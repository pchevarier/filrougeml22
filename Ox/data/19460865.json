The earliest processing step is mRNA capping, which can occur as soon as the 5\u2032 triphosphate terminus of the nascent RNA extrudes from the elongating RNA polymerase (Chiu et al. 2002). The capping enzymes are directed to nascent mRNAs by binding to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Cho et al. 1997; McCracken et al. 1997; Yue et al. 1997; Ho and Shuman 1999; Pei et al. 2001; Fabrega et al. 2003). Capping enzymes also bind to the Pol II elongation factor Spt5 (Wen and Shatkin 1999; Pei and Shuman 2002), which, in conjunction with its binding partner Spt4, elicits an elongation arrest at promoter-proximal sites (Wada et al. 1998a). The Spt5/Spt4-induced elongation arrest in metazoans is alleviated by the Cdk9 protein kinase, a subunit of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (Wada et al. 1998b). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the essential Cdk9 kinase exists as a stoichiomet-ric complex in vivo with its cyclin partner (Pch1) and the methyltransferase component of the S. pombe capping apparatus (Pei and Shuman 2003; Pei et al. 2006; Guiguen et al. 2007). S. pombe Cdk9 also interacts with the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus (Pei et al. 2003). These and other observations underlie the proposal of a transcription elongation checkpoint that ensures a temporal window for capping of nascent mRNAs (Pei et al. 2003; Mandal et al. 2004; Sims et al. 2004). Evidence is emerging that positive and negative regulation of transcription can occur at the step of capping enzyme recruitment (Chiu et al. 2002; Gao and Gross 2008).The Spt5-Spt4 complex is the lynchpin of the putative checkpoint. There is ample genetic and biochemical evidence from budding yeast, zebrafish, roundworm, fruitfly, and mammalian systems that Spt5 and Spt4 exert both negative and positive effects on transcription elongation (Hartzog et al. 1998; Andrulis et al. 2000; Guo et al. 2000; Renner et al. 2001; Shim et al. 2002; Wu et al. 2003; Jennings et al. 2004). Spt5 is a large polypeptide (\u223c1000\u20131200 amino acids) composed of multiple domain modules, including an acidic N-terminal domain, central NusG-like NGN (NusG N-terminal homology), and KOW domains (Hartzog et al. 1998; Wade et al. 1998a; Ponting 2002), and a CTD targeted for threonine phosphorylation (Pei and Shuman 2003; Yamada et al. 2006). Spt5 is essential for cell growth in budding and fission yeast (Swanson et al. 1991; Pei and Shuman 2002). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt5 participates in a vast network of genetic and physical interactions with the Pol II elongation complex and mRNA processing systems (Lindstrom et al. 2003; see also Saccharomyces Genome Database, www.yeastgenome.org). By contrast, Spt4 is a small polypeptide (100\u2013120 amino acids) and is nonessential for cell growth in budding yeast (Malone et al. 1993). Yeast spt4\u0394 cells display pleiotropic phenotypes that are probably linked to defects in transcription elongation and RNA processing (Rond\u00f3n et al. 2003; Lindstrom et al. 2003; Mason and Struhl 2005; Qui et al. 2006; Schneider et al. 2006). Many genetic interactions with spt4\u0394 have been observed in budding yeast (Saccharomyces Genome Database, www.yeastgenome.org).Here we conducted a physical and genetic characterization of the S. pombe Spt5-Spt4 complex that addressed the following issues: (1) the native size and subunit stoichiometry of a recombinant core Spt5-Spt4 complex; (2) structure probing of the complex by limited proteolysis; (3) whether S. pombe Spt4 can function in lieu of S. cerevisiae Spt4 in vivo; (4) identification of functionally important amino acids of Spt4 via alanine scanning and conservative substitutions; (5) the effect of genetic ablation of Spt4 in S. pombe; and (6) synthetic enhancement of S. pombe Spt5 mutations by ablation of Spt4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecombinant S. pombe Spt5-Spt4 complexThe human Spt5-Spt4 complex was purified initially based on its elongation-arrest activity. Wada et al. (1998a) estimated by gel filtration a native size of >300 kDa and suggested that the Spt5-Spt4 complex is a multimer of the 165-kDa Spt5 protein. Deletion analysis delineated a central Spt4-binding domain on human Spt5 from amino acids 176\u2013313 (Yamaguchi et al. 1999; Ivanov et al. 2000), but the methods employed (GST pull-downs, co-immunoprecipitations) did not reveal the stoichiometry or size of the complex.Our aim here was to assess the quaternary structure of the core S. pombe Spt5-Spt4 complex formed by recombinant subunits. Based on our initial two-hybrid data showing that both the N-terminal 164-amino acid segment and the C-terminal 190-amino acid nonamer array of S. pombe Spt5 are dispensable for binding to Spt4 (Pei and Shuman 2002), we sought to physically characterize the complex of Spt4 with Spt5-(165-800). This was accomplished by coexpressing His-tagged Spt4 with untagged Spt5-(165-800) in bacteria and then purifying His-Spt4 by Ni-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1). The affinity-purified material (Fig. 1B, lane Ni) consisted of the 14-kDa His-Spt4 plus the untagged 70-kDa Spt5-(165-800) polypeptide in near 1:1 stoichiometry. This result proves that Spt4 and Spt5 associate in the absence of other fungal proteins. The Ni-agarose preparation was sedimented in a glycerol gradient with internal markers catalase (a 248-kDa tetramer of a 62-kDa subunit), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (a 68-kDa monomer), and vaccinia topoisomerase (vtopo) (a 36-kDa monomer). Analysis of the gradient fractions by SDS-PAGE showed that Spt5 sedimented as a single discrete component coincident with the BSA peak and clearly heavier than the vtopo peak (Fig. 1A). There was no detectable heavier component of Spt5 between BSA and catalase, arguing against Spt5-(165-800) dimerizing. The fact that the majority of the Spt4 cosedimented with Spt5 suggests that the complex is probably a 1:1 heterodimer, although we cannot exclude the possibility that two copies of the Spt4 polypeptide are associated with Spt5-(165-800). The residual \u201cfree\u201d Spt4 sedimented as a lighter shoulder. We subjected the peak glycerol fraction containing Spt5-Spt4 and the markers to another round of Ni-affinity purification, which resulted in efficient recovery of His-Spt4 and untagged Spt5, but not the markers (Fig. 1B, cf. lanes G and G+Ni), thereby attesting to the stability of the reconstituted Spt5-(165-800)-Spt4 complex.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1.Characterization of a recombinant fission yeast Spt5-Spt4 complex. (A) Zonal velocity sedimentation of the HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800) complex with internal standards was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Aliquots of the odd-numbered glycerol gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE; the Coomassie blue\u2013stained gel is shown. (B) Comparison by SDS-PAGE of the polypeptide compositions of the Ni-affinity purified HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800) complex that was applied to the glycerol gradient (Ni), glycerol gradient fraction 15 containing a mixture of HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800), BSA, and vtopo (G), and the imidazole eluate obtained by subjecting an aliquot of glycerol gradient fraction 15 to a second round of Ni-affinity purification (G + Ni). The Coomassie blue-stained gel is shown. (C) Limited proteolysis and automated Edman sequencing were performed as described (Lehman et al. 1999). Affinity-purified HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800) was treated with 3.1, 6.2, 12.5, 25 or 50 ng of trypsin. Trypsin was omitted from the control mixture in lane \u2212. The digests were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by staining the membrane with Coomassie blue dye. Membrane slices containing intact Spt5-(165-800) and individual proteolytic products denoted by arrowheads were excised and sequenced. The N-terminal peptide sequences are indicated on the right. (D) The amino acid sequence of S. pombe (Spo) Spt5 from residues 205\u2013468 is aligned to the sequences of the homologous human (Hsa) and S. cerevisiae (Sce) Spt5 proteins. Positions of side-chain identity or similarity in all three proteins are indicated by \u25cf. The secondary structure elements of the NGN domain of S. cerevisiae Spt5 are displayed below the alignment (with \u03b2-strands depicted as arrows and \u03b1-helices as cylinders). The mapped sites of tryptic cleavage of Spt5 in the recombinant S. pombe Spt4-Spt4 complex are denoted by \u25bc.We probed the structure of the isolated Spt5-(165-800)-Spt4 complex by limited proteolysis with trypsin (Fig. 1C). We observed a discrete set of tryptic fragments that persisted at trypsin levels in excess of the amount sufficient to cleave all the input Spt5-(165-800). The N-terminal sequences of the input Spt5 and the tryptic fragments were determined and are indicated in Figure 1C at right (note the Spt5 N-terminus includes 3 amino acids upstream of Asp165 introduced during cloning into the bacterial expression vector). The protease-accessible sites in Spt5 were thereby mapped to the Arg217-Ser218, Lys381-Asn382, and Lys466-Gly467 dipeptides. These sites could demarcate surface-exposed loops or interdomain linkers within the Spt5 tertiary structure. The changes in the spectrum of the proteolytic fragments as a function of trypsin concentration provide insight to the structure of the Spt5-Spt4 complex. For example, at the lowest trypsin concentration, we see a \u223c55-kDa fragment initiating at Ser218, consistent with initial incision at a single major tryptic site at Arg217-Ser218. The predicted short N-terminal peptide (amino acids 165\u2013217) product of initial cleavage was not seen in Figure 1C, because it would migrate well ahead of the intact Spt4 protein and be compressed at the electrophoretic front. The apparent size of the largest tryptic fragment was less than the value of 64 kDa calculated for Spt5-(218-800), which suggests that trypsin also cleaved near the C terminus to yield one or more small fragments that are not visualized in the experiment. Also present at low trypsin concentrations were an \u223c37-kDa polypeptide initiating at Asn382 and an \u223c18-kDa species that retained the N-terminal Ser218 of the initial 55-kDa tryptic fragment. The size of the smaller species agrees with the calculated size of the Spt5-(218-381) fragment. The 37-kDa and 18-kDa fragments persisted as trypsin concentration increased and all of the initial 55-kDa species decayed (Fig. 1C). In turn, the 37-kDa species was converted at the highest trypsin concentrations to an \u223c29-kDa derivative initiating at Gly467.The small number of discrete tryptic cleavage sites in Spt5-(165-800), which has 81 lysine and arginine residues, suggests that the protein is well folded in the complex with Spt4. The locations of the three trypsin-sensitive sites in S. pombe Spt5 are denoted by arrowheads above the aligned amino acid sequences of the S. pombe, human, and S. cerevisiae Spt5 proteins (Fig. 1D). The Spt4 binding domain of S. pombe Spt5 had previously been localized by two-hybrid assays to the segment from amino acids 165\u2013400 that includes two of the tryptic sites, Arg217 and Lys381 (Pei and Shuman 2002). Coexpression in bacteria of His-Spt4 and Spt5-(218-800) resulted in a stable complex of the two polypeptides after Ni-affinity chromatography (data not shown), suggesting that the entire polypeptide segment preceding the tryptic site at Arg217 is not strictly necessary for interaction with Spt4. The segment between the two most sensitive tryptic sites (Arg217 and Lys381) in S. pombe Spt5 corresponds to amino acids 147\u2013329 in human Spt5, which embraces tightly the mapped binding domain for human Spt4 (Yamaguchi et al. 1999; Ivanov et al. 2000). The apparent resistance of this segment of the S. pombe Spt5-Spt4 complex to trypsin cleavage suggests that it comprises a folded domain.This inference is underscored by the recently published crystal structure (Guo et al. 2008) of a chimeric protein composed of S. cerevisiae Spt4 fused to the homologous segment of S. cerevisiae Spt5 (amino acids 285\u2013375). The structure revealed that the yeast Spt5 fragment adopts a compact tertiary structure composed of a central anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet flanked by three \u03b1 helices. The Spt5 secondary structure elements are depicted below the aligned sequences in Figure 1D.Use of budding yeast for structure-function analysis of S. pombe Spt4Whereas Spt4 is not essential for growth of budding yeast at 25\u00b0C, deletion of the spt4 gene prohibits growth at 37\u00b0C (Malone et al. 1993; Basrai et al. 1996). The available structure-function information for yeast Spt4 concerns the role of an N-terminal tetracysteine motif that was predicted to comprise a zinc-binding site. Malone et al. (1993) had shown that S. cerevisiae Spt4 function in vivo was abolished by single serine substitutions for Cys7, Cys24, or Cys27. Basrai et al. (1996) identified a spontaneous C10Y mutation in yeast Spt4 that also abolished its function in vivo. By contrast, a double-mutation of human Spt4 in which Cys16 and Cys19 were replaced by serine did not have any apparent effect on binding of human Spt4 to human Spt5 or on the reconstitution of a transcriptionally active Spt5-Spt4 (DSIF) complex (Kim et al. 2003). Thus, there are discordant results with respect to the effect of disrupting the putative Zn-binding site of yeast versus human Spt4. Wenzel et al. (2008) verified by optical emission spectrometry that purified human Spt4 contains an equimolar amount of Zn2+. S. pombe Spt4 is notable for its deviation from the tetracysteine motif (Fig. 2B). S. pombe Spt4 has three of the conserved cysteines (Cys12, Cys15, and Cys29), but the fourth cysteine is replaced by an aspartate (Asp32).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2.Conserved amino acids targeted for alanine scanning in S. pombe Spt4. (A) Location of targeted residues in the Spt4 tertiary structure. The figure (rendered in Pymol from PDB coordinates 2exu) shows a stereo view of a ribbon trace of S. cerevisiae Spt4 (with \u03b2-strands colored magenta and \u03b1-helices colored cyan) in complex with the NGN domains of Spt5 (colored gray). The nonglycine side-chains of Spt4 that were targeted for alanine scanning are shown, numbered according to their position in S. pombe Spt4. The Zn2+ ion is depicted as a green sphere. Pertinent atomic contacts are depicted as dashed lines. (B) The amino acid sequence of S. pombe (Spo) Spt4 from residues 8\u201381 is aligned to the sequences of the homologous human (Hsa) and S. cerevisiae (Sce) Spt4 proteins. The secondary structure elements of S. cerevisiae Spt4 are displayed below the alignment (colored as in panel A). The 18 positions targeted for alanine scanning are indicated by \u25cf. The nine residues of S. pombe Spt4 that were required for spt4\u0394 complementation in S. cerevisiae are highlighted in gray boxes.Previous studies had shown that the ts growth defect of an S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394 strain could be rescued by expressing human or Kluyveromyces lactis Spt4 (Hartzog et al. 1996; Hikkel et al. 1998). Here we constructed an S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394 strain and demonstrated rescue of the ts growth defect by expression of S. pombe Spt4 from a CEN plasmid under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter (Fig. 3A). This allowed us to exploit budding yeast as a surrogate system for structure-function analysis of the 105-amino acid S. pombe Spt4 protein. We introduced Ala-mutations at 18 residues of S. pombe Spt4, including the four putative Zn2+ ligands and 14 other amino acids that are conserved in human and S. cerevisiae Spt4 (Fig. 2B). We found that alanine mutations at nine of the conserved residues had no apparent impact on spt4\u0394 complementation: Arg10, Gly28, Thr41, Ser42, Gly47, Trp58, Arg61, Trp62, and Gly71 (Fig. 3A). Alanine changes at nine other conserved positions eliminated or reduced spt4\u0394 complementation at 37\u00b0C: Cys12, Cys15, Phe24, Cys29, Asn31, Asp32, Phe45, Ser57, and Tyr73 (Fig. 3A).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3.Mutational effects on the function of S. pombe Spt4 assayed by complementation of S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394. CEN TRP1 plasmids expressing wild-type SceSpt4, wild-type SpoSpt4, or mutated SpoSpt4 were transformed into S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394 cells. Control cells were transformed with the empty CEN TRP1 vector. Growth of the indicated spt4\u0394 strains was assessed by spotting serial dilutions to SD-Trp agar medium. The plates were photographed after incubation for 3 d at 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C as specified. (A) Effects of alanine mutations. (B) Effects of conservative mutations. (C) Effects of C-terminal truncations.The S. pombe Spt4-Ala mutants were tested for interaction with S. pombe Spt5 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, with dual reporter readouts (His+ and lacZ+) of a positive interaction between a DNA binding domain (BD) fused to S. pombe Spt4 and a transcription activation domain (AD) fused to Spt5-(165-990) or Spt5-(165-400) (Table 1). Whereas all 18 of the Spt4-Ala proteins retained interaction with the larger Spt5-(165-990) protein (Supplemental Fig. S1), four of the Spt4 mutations (C12A, C15A, C29A, and Y73A) affected Spt4 binding to the smaller Spt5-(165-400) fragment that suffices for binding to wild-type Spt4 and 14 other alanine mutants (Table 1). That the S. pombe Spt4-Ala mutants retained activity in one or both two-hybrid assays indicates that the mutant polypeptides are indeed produced in budding yeast.TABLE 1.Mutational effects on Spt4 two-hybrid interaction with Spt5Open in a separate windowStructure-activity relationships at the essential residues were gleaned by testing the effects of 13 conservative substitutions on spt4\u0394 complementation (Fig. 3B). The C12S, C15S, and C29S mutations abolished Spt4 activity, suggesting that zinc coordination is essential for the fission yeast protein, as it is in budding yeast Spt4. The instructive finding was that replacing the deviant Asp32 residue of S. pombe Spt4 with either glutamate or cysteine fully restored complementation activity, whereas serine and asparagine did not (Fig. 3B). We surmise that (1) either a cysteine sulfur or a carboxylate oxygen can serve as the fourth metal ligand and (2) there is no tight steric constraint on distance from the main-chain to the metal-binding atom of the side-chain at position 32. Replacing Tyr73 by phenylalanine resulted in loss of function (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the hydroxyl group was essential. Spt4 was active in vivo when Phe24 was substituted by leucine, indicating that the aromatic ring was not essential. By contrast, the aromatic quality of Phe45 was essential, insofar as the F45L mutant failed to complement spt4\u0394 (Fig. 3B). The essential function of Asn31 could not be performed by aspartate or glutamine, indicating that the amide group is critical and/or there is a steric constraint on the distance from the main-chain to the amide.We also tested the effects of serial deletions of 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 amino acids from the C terminus of S. pombe Spt4. The C\u039410 mutant supported slow growth of spt4\u0394 cells at 37\u00b0C; the C\u039420 and C\u039430 versions were inactive (Fig. 3C), notwithstanding that the C\u039420 and C\u039430 polypeptides retained their interactions with S. pombe Spt5-(165-990) and Spt5-(165-400) in the two-hybrid assay (Table 1). We infer that the segment of Spt4 from amino acids 86\u201395 (86VESLRRRGIN95) embraces functional group(s) necessary for biological activity at a step other than mere binding to Spt5. Note that Spt5 binding was abolished by the Spt4 C\u039440 and C\u039450 deletions (Table 1). These results indicate that the Spt4 segment from amino acids 66\u201375 (66DTFTPGIYAT75) includes function groups necessary for Spt5 binding, one of which is likely to be Tyr73 (Table 1).Interpretation of mutational results in light of an Spt4 crystal structureA stereo image of the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Spt4 in complex with a fragment of Spt5 (Guo et al. 2008) is shown in Figure 2A. The conserved amino acid side-chains that were subjected to mutational analysis in the present study are highlighted; for convenience, they are renumbered in the figure according to their positions in the S. pombe Spt4 polypeptide. The structure rationalizes the essentiality of several of the side-chains identified presently.Spt4 consists of a five-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2 barrel flanked by four \u03b1 helices (Fig. 2). Spt4 has a single bound Zn2+ atom coordinated with tetrahedral geometry by the four conserved cysteines (or three cysteines plus Asp32 in S. pombe Spt4). The fact that all four zinc ligands are essential for yeast Spt4 function likely reflects the role of the zinc complex in maintaining the proper Spt4 tertiary structure. Our finding that the zinc ligands are not essential for interaction with S. pombe Spt5-(165-990) in the two-hybrid assay is consistent with the fact that the zinc-complex is distant from the Spt4-Spt5 interface revealed by the crystal structure. Yet, the Zn2+-binding cysteines are important for binding to the smaller Spt5-(165-400) domain in the two-hybrid assay. It is conceivable that additional stabilizing contacts exist between Spt4 and constituents of Spt5 located distal to the NGN module.Spt4 and Spt5 pack against each other so that their \u03b2-strands form an extended sheet. In addition, the \u03b13 helix of Spt4 makes polar and hydrophobic contacts with Spt5. Conserved Spt4 residues Trp58, Trp62, and Arg61 (a lysine in S. cerevisiae) are disposed on the same face of the helix, and none of them is essential for function per se. However, Ser57 is essential, and it donates a hydrogen bond to a conserved glutamate of Spt5 (Glu291 in S. pombe; Glu338 in S. cerevisiae) (Fig. 2A). This Spt5 glutamate (highlighted in Fig. 1D) makes a bidentate contact with Ser57 O\u03b3 and the main-chain amide of Trp58 (Fig. 2A). Guo et al. (2008) found that mutation of the S. cerevisiae Spt5 Glu388 to lysine (a charge inversion) weakened the Spt5-Spt4 interaction. Essential Spt4 residues Asn31 and Tyr73 contribute a network of hydrogen bonds to each other and the Thr69 main-chain amide and carbonyl (Ile70 in S. cerevisiae). Arg10 and Thr41 interact with each other via hydrogen bonding, but neither of these side-chains is required for Spt4 activity. Ser42 makes cross-strand hydrogen bonds that are also apparently not critical for function. The essential Phe24 residue makes van der Waals contacts with several side-chains in the protein interior. The essential Phe45 is surface-exposed and has no obvious contacts in the crystal structure that explain its contributions to Spt4 activity.Deletion of Spt4 in S. pombeWhereas Spt5 is essential for viability of S. pombe (Pei and Shuman 2002), Spt4 had not been studied genetically in fission yeast. In order to delete the spt4+ gene, either an spt4\u2237kanMX cassette or a spt4\u2237natMX cassette was transformed into a diploid strain of S. pombe, and chromosomal integrants containing one copy of the wild-type gene and one of either spt4\u2237kanMX or spt4\u2237natMX were selected on medium containing G418 or nourseothricin, respectively. Correct integration was confirmed by diagnostic PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the heterozygotes and by Southern blotting. We then sporulated the heterozygotes, dissected tetrads, and scored for spore viability and the presence of the kanMX or natMX marker. We found that tetrads yielded four viable haploid progeny at 30\u00b0C, two of which were G418-resistant or nourseothricin-resistant. We conclude that Spt4 is not essential for cell growth in S. pombe. However, we found that the S. pombe spt4\u0394 mutation elicits a tight ts phenotype, whereby the spt4\u0394 strain grows at 30\u00b0C but fails to grow at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4, spt4\u2237natMX; Supplemental Fig. S2A, spt4\u2237kanMX). Growth at 37\u00b0C was restored by transformation of spt4\u0394 with a plasmid-borne copy of spt4+ driven by the low-strength version of the nmt1 promoter, but not with the empty plasmid vector (Supplemental Fig. S2B). We surveyed the collection of 18 spt4ala mutants for their ability to complement the ts growth defect of the spt4\u0394 strain when delivered on a plasmid. The C12A and C15A strains were sick at 37\u00b0C (Supplemental Fig. S2B). R10A and the 15 other spt4ala mutants supported apparently normal growth of spt4\u0394 cells at 37\u00b0C (Supplemental Fig. S2B; data not shown).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4.Synergy between spt4\u0394 and spt5 CTD truncations. (A) Serial dilutions of S. pombe strains bearing the indicated chromosomal spt5 and spt4 alleles were tested for growth on YES agar. The plates were photographed after incubation for 2 d (at 34\u00b0C) or 3 d (at 30\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C). (B) The Spt5 CTD from amino acids 801\u2013990 is displayed with the nonamer repeats aligned vertically. The consensus sequence TPAWNSGSK is shown below the alignment. The C-termini of the three truncated Spt5 CTDs analyzed in panel A are indicated by asterisks.The discrepancy that seven residues found to be essential for complementation of S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394 by S. pombe Spt4 (Phe24, Cys29, Asn31, Asp32, Phe45, Ser57, and Tyr73) were not required to complement Spt4 function in fission yeast could arise because the two genetic assays rely on greatly different gene dosages. In the S. cerevisiae complementation test, the Spt4 proteins are expressed from single-copy CEN plasmids, but no such single-copy plasmid system is available for fission yeast. Instead, we used high-copy vectors that are standard in the field (Forsburg 1993). Therefore, mutations that cause functional deficits at low gene dosage in budding yeast might be missed at high gene dosage in fission yeast, e.g., because increased production of the mutant Spt4 results by mass action in sufficient Spt5-Spt4 complex to support cell growth at 37\u00b0C. We attempted to down-regulate transcription of the plasmid-borne nmt1-spt4+ cassette by inclusion of thiamine in the growth medium (Forsburg 1993) and found that the plasmid still complemented growth of the spt4\u0394 strain at 37\u00b0C (data not shown), implying that Spt4 is indeed produced in functional excess from the high copy plasmid.An alternative explanation for the discrepancy is that the two genetic complementation assays rely on Spt4 interaction with different Spt5 binding partners. The budding yeast complementation assay is contingent on S. pombe Spt4 forming a functional complex with a heterologous S. cerevisiae Spt5. The cross-species subunit interaction might be more sensitive to certain Spt4 mutations than the intraspecies interaction. Note that whereas we have shown here that wild-type S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Spt4 proteins are functionally interchangeable in budding yeast, this is not the case for the Spt5 proteins. Specifically, we constructed a S. cerevisiae spt5\u0394 p(CEN URA3 SPT5) strain suitable for assay of essential Spt5 functions by the plasmid shuffle method. We found that a plasmid-borne S. cerevisiae SPT5 gene complemented the null mutant. By contrast, a plasmid expressing full-length S. pombe Spt5 under the control of a constitutive S. cerevisiae promoter did not complement in this assay, even when cotransformed with a plasmid expressing S. pombe Spt4 (data not shown).Genetic interactions between Spt4 and the Spt5 CTD\nS. pombe Spt5 is distinguished by the orderly primary structure of its CTD, which extends from amino acids 801\u2013990 and consists of a tandem array of nonapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence TPAWNSGK (Fig. 4B). The unmodified Spt5 CTD binds avidly to the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the S. pombe capping apparatus (Pei and Shuman 2002). The Spt5 CTD is also a substrate for threonine phosphorylation by S. pombe Cdk9 (Pei and Shuman 2003). Here we interrogated genetically the role of the Spt5 CTD nonamer array, by constructing mutant strains of S. pombe in which spt5 alleles encoding incrementally truncated Spt5 proteins were integrated at the chromosomal spt5 locus in lieu of the wild-type gene. The Spt5-(1-898), Spt5-(1-862), and Spt5-(1-835) proteins contain rump CTDs with ten, six, and three nonamer repeats, respectively (Fig. 4B). Full-length Spt5 and each of the three Spt5-CTD\u0394 proteins were expressed in S. pombe at comparable steady-state levels, as gauged by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates with purified polyclonal Spt5 antibody (Supplemental Fig. S3). The immunoreactive Spt5 proteins displayed the expected incremental changes in electrophoretic mobility (Supplemental Fig. S3). We found that haploid S. pombe strains bearing any of the three truncated spt5 alleles grew as well as the spt5+ strain at 30\u00b0C, 34\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C, as gauged by colony size (Fig. 4A). We conclude that three nonamer repeats (containing two Cdk9 Thr-Pro phosphorylation sites) suffice for viability under laboratory growth conditions. Complete deletion of all nonamer repeats causes an overt growth defect that will be described in detail elsewhere (S Schneider and B Schwer, in prep.).The instructive finding here was that combining the serial Spt5 CTD truncations with the spt4\u0394 mutation resulted in slowed growth at temperatures normally permissive for the spt4\u0394 strain (Fig. 4A, spt51-862 spt4\u0394). This synthetic enhancement culminated in the lethality of the spt51-835 spt4\u0394 double mutant at 34\u00b0C and a strong synthetic sick phenotype at 30\u00b0C (Fig. 4A). We surmise that a longer Spt5 CTD becomes essential when Spt4 function is ablated. The implication is that interaction of Spt4 with the central domain of Spt5 overlaps functionally with the Spt5 CTD.Concluding remarksThe present study extends our knowledge of the fission yeast core Spt5-Spt4 complex, which we characterize as a heterodimer. Fission yeast Spt5 has an exceptionally regular CTD nonapeptide array that mediates Spt5 interactions with mRNA capping enzymes. Here we showed that as few as three nonamer repeats sufficed for cell growth, but only when Spt4 was present. A genetic analysis of Spt4 in S. pombe revealed it to be inessential for growth at 25\u00b0C\u201330\u00b0C, but critical at 37\u00b0C. These results echo the temperature-sensitive spt4\u0394 growth phenotype in budding yeast, where S. cerevisiae and S. pombe Spt4 are functionally interchangeable. The S. cerevisiae complementation assay provided a sensitive readout of mutational effects on S. pombe Spt4 function in vivo. The targets for the Spt4 alanine scan were chosen based on conservation among eukaryal and archaeal Spt4 homologs. After the mutational study was completed, the coordinates of the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Spt4 bound to a fragment of Spt5 were deposited (RCSB Protein Databank ID code 2exu). The structure, now published (Guo et al. 2008), provided an invaluable guide to interpret the mutational data we obtained for S. pombe Spt4. The genetic tools described here can assist further dissection of the postulated transcription elongation checkpoint in fission yeast. MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant S. pombe Spt5-Spt4 complexThe fission yeast Spt4 and Spt5-(165-800) ORFs were inserted into the pETDuet expression vector (Novagen) so that the Spt4 ORF was fused in-frame to a leader sequence encoding a His-tag. The dual-expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Expression of the S. pombe proteins was induced by IPTG, and the His-tagged Spt4 and associated Spt5-(165-800) were purified from a soluble bacterial lysate by Ni-agarose chromatography, following protocols developed previously for other recombinant His-tagged S. pombe proteins (Pei et al. 2001). The affinity-purified HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800) complex was mixed with marker protein catalase, BSA and vtopo. The mixture was applied to a 4.8-mL 15%\u201330% glycerol gradient containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton-X100. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 4\u00b0C. Fractions (0.2 mL) were collected from the bottom of the tube. An aliquot of glycerol gradient fraction 15 containing the putative HisSpt4/Spt5-(165-800) heterodimer was subjected to a second round of Ni-affinity purification as described (Pei and Shuman 2002).Media and genetic manipulationsWe followed standard protocols for yeast growth, transformations, mating, sporulation, and tetrad dissection, as described by Guthrie and Fink (1991) and Schiestl and Gietz (1989) for S. cerevisiae and on the Forsburg laboratory Pombe Technology website (www-rcf.usc.edu/\u223cforsburg/index.html) for S. pombe.Genetic assay of Spt4 function in S. cerevisiaeThe S. cerevisiae SPT4 open reading frame (ORF) was replaced in a diploid W303 strain with a spt4\u2237kanMX gene disruption cassette (G\u00fcldener et al. 1996). Integrants were selected on YPD agar plates containing geneticin (150 mg/L, Invitrogen). Correct gene targeting was confirmed by diagnostic Southern blotting of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA. The SPT4 spt4\u0394 diploid was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. We thereby obtained a haploid spt4\u0394 strain (Mata spt4\u2237kanMX ura3 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 can1) that grew well at 30\u00b0C but failed to form colonies on YPD agar at 37\u00b0C. A complementing plasmid, p358-SceSpt4, was generated by inserting a genomic NheI-EcoRI fragment (2.3 kb) containing the wild-type S. cerevisiae SPT4 gene into pSE358 (CEN TRP1). For expression of S. pombe Spt4 in budding yeast, a DNA fragment spanning the 318-bp spt4+ ORF was amplified from chromosomal DNA by PCR with primers designed to introduce an NdeI site at the ATG codon and a BamHI site downstream of the stop codon. The DNA fragment was restricted and inserted into pYN132 (TRP1 CEN), a shuttle vector (modified from pYX132, Novagen) in which expression of S. pombe Spt4 is under the transcriptional control of the constitutive TPI1 promoter. Alanine mutations were introduced into the wild-type spt4+ gene by two-stage overlap extension PCR with mutagenic primers and pYN132-spt4 as the template. The mutated alleles were restricted and inserted into pYN132. The inserts of all plasmids were sequenced to verify that no undesired coding changes were introduced during amplification and cloning. The CEN TRP1 plasmids expressing wild-type SceSpt4, wild-type SpoSpt4, or mutated SpoSpt4 were transformed into S. cerevisiae spt4\u0394 cells. Growth of Trp+ transformants was assessed by spotting 3 \u03bcL aliquots of serial 10-fold dilutions of yeast cultures (grown to mid-log phase in synthetic dropout [SD] broth lacking tryptophan at 30\u00b0C and adjusted to A600 of 0.1) to SD-Trp agar medium and then incubating the plates at 30\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C.Two-hybrid assay of Spt4-Spt5 interactionThe two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously (Pei et al. 2001; Pei and Shuman 2002). Briefly, aliquots of S. cerevisiae Y190 cells (Clontech Laboratories) harboring plasmids for expression of Gal4(AD)-Spt5-(165-990) or Gal4(AD)-Spt5-(165-400) plus wild-type or mutated Gal4(BD)-Spt4 proteins were tested for histidine prototrophy by spotting to SD(-Trp, -Leu, -His) agar medium containing 25 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). Growth was scored after 4 d of incubation at 30\u00b0C. Expression of the lacZ reporter was scored by blue color in the \u03b2-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay.Deletion of spt4 in S. pombeThe entire spt4+ ORF was replaced in a diploid strain with either the kanMX or natMX gene conferring antibiotic resistance. To construct the disruption cassettes, DNA segments spanning 490 bp upstream and 410 bp downstream of the spt4 ORF were amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA and inserted into modified pTOPO vectors to flank the kanMX (G\u00fcldener et al. 1996) or the natMX (Goldstein and McCusker 1999) cassette. DNA fragments with the spt4\u2237kanMX (2.4 kb) and spt4\u2237natMX (2.1 kb) disruption cassettes were transformed into a S. pombe diploid. Transformants were selected on YES (yeast extracts with supplements) agar medium containing geneticin (150 mg/L, Invitrogen) or nourseothricin (100 mg/L clonNAT, Werner Bioagents). Correct gene targeting was confirmed by diagnostic colony PCR and Southern blotting. The heterozygous diploids were then sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to obtain spt4\u0394 haploids used for complementation assays.For expression of Spt4 in fission yeast, DNA fragments encoding wild-type or mutant Spt4 proteins were excised from the respective pYN132-spt4 plasmids and inserted into pREP81x, wherein Spt4 is expressed under the transcriptional control of a weakened nmt1 promoter (Forsburg 1993). Leu+ transformants were selected and the growth of the various pREP81x-spt4 strains was compared to spt4\u0394 cells that had been transformed with the empty pREP81x plasmid. Aliquots (3 \u03bcL) of serial 10-fold dilutions of S. pombe cultures (grown to mid-log phase in SD broth lacking leucine at 30\u00b0C and adjusted to A600 of 0.1) were spotted on to agar medium and the plates were incubated at 30\u00b0 and 37\u00b0C.Truncations of the Spt5 CTD array in S. pombeWe constructed a pUC19-based plasmid harboring the ura4+ gene upstream of a 534-bp fragment of S. pombe genomic DNA located immediately 3\u2032 of the stop codon of the spt5+ gene. We then inserted upstream of ura4+ a series of spt5 gene fragments extending from an NdeI site (at nucleotide +1736 within the spt5 ORF) to either the stop codon at position +2971 (the natural stop codon) or newly created stop codons at positions +2695, +2587, or +2506 that result in truncations of the Spt5 CTD. Linearized spt5CTD+/\u0394-ura4+-spt53\u2032 cassettes were transformed into haploid S. pombe cells. Ura+ transformants were selected and targeted insertions were verified by diagnostic Southern blotting.Anti-Spt5 antibodiesPolyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with recombinant His10Smt3-Spt5-(1-990) at the Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory (Canadensis, PA). Anti-Spt5 antibodies were affinity purified from whole serum by affinity-chromatography by adsorption to His10Smt3-Spt5-(1-990) coupled to Affigel-10 (Bio-Rad).Western blot analysisThe haploid (h-) spt5CTD+/\u0394-ura4+-spt53\u2032 strains spt5-(1-990)\u2237ura4+, spt5-(1-898)\u2237ura4+, spt5-(1-862)\u2237ura4+, and spt5-(1-835)\u2237ura4+ were grown in YES broth at 30\u00b0C. Aliquots of cells from exponentially growing cultures (equivalent to 6 A600 units) were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 200 \u03bcL SDS-sample buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and acid-washed glass beads (\u223c100 \u03bcL) were added. Cells were disrupted by five 30-sec cycles of vigorous vortexing. The samples were heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C and centrifuged to remove macroaggregates and glass beads. Aliquots (25 \u03bcL) of the whole-cell lysates were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to verify that similar amounts of total protein were present in each of the lysates. For Western blot analysis, aliquots (2 \u03bcL) of the lysate were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE, and the polypeptides were transferred to a PVDF membrane (NEN Research Products) with a semi-dry transfer apparatus (semi-phor, Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The membrane was probed with affinity purified anti-Spt5 antibodies, and the immune complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Cell Signaling Technology) using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham).Mutational synergy between spt4\u0394 and spt5CTD\u0394Haploid spt4\u0394\u2237natMX (h+) cells were mated to each of the following haploid (h\u2212) spt5CTD+/\u0394-ura4+-spt53\u2032 strains: spt5-(1-990)\u2237ura4+, spt5-(1-898)\u2237ura4+, spt5-(1-862)\u2237ura4+, and spt5-(1-835)\u2237ura4+. Diploids were selected on synthetic medium lacking uracil and containing nourseothricin. The diploids were sporulated and tetrads dissected. The genotypes of haploid progeny were confirmed by diagnostic colony PCR. Growth of the spt5CTD+/\u0394 and the spt5CTD+/\u0394 spt4\u0394 strains was assessed by spotting 3 \u03bcL aliquots of serial 10-fold dilutions of logarithmic cultures grown at 30\u00b0C onto YES agar medium and then incubating the plates at 30\u00b0C, 34\u00b0C, or 37\u00b0C.
