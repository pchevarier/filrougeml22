Transcription is initiated after recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the promoter. After promoter escape, Pol II enters the elongation stage as it transcribes through the gene body. Finally, transcription is completed during termination when the transcript is processed and Pol II is released from the chromatin template (Perales & Bentley, 2009; Hahn & Young, 2011; Kuehner et\u00a0al, 2011; Rando & Winston, 2012; Kwak & Lis, 2013). Transcription elongation itself is a highly regulated process, consisting of multiple stages (Jonkers & Lis, 2015). In metazoans, promoter proximal pausing separates early and productive elongation in a tightly regulated manner (Adelman & Lis, 2012). During promoter proximal pausing, many factors are recruited to Pol II in an effort to transition the elongation complex (EC) from early into productive elongation. While yeast does not have a sharp promoter proximal pause, transition of yeast ECs into productive elongation is also regulated (Pokholok et\u00a0al, 2002; Mayer et\u00a0al, 2010; Lidschreiber et\u00a0al, 2013; Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Molina et\u00a0al, 2016).Transcription elongation is also controlled to ensure proper timing of co\u2010transcriptional processes which are most pronounced at the early and late stages of transcription elongation (Perales & Bentley, 2009; Hsin & Manley, 2012; Bentley, 2014; Fusby et\u00a0al, 2015). In the early stages of elongation, Pol II must recruit factors to transition into productive elongation and perform the necessary capping of mRNA, which is required for the downstream RNA processing events of splicing and 3\u2032 end processing (Cooke & Alwine, 1996; Schwer & Shuman, 1996; Flaherty et\u00a0al, 1997; Topisirovic et\u00a0al, 2011). In the latter stages of elongation, Pol II must recruit 3\u2032 end processing factors as well as factors that regulate the transition from elongation to termination.Dynamic phosphorylation of the Pol II C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) facilitates the arrival and dissociation of many key regulatory factors at the right time and place (Buratowski, 2009; Hsin & Manley, 2012; Jeronimo et\u00a0al, 2013; Bentley, 2014). The CTD consists of a conserved heptapeptide repeat Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 that is repeated 26 times in yeast, and phosphorylation of Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5, and Ser7 has distinct patterns of enrichment across gene bodies. For example, Ser5P is highly enriched early in transcription and as such interacts with many factors involved in early elongation (Komarnitsky et\u00a0al, 2000; Schroeder et\u00a0al, 2000; Schwer & Shuman, 2011; Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016). However, phospho\u2010CTD patterns are not entirely unique to one region of the gene. For instance, Ser5P also peaks near 3\u2032 splice sites (Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016) and Ser5P and Ser2P are broadly associated with Pol II (Sch\u00fcller et\u00a0al, 2016; Suh et\u00a0al, 2016). Thus, while the CTD phosphorylation state serves as a proxy for transcription stage, it does not dictate precise boundaries during transcription.Understanding which factors regulate these processes is key to determining how Pol II regulates myriad co\u2010transcriptional processes at precise regions across the gene body. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has been a powerful way to localize individual factors along gene bodies, which likely reports on where the factor functions. However, ChIP can only report on a single factor at one time, thus unraveling regulatory mechanisms that use multiple factors together can be laborious. Moreover, ChIP\u2010based approaches are biased, as they require a prior appreciation for a factor's role in transcription regulation.We sought to develop an unbiased and comprehensive strategy to identify the factors that associate with Pol II at specific regions of a gene. We chose to isolate Pol II elongation complexes (ECs) based on the emerging nascent RNA, allowing the purification of complexes from precise genomic locations. We tested this strategy by developing a system to isolate ECs from the two most distinct stages of elongation: (i) early productive elongation and (ii) late\u2010stage elongation just prior to termination. We used two RNA stem\u2010loops, PP7 and MS2, which bind tightly to viral coat proteins (Bardwell & Wickens, 1990). These sequences have been used to study Pol II elongation and splicing dynamics (Lacadie et\u00a0al, 2006; Larson et\u00a0al, 2011; Hocine et\u00a0al, 2013; Lenstra et\u00a0al, 2015). By inserting just two repeats of the PP7 or MS2 stem\u2010loop sequences into the UTRs of a single gene and co\u2010expressing the coat binding proteins, we are able to isolate ECs from early and late stages of transcription. Analysis of EC composition by quantitative mass spectrometry yields the respective Pol II interactomes from early and late elongation. Interestingly, both the early and late ECs contain factors that were not previously appreciated to function during those stages. Through the high\u2010resolution mapping of Pol II by native elongating transcript sequencing (NET\u2010seq) (Churchman & Weissman, 2011), we investigated the region\u2010specific effects of these factors. Indeed, we find a role for transcription termination factor, Rai1, in regulating early transcription elongation genome\u2010wide and a novel role for the histone modifier, Bre1, in regulating Pol II dynamics at polyA sites. These results demonstrate how isolation of distinct Pol II complexes can be used to determine the transcriptional regulatory factors governing different stages of transcription elongation. ResultsIsolation of region\u2010specific transcription complexesTo explore which factors regulate the early and late stages of transcription, we developed a strategy to isolate region\u2010specific transcription elongation complexes (ECs). We designed a synthetic construct that allowed isolation of ECs from the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of a single gene (Fig\u00a01A). The Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae TDH3 gene flanked upstream by two PP7 RNA stem\u2010loop encoding sequences and downstream by two MS2 RNA stem\u2010loop encoding sequences was placed under control of an inducible GAL promoter. This construct was cloned into a high\u2010copy plasmid and transformed into yeast along with a second plasmid constitutively expressing either a PP7 coat binding protein (PCP) fused to GFP or a MS2 coat binding protein (MCP) fused to mCherry (RFP). After inducing expression by addition of galactose to the media, isolation of ECs from either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of this construct occurs via a sequential purification. First, all Pol II complexes are purified using an epitope tag on the Rpb3 subunit of Pol II (Fig\u00a01A and B, Rpb3 input/unbound). While still bound to beads, the nascent RNA is fragmented by RNase A digestion followed by specific elution of the complexes. Next, a second highly efficient IP (Fig\u00a01A and B, GFP or RFP input/unbound) is performed targeting the coat proteins bound to the hairpins: anti\u2010GFP antisera targeting the PCP\u2010GFP bound to the PP7 stem\u2010loops at the 5\u2032 end of the transcript or anti\u2010RFP antisera targeting the MCP\u2010RFP bound to the MS2 stem\u2010loops at the 3\u2032 end of the transcript. The doubly purified complexes are then analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify factors associated with either 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ECs (Fig\u00a01A).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Isolation of transcription elongation complexes from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of a single gene\nSchematic demonstrating the sequential immunoprecipitation (IP) approach used to isolate 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 elongation complexes (ECs).

Bottom: cumulative fraction of NET\u2010seq reads plotted as a function distance from the transcription start site of the stem\u2010loop\u2010TDH3 construct for 5\u2032 (green) and 3\u2032 (red) ECs.\nWe tested the ability of the sequential IP to isolate ECs by comparing a single Rpb3 IP, the sequential Rpb3\u2010GFP IP, and a single GFP IP that is expected to isolate mainly mature RNP complexes. When analyzed by silver stain, the proteins purified by the sequential Rpb3\u2010GFP IP have a banding pattern that is highly similar to the Rpb3 IP but largely different from the single GFP IP banding pattern (Fig\u00a01C). These data demonstrate the ability of the sequential IP to isolate actively transcribing Pol II ECs.Next, we optimized our approach to ensure isolation of complexes enriched at either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the gene. The RFP IP targeting the 3\u2032 end of the transcript can only purify complexes located at the 3\u2032 end of the gene after transcription of the MS2 stem\u2010loops. However, the GFP IP can target complexes at any point after transcription of the PP7 stem\u2010loops placed in the 5\u2032 UTR. To restrict our analysis to the 5\u2032 end of the gene, complexes purified by the Rpb3 IP were treated with RNase A while still bound to beads in order to fragment the nascent RNA, producing ECs with short pieces of nascent RNA. Thus, complexes proximal to the 5\u2032 UTR will be labeled by the PP7 stem\u2010loops in the nascent RNA and complexes further downstream will not. Different intervals of RNase treatment were tested to find the optimal fragmentation time to enrich 5\u2032 transcript regions over 3\u2032 transcript regions after the GFP IP (Fig\u00a01D). Analysis of sequential Rpb3\u2010GFP and Rpb3\u2010RFP IPs by silver stain displayed similar banding patterns to one another and to the Rpb3 IP alone; however, differences were detectable (Fig\u00a01C and E). These data suggest sequential IPs targeting the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of genes purify Pol II complexes. Lastly, to ensure a quantitative purification of ECs, all IPs were optimized to be highly efficient (Fig\u00a01B).As a final test of the ability of our sequential IP system to isolate ECs from a specific gene and from subgenic regions, we performed NET\u2010seq on complexes from the sequential Rpb3\u2010GFP and Rpb3\u2010RFP isolations. NET\u2010seq maps actively transcribing Pol II at nucleotide resolution (Churchman & Weissman, 2011), allowing the precise localization of the ECs isolated. First, NET\u2010seq analysis revealed that the targeted transcript was highly enriched over non\u2010targeted Pol II transcripts (Fig\u00a01F). Second, cumulative analysis of NET\u2010seq reads following a sequential GFP (5\u2032) IP revealed that >\u00a060% of isolated complexes were located in the first 400 base pairs (bp) of the gene. In contrast, greater than half of complexes isolated by sequential RFP (3\u2032) IPs were located in the last 200\u00a0bp of the gene (Fig\u00a01G). These data demonstrate the ability of our approach to enrich for ECs from different regions of a single gene.Analysis of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 transcription elongation complexesTo identify the composition of early and late ECs, 5\u2032 targeted, 3\u2032 targeted, and mock IPs were carried out in biological triplicate and were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins present in each sample (Table\u00a0EV1). Importantly, the mock IP is conducted after the first Pol II IP, representing non\u2010specific interactions of all Pol II interactors (Fig\u00a02A\u2013C). Analysis of normalized MS1 intensities (see Materials and Methods and Fig\u00a0EV1 for details) between all samples shows triplicate IPs of 5\u2032, 3\u2032, and mock ECs are highly reproducible with an average Pearson correlation of 0.9, while comparisons of 5\u2032 to mock, 3\u2032 to mock, and 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 are less consistent with an average Pearson correlation of 0.77. Principal component analysis confirms the reproducible and distinct composition of each EC because three unique clusters of biological triplicate samples are present for 5\u2032, 3\u2032, and mock ECs (Fig\u00a02B). Lastly, we performed a complete linkage hierarchical clustering analysis of purified factors that grouped 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ECs separately from the mock IP and split samples into 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ECs (Fig\u00a02C), demonstrating that both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ECs contain interactomes unique from the mock IP and from one another.Open in a separate windowFigure 25\u2032 and 3\u2032 elongation complexes are distinct\nScatter plots comparing the normalized log2 MS1 intensities for each protein from triplicate GFP (5\u2032), RFP (3\u2032), and mock IPs.

The distribution of MS1 intensities is plotted for all nine samples (triplicate 5\u2032 IPs, triplicate 3\u2032 IPs, and triplicate mock IPs). Also shown is a table displaying the mean and standard deviation for the number of unique proteins identified from the triplicate IPs. The distributions are plotted for (A) raw MS1 intensities, (B) mean normalized (see Materials and Methods) intensities, (C) mean normalized intensities filtered for proteins present in all three samples from at least one condition, and (D) mean normalized intensities filtered for proteins present in all three samples from at least one condition with missing values (i.e. proteins present in one condition but not the other) imputed (see Materials and Methods). The mean and variance are shown in the table next to the distributions represent the mean and variance from averaging the triplicate datasets. t\u2010tests to test for differences in the mean and F\u2010tests to test for differences in the variance for each dataset are also shown. These data demonstrate that both raw and normalized datasets do not vary in their variances as F\u2010tests between the datasets are not significant. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 IPs show highly similar mean MS1 intensity values and distributions in the raw data. The mock IPs display a mean shifted toward larger MS1 intensities. Thus, to allow for comparison between 5\u2032, 3\u2032 IPs, and mock IPs, the data were mean normalized (as described in the Materials and Methods) to center the distributions of the datasets around zero, allowing the samples to be compared to one another. As the variance was not significantly different between any of the datasets, no adjustment of the variance was made. After mean normalization, the MS1 intensity distributions and variances are all similar, allowing direct comparison of protein enrichment within samples as well as t\u2010tests between each protein in each sample. Note that dataset mean and variance values do not differ between samples until imputation of missing values to allow for statistical analysis between samples.\nFactors enriched in either 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ECs samples were determined using quantitative label\u2010free mass spectrometry analysis (Tables EV1 and EV2) (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010; Hubner & Mann, 2011). Volcano plots were determined by calculating the average fold change in normalized MS1 spectral intensities of each protein plotted against the P\u2010value derived from t\u2010tests between the two samples (Fig\u00a03A\u2013C). Only proteins present in all three biological samples were used for analysis. This label\u2010free analysis allows a direct comparison between the relative abundance of each protein in the 5\u2032, 3\u2032, or mock datasets. A false discovery rate (FDR) of either 0.05, as a stringent cutoff for high\u2010confidence interactors, or 0.1, as less stringent cutoff, was used to determine significantly enriched interactors (black, green, or red diamonds in Fig\u00a03A\u2013C). An emphasis on a low FDR inevitably results in false negatives, so when a factor is not significantly enriched that does not imply it does not interact specifically with Pol II in the particular subgenic region.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Identifying factors enriched in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 elongation complexes\nA, BVolcano plot analysis comparing GFP (5\u2032) IPs (A) or RFP (3\u2032) IPs (B) to mock IPs.

Factors mentioned in the text are labeled.CVolcano plot comparing GFP (5\u2032) and RFP (3\u2032) IPs. Factors enriched in the 5\u2032 complexes are colored in green, and those enriched in the 3\u2032 complexes are colored in red. Components of the 26S proteasome are colored in maroon; factors mentioned in the text are labeled.\nAnalysis of the significant interactors within the 5\u2032 region of the gene (Fig\u00a03A, and Tables EV1 and EV2) revealed many known transcription elongation factors, including the mRNA capping complex, the Paf1 complex, the Spt4/5 complex and Spt6, as among the most enriched proteins (Table\u00a0EV2). Many of these factors have been implicated in regulating the early stages of productive elongation in both yeast and mammals (Pokholok et\u00a0al, 2002; Mayer et\u00a0al, 2010; Lidschreiber et\u00a0al, 2013; Chen et\u00a0al, 2015; Yu et\u00a0al, 2015). Factors enriched in 3\u2032 complexes included the CCR4\u2010NOT complex (Kruk et\u00a0al, 2011; Dutta et\u00a0al, 2015) and the CTD prolyl isomerase, Ess1, which has been shown to be a positive regulator of transcription termination (Fig\u00a03B) (Wu et\u00a0al, 2003; Krishnamurthy et\u00a0al, 2009; Ma et\u00a0al, 2012). Our stringent statistical analysis likely results in a number of false negatives. For example, some components of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, such as Pcf11, were enriched in the 3\u2032 IP, but were not determined statistically significant. Additionally, 3\u2032 cleavage factors likely experience a transient association with Pol II before interacting with the nascent RNA. Nevertheless, Cft2 and Pab1, components of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, were also enriched in the 3\u2032 IP, demonstrating that our approach is capable of identifying 3\u2032 RNA processing factors.Lastly, comparison of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 enriched factors again confirmed the region\u2010specific IPs (Fig\u00a03C). The mRNA capping complex, the DNA helicase of the general transcription factor, TFIIH, and transcription elongation factors, Spt5 and Spt6, were all enriched in the 5\u2032 region of the gene compared to the 3\u2032 region. Interestingly, 15 components of the 26S proteasome were enriched in the 3\u2032 region. The proteasome has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, particularly at inducible genes (Gillette et\u00a0al, 2004; Lee et\u00a0al, 2005; Geng et\u00a0al, 2012), consistent with the construct being under control of the GAL1 promoter and induced by galactose. Together, these data demonstrate the unique capability of this system to isolate subgenic ECs.Global analysis of 5\u2032 enriched factors, Bye1 and Rai1, confirms their role in early transcription elongationEnriched in the 5\u2032 but not 3\u2032 complexes, Bye1 is a negative regulator of transcription elongation that binds to both Pol II and trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) (Venters et\u00a0al, 2011; Kinkelin et\u00a0al, 2013). ChIP profiles of Bye1 also confirm its enrichment near the 5\u2032 region of genes with no signal near the 3\u2032 end of genes (Kinkelin et\u00a0al, 2013; Pinskaya et\u00a0al, 2014). NET\u2010seq analysis of bye1\u0394 cells revealed that Pol II density at the 5\u2032 region of the RPL26B gene as well as throughout the gene body was severely affected (Fig\u00a04A), but no defects were seen at the 3\u2032 end of the gene near the polyA site. The same pattern was observed genome\u2010wide where loss of BYE1 causes defects in both early and productive elongation but does not affect Pol II dynamics near polyA sites (Fig\u00a04B). When compared to WT cells, the defect in Pol II dynamics in bye1\u0394 cells significantly reduced the density of Pol II near the promoter (Fig\u00a04C) and increased Pol II density throughout gene bodies. This is consistent with Bye1 serving as negative regulator of transcription elongation in the early stages of transcription (Kinkelin et\u00a0al, 2013; Pinskaya et\u00a0al, 2014). These data demonstrate the ability of region\u2010specific IPs to enrich and identify factors affecting Pol II transcription at specific regions along gene bodies.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Bye1 and Rai1 function during early transcription elongation\nNormalized NET\u2010seq reads for WT (black) and bye1\u0394 (green) cells at the RPL26B gene.Normalized average NET\u2010seq profiles for WT and bye1\u0394 cells around the transcription start site (TSS) and polyadenylation site (polyA) of protein\u2010coding genes.Box\u00a0plot comparing the ratio of Pol II density at the 5\u2032 region of genes to the Pol II density at the 3\u2032 region of genes for WT and bye1\u0394 cells at protein\u2010coding genes.Normalized NET\u2010seq reads for WT (black), rtt103\u0394 (gray), and rai1\u0394 (purple) cells at the ARO8 gene.Normalized average NET\u2010seq profiles for WT and rtt103\u0394, and rai1\u0394 cells around the TSS and polyA site of protein\u2010coding genes.Box\u00a0plot comparing the ratio of Pol II density at the 5\u2032 region of genes to the Pol II density at the 3\u2032 region of genes for WT, rtt103\u0394, and rai1\u0394 cells at protein\u2010coding genes.Data information: In (B) and (E), NET\u2010seq reads for each gene are normalized by total reads for each gene in the analyzed region, and shaded areas represent the 95% confidence interval, n\u00a0=\u00a02,738 genes.

WT, rtt103\u0394, and rai1\u0394 NET\u2010seq data were obtained from Harlen et\u00a0al (2016) and re\u2010analyzed in (D\u2013F).

Solid lines in box plots represent sample median. Filled regions in box plots range form the 25th to 75th percentiles of the data while vertical lines are 1.5 times the inter\u2010quartile range.We next used the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 elongation complex data to explore new, region\u2010specific roles of unappreciated or novel transcription elongation factors. Surprisingly, analysis of the 5\u2032 enriched complexes displayed enrichment for the Rat1/Rai1 exonuclease complex. While the major function of this complex is in transcription termination (Kim et\u00a0al, 2004), the essential exonuclease, Rat1, has been suggested to function as an elongation factor at some genes in yeast (Jimeno\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al, 2010) and its mammalian homologue, Xrn2, has been implicated in regulating early transcription dynamics near promoter proximal pause sites (Brannan et\u00a0al, 2012). To test the possibility that Rat1/Rai1 functions in the early stages of transcription, we re\u2010analyzed NET\u2010seq data from rai1\u0394 cells (Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016), focusing on the 5\u2032 region of genes. As a control, we also re\u2010analyzed cells lacking a third termination factor, Rtt103, that functions with Rat1/Rai1 in transcription termination (Kim et\u00a0al, 2004; Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016). Rtt103 was not enriched in the 5\u2032 complexes. As determined in our previous work, loss of both Rai1 and Rtt103 caused defects in transcription termination, with loss of Rai1 inducing high levels of transcriptional read\u2010through (Fig\u00a04D and E) (Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016). However, while rtt103\u0394 did not affect Pol II dynamics in the early stages of transcription, rai1\u0394 resulted in dramatic changes to Pol II dynamics in the 5\u2032 ends of genes (Fig\u00a04D and E). Loss of Rai1 resulted in a loss of Pol II accumulation near the promoter of the ARO8 gene (Fig\u00a04D), while loss of Rtt103 had no effect. Pol II density was also affected throughout gene bodies where Pol II complexes appeared to accumulate. These effects were observed genome\u2010wide, as seen by analyzing average Pol II occupancy in WT, rtt103\u0394, and rai1\u0394 cells near the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of coding genes (Fig\u00a04E). Comparison of Pol II density near the promoter with density near the polyA site revealed that rai1\u0394, but not rtt103\u0394 cells, have a decreased 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 Pol II density ratio (Fig\u00a04F), again consistent with RAI1 deletion resulting in defects in Pol II elongation near promoters. Interestingly, loss of Rai1 displayed similar effects to loss of Bye1, suggesting that in addition to its role in transcription termination Rai1 may also act as a negative regulator of transcription in the early stages of transcription elongation. To test this possibility, we assessed sensitivity of rai1\u0394 and bye1\u0394 to mycophenolic acid (MPA), a transcription elongation inhibitor. Both rai1\u0394 and bye1\u0394 displayed reduced sensitivity to MPA; in contrast to loss of the known transcription elongation factor DST1 (TFIIS) that displayed increased sensitivity to MPA (Fig\u00a0EV2), consistent with both Bye1 and Rai1 functioning as negative transcriptional regulators. Together, our data indicate a role for Rai1, and perhaps the full Rat1/Rai1 exonuclease complex, as a genome\u2010wide transcription elongation factor in yeast, with functions in both transcription elongation and termination.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2\nMPA growth assay for wild\u2010type cells and bye1\u0394, rai1\u0394, and dst1\u0394 mutantsWT, bye1\u0394, rai1\u0394, and dst1\u0394 mutants were plated on YPD media containing 0, 45, or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of the transcription elongation inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA). Deletion of the transcription elongation factor DST1 confers increased sensitivity to MPA at both low (45\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and high (100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) doses of MPA, consistent with the role of Dst1 as a positive transcription elongation factor. Conversely, bye1\u0394 and rai1\u0394 mutants display decreased sensitivity to MPA, consistent with both bye1\u0394 and rai1\u0394 acting as negative regulators of transcription elongation.Bre1 functions in the 3\u2032 region of genes during transcriptionAnalysis of factors enriched at the 3\u2032 end of genes revealed many factors with known functions in transcription elongation, 3\u2032 end processing, and termination (Fig\u00a03B and C). Interestingly, the ubiquitin ligase, Bre1, was also enriched in 3\u2032 ECs. Bre1, in conjunction with the ubiquitin\u2010conjugating enzyme Rad6, monoubiquitinates both histone H2B on lysine 123 (H2Bub) and multiple residues on the cleavage and polyadenylation factor Swd2 (Crisucci & Arndt, 2011; Vitaliano\u2010Prunier et\u00a0al, 2012). Bre1 has been shown to be recruited to Pol II though the Paf1 complex (Crisucci & Arndt, 2011; Piro et\u00a0al, 2012). Multiple Paf1 complex proteins were enriched in 5\u2032 ECs, but none were enriched in the 3\u2032 ECs. However, a lack of enrichment is surprising as subunits of the Paf1 complex have been shown to localize across gene bodies by ChIP (Crisucci & Arndt, 2011). Our stringent statistical analysis reduces false positives at a cost of false negatives. Indeed, Paf1 complex members, Paf1 and Ctr9, show a modest enrichment of 1.5\u2010fold in the 3\u2032 interactome with low P\u2010values (0.018 and 0.013). To look for transcriptional defects brought on by loss of Bre1, we analyzed bre1\u0394 cells by NET\u2010seq. Consistent with analysis of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ECs, loss of BRE1 caused minimal changes to Pol II density near the 5\u2032 region of genes but did alter Pol II dynamics in the latter stages of transcription elongation and around polyA sites (Fig\u00a05A and B). A lack of major changes to Pol II dynamics at the 5\u2032 end of genes is somewhat surprising as H2Bub is important for proper deposition of other histone modifications such as H3K4 methylation (Batta et\u00a0al, 2011; Crisucci & Arndt, 2011). However, at actively transcribed genes H2Bub is important for modulating transcription elongation (Xiao et\u00a0al, 2005; Batta et\u00a0al, 2011), consistent with the defects in transcription elongation observed by NET\u2010seq in the bre1\u0394 mutant. Loss of BRE1 resulted in a significant increase in Pol II downstream of the polyA site at 60% of genes (Fig\u00a05C); however, it did not lead to transcriptional read\u2010through. These data suggest that Bre1 regulates Pol II pausing during the latter stages of transcription elongation and 3\u2032 end processing. As Paf1 complex components, Paf1 and Rtf1, have been implicated in the recruitment of Bre1 to Pol II (Ng et\u00a0al, 2003; Xiao et\u00a0al, 2005; Piro et\u00a0al, 2012), we analyzed both paf1\u0394 and rtf1\u0394 cells by NET\u2010seq. Rtf1 is a unique member of the Paf1 complex as Rtf1 alone can promote H2Bub through Rad6/Bre1 (Piro et\u00a0al, 2012). Both paf1\u0394 and rtf1\u0394 mutants did induce minor alterations to Pol II density at polyA sites, consistent with the role of Paf1 complex in 3\u2032 end processing (Mueller et\u00a0al, 2004; Penheiter et\u00a0al, 2005; Crisucci & Arndt, 2011). However, neither loss of PAF1 nor RTF1 resulted in increased Pol II pausing during polyadenylation as was seen with loss of BRE1 (Fig\u00a05C), suggesting that Bre1 may regulate Pol II independent of the Paf1 complex at the 3\u2032 end of genes.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Bre1 functions during the latter stages of transcription elongation\nNormalized NET\u2010seq reads for WT (black) and bre1\u0394 (red) cells at the NUP157 gene.

MNase\u2010seq data were obtained from van Bakel et\u00a0al (2013), and ChIP\u2010exo data were obtained from Rhee et\u00a0al (2014).\nConsidering our findings, we postulated that H2Bub and ubiquitinated Swd2 might work together to regulate Pol II dynamics at the 3\u2032 end of genes. Ubiquitination of Swd2 by Bre1 is important for proper 3\u2032 end processing and export of mRNP complexes (Vitaliano\u2010Prunier et\u00a0al, 2012) and H2Bub is important for the reassembly of nucleosomes in the wake of transcription and promotes transcription elongation at actively transcribed genes (Batta et\u00a0al, 2011). To ask whether ubiquitination of H2B occurs downstream of the polyA site, we re\u2010analyzed published MNase\u2010seq and histone modification ChIP\u2010seq data (van Bakel et\u00a0al, 2013; Rhee et\u00a0al, 2014) that reveals the presence of a nucleosome just downstream of the polyA site that is enriched for H2Bub (Fig\u00a05D). To confirm that the enrichment of H2Bub at the post\u2010polyA nucleosomes is not due to contamination from a proximal +1 nucleosome of a downstream gene, we looked a subset of genes that are at least 350\u00a0bp away from another gene and observe a similar trend (Fig\u00a0EV3). Together, these data suggest a role for Bre1 in regulating Pol II during the latter stages of transcription. This regulation may be mediated through its ubiquitin ligase activity directed toward H2B or through altering ubiquitination or regulation of other factors, such as Swd2, important for 3\u2032 end Pol II dynamics. This analysis of transcriptional defects brought on by the bre1\u0394 mutations reveals how the 3\u2032 EC data can be used to interrogate factors regulating transcription at the 3\u2032 end of genes.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Bre1 and H2Bub are present on nucleosomes near the polyA site and are not the result of overlap with the plus one nucleosome from neighboring genesTop: normalized average NET\u2010seq profiles for WT and bre1\u0394 cells around the transcription start site TSS and polyA of protein\u2010coding genes with non\u2010overlapping genes that do not overlap with another protein\u2010coding gene within 350 base pairs, n\u00a0=\u00a01,120.

MNase\u2010seq data were obtained from van Bakel et\u00a0al (2013), and ChIP\u2010exo data were obtained from Rhee et\u00a0al (2014). DiscussionThe coupling of transcription to co\u2010transcriptional processes, such as RNA processing and chromatin modifications, requires Pol II to interact dynamically with a multitude of factors. Not only must the interactions occur during transcription, but they must occur at the proper stage of transcription. Thus, Pol II has to recruit a highly unique set of factors to modulate transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. While techniques like ChIP can be used to study a single factor across gene bodies, it cannot provide information on the suite of proteins regulating Pol II at a specific stage of transcription. To gain insight into how the complete composition of the Pol II elongation complex regulates the stages of transcription, we developed a technique to isolate ECs specifically from the 5\u2032 (early elongation) and 3\u2032 (late elongation/termination) regions of a gene. Purification of all Pol II complexes is followed by isolation of ECs at specific regions of a gene using sequences encoded in the nascent RNA. This allows precise purification of ECs from distinct 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genic regions. Analysis of the isolated complexes by quantitative mass spectrometry determines the proteins functioning at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of the gene, demonstrating the dynamic nature of the transcription elongation complex.Our analysis of the 5\u2032 Pol II EC interactome revealed many known early elongation factors and the surprising enrichment of termination factors, Rat1 and Rai1 (Fig\u00a06). Rat1 has impacts on transcription elongation, and its mammalian homologue, Xrn2, has been implicated in promoter proximal pause regulation in mammalian cells (Jimeno\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al, 2010; Brannan et\u00a0al, 2012). The data presented here indicate a role for Rai1 (that perhaps extends to Rat1) in regulating multiple steps of transcription genome\u2010wide. Thus, multistage regulation of transcription by these canonical termination factors is conserved in yeast and mammals (Jimeno\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al, 2010; Brannan et\u00a0al, 2012), suggesting their importance for governing early transcription elongation, possibly through termination of improperly capped transcripts. Interestingly, our analysis of cells lacking Bye1 revealed a similar Pol II density profile as for Rai1, suggesting that they may function in a common pathway that remains to be determined.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Summary diagram of factors identified to regulate subgenic stages of transcriptionDiagram\u00a0depicting Pol II near the 5\u2032/early elongation transcriptional phase, shaded in green and Pol II in the 3\u2032/late elongation and termination phase of transcription, shaded in red. Factors identified by subgenic isolation of Pol II complexes and shown to regulate specific stages of transcription are displayed. Also depicted is the H2Bub modified nucleosome, which is enriched near the polyA site. Below the diagram is a table indicating genic regions where complexes were isolated from, what transcriptional stage the subgenic Pol II complexes are isolated from, the likely state of CTD phosphorylation, a sampling of factors enriched at subgenic regions during transcription, and the total number of factors enriched in each IP using the stringent cutoff.Analysis of the 3\u2032 end complexes revealed enrichment for many factors regulating the latter stages of elongation, 3\u2032 end processing, and termination (Fig\u00a06). Enrichment of Bre1 in 3\u2032 ECs was unexpected as Bre1 is recruited to Pol II through the Paf1 complex, which we and others have observed to be enriched in 5\u2032 ECs (Pokholok et\u00a0al, 2002; Chen et\u00a0al, 2015; Yu et\u00a0al, 2015). Interestingly, we find that Bre1 regulates the dynamics of Pol II at the 3\u2032 ends of genes, possibly by ubiquitinating histone H2B and possibly cleavage and polyadenylation factor Swd2. The importance of nucleosome modifications in transcription initiation and elongation is well established. These findings suggest that histone modifications, in particular H2Bub, may also be important for regulating transcription termination as well.The identification of unique 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 EC composition will serve as a resource for the future study of many transcription factors and can be used to uncover subgenic roles for said factors. Furthermore, the sequential IP approach with nascent RNA handles can serve as a technique to study EC composition from many genomic positions. Moving the RNA handles to a genomic loci, as opposed to the plasmid\u2010based expression utilized here, may uncover subgenic roles for transcription factors and chromatin modifiers or remodelers not required for expression of the inducible, plasmid\u2010based construct. By placing the stem\u2010loop encoding sequences into different regions of genes, many different co\u2010transcriptional processes can be analyzed. For example, MS2 sequences have been used to study splicing (Lacadie et\u00a0al, 2006) and by inserting PP7 and MS2 sequences into intronic and exonic regions, the sequential IP approach described here could be used to isolate ECs involved in unique co\u2010transcriptional processes. Insertion of the stem\u2010loops into genes regulated by different promoters, enhancers, or terminators will allow exploration of how these different genetic elements regulate the composition of the elongation complex. Lastly, this approach could study genes regulated by different mechanisms, such as stress\u2010induced genes versus housekeeping genes, which would identify factors regulating transcription elongation from different gene classes. Materials and MethodsPlasmid constructionThe pKH202 plasmid was made by first sewing together IDT gene blocks containing the 2\u00d7 PP7 stem\u2010loop sequence from Hocine et\u00a0al (2013), the yeast TDH3 gene, and 2\u00d7 MS2 stem\u2010loop sequence from Hocine et\u00a0al (2013) by overlap extension PCR. This construct (2\u00d7PP7\u2010TDH3\u20102\u00d7MS2) was then cloned into p423 (Mumberg et\u00a0al, 1994) using In\u2010Fusion based cloning (Clontech). This placed the construct downstream of a GAL1 promoter on the 2\u03bc plasmid.

Standard lithium acetate transformations were used. For a list of yeast strains used in this study see Table\u00a0EV3.Sequential PP7\u2010GFP and MS2\u2010RFP IPs for mass spectrometry and NET\u2010seqOvernight cultures from single yeast colonies of YKH402 for GFP IPs or YKH403 for RFP IPs grown in SC\u2010His\u2010Ura media containing 2% glucose as the carbon source were diluted to OD600\u00a0=\u00a00.05 into 1\u00a0l of SC\u2010His\u2010Ura media containing 2% raffinose as the carbon source and grown to an OD600\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u20131.0. Forty percent galactose was then added to the cultures to a final concentration of 2%, and cultures were grown for an additional 1\u00a0h. After 1\u00a0h, cultures were filtered over 0.45\u2010mm\u2010pore\u2010size nitrocellulose filters (Whatman). Yeast were scraped off the filter into a 10\u2010ml syringe and forced through the syringe into liquid nitrogen, creating \u201cnoodles,\u201d as described previously (Oeffinger et\u00a0al, 2007). Noodles were then pulverized by a ball\u2010bearing mixer mill (Retsch MM301) for 3\u00a0min at 15\u00a0Hz for eight cycles. Sample chambers were pre\u2010chilled in liquid nitrogen and chilled after every cycle to generate yeast \u201cgrindate\u201d. One gram of yeast grindate was resuspended in 5\u00a0ml of 1\u00d7 lysis buffer [20\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110\u00a0mM KOAc, 0.5 Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% Tween\u201020, 10\u00a0mM MnCl2, 8\u00a0U/ml RNasin (Promega), 1\u00d7 Complete EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1\u00d7 PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor (Roche)]. 660\u00a0U of RQ1 DNase (Promega) was added and the lysate incubated for 20\u00a0min on ice. Lysate was centrifuged at 20,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was added to 500\u00a0\u03bcl of ANTI\u2010FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) pre\u2010equilibrated with lysis buffer and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. Immunoprecipitations were washed 3\u00a0\u00d7 for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C with 10\u00a0ml of 1\u00d7 wash buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110\u00a0mM KOAc, 0.5 Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% Tween\u201020, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). After washing, the beads were resuspended in 1.2\u00a0ml of wash buffer and 3.33\u00a0\u03bcg of RNase A was added to the samples and they were incubated on a rotator for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. After 5\u00a0min, the RNase A was quenched by the addition of 33\u00a0\u03bcl of RNasein (Promega) and 133\u00a0\u03bcl of 100\u00a0mM EDTA. Quenching was carried out for 60\u00a0s while rotating at 4\u00b0C. Samples were then washed with 1\u00d7 wash buffer containing RNasein (8\u00a0U/ml) for 5\u00a0min once followed by two more washes for 2\u00a0min. Complexes were eluted twice in 300\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00a0mg/ml 3\u00d7 FLAG peptide (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) resuspended in wash buffer by rotating at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After elution, 600\u00a0\u03bcl of sample was added to 50\u00a0\u03bcl of GFP\u2010Trap beads from Chromotek gtm\u201020 or 50\u00a0\u03bcl of RFP\u2010Trap (Chromotek rtm\u201020) magnetic beads pre\u2010equilibrated in wash buffer. For mock IPs, samples expressing the PCP\u2010GFP construct were added to 50\u00a0\u03bcl of RFP\u2010Trap magnetic beads. Samples were incubated for 30\u00a0min and washed 3\u00a0\u00d7 by pipetting with 1\u00a0ml of wash buffer followed by a 5\u2010min rotating wash. For mass spectrometry analysis, complexes were eluted twice by adding 300\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0M Gly pH 2 nutating at room temperature for 5\u00a0min. Elutions were pooled and neutralized by 60\u00a0\u03bcl of 1\u00a0M Tris pH 10 and TCA precipitated. For silver stains, TCA precipitated samples were run at 4\u201312% acrylamide gel and silver stained using the SliverQuest staining kit (Invitrogen). For mass spectrometry analysis, TCA precipitated samples were run on 12% acrylamide gels until the highest molecular weight proteins entered the separating gel. Samples were then stained with Coomassie blue stain, extracted from the gel, and submitted to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School for analysis. For NET\u2010seq analysis, the beads were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of TRIzol (Life Technologies) and incubated in a thermoshaker (Multitherm, Benchmark) for 10\u00a0min at 1,000 rpm at 25\u00b0C. RNA was subsequently isolated according the manufacturer's instructions and resuspended in a volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcl. NET\u2010seq libraries were then generated as described below.NET\u2010seq library generationNET\u2010seq data for WT, rai1\u0394, and rtt103\u0394 cells were obtained from Harlen et\u00a0al (2016). NET\u2010seq data for bye1\u0394, paf1\u0394, rtf1\u0394, and bre1\u0394 mutants were generated as follows. Cultures for NET\u2010seq were prepared as described in Churchman and Weissman (2012). Briefly, overnight cultures from single yeast colonies grown in YPD were diluted to OD600\u00a0=\u00a00.05 in 1\u00a0l of YPD medium and grown at 30\u00b0C shaking at 200\u00a0rpm until reaching an OD600\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u20130.8. Cultures were then filtered over 0.45\u2010mm\u2010pore\u2010size nitrocellulose filters (Whatman). Yeast were scraped off the filter with a spatula pre\u2010chilled in liquid nitrogen and plunged directly into liquid nitrogen as described in Churchman and Weissman (2012). Mixer mill pulverization was performed using the conditions described above for six cycles. NET\u2010seq IPs, isolation of nascent RNA and library construction were carried out as previously described (Churchman & Weissman, 2012). A random hexamer sequence was added to the linker to improve ligation efficiency and allow for the removal of any library biases generated from the RT step as described in Mayer et\u00a0al (2015). After library construction, the size distribution of the library was determined by using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and library concentrations were determined by Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). 3\u2032 end sequencing of all samples was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with a read length of 75.RT\u2013qPCR analysisNascent RNA from sequential Pol II\u2010PCP IPs was isolated as described above, with each sample having a different RNase A digestion time. Digestion times at 0, 2, 5, 7, and 10\u00a0min of treatment on samples purified by the Rpb3 IP were tested. An input sample that represents whole\u2010cell lysate was also analyzed. RT was performed using Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. After that RT samples were diluted 1:2 and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of cDNA was used for qPCR. qPCR was done using SSoFast Supermix from Bio\u2010Rad according the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was carried out on a Bio\u2010Rad CFX384 Real\u2010Time System with a C1000 Thermocycler, and Ct values were calculated using regression. qPCR primers for the 5\u2032 region, corresponding to the PP7 stem\u2010loop, were forward primer PP7: GCCTAGAAAGGAGCAGACGA, reverse primer PP7: CTTGAATGAACCCGGGAATAG. qPCR primers for the 3\u2032 regions, corresponding to the MS2 stem\u2010loops, were forward primer MS2: CGGTACTTATTGCCAAGAAAGC, reverse primer MS2: GATGAACCCTGGAATACTGGA.Methods for protein sequence analysis by LC\u2010MS/MSTaplin biological mass spectrometry facility Excised gel bands were cut into approximately 1\u2010mm3 pieces. Gel pieces were then subjected to a modified in\u2010gel trypsin digestion procedure (Shevchenko et\u00a0al, 1996). Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10\u00a0min followed by removal of acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a speed\u2010vac. Rehydration of the gel pieces was done with 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5\u00a0ng/\u03bcl modified sequencing\u2010grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 4\u00b0C. After 45\u00a0min, the excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to just cover the gel pieces. Samples were then placed in a 37\u00b0C room overnight. Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by one wash with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. The extracts were then dried in a speed\u2010vac (~1\u00a0h). The samples were then stored at 4\u00b0C until analysis. On the day of analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcl of HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano\u2010scale reverse\u2010phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 2.6\u2010\u03bcm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (100\u00a0\u03bcm inner diameter\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0~30\u00a0cm length) with a flame\u2010drawn tip (Peng & Gygi, 2001). After equilibrating the column, each sample was loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings, San Francisco CA) onto the column. A gradient was formed, and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). As peptides eluted, they were subjected to electrospray ionization and then entered into an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion\u2010trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (Eng et\u00a0al, 1994). All databases include a reversed version of all the sequences, and the data were filtered to between a one and two percent peptide FDR.Mass spectrometry data analysisAll mass spectrometry data analysis was done using the Perseus software (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010; Hubner & Mann, 2011) (http://www.coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:start) as follows. For each run, MS1 intensities for each peptide from a given protein were summed to obtain MS1 intensity levels for each protein. The dataset for the specific triplicate IP (GFP or RFP) was loaded into Perseus along with the mock control dataset (PCP\u2010GFP using RFP beads). Datasets were log2 transformed, and each sample was normalized by subtracting the mean MS1 intensity for that dataset from each protein in the dataset. Mean normalization centers the dataset around zero without affecting the variance within each dataset. As seen in Fig\u00a0EV1, mean normalization allows direct comparison between datasets by ensuring each dataset has a similar mean. As samples already have similar variances, the two datasets can be statistically analyzed by t\u2010tests. Samples were then filtered for proteins present in all three specific or mock IPs. To allow for statistical analysis between the specific and mock IPs, missing values (proteins present in the specific IP but not the mock or vice versa) were imputed by assigning a value from a down\u2010shifted normal distribution of the actual MS1 intensity distribution, representing low abundance values near noise levels, with a down\u2010shift of 1.8 and a width of 3, as is standard (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010). Volcano plot analysis identified significantly enriched interactors as follows. Specifically enriched interactors were determined by comparing normalized MS1 intensities of three biological replicates of a specific IP to biological triplicates of a mock control. Proteins were only considered enriched interactors if they were present in all three specific IPs and significantly enriched as determined in the following manner. The observed fold enrichment of proteins in the specific IPs compared to mock IPs (plotted in log2 scale) was compared to the negative log10 of the P\u2010value resulting from a t\u2010test between each protein in the specific and mock IPs. This analysis results in a volcano plot (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010; Hubner & Mann, 2011). Enriched interactors are located in the upper right of the plot, with a large fold enrichment and low P\u2010value. To define truly enriched proteins, a significance line corresponding to a FDR of 0.05 for high\u2010confidence interactors or 0.1 for less stringent interactors is calculated using a permutation\u2010based method in the mass spectrometry analysis software, Perseus (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010; Hubner & Mann, 2011). The SO values, which represent curve bend, were selected to minimize the number of mock\u2010specific interactors as previously described (Hubner et\u00a0al, 2010; Hubner & Mann, 2011). Pearson correlation values, principal component analysis, and complete linkage hierarchical clustering for mass spectrometry data were calculated using the Perseus software.NET\u2010seq data analysisNET\u2010seq reads were aligned as follows. The adapter sequence (ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG) was removed from all reads using cutadapt with the following parameters: \u2010O 3 \u2010m 1 \u2013length\u2010tag \u201clength=\u201d. Raw fastq files were filtered using PrinSeq (http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/) with the following parameters: \u2010no_qual_header \u2010min_len 7 \u2010min_qual_mean 20 \u2010trim_right 1 \u2010trim_ns_right 1 \u2010trim_qual_right 20 \u2010trim_qual_type mean \u2010trim_qual_window 5 \u2010trim_qual_step 1. Random hexamer linker sequences (the first six nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end of the read) were removed using custom python scripts but remained associated with the read, and reads were then\u00a0aligned to the SacCer3 genome obtained from the Saccharomyces\u00a0Genome Database using the TopHat2 aligner (Kim et\u00a0al, 2013) with the following parameters: \u2013read\u2010mismatches 3 \u2013read\u2010gap\u2010length 2 \u2013read\u2010edit\u2010dist 3 \u2013min\u2010anchor\u2010length 8 \u2013splice\u2010mismatches 1 \u2013min\u2010intron\u2010length 50 \u2013max\u2010intron\u2010length 1,200 \u2013max\u2010insertion\u2010length 3 \u2013max\u2010deletion\u2010length 3 \u2013num\u2010threads 4 \u2013max\u2010multihits 100 \u2013library\u2010type fr\u2010firststrand \u2013segment\u2010mismatches 3 \u2013no\u2010coverage\u2010search \u2013segment\u2010length 20 \u2013min\u2010coverage\u2010intron 50 \u2013max\u2010coverage\u2010intron 100,000 \u2013min\u2010segment\u2010intron 50 \u2013max\u2010segment\u2010intron 500,000 \u2013b2\u2010sensitive. To avoid any bias toward favoring annotated regions, the alignment was performed without providing a transcriptome. Reverse transcription mispriming events are identified and removed where molecular barcode sequences correspond exactly to the genomic sequence adjacent to the aligned read. For NET\u2010seq only, the position corresponding to the 5\u2032 end of the sequencing read (after removal of the barcode), which corresponds to the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA fragment, is recorded with a custom python script using HTSeq package (Anders et\u00a0al, 2014).Average profile plots and occupancy analysisNET\u2010seq from wild\u2010type or mutant strains were scored around the transcription start site (TSS) and polyA sites non\u2010overlapping genes in 1\u2010bp bins using the deepTools program (Ram\u00edrez et\u00a0al, 2014). Annotation for TSS and pA sites were derived from Pelechano et\u00a0al (2013) by taking the major transcript isoform for each gene. The TSS and pA average profiles were calculated using non\u2010overlapping protein\u2010coding genes with an RPKM\u00a0>\u00a010 in the WT NET\u2010seq data and that are at least 500\u00a0bp long (n\u00a0=\u00a02,738). For the average plots in Fig\u00a0EV3, genes that did not overlap by at least 350\u00a0bp were used (n\u00a0=\u00a01,120). First, each NET\u2010seq library is normalized by the number of million uniquely mapped reads. NET\u2010seq data for each gene used in the average profile are then normalized by summing the total number of reads for that gene and dividing by the length of the window analyzed, which includes regions around the TSS (1,100\u00a0bp) and the polyA (550\u00a0bp) for a total region of 1,650\u00a0bp. After each gene is normalized, the average profile and 95% confidence interval are calculated using a sliding window of 25 base pairs, which results in average Pol II density for NET\u2010seq around the TSS and polyA sites. To calculate the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 ratio, a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 score is calculated for each gene as follows. The log2 ratio of the sum of normalized reads from the 1 to 250\u00a0bp from the TSS is divided by the sum of reads from 250\u00a0bp upstream of the polyA site to the polyA site. Box\u00a0plots of the distribution of 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 scores for each gene in WT and mutant samples are then plotted. To calculate the polyA pausing ratio, a polyA pausing score is calculated for each gene as follows. The log2 ratio of the sum of NET\u2010seq reads in a window from 50\u00a0base pairs upstream of the polyA site to 100\u00a0base pairs downstream of the polyA site is compared to the sum of reads in a window from 200 to 50\u00a0base pairs upstream of the polyA site. Box\u00a0plots of the polyA pausing ratio distributions for each sample are then plotted. Significant differences in mutant and WT samples for both the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 ratio scores and polyA pausing ratio scores are then determined using two\u2010sided t\u2010tests.Re\u2010analysis of histone and nucleosome dataMNase\u2010seq data and histone ChIP\u2010exo data were obtained from van Bakel et\u00a0al and Rhee et\u00a0al respectively (van Bakel et\u00a0al, 2013; Rhee et\u00a0al, 2014). Reads were then aligned to the SacCer3 genome obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database, using Bowtie version 1.1.1 (Langmead et\u00a0al, 2009) with the following parameters \u2010v 2 \u2010M 1 \u2013best \u2013S. Coverage files were then generated using BEDtools version 2.23.0 with the following parameters genomeCoverageBed \u2010bga \u20105 \u2013strand. ChIP\u2010exo data were then shifted according to the parameters given in Rhee et\u00a0al (2014) and the strand information removed. Data were normalized by million mapped reads, and average profiles were calculated as described in the Average Profile Plots and Occupancy analysis section.MPA assayMycophenolic acid (MPA) assays were conducted as follows. Overnight cultures grown in YPD were back diluted and grown to OD600. Serial tenfold dilutions beginning at 1 OD were then stamped on plates of YPD containing 0, 45, or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of MPA. Plates were grown at 30\u00b0C and imaged every 24\u00a0h to monitor growth.Data availabilityNET\u2010seq data are available in the GEO repository under GEO Accession: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE83546\",\"term_id\":\"83546\"}}GSE83546.
