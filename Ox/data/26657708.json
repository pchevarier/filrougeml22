Such stressful conditions include extreme temperatures, drought, salinity as well as pathogen and herbivore attacks. In nature, these are often\u00a0chronic or recurring. Thus, plants have evolved strategies to remember a past exposure to stress to be better prepared for the next incident (Jaskiewicz et\u00a0al, 2011; Ding et\u00a0al, 2012a; Sani et\u00a0al, 2013; Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). This area of research has only recently received increasing attention (Bruce et\u00a0al, 2007; Conrath, 2011; Avramova, 2015; Hilker et\u00a0al, 2015; Kim et\u00a0al, 2015; Vriet et\u00a0al, 2015), and the molecular basis of plant stress memory is still largely unknown. In this context, the term memory refers to the phenomenon where a signal of limited duration is perceived, stored and later retrieved, as evidenced by a modified response (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014b). A related phenomenon in animals is hormesis, where a low\u2010level stress treatment enhances resistance against the same and other stresses and increases growth, fecundity, and longevity (Gems & Partridge, 2008). Mechanistically, stress memory may be regulated at different levels ranging from metabolites to chromatin structure. In cases where stress memory involves modified gene expression patterns, a plausible hypothesis is that modifications of chromatin structure mediate such a memory.Chromatin structure is an important determinant of the regulation of gene expression. Chromatin structure is modified through nucleosome positioning, histone variants, and posttranslational modification of histones (Struhl & Segal, 2013; Zentner & Henikoff, 2013). Depending on their nature and position, these modifications can promote or repress transcription by altering chromatin accessibility or interaction with specific protein complexes. For example, histone acetylation is associated with active transcription and correlates closely with the rate of transcription (Zentner & Henikoff, 2013). Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) can be mono\u2010, di\u2010, or trimethylated, and its functions are largely conserved between yeast, animals, and plants (Santos\u2010Rosa et\u00a0al, 2002; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2009; Shilatifard, 2012). In plants and animals, H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is highly correlated with active transcription (Guenther et\u00a0al, 2007; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2009) and is thought to be required for efficient RNA polymerase II elongation (Ding et\u00a0al, 2012b; Kwak & Lis, 2013). Similar to H3K4me3, H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) is associated with the 5\u2032\u2010region of genes, but it does not correlate with active transcription (Guenther et\u00a0al, 2007; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2009). H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) is not correlated with gene expression and accumulates within transcribed regions (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2009). In mammals, H3K4me1 is enriched at promoters and enhancers (Cheng et\u00a0al, 2014).It has been hypothesized that recent transcriptional activity of a locus may be marked to mediate a modified response following a second stimulus. H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 have been discussed as such chromatin marks. In yeast, H3K4me3 hyper\u2010methylation was proposed to act as a memory of recent transcriptional activity (Ng et\u00a0al, 2003). It was suggested that elevated H3K4me3 is important for genes to be rapidly switched on and off by environmental stimuli and that it acts to prevent the associated genes from being silenced (Ng et\u00a0al, 2003). In mammals, H3K4me3 marks genes that are poised for expression (Guenther et\u00a0al, 2007). Transcriptional stress memory in plants has been described for recurring drought stress (Ding et\u00a0al, 2012a), hyper\u2010osmotic stress (Sani et\u00a0al, 2013), and defense priming (Conrath, 2011; Jaskiewicz et\u00a0al, 2011). Priming refers to the ability for quicker and more effective activation of specific cellular defenses upon a previous exposure to stress (Hilker et\u00a0al, 2015). Originally used mainly for biotic stress responses, it is now also used to describe abiotic stress responses. In the above\u2010mentioned cases of priming, molecular responses were associated with lasting changes in chromatin modifications. Transcriptional memory following drought stress was correlated with elevated H3K4me3 and stalled RNA polymerase II that is phosphorylated at Ser5 (Ding et\u00a0al, 2012a). Whether chromatin modifications are involved in priming\u2010like phenomena in response to other abiotic stresses such as HS is unknown. What triggers and maintains the deposition of these plant memory marks remains unclear in all reported cases. In particular, the interaction of such chromatin modifications with the transcription factors that govern the induction or sustained activation of the corresponding loci remains unclear.Moderate heat stress (HS) allows a plant to acquire thermotolerance and subsequently withstand high temperatures that are lethal to a plant in the na\u00efve state (Mittler et\u00a0al, 2012). After returning to non\u2010stress temperatures, acquired thermotolerance is maintained over several days, and this maintenance is genetically separable from the acquisition itself (Charng et\u00a0al, 2006, 2007; Meiri & Breiman, 2009; Yeh et\u00a0al, 2012; Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). We refer to this maintenance of acquired thermotolerance as HS memory. While the molecular events that lead to the acquisition of thermotolerance are relatively well understood, little is known about the mechanism of HS memory. The acquisition of thermotolerance involves the activation of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) that induce the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which protect cellular proteins from denaturation (Scharf et\u00a0al, 2012). This HS response is conserved in plants, animals, and fungi (Richter et\u00a0al, 2010). Beyond its function in the HS response, mammalian HSF1 has important roles in aging and pathologies (Vihervaara & Sistonen, 2014). Yeast and animals have only one or a few copies of HSF genes, yet many plants contain more than 20 copies with specialized functions. Among the 21 HSFs in Arabidopsis thaliana, so far eight have been shown to act in the responses to HS (Charng et\u00a0al, 2007; Schramm et\u00a0al, 2008; Ikeda et\u00a0al, 2011; Liu et\u00a0al, 2011; Scharf et\u00a0al, 2012). Of these, HSFA2 has received special attention, as its expression is highly induced by heat (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006; Schramm et\u00a0al, 2006). Interestingly, HSFA2 is not required for the acquisition of thermotolerance, but specifically for its maintenance (Charng et\u00a0al, 2007). Similar effects have been described for HSA32 (Charng et\u00a0al, 2006), and miR156 (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). Micro\u2010array analyses have identified a number of HS memory\u2010related genes that were classified based on their sustained induction after HS, which lasts for at least 3\u00a0days (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). They comprise many small HSPs (such as HSP21, HSP22.0, and HSP18.2), but also ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 2 (APX2). Their expression pattern is in strong contrast to that of HS\u2010inducible non\u2010memory genes such as HSP70 and HSP101, whose expression peaks soon after HS and declines relatively quickly. HSFA2 was reported to be required for the maintenance of high expression levels of several HS memory\u2010related genes, but not for their induction, suggesting they could be direct targets of HSFA2 (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006; Charng et\u00a0al, 2007). This idea was confirmed by in\u00a0vitro binding studies (Schramm et\u00a0al, 2006), but so far not in planta. How HS induction is maintained on some HSPs for several days but not on others remains an open question. Also, it is unknown how the molecular responses to a recurring HS during the memory period differ from the responses to the initial HS, that is, whether there is a transcriptional memory in the classical sense.In general, the term \u201ctranscriptional memory\u201d has been used to describe at least two different phenomena (D'Urso & Brickner, 2014). The first phenomenon is where transcriptional response upon a stimulus (such as induction) is modified if the gene was recently active compared to a copy of the gene that was not active before (type 1). An example is transcriptional memory of INO1 in yeast (Light et\u00a0al, 2010). The second type of transcriptional memory refers to a phenomenon during which gene expression levels are lastingly modified after a transient signal (type 2). A classic example here is the epigenetic silencing of FLC in response to cold by vernalization (Berry & Dean, 2015). During HS memory, a modified re\u2010induction after a second HS would indicate type 1, whereas the sustained induction of HS memory\u2010related genes indicates type 2. For the sake of distinction and clarity, we here refer to type 1 transcriptional memory as such, whereas type 2 transcriptional memory will be referred to as sustained induction.This study investigates a possible involvement of histone modifications during HS memory and their interaction with HSFA2. We show that HSFA2 is required for the maintenance of induction of HS memory\u2010associated genes and directly binds to these loci in planta. Interestingly, this binding occurs transiently during the first few hours after HS. In addition, we identify sustained H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 as chromatin marks that discriminate HS memory\u2010related genes from other HS\u2010inducible genes. Elevated H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 levels persist after HSFA2 association with the locus has declined. Loci that maintain very high levels of H3K4 methylation show an increased response after a recurring HS 2\u00a0days after the primary HS, consistent with the definition of transcriptional memory. Thus, HS memory consists of two components, first, the sustained induction of HS memory\u2010associated genes, and second, differential response upon recurring HS. Both components are associated with elevated levels of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 and depend on functional HSFA2. In summary, our study identifies H3K4 methylation as a HS memory mark and reveals its dependency on a transiently binding transcription factor. ResultsProlonged expression of HS memory\u2010related genes is associated with changes in chromatin modificationsWe hypothesized that sustained activation of HS memory\u2010related genes may be associated with changes in chromatin modifications and that such modifications may prime the plant for recurring HS. To test this hypothesis, we investigated H3K4me3, H3K4me2, and H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) at the HSP22.0 and HSP70 loci as representatives of the HS memory\u2010related and non\u2010memory HS\u2010inducible genes, respectively.We analyzed histone modifications in the A.\u00a0thaliana accession Col\u20100 by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative real\u2010time PCR (ChIP\u2010qPCR) 4, 28 and 52\u00a0h after an acclimatizing HS (ACC), consisting of 60\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, 90\u00a0min recovery at 23\u00b0C, 45\u00a0min at 44\u00b0C (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). A temperature of 44\u00b0C is commonly used in A.\u00a0thaliana HS studies (Yeh et\u00a0al, 2012). In nature, full insolation causes leaf temperatures to rise much higher than air temperatures (Salisbury & Spomer, 1964). During the 2\u00a0days following ACC, HSP22.0 transcript levels remain elevated while HSP70 transcript levels are elevated only during the first 28\u00a0h (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). For both genes, we analyzed one genic region at the 5\u2032\u2010end of the gene and one flanking region about three kb away in an intergenic region. For H3K9ac, we observed strong enrichment at 4\u00a0h that was specific for the genic region at both loci (Fig\u00a01). This enrichment declined rapidly in HSP70, where it was no longer significantly enriched at 28\u00a0h and undetectable at 52\u00a0h relative to no\u2010HS (NHS) control conditions (Fig\u00a01B). In contrast, H3K9ac at HSP22.0 declined more slowly and was still significantly enriched at 52\u00a0h (Fig\u00a01A). We next investigated H3K4me3 levels at HSP70. A moderate enrichment (threefold) was observed 4\u00a0h after ACC that declined over the next 2\u00a0days and returned to baseline levels by 52\u00a0h. In contrast, HSP22.0 showed strongly elevated H3K4me3 levels relative to NHS (up to 75\u2010fold enrichment). These remained very highly elevated over the course of the experiment. For H3K4me2, no HS\u2010dependent changes were observed at the HSP70 locus (Fig\u00a01B). However, at HSP22.0, enrichment of H3K4me2 was observed following HS. Interestingly, this modification accumulated only at the later time points (28, 52\u00a0h), while at 4\u00a0h no significant enrichment compared to the NHS control was found. Together, these results indicate that H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 accumulated on HSP22.0 especially toward the later phases during HS memory, when expression and acetylation levels have declined (Figs\u00a01A and \u200band2A).2A). Thus, given their sustained enrichment in comparison with H3K9ac, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at HSP22.0 may store information of recent transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the genic regions of HSP22.0 and HSP70 displayed a slight enrichment of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 relative to their respective intergenic control regions also in the absence of any HS (compare regions 1 and 2 in Fig\u00a01, see Fig\u00a0EV1 for no antibody control). This suggests that HSP22.0 and HSP70 may both be constitutively poised for rapid activation in response to elevated temperatures. Notably, our results for HSP70 confirm the notion that there is no close correlation between high expression levels and H3K4me2 accumulation. At the physiological level, HS memory is detectable for at least 3\u00a0days after ACC (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). Thus, the duration of the physiological memory phase is in good accordance with elevated H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at HSP22.0.Open in a separate windowFigure 1\nHS induces sustained H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 methylation at HSP22.0, but not at HSP70\n\nA, BDynamics of histone modifications after an acclimatizing HS (ACC) or no HS (NHS) in Col\u20100 wild type at HSP22.0 (A) and HSP70 (B).

We next investigated whether the expression profiles of HS memory\u2010related and non\u2010memory HS\u2010inducible genes depended on HSFA2 during a time course of 3\u00a0days (76\u00a0h) following ACC (Fig\u00a02A). To put further analyses on a broader basis, we investigated four memory genes and two HS\u2010inducible non\u2010memory genes. For the memory\u2010related genes HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and HSP21, we observed unchanged induction 4\u00a0h after ACC in hsfa2 mutants compared to wild type. This induction declined faster in hsfa2 mutants over the next 3\u00a0days. The dependency on HSFA2 was most pronounced in HSP18.2 and somewhat weaker in HSP21 and HSP22.0. For the memory gene APX2, transcript levels in hsfa2 mutants were already lower at 4\u00a0h and declined strongly thereafter. These results indicate that for HSP18.2, HSP21, and HSP22.0, HSFA2 is not required for the initial induction, but rather for the maintenance of high expression levels. For APX2, HSFA2 was required for all time points analyzed. However, it is important to keep in mind that the first time point analyzed was already 4\u00a0h after ACC. In contrast, transcript levels of the non\u2010memory genes HSP70 and HSP101 declined much faster. Moreover, HSP70 and HSP101 transcript levels were not dependent on hsfa2. These findings confirm and extend previous work (Charng et\u00a0al, 2007).To estimate whether transcript levels represented ongoing transcriptional activity, we sought to analyze unspliced transcript levels as a proxy for ongoing transcriptional activity (B\u00e4urle et\u00a0al, 2007; Kabelitz et\u00a0al, 2014). Unspliced APX2 transcripts were significantly induced in wild type between 4 and 52\u00a0h, indicating that active transcription continues for at least 2\u00a0days after ACC (Fig\u00a0EV2A). In hsfa2, we observed a significantly lower induction of unspliced APX2 transcripts at 4\u00a0h that was undetectable at later points. The same was true for the HS memory gene HSP21 (Fig\u00a0EV2B). In contrast, unspliced HSP70 transcripts in wild type and hsfa2 were strongly induced at 4\u00a0h, but quickly declined thereafter (Fig\u00a0EV2C). Neither HSP18.2 nor HSP22.0 contains an intron, thus precluding corresponding analyses for these genes. In summary, the overall dynamics of unspliced transcripts closely mimicked that of the spliced transcripts, indicating that the sustained accumulation of APX2 and HSP21 transcripts reflects ongoing transcriptional activity for at least 52\u00a0h after ACC. In contrast, unspliced HSP70 transcripts\u00a0were not induced at 28\u00a0h and thereafter, corroborating the distinction between the two classes. Thus, our results indicate that HSFA2 regulates APX2 and HSP21 at the level of transcription.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Unspliced transcript levels of APX2 and HSP21, but not HSP70, are increased for at least 2\u00a0days after an acclimatizing HS\n\nA\u2013C Quantification of unspliced transcript levels of APX2 (A), HSP21 (B), and HSP70 (C) by qRT\u2013PCR in Col\u20100 (blue bars) and hsfa2 (orange bars) at the indicated times after an acclimatizing HS (ACC) or control treatment (NHS).

We analyzed protein levels of HSP21 and HSP101 in wild type and hsfa2 after ACC using commercially available antibodies. HSP21 protein levels peaked only at 28\u201352\u00a0h after ACC and remained highly elevated until 76\u00a0h (Fig\u00a02B). In contrast, HSP21 levels in hsfa2 were much reduced between 28 and 76\u00a0h. HSP101 was induced by ACC and peaked at 4\u00a0h. Elevated protein levels were still observed at 76\u00a0h. There was no difference in hsfa2, indicating that HSP101 expression did not depend on HSFA2. Thus, HSP101 protein levels are still elevated at 76\u00a0h despite the earlier decline in transcript levels, suggesting that the HSP101 protein may have a longer half life than the HSP21 protein. In summary, our protein analysis correlates well with the corresponding transcript analysis and indicates that proteins may be more stable than transcripts.\nHSFA2 is required for sustained accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2We next asked whether HSFA2 is also required for the accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at the memory\u2010associated loci. To this end, we compared the accumulation of H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in response to ACC in wild\u2010type and hsfa2 mutants by ChIP\u2010qPCR. We analyzed HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2 as HS memory\u2010related loci, and HSP70 as a HS\u2010inducible non\u2010memory locus whose expression is independent of HSFA2 (see Fig\u00a02A). In wild type, H3K4me3 was strongly induced at the 5\u2032\u2010region of HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2 throughout the analyzed time course (4\u201352\u00a0h after ACC, compared to NHS controls, Figs\u00a01A and \u200band3A).3A). There was no enrichment in intergenic regions flanking the loci. For HSP22.0 and APX2, H3K4me3 remained very high at 52\u00a0h after ACC, and for HSP18.2, the levels were still elevated, but lower than at 4\u00a0h (Fig\u00a03A). In contrast, at the HSP70 locus, we observed only a moderate increase in H3K4me3 after ACC (Figs\u00a01B and \u200band3A).3A). H3K4me3 accumulation at HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2 was dependent on HSFA2 as HSP18.2 and APX2 had significantly lower H3K4me3 in hsfa2 at all time points, and HSP22.0 had a trend for lower H3K4me3 at 4 and 28\u00a0h and significantly lower levels at 52\u00a0h (Fig\u00a03A). The slight increase in H3K4me3 at HSP70 at 4 and 28\u00a0h was largely independent of HSFA2, in line with the expression analysis, which suggested that HSP70 is not a target. In summary, we observed sustained H3K4me3 accumulation at HS memory\u2010related loci (HSP18.2, HSP22.0, APX2) that lasted for several days after ACC; this sustained H3K4me3 accumulation required functional HSFA2.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Sustained H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at HS memory\u2010related loci depends on HSFA2\nA, BH3K4me3 (A) or H3K4me2 (B) levels after an acclimatizing HS (ACC) in Col\u20100 and hsfa2 at HSP18.2,HSP22.0,HSP70, and APX2 as detected by ChIP\u2010qPCR. Col\u20100 (blue bars) and hsfa2 (orange bars) seedlings were subjected to ACC or no treatment (NHS) 4 d after germination. At the indicated time points after the treatment, ChIP\u2010qPCR was performed with antibodies against H3K4me3 (A), H3K4me2 (B) and H3 (for normalization). Schematics show positions of regions analyzed (gray bars, UTR; black bar, exons). Intergenic control region 1 is 3,123\u00a0bp (APX2) or 2,570\u00a0bp (HSP22.0) upstream of the TSS, or 5,311\u00a0bp (HSP18.2) or 6,725\u00a0bp (HSP70) downstream of the TSS, respectively. Data are averages over four biological replicates. Amplification values were normalized to input and H3 and the Col\u20100 4\u00a0h NHS region 2 (HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and HSP70) or region 3 (for APX2). *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for differences between genotypes at the same time point and treatment; squares and triangles within bars mark significant differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively) between ACC and NHS samples of the same time point and genotype, Student\u2032s t\u2010test. Error bars indicate SE.\nWe next analyzed H3K4me2 accumulation (Fig\u00a03B). Similar to what we observed previously for HSP22.0 (Fig\u00a01A), H3K4me2 at the 5\u2032\u2010region of HSP18.2 and APX2 was clearly enriched after ACC in wild type (Fig\u00a03B). Remarkably, this enrichment tended to increase during the course of the experiment and reached highest levels only at 28 or 52\u00a0h after ACC. For HSP70, H3K4me2 after ACC was not increased. At the APX2 locus, H3K4me2 enrichment was high and depended on HSFA2 at 28\u00a0h and 52\u00a0h. Similar results were obtained for HSP18.2 and HSP22.0. In contrast, H3K4me2 levels at HSP70 were not induced after ACC and this did not change in hsfa2. For all genes analyzed, no accumulation of H3K4me2 was observed at the intergenic region. In summary, H3K4me2 does not directly correlate with transcriptional activity. Instead, our findings support the notion that H3K4me2 acts as a mark of recent transcriptional activity in HS memory and that HSFA2 is required for the sustained accumulation of this mark.Lastly, we analyzed H3K9ac levels after ACC (Fig\u00a04). At HSP70, we observed enrichment at 4\u00a0h but not thereafter. This enrichment was not affected in hsfa2. At HSP18.2 and APX2, H3K9ac was enriched strongly at 4\u00a0h and weaker thereafter and the enrichment depended on HSFA2. At HSP22.0, sustained accumulation of H3K9ac depended on HSFA2 during the later time points (Figs\u00a01A and \u200band4).4). Thus, H3K9ac levels during HS memory largely follow transcriptional activity, however, at most HS memory\u2010related genes investigated, acetylation levels appear to decline earlier than transcription. In summary, especially for APX2 and HSP18.2, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 persist longer than H3K9ac after ACC.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Histone H3K9ac profiles after ACC in Col\u20100 and hsfa2 at HSP18.2,HSP22.0,HSP70, and APX2 as detected by ChIP\u2010qPCR\nCol\u20100 (blue bars) and hsfa2 (orange bars) seedlings were subjected to ACC or control treatment (NHS) 4\u00a0days after germination.

Error bars indicate SE.HSFA2 expression is induced by HS and peaks during the first day after HSFollowing ACC, HSFA2 transcript levels peaked at 4\u00a0h and declined rapidly thereafter (Fig\u00a0EV3A). This is in contrast to the expression, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 dynamics of the suspected target genes HSP18.2, HSP21, and HSP22.0, which all show more sustained changes (Fig\u00a02A). One possibility is that HSFA2 protein is much more stable than its transcripts. To investigate this, we created transgenic A.\u00a0thaliana plants expressing a fusion of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to the endogenous HSFA2 gene (pHSFA2::HSFA2\u2010YFP) in the hsfa2 background. The construct complemented the hsfa2 mutant as evidenced by complementation of the loss of HS memory phenotype (Fig\u00a0EV3B) and by restoration of HSFA2\u2010dependent protein levels after HS (Fig\u00a0EV3C). Immunoblotting with an anti\u2010GFP antibody indicated that HSFA2\u2010YFP levels peaked at 2\u20134\u00a0h after ACC (Fig\u00a0EV3D), thereby closely resembling the endogenous HSFA2 transcript levels (Fig\u00a0EV3A). In addition, we investigated the expression and localization of HSFA2\u2010YFP in the root tips of seedlings that were treated with ACC 3\u00a0days after germination (Fig\u00a0EV4). We observed a strong induction of HSFA2\u2010YFP after 1\u00a0h of 37\u00b0C that was maintained until 8\u00a0h after ACC. The HSFA2\u2010YFP signal was mostly nuclear. The next day, fluorescence levels were markedly decreased, similar to the signal in NHS seedlings (Fig\u00a0EV4H and I). The signal also appeared more diffuse with potentially a cytoplasmic component. These results corroborate the immunoblotting results and the endogenous transcript analysis and indicate that HSFA2 is a strongly heat\u2010inducible protein that peaks within hours after heat exposure and then rapidly decreases in abundance. Interestingly, these results suggest that by the time the effect of a loss of HSFA2 is apparent at the transcript and physiological levels, its protein levels are already much reduced.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3The pHSFA2::HSFA2\u2010YFP construct complements the hsfa2 phenotype\nTranscript levels of HSFA2 in Col\u20100 after ACC normalized to TUB6 and the corresponding NHS harvested at the same time point ([GENE OF INTERESTACC\nx h/TUB6ACC\n x h]/[GENE OF INTERESTNHS\n x h/TUB6NHS\n x h]).

HSF transcription factors are known to bind heat shock elements (HSE, 5\u2032\u2010 nnGnAnnTnCtn\u20103\u2032) (Nover et\u00a0al, 2001). We identified putative HSEs in the promoters of APX2, HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and HSP70 (Fig\u00a05, insets) (Schramm et\u00a0al, 2006; Jung et\u00a0al, 2013). We then performed ChIP at 0.5, 4, or 28\u00a0h after ACC or NHS. Besides regions containing HSEs, we assayed intergenic regions flanking each gene to estimate technical background (about three kb away, see legend of Fig\u00a05 for details). HSFA2\u2010YFP was enriched around the promoter\u2010proximal HSEs of HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2, compared to NHS control samples and to the intergenic regions not spanning an HSE (Fig\u00a05). This is consistent with the notion that HSFA2 directly regulates these HS memory\u2010related genes through binding of promoter\u2010proximal HSEs. We also found a slight enrichment of HSFA2\u2010YFP at HSE\u2010containing regions of HSP70 and ACT7 after ACC compared to NHS controls and regions not containing an HSE (Fig\u00a05D and E). Interestingly, at HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2, the strongest enrichment was observed 30\u00a0min after the end of the ACC treatment (Fig\u00a05A\u2013C). For HSP18.2, HSFA2 binding was already strongly decreased at 4\u00a0h after ACC, while the decrease was slower at HSP22.0 and APX2. At 28\u00a0h, HSFA2 binding was hardly detectable. Thus, HSFA2 binds to HSP18.2, HSP22.0, and APX2 directly and predominantly during the first few hours after ACC.Open in a separate windowFigure 5\nHSFA2 associates with HS memory\u2010related genes transiently after an acclimatizing HS\n\nA\u2013E Binding of HSFA2\u2010YFP to the promoter regions of HSP18.2 (A), HSP22.0 (B), APX2 (C), HSP70 (D), and ACTIN7 (E) was determined by ChIP\u2010qPCR. Quantifications represent the enrichment relative to input in %. Red\u2013orange\u2013yellow bars represent time points (0.5\u00a0h\u20134\u00a0h\u201328\u00a0h) after a ACC and gray bars represent the respective NHS control samples.

Regions are drawn to scale. Intergenic control region 1 is 4,610\u00a0bp (HSP18.2) and 4,192\u00a0bp (HSP70) downstream of the 3\u2032UTR and 2,570\u00a0bp (HSP22.0) or 3,123\u00a0bp (APX2) upstream of the TSS, respectively. One representative experiment out of at least four biological replicates is shown. Error bars are SD of three replicates.\nTranscriptional memory after recurring HS depends on HSFA2We next asked whether HSP18.2, HSP22.0, APX2, and HSP70 activation is modified upon a second HS 2\u00a0days after a primary HS. To this end, we revised the HS treatment so that each HS was for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. This shortened the duration of the HS treatment and allowed us to investigate (relatively) early time points after HS. In addition, this HS is not lethal even for non\u2010acclimatized seedlings, which facilitated interpretation of the results. HS was applied either 4\u00a0days after germination, 6\u00a0days after germination, or both 4 and 6\u00a0days after germination. Expression was monitored 1, 2, and 4\u00a0h after the end of the HS. For the treatment on day 4, transcript levels were analyzed also 28 and 52\u00a0h after the HS to allow estimation of transcript levels at the time of the second HS. Generally, we observed a similar HS\u2010dependent induction of expression compared to the ACC treatment, however with a more rapid decline of transcript levels (Fig\u00a06). For APX2, we observed a very strong hyper\u2010induction after repeated HS compared to the single HS on day 6 or on day 4 (Fig\u00a06A). For HSP22.0, we observed a trend for increased induction at 1\u00a0h after the repeated HS (day 4\u00a0+\u00a06), compared to seedlings that had received only the second (day 6) HS (Fig\u00a06C). For HSP18.2 and HSP70, the induction profiles were similar for all three treatments (HS on day 4, day 6, day 4\u00a0+\u00a06; Fig\u00a06B and D). Thus, APX2 and possibly HSP22.0 show transcriptional memory as the induction upon repeated HS is increased compared with the induction after either single HS. This transcriptional memory is active for at least 2\u00a0days, consistent with the maintenance of elevated H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at these loci. It was abolished in hsfa2 mutants, which induced expression of APX2 and HSP22.0 to the same level regardless if a single HS or a repeated HS was applied (Fig\u00a06A and C).Open in a separate windowFigure 6Expression profiles of HS memory\u2010related genes after a recurring HS show HSFA2\u2010dependent transcriptional memory\nA\u2013D Response of selected HS\u2010inducible loci upon recurring HS as determined by qRT\u2013PCR.

We observed hyper\u2010induction in plants that had received the ACC treatment 2\u00a0days before for APX2, HSP22.0, and HSP21, but not for HSP18.2 and HSP70 (Fig\u00a0EV5), thus confirming that APX2 and HSP22.0 show transcriptional memory after HS. The effect was reduced, but not fully abolished in HSFA2, suggesting that the stronger primary heat treatment (ACC) may trigger the activation of an additional factor acting redundantly with HSFA2. Taken together, we demonstrated transcriptional memory in response to HS for APX2 and HSP22.0 that correlated well with sustained H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. In addition, both processes required HSFA2.Open in a separate windowFigure EV5Expression profiles of HS memory\u2010related genes after an acclimatizing HS show HSFA2\u2010dependent transcriptional memory upon a recurring HS\n\nA\u2013E Response of selected HS\u2010inducible loci upon recurring HS after prior ACC or NHS as determined by qRT\u2013PCR.

In yeast, the mechanistic understanding of transcriptional memory is most advanced, and several non\u2010exclusive mechanisms have been proposed (Brickner et\u00a0al, 2007; Laine et\u00a0al, 2009; Tan\u2010Wong et\u00a0al, 2009; Light et\u00a0al, 2010, 2013). They involve a lasting modification of chromatin, either through histone modifications, histone variants, gene looping, or altered subnuclear localization of the memory loci. In plants, transcriptional memory is less well understood. It is increasingly recognized that plants can remember a past exposure to environmental stress and this may serve them to be better prepared for a future stress incident. In the case of HS, such a memory has been thoroughly characterized at the whole plant and molecular level (Charng et\u00a0al, 2006, 2007; Meiri & Breiman, 2009; Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a,b). While a number of reports have implicated epigenetic regulators in plant HS responses (Liu et\u00a0al, 2015), the involvement of chromatin modifications in HS memory was hitherto unknown. Here, we have shown that HS induces sustained accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at specific loci.\u00a0In particular, H3K4me2 peaks later than the corresponding transcript levels, hence marking these loci as recently transcriptionally active. We further demonstrated that increased H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 at some of these loci were associated with increased activation upon a recurring HS. Thus, the physiologically defined phenomenon of HS memory has a molecular correlate in the transcriptional memory at APX2 and HSP22.0. Moreover, both the transcriptional memory at these loci and the sustained H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 depend on an HSF transcription factor that transiently associates with these loci.Previously, transcriptional memory in response to drought stress was reported and this was associated with elevated H3K4me3 and Ser5P RNA polymerase II levels, suggesting stalling of RNA polymerase II (Ding et\u00a0al, 2012a). H3K4me2 was not investigated in this context. Interestingly, neither of the tested transcriptional regulators (ABA\u2010dependent transcription factors and the histone methyltransferase ATX1) was required for drought transcriptional memory (Ding et\u00a0al, 2012a). Here, we uncovered that HS memory is associated with elevated H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor that is required for both, hyper\u2010methylation of H3K4 and transcriptional memory at APX2 and HSP22.0, providing a molecular framework for HS memory in plants. During HS memory, H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 both accumulate strongly and especially during the later stages (28, 52\u00a0h) at HS memory\u2010related genes. In contrast, the HS\u2010inducible non\u2010memory locus HSP70 accumulates at 4 and 28\u00a0h moderate levels of H3K4me3 but no H3K4me2, despite strong transcriptional activation. The accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 is particularly high and long\u2010lasting at APX2 and HSP22.0. It is somewhat lower at HSP18.2. Interestingly, this appears to correlate with the strength of transcriptional memory upon recurring HS, being most pronounced for APX2, somewhat weaker for HSP22.0 and undetectable for HSP18.2 and HSP70. These findings are in line with the notion that H3K4me3 and/or H3K4me2 act as a mark of recent transcriptional activity (Ng et\u00a0al, 2003; Guenther et\u00a0al, 2007; Light et\u00a0al, 2013). Interestingly, H3K4me2 appeared to peak even later than H3K4me3, suggesting that both marks may have slightly different functions. This is in line with genome\u2010wide ChIP\u2010chip experiments in A.\u00a0thaliana that found a good correlation of active transcription with H3K4me3, but not H3K4me2 (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2009). Thus, H3K4me2 may convey a more sustained mark of recent transcriptional activity than H3K4me3. However, experiments that specifically modify one but not the other H3K4 methylation mark will be required to disentangle the functions of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. Also, it remains to be investigated whether the sustained accumulation of H3K4 methylation is caused by sustained methylation, reduced demethylation, or reduced nucleosome replacement.The responses of plants to chronic or recurring stress are not well understood, despite their economic and ecological relevance. HSFA2 is a master regulator of the HSF signaling network involved in cellular responses to various types of environmental stress. HSFA2 is induced not only upon HS, but also upon drought stress, osmotic stress, salt stress, high light, and hypoxia (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006; Ogawa et\u00a0al, 2007; Banti et\u00a0al, 2010; Liu et\u00a0al, 2011; Jung et\u00a0al, 2013). HSFA2 expression is activated by HSFA1 isoforms (Liu et\u00a0al, 2011; Nishizawa\u2010Yokoi et\u00a0al, 2011). Constitutive overexpression of HSFA2 enhances heat, salt, and osmotic stress tolerance (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006; Ogawa et\u00a0al, 2007). Several putative target genes of HSFA2 were identified based on differential gene expression, in\u00a0vitro binding studies and transient protoplast reporter assays (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006; Schramm et\u00a0al, 2006). Here, we showed direct binding of HSFA2 to putative target genes using ChIP in A.\u00a0thaliana, thereby confirming earlier predictions. Unexpectedly, HSFA2 was associated with its target genes most highly as early as 30\u00a0min after ACC. In contrast, gene expression studies and physiological analyses indicate that HSFA2 is specifically required for the maintenance of acquired thermotolerance and not its induction (this study and (Charng et\u00a0al, 2007)). Accordingly, for HSP18.2 and HSP22.0 expression, the strongest effect in hsfa2 was observed only 1\u20132\u00a0days after ACC, but was weak or undetectable 4\u00a0h after ACC (Fig\u00a02). Notably, even at 4\u00a0h after ACC, binding of HSFA2 at HSP18.2 and APX2 was already reduced compared to 0.5\u00a0h after ACC. For APX2, the analysis of unspliced transcript levels indicated that transcription was elevated until at least 52\u00a0h after ACC. Also, transcriptional activity was lower in hsfa2 throughout the experiment (at 4, 28, and 52\u00a0h after ACC). The initial induction of the HS memory\u2010related genes is mediated by isoforms of HSFA1 (HSFA1a, HSFA1b, HSF1d, HSFA1e) that also induce HSFA2 expression (Liu et\u00a0al, 2011). In contrast to HSFA2, HSFA1 isoforms are constitutively expressed and rapidly activated upon HS. As overexpression of HSFA2 constitutively activates its target genes (Nishizawa et\u00a0al, 2006), it can be assumed that this sequence of events (HSFA1 acting before HSFA2) is primarily caused by the absence of HSFA2 protein upon the first response to HS rather than the inability of HSFA2 to induce inactive target genes.The binding kinetics of HSFA2 and the expression kinetics of its\u00a0target genes suggest that HSFA2 may act according to the \u201chit\u2010and\u2010run\u201d model for transcription factors. This model was first proposed several decades ago (Schaffner, 1988) and has recently received experimental support with the development of better spatial and temporal resolution of binding studies (Para et\u00a0al, 2014; Charoensawan et\u00a0al, 2015). According to this model, transcription factors bind transiently to their targets, even when activating lasting gene expression. This may be achieved by recruiting sequence\u2010specific or general transcriptional activators that induce lasting gene expression. Thus, our findings suggest that HSFA2 recruits (directly or indirectly) chromatin\u2010modifying factors such as H3K4 histone methyltransferases to memory loci to mediate their sustained induction and hyper\u2010inducibility upon a recurring HS (Fig\u00a07). The model is supported by our finding that HSFA2 is required for sustained accumulation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. Direct interaction of sequence\u2010specific transcription factors with the H3K4 methyltransferase Set1\u2010containing COMPASS complex has been described in several organisms including plants (Ruthenburg et\u00a0al, 2007; Bertero et\u00a0al, 2015; Song et\u00a0al, 2015). A. thaliana contains up to ten histone\u00a0H3K4 methyltransferases that are related to yeast Set1. Further studies will be required to identify the interacting proteins recruited by HSFA2. The lack of sustained activation and H3K4 hyper\u2010methylation in hsfa2 mutants and at HSFA2\u2010independent loci such as HSP70 suggests that such interacting proteins may be specifically recruited by HSFA2, but not by HSFA1 isoforms.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Transient binding of HSFA2 governs sustained H3K4 methylation after HS\nTop panel: Transient binding of HSFA2 after HS induces sustained induction of H3K4me2 (light blue) and H3K4me3 (dark blue) through direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin\u2010modifying factors. H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 levels remain elevated after H3K9ac (orange) and HSFA2 binding (red) have decreased and hence mark recent transcriptional activity of the locus, leading to sustained induction and transcriptional memory upon recurring stress. Bottom panel: In hsfa2, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 remain low, while the H3K9ac levels are only slightly changed compared to wild type. Profiles were drawn based on the data obtained for the APX2 locus.In summary, we have identified transcriptional memory in response to HS and show that this is associated with elevated H3K4 methylation levels and dependent on a HSF transcription factor that transiently binds these loci. Similarly, sustained activation of HS memory loci requires HSFA2 and is associated with high levels of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2. Our findings have implications for the engineering of heat\u2010resistant plants and for the basic research question how stress memory and transcriptional memory are realized mechanistically. Materials and MethodsPlant material and growth conditions\nArabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col\u20100) seedlings were grown on GM medium (1% [w/v] glucose) under a 16\u2010h/8\u2010h light/dark cycle at 23\u00b0C/21\u00b0C. The hsfa2\u20101 allele (Charng et\u00a0al, 2007) was obtained from the Nottingham Stock Centre (SALK_008978). Seeds were stratified for 5\u00a0days at 4\u00b0C in darkness. Heat treatments were performed on 4\u2010day\u2010old seedlings unless stated otherwise. For expression analyses, ChIP experiments, and protein extraction, seedlings were treated with an acclimatizing HS (ACC) of 37\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min, 23\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min, and 44\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min starting 8\u00a0h after light onset. After HS, plants were returned to normal growth conditions. For the repeated HS experiment, each HS was 60\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C on the indicated days unless otherwise stated. Maintenance of acquired thermotolerance assays were performed as described (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). Accession numbers of the genes studied were HSP18.2 (At5g59720), HSP21 (At4g27670), HSP22.0 (At4g10250), HSP70 (At3g12580), HSP101 (At1g74310), APX2 (At3g09640), HSFA2 (At2g26150), ACT7 (At5g09810), and TUB6 (At5g12250).Construction of pHSFA2::HSFA2\u2010YFP\nTo generate pHSFA2::HSFA2\u2010venusYFP, a 2.8\u2010kb fragment encompassing the promoter and coding sequence of HSFA2 was amplified from genomic DNA mutating the stop codon (Hsfa2 5\u2010FSalI GTCGACGGACTCTGCGAGCAAAGCTAC, Hsfa2 5\u2010RnostpSmaI CC CGG GGA AGG TTCCGAACCAAGAAAACCC) and fused to venusYFP. A 0.7\u2010kb fragment containing the 3\u2032UTR and further sequences (Hsfa2 3\u2010FSacI GAGCTCTATACGGTATTAACACATCTACTTG, Hsfa2 3\u2010RERI GAATTCCTTATAGTTACGTGTTGTGTTGT) was added. The resulting pHSFA2::HSFA2\u2010YFP construct was transformed into hsfa2\u20101.Chromatin immunoprecipitationSeedlings were harvested and cross\u2010linked under vacuum in ice\u2010cold MC buffer/1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Kaufmann et\u00a0al, 2010) for 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min or 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0min for histone ChIP or HSFA2\u2010YFPChIP, respectively. Chromatin was extracted as described (Kaufmann et\u00a0al, 2010). Chromatin was sonified using a Diagenode Bioruptor (18 cycles/30 sec on/off) on low intensity settings. For histone ChIP, equal amounts of chromatin from the same preparation were immunoprecipitated at 4\u00b0C over night using antibodies against H3\u00a0(Abcam, ab1791), H3K4me2 (Millipore, 07\u2010030), H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580), or H3K9ac (Abcam, ab10814). For HSFA2\u2010YFP\u2010ChIP, chromatin was incubated with \u03b1\u2010GFP paramagnetic beads for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C and chromatin was recovered using a GFP isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by qPCR (LightCycler480, Roche). Primers used are listed in Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S1.Protein extraction and immunoblottingTotal protein was extracted from seedlings using extraction buffer (50\u00a0mM Bis\u2013Tris, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5\u00a0mM DTT, 1% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, complete Mini Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)). One microgram of protein was loaded per lane and separated on either 12% (for HSP101 and HSFA2\u2010YFP) or 14% (for HSP17.6, HSP17.7, and HSP21) SDS\u2013PAGE gels. For immuno\u2010detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: \u03b1\u2010GFP (Abcam, ab290), \u03b1\u2010tubulin (Sigma, T5168), \u03b1\u2010HSP21, \u03b1\u2010HSP101 (Agrisera, AS08285, AS07253). Secondary antibodies (goat\u2010\u03b1\u2010mouse\u2010IRdye 800CW, #926\u201032210, goat\u2010\u03b1\u2010rabbit\u2010IRdye 800CW, #926\u201032211, LICOR) were used for infrared detection.RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT\u2013PCRRNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT\u2013PCR were done as described previously (Stief et\u00a0al, 2014a). All data were normalized to TUB6 using the comparative CT method. Data for Fig\u00a02 was further normalized to NHS control ([GENE OF INTERESTACC x h/TUB6ACC x h]/[GENE OF INTERESTNHS x h/TUB6NHS x h]) before averaging. For statistical analysis, unpaired Student's t\u2010test was used as indicated. Primer sequences are listed in Appendix Table\u00a0S1.MicroscopyTransgenic or wild\u2010type seedlings grown and treated as described above were imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.
