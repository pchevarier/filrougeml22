In D.\u00a0melanogaster, piRNAs are transcribed from a small number of genomic clusters to produce >\u00a010\u00a0kb long piRNA precursors. piRNA precursors are then processed by nuclease activities into 27\u201335 nucleotide long primary piRNAs. Upon detection of transposable element transcripts, piRNAs initiate a cycle of coupled cleavage reactions involving transposable element mRNAs and piRNA precursor RNAs. This coupling is known as the Ping\u2010pong cycle, which allows amplification of piRNA populations while simultaneously degrading TE mRNAs (Brennecke et al, 2007; Gunawardane et al, 2007).\nCaenorhabditis elegans piRNAs present remarkable differences to the Drosophila system. Mature piRNAs in C.\u00a0elegans are 21 nucleotides long with a strong bias towards uracil as the first nucleotide (21U\u2010RNAs; (Ruby et al, 2006; Batista et al, 2008; Das et al, 2008)). Caenorhabditis elegans piRNA loci are individual transcriptional units. The majority of piRNA loci localize to two ~3\u00a0Mb cluster regions on chromosome IV containing more than 15,000 loci and are demarcated by a conserved GTTTC motif at their promoter regions (Ruby et al, 2006; Billi et al, 2013); these loci are known as motif\u2010dependent piRNAs or type I piRNAs. Another set of low\u2010abundance piRNAs are generated from almost 10,000 loci distributed across the C.\u00a0elegans genome and independently of an upstream motif; these are known as motif\u2010independent piRNAs (Gu et al, 2012) or type II piRNAs. Both types of loci are transcribed as short 27\u201040 nt capped RNA precursors by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Gu et al, 2012). These short precursors have been proposed to result from pausing of Pol II at piRNA promoters (Gu et al, 2012; Beltran et al, 2019). We previously described a region of low melting temperature (high AT content) centred 33 nt downstream of piRNA TSSs across multiple nematode species, which may have a role in RNA polymerase II termination (Beltran et al, 2019). However, the exact mechanisms controlling this process are largely unknown. In particular, the role of Pol II\u2010associated factors in promoting pausing and premature termination of Pol II remain unexplored.Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the mechanisms of piRNA transcription in nematodes evolved by co\u2010option of factors controlling the transcription of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). First, transcription of piRNAs requires the small nuclear RNA activating protein complex SNAPc (Kasper et al, 2014). SNAPc forms a distinct complex in the germline with the nematode\u2010specific pseudokinase PRDE\u20101 (Kasper et al, 2014; Weick et al, 2014; Weng et al, 2019), which binds to the upstream Ruby motif directly (Weng et al, 2019). In addition, the GTTTC motif is found in snRNA promoters in basal nematodes (Beltran et al, 2019). Transport of piRNA precursors to their processing sites in perinuclear phase\u2010separated P\u2010granules is achieved by a specialized protein complex named PETISCO/PICS (Cordeiro Rodrigues et al, 2019; Zeng et al, 2019). Interestingly, components of this complex are required for the biogenesis of SL1 RNAs, the trans\u2010splicing leaders preceding the majority of C.elegans mRNAs, which are also related to snRNAs (Cordeiro Rodrigues et al, 2019). Altogether, these observations suggest that snRNAs and piRNAs share mechanisms of transcription and processing.In metazoans, termination of snRNA genes requires the Integrator complex (Baillat et al, 2005). Integrator is a protein complex containing 12\u201314 subunits, which associates co\u2010transcriptionally with the carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. Two of the subunits of the complex, Ints\u20109 and Ints\u201011, are homologs of CPSF73, the catalytically active subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPSF) responsible for the formation of 3\u00b4 ends of protein\u2010coding gene mRNAs. Ints\u201011 possesses the endonuclease activity responsible for cleavage of nascent snRNAs to generate snRNA 3\u2019 ends. This cleavage is coupled to Pol II termination.While the best described function for Integrator is at snRNA loci, Integrator may also have functions in transcription of other Pol II\u2010dependent transcripts. Integrator was shown to promote early termination of Pol II at the HIV LTR promoter, attenuating HIV transcription (Stadelmayer et al, 2014). A role for Integrator in conferring processivity to Pol II during the elongation stage of transcription has also been reported (Gardini et al, 2014; Stadelmayer et al, 2014). Additionally, Integrator mediates the biogenesis of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) by promoting early termination of Pol II (Lai et al, 2015). Finally, Integrator has been proposed to terminate lncRNA transcription (Nojima et al, 2018).Here, we discover that the Integrator complex is involved in piRNA biogenesis in nematodes. We show that Integrator activity is required for accumulation of mature piRNAs and their silencing activity. Integrator associates with piRNA clusters in germ cells, and its catalytic activity is essential to produce short\u2010capped RNA precursors via co\u2010transcriptional cleavage of nascent piRNA precursors. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of piRNA biogenesis in nematodes and uncover novel functions of the Integrator complex in the regulation of promoter\u2010proximal Pol II pausing and the biogenesis of non\u2010coding RNAs. ResultsIntegrator is required for the biogenesis of short piRNA precursorsPrompted by the evolutionary relationship between piRNAs and snRNAs (Beltran et al, 2019), we sought to understand whether Integrator is involved in piRNA biogenesis in C.\u00a0elegans. We performed RNAi against the catalytic subunit of the complex, ints\u201011 and measured changes in piRNA abundance upon knock\u2010down by sequencing small RNAs. We observed a decrease in total piRNA abundance in ints\u201011\u2010depleted worms compared with the empty vector (EV) controls (Figs\u00a01A and EV1A\u2013C). These differences were also observed when comparing the piRNA abundance at each locus between EV and ints\u201011 RNAi\u2010treated animals (Fig\u00a01B). Additionally, we assessed the silencing activity of piRNAs using a strain carrying a germline histone H2B::GFP transgene as a sensor of piRNA activity (Bagijn et al, 2012). Upon knock\u2010down of ints\u201011, we observed an increase in the proportion of GFP\u2010positive animals (Fig\u00a0EV1D). Together these results suggested that Integrator functions in piRNA biogenesis.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Integrator is required for motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursor abundance and their short length\nAAverage mature piRNA abundance relative to EV in EV and ints\u201011 RNAi samples normalized using miRNA\u2010derived size factors.

Upon knock\u2010down of ints\u201011, we observed a decrease in piRNA precursors from piRNA loci with the characteristic GTTTC core (Ruby) motif (motif\u2010dependent piRNAs; Figs\u00a01C and D, and EV1E). We also observed a marked increase in motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursor length upon Integrator depletion (Fig\u00a0EV1E). To characterize the length distribution of piRNA precursors in greater detail, we performed high\u2010throughput sequencing of capped RNAs up to a length of 75 nt. The previously described peak of ~28 nt piRNA precursors (Weick et al, 2014) was accompanied by an additional population of longer precursors up to ~75 nt long (Fig\u00a01E and F). This population was rare in wild\u2010type nematodes, but accumulated substantially upon ints\u201011 depletion (Fig\u00a01E and F). The increase in precursor length observed from the overall distributions was confirmed by comparing the difference in length at each locus between ints\u201011 RNAi and EV controls (Fig EV1F and G).Altogether, these data strongly suggest a role for Integrator in the termination of short motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursor transcripts. Interestingly, we did not detect a decrease in abundance of motif\u2010independent piRNA precursors, suggesting that their biogenesis may not depend on Integrator (Fig\u00a0EV1H).Integrator localizes to sites of piRNA biogenesis in germ cellsWe next investigated whether Integrator is recruited to sites of piRNA biogenesis. We used a strain where an endogenous deletion (tm1616) in the ints\u20106 Integrator subunit, also known as dic\u20101 in C.\u00a0elegans, is rescued by an ints\u20106::3xFLAG::eGFP fusion transgene (G\u00f3mez\u2010Orte et. al., 2019). INTS\u20106::eGFP formed discrete foci in germ nuclei (Fig\u00a02A), which start to form in the mitotic and transition zone regions of the germline and become most apparent in early\u2010mid pachytene. To test whether these foci correspond to piRNA cluster regions, we crossed this strain with one carrying an mCherry\u2010tagged version of the piRNA biogenesis factor PRDE\u20101, which is known to bind to piRNA clusters (Weick et al, 2014; Weng et al, 2019). The majority of mCherry::PRDE\u20101 foci co\u2010localized with INTS\u20106::eGFP foci across the germline (Fig\u00a02B, quantification in Appendix Fig\u00a0S1A). We observed a second population of INTS\u20106 foci appearing as cells progress into pachytene (Fig\u00a02A), with mid\u2010pachytene cells showing two clear INTS\u20106 foci, one of which co\u2010localizes with PRDE\u20101 (Fig\u00a02B, panels 2\u20133). Towards the end of pachytene, PRDE\u20101 foci became more diffuse and start to disappear, and INTS\u20106 signal in PRDE\u20101 regions was clearly reduced, resulting in no co\u2010localizing foci (Fig\u00a02B, panel 4). Interestingly, however, a single INTS\u20106 focus remained in late\u2010pachytene cells well after the disappearance of PRDE\u20101 foci (Fig\u00a02B, panel 5). In order to further confirm these observations, we used CRISPR\u2010mediated genome editing to tag the endogenous INTS\u201011 protein with an N\u2010terminal FLAG tag and tested its localization by immunofluorescent staining. FLAG::INTS\u201011 also co\u2010localized with PRDE\u20101 foci in germ cells (Appendix Fig\u00a0S1B).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Integrator localizes to sites of piRNA biogenesis in germ cells\nLive imag\u00a0ng of a rescue transgene expressing an eGFP\u2010tagged version of Integrator subunit 6 (INTS\u20106) in the germline of C.\u00a0elegans.

PRDE\u20101 and INTS\u20106 co\u2010localize in early stages of meiosis (1,2) and up to mid\u2010pachytene (3), where an additional INTS\u20106 focus appears (3). When PRDE\u20101 foci are about to disappear, co\u2010localization is lost (4), and the additional INTS\u20106 focus remains present well after the loss of PRDE\u20101 foci (5).\nChromatin fractionation reveals two distinct populations of nascent piRNA precursorsWe recently described a sequence signature of increased AT content downstream of motif\u2010dependent 21U\u2010RNAs resulting in a low melting temperature region (hereforth referred to as \u201ctermination signal\u201d) (Beltran et al, 2019). We showed that the strength of this signal correlates with the length of motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursors and suggested that it contributes to termination by promoting pausing of early elongating Pol II due to the low stability of the AT\u2010rich nascent RNA\u2010DNA hybrid. We also showed that the elongation factor TFIIS, which is involved in the rescue of backtracked Pol II complexes, is required for efficient motif\u2010dependent piRNA biogenesis (Beltran et al, 2019). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that Integrator might function in motif\u2010dependent piRNA biogenesis by processing nascent RNA associated with promoter\u2010proximal Pol II, terminating transcription.To test this model, we fractionated purified germ nuclei (Han et al, 2019) into chromatin bound and nucleoplasmic fractions and generated short\u2010capped RNA libraries up to an insert size of 75\u00a0bp. This allowed us to distinguish chromatin\u2010bound nascent piRNA precursor transcripts and nucleoplasmic precursors released from chromatin (Fig\u00a03A). Importantly, as chromatin\u2010bound precursors are predicted to be associated with transcribing Pol II, they report on the position of Pol II at piRNA loci, whereas nucleoplasmic precursors have already been released from the piRNA locus. Consistently, we observed longer precursors in the chromatin\u2010bound fraction compared with nucleoplasm (Appendix Fig\u00a0S2A and B).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Chromatin fractionation identifies nascent piRNA precursors\nAExperimental design. Germ nuclei isolated from empty vector or ints\u201011 RNAi\u2010treated nematodes were fractionated into chromatin\u2010bound and nucleoplasmic fractions.

Significance for each distribution to be different from no change was tested using a two\u2010tailed paired Wilcoxon rank\u2010sum test, with all p\u2010values <\u00a02.2e\u201016.

The length distributions were calculated from two merged replicates (see Appendix Fig\u00a0S2 for the length distributions in each replicate).F, GDistribution of the position of the ~28 nt (F) and ~48 nt (G) nascent RNA peaks in 2,000 bootstrapped subsamples of 3,000 precursors. Sampling probability was weighted by precursor abundance.\nIn wild\u2010type animals, the total length distribution of chromatin bound nascent RNA initiating at piRNA promoters followed a bimodal distribution, with a major peak at ~28 nt and a less abundant peak at ~48 nt. The ~48 nt peak was not present in nucleoplasmic RNA (Fig\u00a03B). Weaker termination signals (lower AT content) downstream of the 21U\u2010RNA locus were associated with a larger proportion of sequences mapping to the 48 nt peak (Fig\u00a03C). Upon ints\u201011 knock\u2010down, we observed a decrease in nucleoplasmic and chromatin\u2010bound precursor levels (Fig\u00a03D), and an increase in length in both fractions (Fig\u00a03E, Appendix Fig\u00a0S3B). Mutation of C.\u00a0elegans TFIIS (T24H10.1) led to a decrease in nucleoplasmic precursor levels and an increase in their length (Fig\u00a03D and E, Appendix Fig\u00a0S2B). However, chromatin\u2010bound precursors had increased levels in tfiis mutants and showed an accumulation of nascent RNAs at the ~48 nt peak, suggesting that TFIIS activity is important for termination of Pol II at the 48 nt peak. Knock\u2010down of ints\u201011 in tfiis mutants led to a further increase in precursor length in both nucleoplasmic and nascent fractions (Fig\u00a03E). The peak at 28 nt was also reduced relative to tfiis mutants, suggesting that the combined effect of loss of TFIIS and reduced Integrator activity interferes with initiation of transcription. This may result from torsional stress or spatial constraints resulting from the accumulation of Pol II at the 3\u00b4 end of the piRNA locus. Interestingly, the position of both nascent RNA peaks was shifted in tfiis mutants, from 27 to 29\u201330 nt and from 47\u201048 to 51 nt. These shifts were also seen when comparing ints\u201011 knock\u2010down in wild\u2010type and ints\u201011 knock\u2010down in tfiis mutant animals (Fig\u00a03E\u2013G). These peak shifts are likely to result from reduced efficiency of cleavage of the 3\u2032 end of nascent RNAs by Pol II in tfiis mutants after pausing and backtracking, suggesting that both peaks indeed correspond to Pol II pause sites on chromatin.To support these observations at a locus\u2010specific level, we calculated the mean length changes for all loci (Fig\u00a0EV2A) and plotted the lengths of all detectable precursor sequences in each locus as a heat map (Fig\u00a0EV2B). In addition, we plotted chromatin\u2010bound precursor length heat maps across bins of increasing pausing strength (Fig\u00a0EV3). In EV controls, loci with weak pausing signals generally had both ~20\u201330 nt and ~40\u201350 nt long chromatin bound RNAs, indicating that both types of pausing events could occur at the same locus. However, at loci with strong pausing signals, a larger proportion of loci exhibited only ~20\u201330 nt chromatin\u2010bound precursors. Similar trends were observed in ints\u201011 RNAi\u2010treated wild\u2010type animals, and in tfiis mutants.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Locus\u2010by\u2010locus analysis of piRNA precursor length\nDistributions of mean length changes in precursor length in a locus\u2010by\u2010locus basis (see Materials and Methods).

The paused polymerase could be resolved either through release from DNA, resulting in release of a ~28 nt piRNA precursor, or by Pol II resuming before arresting again ~48 nt downstream of the TSS. Since short ~28 nt nascent RNAs are contained within the polymerase, termination of Pol II at the ~28 nt peak to generate 28 nt precursors would be independent of Integrator. Termination at the ~48 nt peak, in contrast, would result from Integrator cleavage, as piRNA precursors at this stage are sufficiently long to be processed by the endonuclease activity of ints\u201011 at the 5\u2032 side of paused Pol II. Thus, we hypothesized that termination of the 48 nt peak would be dependent on the Integrator complex. This model would account for the increased proportion of ~48 nt nascent RNAs upon Integrator knock\u2010down, and the small but consistent 3\u2032 shift in the position of the two peaks in the absence of TFIIS.To test this model, we searched for cleavage products with a 5\u2032 monophosphate that might result from Integrator cleavage of nascent RNA (Fig\u00a04A). We observed a population of 5\u2032 monophosphate fragments with 5\u2032 ends peaking at +38 nt of piRNA TSSs, which we designated as putative cleavage products (Fig\u00a04B). ints\u201011 knock\u2010down resulted in a clear decrease in cleavage products (Fig\u00a04B and C, Appendix Fig\u00a0S3A and B), suggesting that these result from Integrator cleavage. These fragments had a median length of 20 nt (Fig\u00a04D). Further, the 30\u2032 position of cleavage fragments was centred 58 nt downstream of piRNA TSSs (Appendix Fig\u00a0S3C). This implies that at the point at which cleavage occurs, Pol II has transcribed approximately 10 nt past the +48 pause site. The lack of a defined +58 peak of chromatin\u2010bound RNAs (Fig\u00a03E) implies that Pol II is rapidly terminated at this point. The tfiis mutation alone also resulted in a reduction in Integrator cleavage products (Fig\u00a04B and C, Appendix Fg\u00a0S3A and B). This indicates that TFIIS activity is important for Integrator\u2010mediated processing of nascent RNAs, by promoting Pol II transcription through the +48 pause site. This model is consistent with the accumulation of ~48 nt nascent precursors in tfiis mutants (Fig\u00a03D and E). Similarly, ints\u201011 knock\u2010down in a tfiis background resulted in a reduction in cleavage products (Fig\u00a04B and C, Appendix Fig\u00a0S3A and B).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Integrator\u2010mediated cleavage of nascent piRNA precursors generates short\u2010capped RNAs\nModel for Integrator cleavage of nascent piRNA precursors associated with promoter\u2010proximal Pol II.

The data shown here correspond to one of two N2 EV replicates, see Appendix Fig\u00a0S6 for this analysis across replicates and genotypes.\nAn important test of our model is that stronger AT\u2010rich signals would result in reduced reliance on Integrator cleavage due to a larger proportion of termination events happening at the 28 nt peak. In support of this, loci with stronger AT\u2010rich signals tended to have reduced abundance of cleavage products (Fig\u00a04E, Appendix Fig\u00a0S3D). These data suggest that the AT\u2010rich signal affects pausing and progression of Pol II to the 48 nt peak, and not Integrator processing efficiency. Consistently, the differences in nascent piRNA precursor length between loci with strong and weak termination signals were still present upon knock\u2010down of ints\u201011, suggesting that ints\u201011 does not mediate the effect of the termination signal (Appendix Fig\u00a0S4).We wondered whether we could find any evidence of additional trimming of Integrator\u2010released precursors. To test this, we categorized loci in bins according to the median length of their chromatin\u2010bound precursors and examined the distributions of nucleoplasmic precursor length across these bins (Appendix Fig\u00a0S5). This analysis showed that even loci with a large fraction of long chromatin\u2010bound precursors (>\u00a038 nt) produce nucleoplasmic precursors with a median length <\u00a030 nt (Appendix Fig S5).This implies that RNA released from chromatin upon Integrator cleavage may be further trimmed to 28 nt in the nucleoplasm before further maturation to mature piRNAs.Pol II elongation control is independent of Integrator activity at the majority of piRNA lociHaving established that Integrator cleaves nascent piRNA precursors associated with paused Pol II, we set out to test whether Integrator acts to prevent further Pol II elongation beyond the second pause site at 48 nt downstream of the piRNA TSS. To investigate this, we performed super low\u2010input carrier CAGE (Cvetesic et al, 2018) using chromatin\u2010bound RNA as input material and subjected the libraries to paired\u2010end sequencing. This approach captures 5\u2032 ends of nascent long (>200 nt) capped RNAs, allowing us to identify putative piRNA precursor initiating 2 nt upstream of 21U\u2010RNAs. Paired\u2010end sequencing allowed us to obtain lower\u2010bound estimates of their length from the position of the 3\u00b4 end of the fragments generated through random priming.Nascent RNA libraries had much higher intron retention rates than a total RNA control (Fig EV4A and B), validating that chromatin fractionation captures nascent RNAs. Across samples, we observed an enrichment of unique CAGE tags initiating 2 nt upstream of motif\u2010dependent 21U\u2010RNAs corresponding to 659 loci in total (3.64% of Ruby motif\u2010dependent piRNAs, Figs \u200bFigs5A5A and EV4C). These transcripts were found at low levels in N2 EV controls, as well as in tfiis mutants; however, ints\u201011 knock\u2010down led to an increase in their abundance (Fig\u00a05B and C), both in an N2 background (2.83 median fold increase), and a tfiis background (22.62 median fold increase) (Fig\u00a05B). Importantly, this effect was highly specific for CAGE reads initiating 2 nt upstream of piRNAs (Fig\u00a05C), confirming that this signal captures transcription from piRNA promoters. These transcripts peaked at a length of ~400\u2013500 nt (Fig\u00a05D), similarly to the library insert size, suggesting that this is a lower\u2010bound estimate of their length. Thus, ints\u201011 knock\u2010down leads to an increase in readthrough transcription at piRNA loci.Open in a separate windowFigure EV4Nascent SLIC\u2010CAGE detects readthrough transcription from piRNA loci (relates to Fig\u00a05)\nAClustered correlation matrix of promoter\u2010mapping CAGE tpms for the top 1,000 genes with the highest CAGE signal.BIntron retention ratio distributions across nascent RNA samples, and in a total RNA control, estimated through IRFinder analysis.C, DTotal raw CAGE tags mapping between \u221210 and \u22121 nucleotide positions upstream of motif\u2010dependent piRNAs (C) and motif\u2010independent piRNAs (D).ETotal unique CAGE\u2010detected TSSs mapping between \u221210 and \u22121 nucleotide positions upstream of motif\u2010independent piRNAs.FMean normalized expression levels of CAGE\u2010detected and non\u2010detected motif\u2010dependent piRNAs at the short\u2010capped RNA level.GDownsampling analysis of CAGE libraries showing that the detection of piRNA loci is saturated with sequencing depth.

Boxplots show the interquartile range with a line at the median; the whiskers extend to the greatest point no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range.\nLong capped RNAs initiating 2 nt upstream of motif\u2010independent piRNAs were much more abundant, with 4,437 motif\u2010independent piRNA loci producing detectable long capped RNAs (45% of motif\u2010independent loci) (Figs \u200b(Figs5E5E and EV4D and E). Their abundance, however, was slightly reduced upon Integrator knock\u2010down, in contrast to motif\u2010dependent piRNAs (Fig\u00a05F).Despite the clear increase in readthrough transcription at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci upon ints\u201011 knock\u2010down relative to WT, we still only detected such events at a minority of loci (3.64%). This observation is not likely to result from low sensitivity of CAGE since the levels of short piRNA precursors are not significantly different between CAGE\u2010detected and undetected piRNAs (Fig\u00a0EV4F); and the number of detected motif\u2010dependent piRNAs is saturated at the sequencing depth we obtained for our CAGE libraries (Fig\u00a0EV4G). In order to better understand the factors influencing Pol II promoter escape at piRNA loci, we examined chromatin accessibility (J\u00e4nes et al, 2018) and germline H3K27ac levels (Han et al, 2019) at piRNA promoters. Motif\u2010dependent piRNA promoters showed extremely low accessibility levels below genome\u2010wide average (Fig\u00a0EV5A); however, a clear increase in ATAC signal is observed around piRNA TSSs when comparing wild\u2010type adult worms to glp\u20101 mutants lacking a germline (1.5\u2010fold mean fold increase) (Fig\u00a0EV5B). Motif\u2010independent piRNAs, in contrast, showed on average 10 times higher accessibility than genome\u2010wide average, both in wild\u2010type and glp\u20101 nematodes (Fig\u00a0EV5A and \u200bandB).B). Both types of piRNA loci also showed clear differences in the levels of H3K27ac: motif\u2010dependent loci showed extremely low levels, while motif\u2010independent loci were highly enriched; this enrichment was especially high in the germline (Fig\u00a0EV5C). The subset of motif\u2010dependent piRNA promoters that were detected by CAGE tended to have slightly higher levels of H3K27ac and accessibility, but these are still very low relative to motif\u2010independent loci (Fig\u00a0EV5D and \u200bandE).E). We thus conclude that the differences in read through transcription between motif\u2010dependent and motif\u2010independent piRNA promoters correlate with chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac status.Open in a separate windowFigure EV5Accessibility and H3K27 acetylation levels at piRNA promoters (relates to Fig\u00a05)\nAATAC\u2010seq read coverage around motif\u2010dependent and motif\u2010independent piRNA promoters, in wild\u2010type young adult wild\u2010type worms, and in day 1 adult germlineless glp\u20101 mutant worms lacking a germline. \u201cMotif\u2010dependent CAGE\u201d refers to motif\u2010dependent loci detected by CAGE.BLog2 ratio in accessibility signal at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci between young adult wild\u2010type worms and day 1 adult germlineless glp\u20101 mutants lacking a germline.

This is in accordance with previous analyses of the effect of ints\u201011 knock\u2010down on sRNA transcription, which has been described to result in fusion transcripts with downstream protein\u2010coding genes (G\u00f3mez\u2010Orte et al, 2019).Open in a separate windowFigure 6Model for the role of Integrator in piRNA transcription terminationAt snRNA loci, Integrator generates snRNA 3\u2032 ends leading to Pol II termination. ints\u201011 knock\u2010down results in readthrough past termination sites and polyadenylation of snRNA transcripts. At motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci, Pol II pauses\u00a0~\u00a028 nt and\u00a0~\u00a048 nt downstream of piRNA TSSs. ~28 nt short\u2010capped RNAs may be generated via direct dissociation of Pol II from chromatin at the\u00a0~\u00a028 nt pause site. When Pol II transcribes past the\u00a0~\u00a048 nt pause site, Integrator acts to cleave nascent precursors approximately when Pol II is at\u00a0+\u00a058 from piRNA TSSs, generating\u00a0~\u00a038 nt short\u2010capped RNAs and\u00a0~\u00a020 nt degradation fragments. ints\u201011 knock\u2010down does not lead to Pol II readthrough, suggesting that additional mechanisms prevent Pol II elongation at piRNA loci.Integrator attenuates protein\u2010coding gene expression in C.\u00a0elegans\nWe assessed the role of Integrator in protein\u2010coding gene transcription by examining the changes in short\u2010capped RNA and CAGE reads initiating at gene promoters (Chen et al, 2013). We identified a total of 437 genes with changes in short\u2010capped RNA signal (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.1; 371 upregulated, 66 downregulated, Appendix Fig\u00a0S6C), as well as 470 genes with changes in CAGE signal (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.1; 330 upregulated, 140 downregulated, Appendix Fig\u00a0S11D). Changes in short and long\u2010capped RNAs tended to correlate well, with very few genes showing changes in the opposite direction (Appendix Fig\u00a0S6E\u2013G). Interestingly, Integrator depletion also led to increased transcription of a subset of transposable elements from the Tc1 family (Appendix Fig\u00a0S7A and B). The enrichment of upregulated genes suggests that Integrator\u2010mediated termination negatively regulates transcription at certain genomic regions, potentially by cleaving upstream of paused polymerase to terminate transcription as has been recently reported (Elrod et al, 2019). Since motif\u2010independent piRNA loci tend to localize within protein\u2010coding gene promoters genome\u2010wide, we wondered whether they may be generated as a by\u2010product of premature Pol II termination at protein\u2010coding genes by Integrator. Motif\u2010independent piRNA loci, however, were not enriched in the promoters of genes that become upregulated upon Integrator knock\u2010down (Appendix Fig\u00a0S6H), consistent with an Integrator\u2010independent biogenesis pathway for motif\u2010independent piRNAs. DiscussionIn this work, we gain insight on the fundamental mechanism of piRNA biogenesis in C.\u00a0elegans and explore the role of the Integrator complex in the termination of promoter\u2010proximal Pol II at piRNA loci.Parallels between snRNA and piRNA transcriptionMultiple lines of evidence suggest that piRNA promoters evolved from snRNA promoters (peprint: Weng et al, 2018; Beltran et al, 2019; Cordeiro Rodrigues et al, 2019). Here, we explore the parallels between the mechanisms of piRNA and snRNA transcription. We show that the Integrator complex is recruited to sites of piRNA biogenesis upon piRNA transcription activation. It is unclear whether Integrator recruitment to piRNA promoters is directly mediated by the USTC complex (SNAPc/PRDE\u20101/TOFU\u20105), or whether Integrator is recruited to the initiating Pol II independently of SNAPc. Integrator has been shown to associate with the CTD of Pol II phosphorylated on Ser7 (Egloff et al, 2007, 2010). It will be of interest to explore whether Ser7\u2010P is associated with piRNA biogenesis, and the mechanisms directing this modification. The presence of piRNA\u2010independent Integrator foci may reflect Integrator\u2010dependent regulation of snRNA genes. Indeed, snRNA genes have been shown to spatially interact and coalesce into Cajal bodies (Frey & Matera, 2001; Wang et al, 2016). This phenomenon may share some mechanistic aspects with the formation of piRNA foci in the C.\u00a0elegans germline.Two distinct populations of piRNA precursorsBy isolating chromatin\u2010bound RNA from germ nuclei, we characterize two distinct populations of nascent piRNA precursors; one peaking at ~28 nt, and a second population of ~48 nt long, representing two Pol II pause sites on chromatin. In addition, we provide evidence that Integrator acts to cleave 53\u201363 nt nascent precursors past the +48 pause site, resulting in the release of 33\u201343 nt short\u2010capped piRNA precursor transcripts (Fig\u00a06). Several studies had set out to address the length of piRNA precursors in the past. Cecere et al, 2012 reported the existence of a ~75 nt long precursor detected by RACE, but high\u2010throughput sequencing\u2010based approaches detected 26\u201328 nt precursors (Gu et al, 2012; Weick et al, 2014). Our discovery of a second population of 40\u201360 nt nascent precursors reconciles these previous observations by suggesting that longer precursor transcripts, while rare, can be detected at piRNA loci.Interestingly, a large fraction of nascent precursors peak at a length of ~28 nt, as observed for nucleoplasmic precursors. This raises the question of whether these are truly chromatin\u2010bound. We previously suggested that increased AT content downstream of 21U\u2010RNAs leads to Pol II pausing ~28 nt downstream of the TSSs (Beltran et al, 2019). Consistent with this model, TFIIS mutation results in a 2\u20133 nt shift in both +28 and +48 peaks, suggesting pausing and backtracking of Pol II at both sites (Fig\u00a06). A recent study also supports the existence of two Pol II pause sites at protein\u2010coding genes in human cell lines (Aoi et al, 2020). Interestingly, accumulation of Pol II at the second pause site is observed upon NELF depletion, and coincides with a positioned downstream nucleosome (Aoi et al, 2020). Caenorhabditis elegans does not have NELF (Maxwell et al, 2014) potentially favouring the transition of Pol II to the +48 peak. In addition, integrator cleavage fragments are reduced in loci with high AT content downstream of 21U\u2010RNAs, suggesting that Pol II is less likely to reach the +48 peak in these loci. Pol II may be released from the +28 pause site independently of Integrator, and Integrator may act as a failsafe termination mechanism when transcription continues beyond +48 (Fig\u00a06). As indicated by the 5\u2032 ends of cleavage fragments, Integrator\u2010mediated termination releases ~38 nt capped RNAs, and these intermediates are likely further trimmed on their 3\u2032 ends to generate the main class of ~28 nt nucleoplasmic precursors. Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that Integrator promotes accumulation of Pol II at the +28 site, we favour the model outlined above given the known functions of Integrator in nascent RNA cleavage. It is also possible that Integrator depletion affects overall transcription initiation or nascent piRNA precursor stability, given the decrease in the levels of chromatin\u2010bound precursors observed upon ints\u201011 RNAi.Integrator and Pol II elongation controlOur analysis of the role for Integrator at piRNA loci in C.\u00a0elegans fits with a recent study demonstrating that Integrator terminates promoter\u2010proximal Pol II at protein\u2010coding gene promoters to attenuate gene expression (Elrod et al, 2019). The short\u2010capped RNAs produced as a by\u2010product of Integrator cleavage at protein\u2010coding gene promoters are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. At C.\u00a0elegans piRNA loci, instead, the resulting short\u2010capped RNAs are handed in to a specialized RNA processing complex resulting in mature piRNA production (Cordeiro Rodrigues et al, 2019; Zeng et al, 2019). How piRNA precursors are recognized and channelled into the downstream processing pathways while avoiding nuclear RNA surveillance will be interesting to explore in the future.Our data reveal an interesting interplay between TFIIS and Integrator function in the regulation of promoter\u2010proximal Pol II. TFIIS mutation results in increased nascent precursors, and an accumulation of ~48 nt precursors, but a decrease in degradation fragments, suggesting that TFIIS activity modulates the ability of Integrator to process nascent RNAs. The observation that Integrator processing occurs downstream of the +48 pause site suggests that the role of TFIIS is to promote elongation through the +48 site prior to Integrator termination. Interestingly, C.\u00a0elegans mutants of the RPB\u20109 subunit of Pol II exhibit defects in piRNA biogenesis similar to tfiis mutants (Berkyurek et al, cosubmitted). These data are consistent with previous studies indicating that TFIIS binding to Pol II is compromised in rpb\u20109\u0394 mutants in yeast (Sigurdsson et al, 2010). Indeed, the capacity of TFIIS to promote Pol II transcription through arrest sites in vitro depends on RPB\u20109 (Awrey et al, 1997). Understanding how the regulation of Pol II early elongation influences the ability of Integrator to prematurely terminate transcription will be an interesting avenue for research in the Pol II pausing field.At snRNA loci, Integrator is required to terminate transcription and in its absence substantial readthrough transcription is observed (Baillat et al, 2005; G\u00f3mez\u2010Orte et al, 2019). In our study, we observed similar evidence of readthrough transcription after Integrator knock\u2010down at snRNA loci. In contrast, Integrator depletion did not result in readthrough transcription at most motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci. This indicates that the cleavage activity of Integrator is not required to prevent elongation at motif\u2010dependent piRNAs. Pol II elongation control is thus likely to operate independently of Integrator via additional mechanisms (Fig\u00a06). One possibility is that elongation repression is chromatin\u2010based; since motif\u2010dependent piRNAs localize to broad domains of H3K27me3 (Beltran et al, 2019), and very low H3K27ac (Fig\u00a0EV5D) and accessibility (Fig\u00a0EV5A\u2013C), a situation reminiscent of poised enhancers (Creyghton et al, 2010). In contrast, motif\u2010independent piRNAs, which show extensive readthrough, are in highly accessible H3K27ac\u2010rich genomic regions. The tight control of Pol II elongation at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci may be a consequence of evolutionary pressure to avoid transcriptional interference between neighbouring piRNA loci given the high density of loci in piRNA cluster regions that are simultaneously activated.Integrator: piRNA functions beyond nematodes?The involvement of Integrator in piRNA biogenesis adds to the existing evidence that snRNA and nematode piRNA transcription are functionally and evolutionarily related. Whether this principle extends to piRNAs in other organisms remains unknown; however, the piRNA biogenesis factor cut\u2010off has been shown to bind to snRNA promoters in Drosophila melanogaster (Pritykin et al, 2017). Interestingly, Integrator was identified in genetic screens to be required for piRNA\u2010mediated silencing of a reporter in the Drosophila germline (Czech et al, 2013) and in ovarian somatic cells (Handler et al, 2013), making Integrator a possible candidate to assist in termination of piRNAs in Drosophila and mouse. Our data add to the growing evidence indicating co\u2010option of functional modules from a range of existing transcriptional and RNA metabolic processes in metazoan piRNA biogenesis, and expand the repertoire of non\u2010coding RNAs under Integrator control in metazoans. Materials and MethodsNematode culture and RNAi\nC.\u00a0elegans nematodes were grown at 20\u00b0C in standard nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates feeding on OP50 E.\u00a0coli. RNAi clones from the Ahringer library (Kamath & Ahringer, 2003) were grown overnight in LB supplemented with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml tetracycline. The next morning, cultures were diluted in LB 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ampicillin, grown to an OD of 0.5\u20130.6 and seeded into 1\u2010week\u2010old NGM plates supplemented with 1\u00a0mM IPTG and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ampicillin. Plates were dried for 48\u00a0h before plating synchronized L1 worms obtained by hypochlorite treatment followed by 24\u00a0h starvation in M9 media. See Appendix Table\u00a0S1 for nematode strains used in this study, and Appendix Table\u00a0S2 for oligonucleotides used in this study.Live imagingLive imaging of SX1316 piRNA sensor worms, as well as INTS\u20106::eGFP::3xFLAG and PRDE\u20101::mCherry transgenes was carried out in a DeltaVision fluorescence microscope system. Worms were picked into a 2\u00a0\u03bcl drop of M9 with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM levamisole on a slide, and subsequently immobilized in a hydrogel matrix with microbeads as described in Dong et al, 2018. Live imaging was carried out within 15\u00a0min of slide preparation.Immunofluorescent stainingMouse anti\u2010FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (F1804, Sigma) preadsorbed with C.\u00a0elegans lysates to remove background was used for immunofluorescent staining. 15\u201320 worms were picked onto 15\u00a0\u03bcl M9 Tween 0.1% on a poly\u2010lysine\u2010coated slide and dissected using a gauge needle. Another 15\u00a0\u03bcl 2% paraformaldehyde in M9 Tween 0.1% were added, some solution was removed and a coverslip was placed on top to let the germlines fix for 5\u00a0minutes. The slides were then frozen in liquid nitrogen, worms were cracked by quickly removing the coverslip, and slides were fixed in \u221220\u00b0C methanol for at least 1\u00a0minute. Slides were then washed by immersion in PBST for 5\u00a0min, 3 times, and blocked with PBST with 1% BSA for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with mouse anti\u2010FLAG M2 antibody diluted 1:500, and rabbit anti\u2010mCherry antibody (GTX128508) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution, in a wet chamber, overnight, at 4\u00b0C. The next day, slides were washed in PBST for 10\u00a0minutes, 3 times and then incubated with goat anti\u2010mouse Alexa 488 secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution, and goat anti\u2010rabbit Alexa 594 secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution in PBST for 1\u20132\u00a0h in the dark. Slides were again washed in PBST for 10\u00a0min, 3 times and incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcl DAPI 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for 5\u00a0min in the dark. Slides were finally washed in PBST in the dark for 20\u00a0min. Excess liquid was removed, and slides were mounted with Vectashield and sealed with nail polish.RNA extractionFor total RNA whole animal samples, young adult synchronized populations of worms were grown and washed with M9 three times to remove bacterial residues. For each 100\u00a0\u03bcl of worm pellet, 1\u00a0ml of Trizol was added. 5 cycles of freeze\u2010cracking were carried out, freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by thawing in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. Tubes were vortexed for 30\u00a0s on, 30\u00a0s off, for 5\u00a0min and incubated for 5\u00a0min at room temperature. 200\u00a0\u03bcl chloroform per ml of Trizol were added, tubes were shaked vigorously, incubated 2\u20133\u00a0min at room temperature and centrifuged at full speed for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The top layer was transferred to a new tube, and RNA was precipitated overnight at \u221220\u00b0C with 1\u00a0\u03bcl glycogen and an equal volume of isopropanol.Germ nuclei purification and chromatin fractionationGerm cells were purified similarly to the protocol described in Han et al, 2019. Approximately 50 100\u00a0mm standard NGM or RNAi plates of synchronized young adult worms were used per sample. Worms were washed off plates with M9, collected in a 15\u00a0ml conical tube and washed several times with M9 to clean from bacteria. The final wash was done with ice cold nuclear purification buffer (NPB: 10\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.6, 10\u00a0mM KCl, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.25\u00a0M sucrose, 0.025% TritonX\u2010100, 50\u00a0mM NaF, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 40\u00a0mM \u03b2\u2010glycerol, 2\u00a0mM Na3VO4). Worms were resuspended in NPB and transferred to a previously chilled metal grinder (#08\u2010414\u201020A), and 1\u20103 strokes were applied, monitoring the extent of homogenization after each stroke, such that no more than 10\u201015% of worms were broken. The solution was transferred to a prechilled 50\u00a0ml conical tube, vortexed for 30\u00a0s at medium speed, and then incubated on ice for 5\u00a0min, twice. The sample was then filtered through a 100\u00a0\u03bcm nylon mesh filter (Falcon), followed by three 40\u00a0\u03bcm (Falcon) and three 20\u00a0\u03bcm filters (PluriSelect). The filtered solution was recovered and centrifuged at 100\u00a0g for 6\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to pellet debris (usually a good germline yield has little or no material pelleted in this step). The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 2,500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to pellet nuclei, and the supernatant was discarded. Isolated nuclei were then subjected to chromatin fractionation as described in Nojima et al, 2016. Briefly, nuclei were resupended in 67.5\u00a0\u03bcl of ice\u2010cold NUN1 buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH\u00a0=\u00a07.9, 75\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 50% glycerol v/v, 1\u00d7 cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail), and mixed gently by pipetting. 0.6\u00a0ml of ice\u2010cold NUN2 buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES pH\u00a0=\u00a07.6, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 7.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1% v/v NP\u201040, 1\u00a0M urea, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail) were added. The mix was vortexed at maximum speed and incubated on ice for 15\u00a0min, vortexing every 3\u20134 during the incubation to precipitate the chromatin fraction. The mix was then centrifuged at 16,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant (nucleoplasm fraction) was collected, split into two aliquots of 300 and 900\u00a0\u03bcl Trizol LS were added to each aliquot and mixed by vortexing to proceed with RNA extraction. To isolate chromatin\u2010bound RNA, the chromatin pellet was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl HSB buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH\u00a0=\u00a07.5, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM MgCl2) with 10\u00a0\u03bcl TURBO DNase (stock 2 U/\u03bcl) and 10\u00a0\u03bcl Superase\u2010In RNase inhibitor (stock 20 U/\u03bcl) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, vortexing to help resuspension and solubilization. 2\u00a0\u03bcl of proteinase K (stock 20\u00a0mg/ml) was then added, and the mix was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. 600\u00a0\u03bcl Trizol LS was added to proceed with RNA extraction.CIP\u2010Rpph treatment of RNA and small RNA library preparationAn overview of the alternative cloning methods used in this work is available on Appendix Fig\u00a0S8). To enrich for short\u2010capped RNAs, we first pretreated 2\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA, or 500\u00a0ng of chromatin\u2010bound or nucleoplasmic RNA with 2\u00a0\u00b5l Quick CIP (NEB) in a total volume of 20\u00a0\u00b5l for 90\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. RNA was phenol\u2010chloroform extracted, and precipitated at \u221220\u00baC overnight with 1/10 vol 3\u00a0M AcNa, and 3 vol 100% EtOH and 1\u00a0\u00b5l glycogen. The next day, RNA was resuspended and treated with 7.5 units (1.5\u00a0\u00b5l) RNA 5\u2032 pyrophosphohydrolase (NEB) for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 20\u00a0\u00b5l. RNA was extracted and precipitated overnight as described for CIP treatment. The resulting RNA was used as input for small RNA library preparation using the TruSeq small RNA kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, except for an increase in the number of PCR cycles from 11 to 15. An insert size range of 20\u201370 nt was gel purified, DNA was eluted from the gel in 0.3\u00a0M NaCl, and EtOH precipitated overnight. For direct 5\u2032 P libraries, 1\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA was used as input, and an insert size range of 20\u201335 nt was gel purified. Libraries were quantitated using Qubit and Tapestation prior to pooling in groups of 6 to 12 per lane and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 (50bp single end libraries), or an Illumina NextSeq instrument (75\u00a0bp single end libraries).Small RNA sequencing data processing, mapping and normalizationThe Illumina universal adapter was trimmed from small RNA reads using cut adapt v1.10 and reads >\u00a017nt were mapped to WS252 C.\u00a0elegans genome (ce11) using bowtie v0.12 (Langmead et al, 2009) with parameters \u2013v 0 \u2013m 1. Sam files were converted to bam and bed using samtools v1.2 (Li et al, 2009) and bedtools v2.25.0 (Quinlan & Hall, 2010).piRNA and miRNA counts were derived from direct 5\u2032 P libraries by searching collapsed fasta files for exact matches to existing piRNA (Batista et al, 2008; Gu et al, 2012) and miRNA (Kozomara & Griffiths\u2010Jones, 2014) annotations. Direct library sizes were estimated, using total non\u2010structural read counts (i), using total miRNA counts (ii) and extracting DEseq2 size factors from a miRNA counts table (iii), resulting in similar trends. Log2 fold change in abundance was calculated for loci with more than 5 DEseq2 normalized read counts on average. 1 pseudocount was added to avoid zero counts. Additionally, the change in total mature piRNA counts relative to N2 was estimated using the same size factors.piRNA precursor reads were identified from CIP\u2010Rpph libraries by identifying reads mapping exactly 2 nt upstream of annotated piRNAs. Library sizes were estimated as the total counts of precursor reads mapping to previously annotated TSSs (Chen et al, 2013). The log2 fold change in abundance was calculated for loci with more than 5 reads per million of TSS\u2010mapping scRNA reads on average. 1 pseudocount was added to avoid zero counts. Additionally, the change in total piRNA precursor counts relative to N2 was estimated using the same size factors. To estimate the effects of the termination signal strength on piRNA precursors, we calculated termination signature strength as described in Beltran et al, 2019 considering the entire transcriptional unit from the TSS to +50, and considering the region downstream of 21U\u2010RNAs alone (+25 to +50). We plotted the length distribution of precursors across equal\u2010sized bins of piRNA loci stratified according to pausing signature strength. We additionally plotted the length distributions for the top vs bottom 20% loci.To analyse the data on a locus\u2010by\u2010locus basis, we calculated the median precursor length in each locus in two alternative ways: (i) the median/mean length of all unique sequences and (ii) the median/mean length of all precursor reads. We then calculated the length shift distributions between each condition and the EV controls. We also plotted the length distributions of precursors on a locus\u2010by\u2010locus basis as a heat map, where each precursor sequence length for each piRNA TSS is assigned a 1 (detected) or a 0 (undetected). Additionally, we stratified these heat maps in bins of loci of increasing termination signature strength.To assess the possibility of precursor trimming, we classified loci in bins according to the proportion of long (>\u00a038 nt) chromatin\u2010bound precursors observed. For each locus, we calculated the median length of all nucleoplasmic precursor sequences, and of all nucleoplasmic precursor reads. We plotted the distributions of median lengths in each of the previously defined bins as violin plots/boxplots.Bootstrap analysis of piRNA precursor peak locationsIn order to obtain robust estimates of precursor distributions, and sufficient sampling of precursors, we combined precursors identified in the two replicates for each condition. For each condition, we generated 2,000 random subsamples of 3,000 precursor sequences, sampling without replacement and weighting the probability of sampling by the number of reads for each precursor sequence. We fit a smoothing density curve to the distribution, identified the two local maxima of the fit corresponding to first and second peaks and extracted the positions of the two. The resulting distributions of positions of both peaks for each condition are shown on Fig\u00a03F and G.Degradation fragment analysisDegradation fragment analysis was carried out from direct 5\u2032 P small RNA libraries generated from RNA purified from germ nuclei, with the data processed as described above but without applying a minimum read length cut\u2010off. Reads >\u00a015 nt initiating exactly at annotated 21U\u2010RNA sites were discarded from the libraries, and the read coverage of the remaining 5\u2032 P unique sequences around piRNA promoters was plotted at single\u2010nucleotide resolution in the form of an average profile and a heat map. Additionally, the counts per million and sequences per million of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of 5\u2032 P reads was similarly plotted. We found an enrichment of 21\u2010U RNA sequences initiating within a +/\u20105 nt window from 21U\u2010RNA sites. These likely represent unannotated 21U\u2010RNAs originating from overlapping TSSs from the same piRNA locus (Billi et al, 2013). We additionally removed these 21U\u2010RNA sequences, as well as reads >\u00a015 nt initiating at those unannotated 21U\u2010RNA sites. The remaining first nucleotide and length distributions showed an enrichment of unique sequences initiating at the \u22122 position from annotated 21U\u2010RNAs. Fragments whose 5\u2032 ends mapped in between +25 and +50 from the 5\u2032 U of annotated 21U\u2010RNAs, corresponding to the second peak centred at +50 were collected, and their length distribution was plotted. Total fragment counts per locus were calculated and normalized to cpm of total non\u2010structural mapped reads. The total number of loci with detectable fragments, and well as the distribution of fragment cpms were quantified across piRNA loci binned according to the strength of their termination signals.SLIC\u2010CAGE library preparation and sequencingCAGE library preparation from chromatin\u2010bound RNA was performed using the SLiC\u2010CAGE protocol (Cvetesic et al, 2018, 2019). The prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 (100bp paired\u2010end libraries). In order to assess the enrichment of potential piRNA precursor reads in chromatin\u2010bound samples, a total RNA sample control was used. Intron retention ratios were estimated using IRFinder (Middleton et al, 2017), which computes a ratio between the abundance of spliced and unspliced introns for all annotated RNAs, confirming the enrichment of unspliced transcripts in nascent RNA samples.Analysis of SLIC\u2010CAGE dataCAGE tags of read 1 were mapped to a reference C.\u00a0elegans genome (ce11) using STAR (Dobin et al, 2013). Uniquely mapped reads were imported into R (http://www.R\u2010project.org/) as bam files using the standard workflow within the CAGEr package (Haberle et al, 2015). Due to the template\u2010free activity of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, often a G is added at the 5\u2019 end of the read. G\u2019s that do not map to the genome at the 5\u00b4 end of reads are removed by CAGEr\u2019s standard workflow. G\u2019s that map to the genome are removed at a rate comparable to the mismatching G\u2019s removed. The 5\u00b4 ends of reads represent CAGE\u2010supported transcription start sites (CTSSs), and the number of tags for each CTSS reflects expression levels. Raw tags were normalized using a referent power\u2010law distribution and expressed as normalized tags per million (TPMs) (Balwierz et al, 2009).Biological replicates were highly correlated (r\n2\u00a0>\u00a00.9) and were therefore merged, and the distributions of log2 fold change in CAGE signal at the \u22122 position of piRNA loci were calculated. For each pair of samples, piRNA loci with non\u2010zero counts in at least one of the conditions were included, and 0.01 tpm were added to all data points to prevent division by zero. Log2 transformed data for all positions upstream of piRNAs in all conditions were plotted as a heat map, with the total sum of normalized CAGE tpms by position shown above.For fragment length quantification, reads were aligned using using Tophat v2.1.0. (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012) with parameters \u2010X 20000. Alignment files were sorted by read name and converted to bed12 format using pairedBamToBed12. Read pairs initiating at \u22122 from 21U\u2010RNAs were retrieved, and their overall length and abundance normalized to counts per million of mapped fragments were plotted. In addition, library sizes obtained from the total numbers of pair1 reads containing SL1 and SL2 spliced leader sequences were used for normalization, resulting in very similar trends to previous normalization strategies. Tophat alignments were converted to bigwig tracks using deeptools v3.1.2 bamCoverage (Ram\u00edrez et al, 2016) with parameters \u2010bs 10 \u2010e, tracks from the two replicates for each condition were averaged, and signal average profiles and heat maps were generated for snRNA and protein\u2010coding gene TSSs.CAGE counts were randomly down sampled to multiple total count sizes (from 50,000 to 5,000,000 to match library size across libraries), and to multiple percentages of total library size (to examine saturation of piRNA detection with sequencing depth). 15 samples were obtained for each size and library, and the total number of piRNA loci with detected signal at \u22122 nt from the 21U\u2010RNA were recovered. For each of the 15 subsamples, the two replicates of each library were averaged. The resulting distributions of total detected piRNAs per condition were plotted as boxplots against the depth of the subsamples.ATAC\u2010seq and ChIP\u2010seq data processing and analysisProcessed bigwig ATAC\u2010seq tracks from young adult wild\u2010type nematodes, and day 1 glp\u20101 mutant adults were obtained from Janes et al (2018) ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE114439\",\"term_id\":\"114439\"}}GSE114439) and lifted over to ce11. Raw H3K27 acetylation ChIP\u2010seq data from isolated germ nuclei and somatic nuclei were obtained from Han et al, 2019 (SRR9214969 to SRR9214976), mapped to ce11 using bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012) with default parameters, and the resulting bam files were converted to bigwig tracks using deeptools bamCoverage (Ram\u00edrez et al, 2016) with parameters \u2010bs 1 \u2010e 150 \u2013normalize Using RPGC \u2010\u2010effectiveGenomeSize 96945445. Replicates were averaged using bigwigCompare, and heat maps of H3K27ac and ATAC signal around piRNA loci were generated using deeptools computeMatrix reference\u2010point. The signal data underlying the heat maps were extracted in order to compare the distributions of ATAC (\u00b1100\u00a0bp around piRNA TSSs) and H3K27ac signal between groups of loci (\u00b11\u00a0kb around piRNA TSSs).Differential expression analysis of gene promoters genome\u2010wide using scRNA and CAGE count datascRNA or CAGE TSS annotations were intersected with a set of WormBase protein\u2010coding gene promoters (Chen et al, 2013) lifted over to ce11, in order to generate count matrices of scRNA or CAGE counts for all gene promoters genome\u2010wide. Differential expression analysis comparing N2 empty vector chromatin\u2010bound samples to N2 ints\u201011 RNAi chromatin\u2010bound samples was carried out using DESeq2. Promoters were considered to be differentially expressed using a Benjamini\u2010Hochberg FDR threshold of 0.1. The fold changes of promoters identified as differentially expressed in either of the two experiments were extracted, and the fold change in scRNA signal was plotted against the fold change in CAGE signal. To test for enrichment of motif\u2010independent piRNAs in each of the promoter classes, motif\u2010independent piRNAs were first overlapped with promoters detected in the scRNA and CAGE experiments in order to determine their background enrichment. Enrichment was calculated in each promoter set as an odds ratio relative to its corresponding background; for instance the fraction of CAGE \u201cup\u201d promoters overlapping with motif\u2010independent piRNAs was compared with the fraction of all CAGE detectable promoters overlapping with motif\u2010independent piRNAs. For intersecting promoter sets, genes detected as significant in either experiment, and having a fold change greater than 2 in both experiments were selected. In these cases, background was calculated as the fraction of promoters detected in both experiments overlapping with motif\u2010independent piRNAs.To investigate transcriptional changes in transposable element (TE) expression, we used RepeatMasker and RepeatModeller to identify the positions of TEs within the C.\u00a0elegans genome, version ce11. We then used Bedtools to intersect this with the normalized CAGE data resulting in counts for each transposable element. The maximum CAGE signal across the two replicates was identified and the sum of this for TE families compared between EV\u2010treated animals and int\u201011 RNAi\u2010treated animals using a Wilcoxon paired test across individual elements of each family. Significantly different TEs were identified as those with a Benjamani\u2010Hochberg adjusted P\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and a more than 1.5\u2010fold difference in total expression.
