This study aimed first to describe outcomes of patients suffering from COVID-19-related ARDS treated with HFNC; secondly to evaluate safety of HFNC (patients and healthcare workers) and compare patients according to respiratory outcome.                  Methods:                       A retrospective cohort was conducted in French general hospital intensive care unit (ICU).

In the HFNC-DNIO group (n = 11), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ratio median worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 109 (102-172) and hospital mortality was 54.5%. Except the HFNC-DNIO patients (n = 35), 20 patients (57%) were eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation group) and 15 were only treated by HFNC (HFNC-only). HFNC-intubation patients presented higher worst respiratory rates per minute in ICU [37 (34-41) versus 33 (24-34) min, p < 0.05] and worsened ICU admission PaO2/FiO2 ratios [121 (103-169) versus 191 (162-219), p < 0.001] compared with HFNC-only patients. Hospital mortality was 35% (n = 7/20) in HFNC-intubation group, 0% in HFNC-only group with a global mortality of these two groups of 20% (n = 7/35).

Early guidelines were either against\n23\n or in favor\n24\n of HFNC. Several small studies report that use of HFNC (17 patients,\n11\n 33 patients)\n8\n seems to limit the intubation rate (respectively, 41.1 and 42%) compared to\n71.0\u201388.0%9,10 in studies with no or limited HFNC use (<5%).Vannes (Morbihan, France) was one of the first clusters of cases in France (first\ncase 26 February), before national and international guidelines publication. In view\nof increased COVID-19 hospitalization (24 COVID-19 admissions within 15\u2009days at the\nbeginning of March 2020) and limited availability of ventilators (20 ICU beds), our\nICU and pneumology department decided to use HFNC with strict protective measures\nafter infectiologist agreement. We then conducted a retrospective analysis of the\nCOVID-19-related ARDS patients treated with HFNC in order to assess the intubation\nrates, evaluate patients\u2019 outcomes and safety for healthcare workers. The\noriginality of our study was the creation of a COVID-19 acute-HFNC-pneumology\ndepartment in order to spare ICU beds; the study of patients prior limited to life\nsustaining therapy and the investigation of healthcare workers\u2019 exposition. Materials and methodsStudy designThis is a retrospective monocenter analysis conducted in a secondary hospital in\nVannes, France between 26 February 2020 and 30 June 2020.The primary end point was to describe outcomes of patients treated with HFNC for\nCOVID-19-related ARDS (intubation rate, mortality, and hospital length of stay).\nThe secondary end points were to evaluate safety of HFNC (for patients and\nhealthcare workers) and to compare characteristics of patients according to\nrespiratory outcome (intubation requirements).PopulationInclusion criteria: all adult patients (over 18\u2009years old) with a\nCOVID-19-related ARDS diagnosis and treated by HFNC were eligible.Berlin criteria diagnoses for ARDS were: acute respiratory symptoms with\nbilateral opacities on chest-X rays and a partial arterial oxygen pressure\n(PaO2)/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ratio under 300.\n25\n According to PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ARDS was classified\nas mild (200\u2013300), moderate (100\u2013200) or severe (<100). The COVID-19 etiology\nwas obtained with positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase\nchain reaction (RT-PCR) (Laboratory of Rennes and Brest University Hospital or\nQuimper Hospital, France) tested on nasal and/or pharyngeal swab samples or\nbroncho-alveolar lavage.Patients were treated by HFNC when French-speaking resuscitation society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nde R\u00e9animation de Langue Fran\u00e7aise) criteria for theoretical endotracheal intubation\n23\n appear: saturation pulse oxygen (SpO2) \u2a7d92% on standard oxygen\n\u2a7e6\u2009L/min.Exclusion criteria: pregnant women, patients under legal protection and refusal\nto participate.Three groups were defined: patients with prior do not intubate order (HFNC-DNIO\ngroup), patients treated with HFNC who were not intubated (HFNC-only group, DNIO\npatients excluded) and HFNC-intubation group when requiring mechanical\nventilation after HFNC use.Patients were intubated depending on physician decision, based on the following:\nhypoxia with SpO2 \u2a7d90% despite FiO2 \u2a7e80% associated with\none of the following: respiratory rate >35/min or use of accessory\nrespiratory muscles or inability to clear tracheal secretions or deterioration\nof consciousness.Data collectionWe reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory\nfindings, and radiological examinations for all patients.We collected the following data: (a) demographic characteristics; (b) past\nmedical histories; (c) decision to limit life-sustaining therapy, including\nDNIO; (d) symptoms onset, vital signs, and severity scores namely SOFA\n(sequential organ failure assessment) and APACHE II (acute physiology and\nchronic health evaluation) score26,27 upon admission; (e)\narterial blood gas analysis; (f) oxygenation, ventilation and organ supports\n(vasopressors).Department organizationAn acute-HFNC-pneumology department (without continuous monitoring) was created\nin the pneumology department for HFNC patients treated with FiO2\n40\u201360% and/or for patients with DNIO. Of note, HFNC was routinely used in the\npneumology department since Frat et al.\n12\n study, especially for DNIO patients. The nurse ratio was increased\ncompared to the traditional pneumology department. The 56 healthcare workers\nwere, as possible in this sanitary crisis, dedicated to the HFNC beds. Patients\nwith FiO2 \u2a7e60% under HFNC were transferred to a conventional ICU.\nNon-invasive mechanical ventilation was not used in our cohort. In ICU\ndepartments, healthcare workers treated COVID-19 patients with either HFNC or\ninvasive mechanical ventilation; and non-COVID-19 patients.HFNC was delivered as recommended: 50\u201360\u2009L/min, 34\u201337\u00b0C.\n28\n Once HFNC was started, the therapy was maintained 24\u2009h/24\u2009h until weaning\nseemed possible (when FiO2 reached 30%). Awake prone position under\nHFNC was not performed during this study period.Neither acute-HFNC-pneumology department nor ICU department are equipped with a\nnegative pressure room. All intubated patients had closed circuit ventilation.\nHealthcare workers were protected with FFP2 (filtering face piece type 2) masks,\novercoat gowns, glasses, hat and gloves. Patients did not wear surgical\nmasks.Symptomatic healthcare workers were tested by PCR at the onset of symptoms. A\nserological test was proposed to asymptomatic healthcare workers in June 2020 to\nevaluate the contamination rate. Serological testing used total antibodies\n(including IgG) directed toward SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapside, using\nelectrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche).EthicsThe study was approved by Rennes academic hospital ethics committee (no. 20.32)\nand National Commission for Data Protection (Commission Nationale de\nl\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, CNIL, no. 2217312). All living patients received\noral and written information and non-opposition was collected.Statistical analysisContinuous variables are presented as median (1st\u20133rd interquartile range) and\ncategorical variables by frequencies. Continuous data were tested with\nMann\u2013Whitney test and nominal variables were compared with a chi-square test or\nFisher\u2019s exact test, depending on sample size. The p value\n<0.05 in two-tailed test was considered significant. Statistical analysis was\nperformed with StatView 5.0 software. ResultsPopulationFrom 20 February 2020 to 30 June 2020, 378 patients were diagnosed with\nvirologically confirmed COVID-19 (flow chart, Figure 1). Forty-six patients who\nreceived HFNC as first line therapy were included. No patient opposed enrolment.\nFourteen patients (30.4%) only stayed in acute-HFNC-pneumology department\nwithout need for conventional ICU transfer.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Flow chart.Demographic characteristicsThe baseline characteristics of the 46 patients are summarized in Table 1. Of note,\nafter excluding DNIO patients 15/35 patients (42.9%) were \u2a7e75\u2009years old, 19\n(41.3%) and only two (5%) less than 50\u2009years old. Sex ratio M/F was 3.2.

Six\npatients were intubated >48\u2009h after HFNC initiation, of whom two died after\nextubation and ARDS resolution more than 3\u2009weeks after admission. Concerning the\nremaining five deaths, medical staff decided to limit life-sustaining therapy\nwhile still intubated for five patients (all died). Mortality increases with the\nseverity of ARDS with a mortality of 0% for mild, 12.5% for moderate and 38.5%\nfor severe ARDS.Healthcare workersThe cohort was cared for by 148 healthcare workers (30 physicians, 66 nurses, 3\nphysiotherapists, 2 psychologists, 2 dieticians and 45 other healthcare\nworkers). Twelve healthcare workers presented mild COVID-19-like symptoms:\nfever, dry cough, throat pain. No one had pneumonia. Only one was PCR SARS-CoV-2\npositive but physicians concluded certain home contamination by his relatives\ncoming back from a bigger cluster in eastern France. Among the 74.3%\nasymptomatic healthcare workers tested by SARS-CoV-2 serology (110/148), two\n(1.8%) were positive (one nurse in acute pneumology-department and one caregiver\nin conventional ICU), without sufficient data for work-related infection. DiscussionThe first major point of this observational study is that our patients treated with\nHFNC for ARDS-related COVID-19 had a good outcome.Using conventional criteria for intubation, we reported a 57% intubation rate. Wang\net al.\n11\n reported a 42% intubation rate but the study included a limited number of\npatients (n\u2009=\u200917) and involved patients less severe: baseline ICU\nPaO2/FiO2 ratio in HFNC-only compared to HFNC-intubation\ngroups was 223 and 159, respectively, versus 191 and 121 in our\ncohort. In Yang et al.\n8\n study, patients were younger, with a median age of 59.7\u2009years old compared\nwith 75\u2009years old in our study, with a 41% intubation rate. Grasselli et\nal.\n10\n and Auld et al.\n29\n studies report, respectively, 88% and 76% invasive mechanical ventilation, in\ncohorts without HFNC use (non-invasive mechanical ventilation was applied for 11%\npatients in the Grasseli study). No randomized trial allows strong conclusion about\npreventing intubation in COVID-19 patients with HFNC.\n30\nMortality rate of the HFNC-intubation group was not higher than expected for neither\nARDS patients nor COVID-19 patients in ICU. Indeed, overall hospital mortality rate\nof patients without DNIO was 20% (respectively, 0% and 35% in HFNC-only and\nHFNC-intubation groups). Our 0%, 12.5% and 38.5% hospital mortality rate in patients\nwith mild, moderate or severe ARDS was lower if compared with 34.9%, 40.3% and 46.1%\nin general ARDS described in the LUNG SAFE study.\n31\n In COVID-19, a wide variation of mortality rates are reported in patients,\nranging from 26%\n10\n (58% of the cohort still in the ICU at the time of publication), 30.9%,\n29\n 52.4%\n9\n or 61.5%\n8\n depending on studies. Mortality increased in patients >63\u2009years old (36%\nversus 15%), the population largely represented in our cohort.\n10\nThere is still debate on whether timing and or clinico-biological parameters should\nguide physicians to decide upon intubation procedure.\n32\n Kang et al.\n33\n report that in patients with HFNC failure, ICU mortality of patients\nintubated after 48\u2009h was higher (39.2 versus 66.7,\np\u2009=\u20090.001). In our cohort, six patients were intubated after\n48\u2009h of HFNC therapy, the two deaths to deplore did not seem linked to delayed\nintubation. Considering that the HFNC-intubation group presented higher worst mean\nrespiratory rates per minute [37 (34\u201341) versus 33 (24\u201334) min,\np\u2009<\u20090.05] and worsened mean admission\nPaO2/FiO2 ratios [121 (103\u2013169) versus\n191 (162\u2013219), p\u2009<\u20090.001], the association of a\nPaO2/FiO2 <150 with a respiratory rate >35/min upon\nadmission could help for intubation decision in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, an ICU\n(acute pneumology department or conventional ICU) PaO2/FiO2\nratio admission >150 and a worst respiratory rate <35/min seem to well\nclassified patients who were not undergoing intubation.In addition, HFNC could be considered as rescue therapy in DNIO patients: we\ncurrently report a 54.5% mortality rate. As previously described in Koyauchi\net al.\n34\n HFNC ensures end of life comfort, allowing better communication and easier\nfeeding for these patients.The last major point is the fact that hospital-acquired COVID-19 was not observed in\nhealthcare workers, which remains a serious concern for medical societies.16,35 All\nsymptomatic healthcare workers were tested with RT-PCR, with no positive test\nattributable to their professional activity. Only one nurse presented virologically\nconfirmed COVID-19 but he was obviously infected at home by his parents. Among the\n74.3% asymptomatic healthcare workers who accepted to be tested, 1.8% had positive\nSARS-CoV-2. Even at admission peak in early April, hospital influx did not reach\ntotal saturation, which enables us to respect optimal protection to healthcare\nworkers.Our study has several limitations. The retrospective design and sample size did not\nallow multivariate analysis. Due to retrospective analysis, time from symptoms to\nchest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan was too heterogeneous to be analyzed.\nSerological testing in healthcare workers was heterogeneous (only 110 healthcare\nworkers tested on the 148 exposed) without precise timing, due to retrospective\nanalysis, healthcare workers motivation (no obligation to perform the serology) and\ntests availability. ConclusionHFNC seems a safe therapy in order to avoid intubation in COVID-19-related ARDS\npatients, regarding the 20% hospital mortality rate (except HFNC-DNIO patients).\nARDS severity with PaO2/FiO2 <150 associated with\nrespiratory rate >35/min could be regarded as a predictor of intubation. Only one\nCOVID-19 related to out-hospital acquisition and 1.8% of positive serologies in\nasymptomatic were observed in healthcare workers. Further studies with prospective\nand randomized design are needed.
