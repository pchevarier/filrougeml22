One such member, Forkhead Box P1 [FOXP1], typically\nexpressed as multiple isoforms [5], is\nnecessary for the proper development of the heart, lung and brain of mammals [6\u20139]. Previous studies have shown that FOXP1 is essential to various aspects\nof cardiac development, including formation of the outflow tract, myocardial\nproliferation and thinning of the ventricular myocardium [3,10]. FOXP1\nexists as a mixture of monomers and dimers [11] and belongs to the P-subfamily of Fkh TFs that also include FOXP2-4\n[12]. In addition to its Fkh DNA-binding\ndomain, FOXP1 contains a glutamine-rich region, a zinc finger and a leucine zipper\nrequired for homodimerization.Another family of dimerizing TFs critical for heart development and other\ncellular systems are characterized by their basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA\nbinding domains. These include four highly conserved myogenic regulatory factors\n(MRFs) [13,14]. Muscle-specific bHLH TFs cooperate with the MEF2 family of MADS box\nTFs to activate transcription of muscle structural genes through E-box and MEF2\npromoter sites, respectively [13,14]. One of these, Myoblast Determination\nprotein 1 (MYOD1/MyoD), is the topic of this report.MyoD1 transcription is largely limited to embryonic somitic\nprecursors and differentiated myogenic cells [13,14]. MyoD functions primarily\nin development to commit mesoderm progenitor cells to the skeletal myoblast lineage\n[14] and to continually regulate their\nstatus. MyoD also has been shown to regulate muscle repair, as its levels are\nelevated during skeletal muscle aging [14,15].Myod1 transcription is primarily regulated by two enhancer\nregions [Supplementary Figure\n1; 15]. However, regulation\nthrough these elements is complex, as combinations of multiple TFs bind to activate\nor repress in different muscle progenitor cells and phases of differentiation. A\nrange of epigenetic modifications within the 24kb \u201csuper enhancer\u201d\nalso contribute to Myod1 transcription during development and\nregeneration [15].FOXP1 and MyoD heterodimerize extensively with both family and non-family\nmembers [16]. As an example of the latter,\nFOXP1 forms cooperative complexes with NFAT2 when bound to the same region of the\nIL-2 promoter to repress its transcription [17]. MyoD and the other MRFs heterodimerize most prominently with bHLH\nproteins, including the E2A gene products, E12 and E47 [14,15,18]. Their dimerization leads to increased DNA\nbinding and stimulation of Myod1 transcription [14,15].\nConversely, ID, which contains a HLH dimerization domain but lacks the basic domain,\ninhibits MyoD DNA binding by dimerizing and sequestering E2A proteins [14,15,19].The structure of the forkhead domain consists of a compact packing of three\n\u03b1-helices (H), three \u03b2-strands (S), and two loops or\n\u201cwings\u201d (W), arranged in the order of H1-S1-H2-H3-S2-W1-S3-W2 [20]. Helices H3 and W2 interact with the major\nand minor grooves of DNA, respectively. We demonstrated [1] that an 84 amino acid segment containing H1 and H2\nresembled helices 2 and 1 of MyoD, but not other MRFs, in amphipathicity and in\nconserved hydrophobic core residues (Supplementary Figure 2). With respect\nto MyoD, a \u201cbasic hook\u201d is formed by a conserved arginine and the\ncurvature of two Prolines. H3 of FOXP1 shares properties with the recognition helix\nconserved in all MEF homeodomains [1,14,15].\nWe accurately predicted that a basic region at the C-terminus of FOXP1 provides\nmajor DNA contacts [1]. These features were\nconfirmed in the high-resolution structures of both FOXP1 and the highly related\nFOXA1/HNF-3A complexes with DNA [21\u201323].These features led us to hypothesize that FOXP1 might heterodimerize with\nMyoD. We show here that FOXP1, but not the highly similar FOXA1, heterodimerizes\nin vitro and in vivo through its Fkh domain\nwith the bHLH domain of MyoD, but not with several other Class 1 or Class II bHLH\ndomains. We found that this interaction competes with MyoD-E47 heterodimerization,\nleading to a block in MyoD E-box DNA binding. Through this quenching interaction,\nFOXP1 represses the ability of MyoD to transactivate E-box-driven promoters in\ncultured cells or in vitro. As a consequence, the ability of MyoD\nto promote fibroblast conversion to myotubules is impaired by ectopic overexpression\nof FOXP1. Our results suggest a model for FOXP1-MyoD regulation based on repressor\nreplacement of ID by FOXP1 at the post-proliferative stage of myoblast\ndevelopment. ResultsFOXP1 and MyoD are coordinately expressed and interact physically in\nvivoUpon serum deprivation, C2C12 myocytes activate transcription of MyoD\nand undergo cell cycle arrest following transcription of the Cdk inhibitor, p21,\nand phosphorylation of pRb [24]. Skeletal\nmuscle differentiation then proceeds through the induction of additional MRFs\nand fusion of myoblasts into myotubes. C2C12 myocytes and 10T1/2 fibroblasts are\nwell-characterized in culturo models of this process [25]. When 10T1/2 cells are treated with\n5-azacytidine to induce DNA demethylation, they undergo spontaneous\ndifferentiation into myotubes [15]. As\nshown in Figure 1A, both FOXP1 and MyoD\nexpression in 10T1/2 commences at ~48 in culture following 5-azacytidine\naddition.Open in a separate windowFigure 1:FOXP1 and MyoD are coordinately expressed and interact physically in\nvivo.A, B. FOXP1 and MyoD expression peaks at ~3 days\nfollowing serum withdrawal-mediated differentiation in C2C12 myocytes and or\n5-azacytidine-mediated differentiation in 10T1/2 fibroblasts. SDS-PAGE\nfractionation was followed by anti-MyoD Ab or anti-FOXP1 Ab Western blotting.\nC. FOXP1 and MyoD heterodimerize in differentiated C2C12\nmyoblasts. Standard co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)/Western blotting was\nperformed 3 days following serum withdrawal. Nuclear lysates were\nimmunoprecipitated with anti-FOXPI Ab, fractionated on SDS gels and then blotted\nwith anti-MyoD Ab. IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Western blotting; Loading\ncontrols (CTRL) include 1% input lanes, 1% IP\u2019d lanes, Ig-only, and\n\u03b2- tubulin loading controls. Molecular weights are indicated on the\nright.We confirmed and extended these results by employing C2C12 myocytes. As\nshown in the Western blots of Figure 1B,\nFOXP1 and MyoD reach expression maxima at approximately the same time, 48 hrs\nfollowing serum withdrawal. Expression of an E box-containing MyoD target gene,\nMuscle Creatine Kinase (MCK), continues to increase (the MCK promoter is\nemployed in luciferase experiments detailed below).We employed a standard co-immunoprecipitation/western blotting approach\nto test if MyoD and FOXP1 heterodimerize in C2C12 myocytes following serum\nwithdrawal (Figure 1C). Nuclear lysates of\ndifferentiated cells were prepared under mild, nonionic detergent conditions,\nCo-immunoprecipitated (Co- IP\u2019d) with anti-FOXP1 antibody (Ab),\nfractionated on SDS gels and then blotted with anti-MyoD Ab. As shown in Figure 1C, MyoD was specifically\nCo-IP\u2019d by FOXP1 at 48 hr\u2014about the same time at which both\nproteins achieve their maximal expression.Together these data support the hypothesis that FOXP1 and MyoD are\ncoordinately expressed and interact in differentiated myoblasts.In vitro heterodimerization specificity of the FOXP1 Fkh and\nthe bHLH domain of MyoDHelices 1 and 2 of the 84 residue FOXP1 fkh are surprisingly similar to\nthe amphipathic structures of helix-loop-helices (HLH) in total length and\nhydrophobic core density (Supplementary Figure 2). As pointed out in the Introduction, several invariant/conserved residues\nwithin helix 2 of Fkh are shared with helix 1 of both highly and distantly\nrelated Fkhs. The similarity becomes more compelling when classes of each domain\nwere compared (Supplementary\nFigure 3).A strategy similar to the one above was employed to test the specificity\nof the FOXP1-MyoD interaction. We performed a series of Co-IPs of FOXP1 along\nwith several potential interaction partners\u2013 each tagged with N-terminal\nHA motifs. These included the 4 MRFs (MYF6, MRF4, MyoG, and MyoD) and their\ninteracting partner, E47. We also analyzed potential FOXP1 interaction with a\nrelatively distant bHLH factor, TAL1, as well as related forkhead protein,\nFOXA1. HA-FOXP3, a recognized FOXP1 interacting protein whose expression is\nactivated by FOXP1 [26], served as the\npositive control. Each of the HA-tagged pairs were transcribed and translated in\nrabbit reticulocyte lysates (detailed in Methods\nand Materials). Lysates were prepared under non-dissociating\nconditions for SDS-PAGE fractionation and immunoblotting with anti-HA mAb.As shown in Figure 2 and as\nanticipated, FOXP1 associated with the positive control, FOXP3. Otherwise, FOXP1\ninteracted exclusively with MyoD and none of the other bHLH proteins. The\nspecificity of the FOXP1-MyoD interaction was supported by the observation that\nFOXA1 and FOXP1 share significant conformational and sequence conservation\n(~90% identity/similarity within their Fkh domains). Curiously and\nreaddressed in Discussion, FOXA1 is a\ndirect activator of MyoD and Pax3/7 in myoblasts [27].Open in a separate windowFigure 2:FOXP1 selectively heterodimerizes with MyoD.Putative interaction of MYC-tagged- FOXP1 with several HA-tagged-bHLHs\nwas assessed by Co-IP. These included the 4 HA-tagged MRFs (MYF6, MRF4, MyoG,\nand MyoD), their interacting partner, HA-E47, as well as the distantly related\nbHLH factors HA-FOXA1 and HA-TAL1. A previously determined FOXP1 interacting\npartner, HA-FOXP3 (26) was employed as a positive control. Construct inserts\nwere in vitro transcribed and translated within rabbit\nreticulocyte lysates as detailed in Methods and\nMaterials. Lysates were prepared under non- dissociating conditions\nfor SDS-PAGE fractionation, then Co-IP was performed with MCK-FOXP1 and\nimmunoblotting with anti-HA mAb. FOXP1 associated with FOXP3 and MyoD. Controls:\n1% HA-tagged MRF inputs, HA-inputs and Ig-only blots.FOXP1 blocks DNA binding of MyoD homo- and heterodimers with specifically and\navidityWe cared out a series of EMSA DNA binding experiments to determine the\neffect of FOXP1 on MyoD homomeric and MyoD-E47 heteromeric DNA binding.\nInitially we employed a 32P-labled probe carrying a single MyoD\nbinding site from the MCK enhancer as probe. GST-linker histone H1.2 (dH1.2),\nGST-DC and GST-alone served as controls. As shown in Figure 3A, we observed that GST-Fkh strongly and\nspecifically inhibited the binding of MyoD homodimers and MyoD-E47 heterodimers\nwhen the dimers were allowed to form prior to addition of the Fkh proteins.Open in a separate windowFigure 3:FOXP1 specifically and avidly blocks DNA binding of MyoD homo- and\nheterodimers.Each of the EMSA experiments were performed with 32P-labled\nDNA or 32P-labled oligonucleotide probes. A. FOXP1\nspecifically blocks MyoD homodimer and MyoD-E47 heterodimer binding to the\nmuscle Creatin Kinase (MCK) promoter. EMSA was employed using bacterially\nexpressed MyoD (200ng/reaction), E47N (50ng/reaction) with GST-dH1.2, GST-dC and\nGST proteins (150ng/each) serving as controls. MyoD-E47 heterodimers were formed\nprior to addition of the GST-FOXP Forkhead domain (GST-Fkh) which was generated\nand purified in bacteria. GST-Fkh strongly and specifically inhibited the\nbinding of MyoD homodimers and MyoD-E47 heterodimers. B. Titration\nof GST-Fkh-mediated inhibition of MyoD and MyoD-E47 DNA binding. Using the probe\nemployed in (A), inhibition of DNA binding was determined as a function of\nGST-Fkh concentration. Proteins were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min;\nMyoD homodimers (200ng/reaction); E47N (50ng/reaction); GST-Fkh concentrations\n(ng) indicated on Fig. 3B. Full inhibition of MyoD dimers occurs at 100ng,\nwhereas full inhibition of E47N requires 400ng. FOXP1 binds preferentially to\nhomodimers. C.\nLanes 1-9: The effect of different concentrations of\nGST-Fkh on MyoD-E47N binding; MyoD (200ng), E47N (50ng), GST-Fkh levels shown on\nthe film. GSTdC added to control lane. Lanes 10-19: An\noligonucleotide (oligo) probe containing 1 MyoD and 1 NF-kB binding site (two\ndifferent binding sites on the same oligo). Lanes 10-13:\nBacterially expressed p50(\u03baB) binds specifically to the \u03baB\nrecognition site with no interference with GST-Fkh; Lane\n14: MyoD-E47N heterodimers bind to the same oligo.\nLanes 15-17: Binding of MyoD-E47N heterodimers and\np50 homodimers to the same oligo. The lower complex: p50 binding; the upper\ncomplex: double site binding. Lane 16: GST-Fkh inhibits\nprimarily MyoD-E47 complexes (lower intensity of the upper complex; higher\nintensity of the lower complex represents p50 binding). D.\nSpecificity and affinity of FOXP1-MyoD interaction. EMSA performed with an\nunrelated bHLH TF, FOXA1 and with the MyoD inhibitor, ID1. Full length FOXP1,\nFOXA1, MyoD, and ID1 were synthesized in vitro reticulocyte\nlysates (detailed in Materials and\nMethods). Neither FOXA1 nor FOXA1-1 super-shifted complexes formed by\nFOXP1-MyoD bound to the MCK promoter probe, whereas ID1 super-shifts occurred\nonly at 10-fold higher concentrations.We then titrated DNA binding over several concentrations of GST-Fkh by\nprior incubation of proteins with the same probe. We observed that full\ninhibition of MyoD homodimers occurred ~4 times more avidly than that of\nE47-MyoD monomers. This suggested that FOXP1 binds preferentially to homodimers\n(Figure 3B). GST-Fkh showed partial\nresistance when heated to 80\u00b0C for 5 minutes prior to initiation of the\nreaction with probe (Supplementary Figure 4). This suggested that FOXP1 stability is\nthermo-protected by MyoD association.Next, we tested the effect of different concentrations of FOXP1 on\nformation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers; GST-dC served as control (Figure 3C). In lanes 10-19, we employed as probe an\noligonucleotide that contains binding sites for MyoD and for NF-\u03baB p50.\nWe observed that in Lanes 10- 13, p50 binds specifically to its DNA recognition\nsite and GST-Fkh does not inhibit its binding. In Lanes 15-17, we observed that\nbinding of MyoD-E47 heterodimers and p50 homodimers to their respective sites\noccur even when delivered on the same oligonucleotide probe. The lower complex\nis composed of p50 and the upper complex represents double occupancy. As shown\nin Lane 16, GST-Fkh primarily inhibits MyoD-E47 complexes, further supporting\nthe specificity of the interaction. The GST-dC mutant in Lane 17 has no\ninhibitory effect.As might be expected from both the affinity and the specificity results\nabove, neither in vitro translated, full-length FOXA1 nor the\nunrelated bHLH TF, TAL1, super-shifted complexes formed by FOXP1-MyoD and\n32P-labeled MCK enhancer (Figure\n3D); ID super-shifts required a 10-fold higher concentration.Taken with the immunoprecipitation data of Figures 1 and \u200band2,2, these results\nsupport our structural- based hypothesis that FOXP1 interacts avidly and\nselectively both in vivo and in vitro with\nMyoD-DNA complexes.FOXP1 inhibits MyoD transcription in cultured myoblastsWe first employed transient transfection assays to determine the effect\nof FOXP1-MyoD interaction on MyoD-dependent transcriptional activation. We\nanalyzed transcription of an E box-containing luciferase reporter in 10T1/2\nmouse fibroblasts following 5-azacytidine induction to myoblasts. The luciferase\nplasmid was driven by the MCK enhancer\u2013an established MyoD target [29]. FOXP1 was provided in varying amounts\nas a CMV-based expression plasmid. As showed in Figure 4A, an ~20-fold reduction in firefly\nluciferase activity (normalized to renilla luciferase control)\nwas achieved in cells that received the highest input of FOXP1 (estimated as\n~3-fold molar excess over MyoD relative to empty vector control). Neither\na FOXP1-DNA binding domain mutant (FOXP1R525/A) [30] nor vector alone generated significant luciferase\nactivities (Figure 4A). This magnitude of\nrepression is similar to that reported previously [31] for ID/MyoD repression at equivalent DNA\nratios.Open in a separate windowFigure 4:FOXP1 inhibits MyoD transcription in cultured myoblasts and in\nvitro.A. FOXP1 repression of MCK E box-containing firefly\nluciferase expression [29] following\n5-azacytidine-mediated differentiation of T101/2 myoblasts. FOXP1 was\ntransfected at varying amounts (indicated on the x-axis as a CMV-based\nexpression plasmid. When normalized to co-transfected renilla\nluciferase controls, ~20- fold FOXP1 repression was observed in cells\nthat received the highest input of FOXP1 (estimated as ~3- fold molar\nexcess over MyoD relative to empty vector control). Negative controls include a\nFOXP1-DNA binding domain mutant (FOXP1R525/A) [30] and luciferase vector alone. B.\nFOXP1 repression of firefly luciferase driven by 2 E-box consensus MyoD binding\nsites (2R-luc) [32] measured 5 days post\ninduction of C2C12 differentiation. Negative controls included\nFOXP1R525/A. FOXP1 repressed 2R-luc ~12-fold as normalized\nto co-transfected \u03b2-galactosidase expression. C. Time course\nfollowing FOXP1 repression of a MCK-driven E box- luciferase reporter in C2C12\n(upper panel) or in 10T1/2 (lower panel). Shown in A-C are the means and\nstandard deviations of a minimum of 4 independent experiments. D.\nFOXP1 represses both basal and MYOD-activated transcription in\nvitro. Employing the methods detailed by Bengal et al. [33] (detailed in S-Methods), basal\ntranscription factors were fractionated from HeLa cells with E47, GST-Fkh, and\nGST-dH1.2 bacterially expressed and purified on glutathione beads. The\nAdenovirus Major Late Promoter (Ad MLP) affixed to 6 MyoD E-box binding sites\nfrom the MCK enhancer (Ad MLP+6MyoD binding sites) was employed as substrate.\nMyoD (200 ng/reaction), E47N and GST- dH1.2 (50ng/reaction); GST-Fkh (200\nng/reaction). Filled arrowhead points at transcripts of the control template (Ad\nMLP); open arrowhead, to transcripts from the test template (Ad MLP+6MyoD).We next utilized as substrate a construct in which expression of\nluciferase is driven by 2 E-box consensus MyoD binding sites (2R-luc) [32]. Luciferase activity was measured 4\ndays post induction of C2C12 differentiation. FOXP1 repressed this 2R-luc\nsubstrate ~12-fold when normalized to expression of co-transfected\n\u03b2-galactosidase (Figure 4B). DNA\nbinding-deficient FOXP1R525A served as a negative control.Finally, we performed a time-course in which luciferase activity of the\nMCK-driven E box- reporter was measured at various times following transfection\nand serum withdrawal (C2C12) or 5-azacytidine treatment (10T1/2). Corrected\nvalues over a course of 6 days were plotted and are shown in Figure 4C. We observed a general correlation with the\ntiming of MyoD myotonic conversion observed in Figures 1A and \u200band1B1B.FOXP1 represses both basal and MYOD-activated transcription in\nvitroReporter assays may fail to distinguish between transcriptional\ninitiation and post-transcriptional modifications (eg, transcript half-life,\npost-transcriptional modification). Thus, we carried out transcription\nin vitro following the general protocol of Bengal et al.\n[33]. As described previously [33,34 and S-Methods], basal transcription factors were fractionated\nfrom HeLa cells. E47, GST-Fkh, and GST-dH1.2 were bacterially expressed and\npurified on glutathione beads. For template, we employed the Adenovirus Major\nLate Promoter (Ad MLP) affixed to 6 MyoD E-box binding sites from the MCK\nenhancer [35]. As shown in Figure 4D, GST-Fkh repressed both MyoD-driven (Lanes 3\nand 4) and basal (Lanes 7 and 8) transcription, whereas controls provided no\nrepression.These results, coupled with those generated in luciferase assays,\nstrongly implicate FOXP1 as a direct transcriptional repressor of\nMyod1. However, we cannot eliminate squelching, which is\nrevisited in Discussion.FOXP1 retards the ability of MyoD to catalyze myoblastic differentiation and\nproliferationCultured C2C12 myocytes convert to elongated myoblasts and then to\nmyotubes either following serum withdrawal or when supplied with exogenous MyoD\nor several other bHLH myogenic regulators (13-16). This conversion can be\nmonitored anatomically and/or by immunostaining with skeletal muscle-specific\nantibodies.We engineered a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible FOXP1 over-expressing C2C12\ncell line via retroviral transduction. Our method is detailed in Materials and Methods and its doxycycline induction\nkinetics are shown in Supplementary Figure 5. Both the Tet response (R) elements within\nthe promoter and the Tet-controlled transactivator were optimized to achieve\nlowest background and highest expression (data not shown).\nLentiviral-Foxp1 was infected into C2C12 myocytes, cultured\nfor several generations and then Teton expression was initiated by\naddition of doxycycline (dox) 18 hours following serum-deprivation. We then\ncompared the induction kinetics with the TetR empty vector control\nover 6 days. As shown in Figure 5A, control\nC2C12 cell conversion is readily visible by day 4. However, soon after FOXP1\noverexpression is activated via dox, we observed significant retardation in the\ngeneration of myotubes. Quantification (Figure\n5B) of at least 5 independent measurements using epifluorescence\nmicroscopy indicated that the reduction was significant (p \u2264 0.05).Open in a separate windowFigure 5:FOXP1 retards MyoD-mediated myoblastic differentiation.A.

OE kinetics of GFP-illuminated C2C12 cells were measured\nthrough day 6.

EdU,\n5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine; p \u2264 0.05,*; p \u2264 0.01, **; n=4\n(Student\u2019s t tests).Aliquots of control and FOXP1 over-expressing C2C12 cells were analyzed\nat day 6 following serum withdrawal for accumulation of MRF proteins (Figure 5C). FOXP1 OE led to significant loss\nof MyoD, whereas MYF5, MyoG, and MRF4 protein levels were relatively unperturbed\nor slightly elevated. When quantified at the RNA level by RT-qPCR (Figure 5D), MyoD levels were reduced\n~4-fold by FOXP1 OE while other MRFs were either unaffected or modestly\nupregulated (Figure 5D).During muscle development and growth, quiescent satellite cells are\nactivated to proliferative myoblasts as myogenic progenitor cells. After several\nrounds of cell division, myoblasts arrest cell cycle and terminally\ndifferentiate into mononuclear contractile myocytes. We [7] previously observed that FOXP1 was required for\ncardiomyocyte proliferation during normal development. Cell numbers of C2C12\nFOXP1 OE myoblasts were compared to controls daily following serum withdrawal\nover a 96-hour time course. As shown in Figure\n5E, the number of Ctrl myoblasts were significantly higher than those\nin which FOXP1 was over-expressed. Next, we quantified their proliferative\nabilities by measuring DNA synthesis via the incorporation of\n5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) (Figure\n5F). The rate of EdU+ FOXP1 OE myoblasts (35\u00b11.4%)\n(49.0\u00b14.8%) were significantly reduced (p\u2264 0.01) relative to those\nof controls (50\u00b14.8%) (Figure 5G).\nThese data indicate that high levels of FOXP1 result in reduction of myoblast\nproliferation and fewer progenies than WT myoblasts.Collectively our results are consistent with the central hypothesis of\nthis report which holds that FOXP1 is a selective transcriptional repressor of\nMyoD. DiscussionMyoblast differentiation and proliferation are complex events that involve\nnumerous signaling molecules and transcription factors (TFs) (Supplementary Figure 1). The latter\ninclude the highly conserved and essential myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) along\nwith their positive (E12/E47) and negative (ID1-4) heterodimerization partners. In\nthe original cloning and characterization of FOXP1 (then termed QRF1) [1], our structural analysis of the FOXP1\nforkhead (Fkh) DNA binding domain arrived at an interesting, yet unexpected,\nconclusion (Supplementary Figure\n2A): That the FOXP1 Fkh domain shared significant linear and tertiary\nsimilarity with the bHLH domain of MyoD (Supplementary Figure 2B). Fkh\nsimilarity with the other MRFs was far less dramatic. Prompted by these results, we\npredicted that FOXP1 and MyoD not only interact, but do so with functional\nconsequences. Below we discuss the results generated from this hypothesis and\nconclude with a model that is predicted by them.Embryonic rationale for coordinated expression of FOXP1 and MyoDMyoD-expressing myoblasts ultimately withdraw from the cell cycle and\nfuse to form multinucleated myotubes [13\u201315]. Using\nfibroblast (10T1/2) and myocyte (C2C12) cell lines that undergo such\ndifferentiation following serum withdrawal or 5-azacytidine treatment, we\nobserved quite similar kinetics in the appearance of FOXP1 and MyoD [Figures 1A, and \u200band1B].1B]. This was unanticipated, given that MyoD is expressed\nexclusively in skeletal muscle and its progenitors [13\u201315],\nwhereas FOXP1 is expressed far more broadly during adult and embryonic\ndevelopment [1\u20139]. For example, FOXP1 plays critical roles in\ndevelopment of spinal motor neurons, lymphocytes, bones and connective tissue\n[6\u20139].A potential unifying explanation is that both MyoD and FOXP1 are\ncritical to cardiomyocyte development and function. FOXP is expressed in\ncardiomyocytes underlying the cushion mesenchyme and in the endocardium [3,6,10]. FOXP1 regulates\nvarious aspects of cardiac development, and its loss leads to death and/or\ncomplex cardiac phenotypes. In particular, these include defects in outflow\ntract septation, increased myocardial proliferation, and thinning of ventricular\nmyocardium.With respect to MyoD, skeletal and cardiac muscle both arise from\nmyogenic mesodermal lineages and share many characteristics [36,37]. The\nexpression patterns of essential TFs and myosin heavy chain (MHC) within\nventricular myocardium and skeletal muscle are similar in late embryogenesis\n[13,38]. These expression patterns become specified as cardiac- or\nskeletal muscle-only during postnatal development [13,24].\nCertain forms of muscular dystrophies associate with cardiomyopathy and chronic\ncardiac diseases [38]. Another curious\nobservation is that FOXP1 is expressed in both neural crest-derived cells\n(precursors of bone and tendon) and mesoderm-derived myoblasts [39]. Indeed, fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed\nto cardiomyocyte-like cells by introducing fusions of the MyoD transactivation\ndomain [40].The overlapping pattern of MyoD and FOXP1 during cardiac/skeletal muscle\ndevelopment, along with the common origin of their cardiac/muscle pathologies,\nsuggest an underlying regulatory program for control. While \u201ccore\u201d\nmuscle factors such as the MRFs and key TFs (eg, MEF2, GATA and TBX) govern\nheart development, they primarily contribute to chamber myocardium as opposed to\nthe initial commitment to cardiomyocytes. Thus, understanding the mechanism\nunderlying these initial steps is necessary and will be essential for\nunderstanding medical issues relevant to FOXP1, such as cardiomyocyte\nregeneration [14,15].FOXP1 and MyoD heteromerization specificityThe similarity of Helices 1 and 2 of Fkh, with the amphipathic\nstructures of MRFs in length and hydrophobicity (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3), prompted our\nextension of the MyoD-FOXP1 interaction to the 3 other MRFs (MYF6, MRF4 and\nMyoG) and their interacting partner (E47). We also tested TAL-1, a distant bHLH\nprotein, as well as the highly similar bHLH, FOXA1. Our Co-IP analyses performed\nin reticulocyte lysates led to the unexpected finding that FOXP1 interacted only\nwith MyoD and its previously established [23] partner, FOXP3 (Figure 2).\nThese results suggest that the amphipathic helices 1 and 2 of FOXP1 and MyoD are\nboth necessary and sufficient for the interaction.Since FOXP1 and MyoD each have extensive non-family interactions, we\nfind it useful to speculate how, in vivo, their complex might\nbe augmented. MyoD interacts with c-JUN [41], which along with FOS, constitute the NFAT DNA binding and the\nsynergistic NFAT\u2013FOS\u2013JUN\u2013DNA quaternary complex [42]. Initially thought to be T\nlymphocyte-specific, it is now well established that NFAT proteins direct\nspecific biological programs in a variety of cells and tissues [43]. Both MyoD and FOXP1 interact with the SMAD\ncomplex\u2013SMAD3 with FOXP1 in mesendoderm progenitors and SMADs 3 and 5\nwith MyoD in myoblasts [44\u201346]. NCOR2, a transcriptional co-repressor\nthat promotes chromatin condensation, interacts not only with FOXP1 but with the\nSMAD1-4 complex theoretically formed by FOXP1 and MyoD [44\u201346].These protein-protein interactions provide the hypothetical\nmacro-complex illustrated in Supplementary Figure 6A. There is no direct evidence of such a\ncomplex. However, MyoD and MYF5 contain specific domains that, when aggregated,\nmediated chromatin remodeling [47]. We\nspeculate that the chromatin structure established by this set of\nlineage-determining proteins might selectively constrain the activity of other\nMRFs and add transcriptional specificity to MyoD/FOXP1 heterodimers.DNA binding experiments confirm affinity and specificity of the FOXP1-MyoD\ninteractionEMSA DNA binding experiments not only confirmed but provided additional\ndetails of the interaction of the FOXP1 fkh domain with the bHLH of MyoD. First,\nwe observed that if either MyoD homodimers or MyoD-E47 heterodimers were\npre-bound to the MCK enhancer, the FOXP1 fkh domain was capable of replacing\nthem (Figure 3A). Full inhibition of MyoD\nhomodimers occurred at ~4-fold lower FOXP1 fkh concentration, plus FOXP1\nwas thermo-protected by the binding of MyoD (Supplementary Figure 4). These\nresults identified MyoD homodimers as the preferred FOXP1 target and suggested\nthat their association might stabilize their complex from degradation (Figure 3B; Supplementary Figure 4).Further support for the specificity and affinity of FOXP1 for MyoD was\nprovided in Figure 3D. While neither FOXA1\nnor TAL-1 super-shifted complexes of FOXP1-MyoD, FOXP1 super-shifts occurred at\n10-fold lower concentrations than required for ID (Figure 3D). Finally, as additional support for specificity, an oligo\nprobe carrying both MyoD and NF-\u03baB p50 binding sites was bound by both\nTFs, whereas addition of FOXP1 Fkh inhibited only formation of MyoD-E47 dimers\n(Figure 3C).These results suggested that FOXP1 might function by increasing the\nMyoD-E47-dissociation rate or by preventing the bHLH heterodimer from rebinding\nDNA when they transiently dissociate (readdressed below).FOXP1 directly inhibits MyoD transcription in cultured myoblastsWe analyzed the effect of FOXP1 on MyoD transcription initially by\ntransient transfection either 4 days or as a time course following serum\nwithdrawal (C2C12) or 5-azacytidine treatment (10T1/2). We measured the time\ncourse of FOXP1 repression of a single E-box-containing luciferase as well as\nits steady state activity against a 6 E-box luciferase; each were driven by the\nMCK enhancer (Figures 4A\u20134C). Overall the magnitude of FOXP1\nrepression was ~12-30-fold. These results further suggested that maximal\nrepression was achieved near the time of maximal FOXP1 expression during\nmyoblast development (Figures 1A and \u200band1B1B).To circumvent caveats associated with luciferase assay interpretation,\nwe measured FOXP1 repression in vitro by employing 6 MyoD\nE-boxes driven by the Adenovirus major late promoter [33]. We observed that FOXP1 strongly repressed both\nbasal and E-box-driven transcription (Figure\n4D).Collectively these results strongly implicate FOXP1 as a direct\ntranscriptional repressor of Myod1. However, caution must be\napplied, particularly regarding the in vitro results of Figure 4D. These data do not eliminate the\npossibility that FOXP1 may interact directly or indirectly with basal\ntranscription factors to prevent their interactions with enhancer/promoter\nsequences (Supplementary\nFigure 1); i.e., squelching. This possibility requires further\ntesting. One target of such investigation is the FOXP1-interacting protein,\nBromodomain PHD Finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) [48]. As a histone-binding component of the NURF\nnucleosome- remodeling factor, BPTF catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding\nto facilitate transcription of chromatin.Potential mechanism(s) of FOXP1 repressionA central, remaining question is the mechanism by which FOXP1 acts to\nselectively repress MyoD. In addition to ID1-4, several other MyoD repressors\nhave been identified (Supplementary Figure 1; reviewed by Wardle, [15]). SIM2 is a bHLH-PAS TF expressed in muscle\nprogenitors prior to their migration into the limb [49]. SIM2 appears to prevent entry into the myogenic\nprogram via binding to the CE enhancer (Supplementary Figure 1) in\nembryonic mouse limb buds [49]. DELTEX2\nis an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is expressed during adult muscle cell\nregeneration in myogenic progenitor cells where it inhibits myogenic\ndifferentiation [15]. DELTEX2 binds the\nDRR and PRR regions but not to the CE region of Myod1. This\nleads to an enrichment of the repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me2, likely through\ninhibiting the lysine demethylase JMJD1C. Myostatin/GDF8, which is produced and\nreleased by myocytes acts on muscle autocrine function to inhibit primarily at\nthe level of myoblast proliferation [50].\nWe find it interesting in the context of our model (Supplementary Figure 6A) that\nMyostatin inhibition is mediated through SMAD3. However, Myostatin does not\nshare the MyoD specificity of FOXP1, as it inhibits each of the four MRFs [50].For TFs to direct the activation or repression of gene expression, DNA\nmust be accessible for them to bind. A number of reports have implicated\nenhancer/promoter accessibility of MyoD enhancer and promoter sequences through\nmultiple epigenetic mechanisms. These include DNA methylation, histone\nmodification and non-coding RNAs (reviewed in [15]).The C/EBP homology protein (CHOP), is expressed in quiescent\nsatellite cells and transiently during myoblast differentiation in\nvitro [15]. Overexpression\nof CHOP inhibits myogenesis by binding upstream of the MyoD TSS (Supplementary Figure 1). CHOP\nappears to act via regulating and directly interacting with HDAC1 (51). Using\ngenome-wide approach to identify MyoD modulators, Blum et al. [52] observed requirements for diminished H3K4me1,\nacetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) and reduced recruitment of the H3K4 monomethylase\nby SET7. In the context of our conjecture above regarding basal transcription\nfactors, MyoD regulatory elements are associated with recruitment of Pol II as\nwell as ncRNAs [15]. Finally, genome-wide\nanalysis led to the identification of TWIST2 as another repressor of myogenic\ndifferentiation [53] (Supplementary Figure 1). Knockdown\nof TWIST2 in Rhabdomyosarcoma cells resulted in up-regulation of MyoD and MyoG\nas well as a decrease in proliferation.FOXP1 interacts with several epigenetic modifiers that catalyze\nrepressive marks. These include Metastasis-associated protein (MTA1), a\ncomponent of the histone-deacetylase multi-protein complex, NuRD [54]. NuRD regulates transcription by\nmodifying the acetylation status of target chromatin. The FOXP1 interacting\nprotein SATB2, on the other hand, binds to DNA at nuclear matrix-associated\nregions (MARs), which have been shown to induce local chromatin-loop remodeling\nby recruiting chromatin remodeling or HDAC co-repressors [55]. Of particular interest in the present context is\nthe interaction of FOXP1 with NCOR2/SMRT [56], which bridges our theoretical FOXP1-MyoD super-complex via\njoint binding with SMADs1-4 (Supplementary Figure 6A). The transcriptional activity of the\nSMAD2/3:SMAD4 heterotrimer can recruit NCOR2 and possibly other transcriptional\nrepressors (reviewed in [57]).It will be informative to follow these leads with\nMyod1ChIP experiments to measure the promoter/enhancers\noccupancy of FOXP1 and its potential co-occupancy with previously mapped factors\nshown in Supplementary Figure\n1.FOXP1 functions as a selective repressor of MyoD-mediated myocyte\ndifferentiationWhen FOXP1 overexpression in C2C12 myocytes was initiated following\nserum withdrawal-mediated differentiation, significant retardation of myotubes\nwas observed (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 5). FOXP1\nrepression was selective, as we observed no reduction of MYF5, MyoG, or MRF4\naccumulation when measured either at the protein or RNA levels (Figures 5B and \u200band5C5C).Loss of a number of myogenic regulators as well as epigenetic modifiers\nhave been shown to mediate myocyte differentiation/proliferation defects [15]. A particularly relevant one is FOXA1.\nWe observed no formation of an FOXA1-MyoD heterodimer (Figure 2A). However, Hu et al. [27] demonstrated that FOXA1 was a direct activator of\nMyoD transcription, and its knockdown led to decreased in vitro\nmyocyte differentiation. They further showed that Foxa1 null\nmice are reduced in their ability to regenerate muscle [27]. While FOXP1 and FOXA1 share high Fkh sequence\nsimilarity, they play opposite roles in MyoD transcription. A potential\ncontributor may be the enormous difference in their abilities to equilibrate\nbetween homomeric and heterodimeric states [11]; i.e., domain swapping. Homodimer dissociation of FOXP1 in\nnearly 1,000 times faster and more favorable than in many other proteins,\nincluding FOXA1 [11]. This may allow\nFOXP1 to maintain the folding stability and cooperativity of Helix3 within the\nDNA binding Fkh domain.We further suggest that the kinetics of domain swapping within fkh Helix\n3 favors FOXP1-MyoD heteromeric association because it is essential for their\ninteraction (Figure 2B and \u200band2C;2C; Supplementary Figure 2). We find it interesting in this context that\nmutations affecting domain swapping of FOXP proteins are involved in severe\ndiseases, including the IPEX syndrome in humans [58,59].A displacement model for FOXP1 repression at the late stage of MyoD-mediated\nmyogenesisOur rationale for the work described in this report was based on the\nfollowing observations:1) Helices 1 and 2 of FOXP1 resemble helices 2 and 1 of some, but not\nall bHLH proteins, in amphipathicity and hydrophobic core residues; 2) the best\nmatch for the above observation is MyoD; 3) The ID1 MyoD repressor is expressed\nrelatively early and the FOXP1 repressor is expressed relatively late in\nmyogenesis; 4) MyoD, ID and FOXP1 are expressed in muscle-restricted tissues.\nThese observations led us to hypothesize that FOXP1 will displace ID at the\nlater stage of myogenesis to insure continual opportunity for repression;\nperhaps under conditions of muscle damage.The data supporting this hypothesis and the additional experimental\nextensions generated in this report are: 1) FOXP1 heterodimerizes selectively\nwith MyoD and not with other MRFs or bHLH domains; 2) this interaction competes\nwith MyoD homodimerization and/or with MyoD-E47 heterodimerization; 3) through\nthis \u201cquenching interaction, FOXP1 represses the ability of MyoD to\ntransactivate E-box driven promoters; 4) FOXP1 impedes the ability of MyoD to\ncatalyze myocyte to myoblast differentiation.We have rolled these observations into the model of Supplementary Figure 6B. The model\nholds that at high serum concentration and/or early in myogenesis, ID is\navailable to repress MyoD by stripping off the E12/E47 activator. Under low ID\nconditions, MyoD homodimers are available to activate their own gene expression\nas well as early-stage myogenic proliferation genes. When myoblast proliferation\nis retarded either by normal conditions (or experimentally by reducing serum\nconcentrations), ID is turned off and MyoD is released from ID. This allows it\nreassociation with E12 or E47 to reestablish heterodimers that positively\ntransactivate essential differentiation genes (eg, via E-boxes upstream of\nMck). At later stages of myogenesis, in which proliferation\nis halted and differentiation proceeds, FOXP1 is expressed. We suggest that it\nthen out-competes/displaces E12/E47 to form a repressive FOXP1-MyoD complex.\nFOXP1 expression remains available to aid in insuring further MyoD repression as\nwell as for regulation of additional differentiation-specific genes.This model provides a number of testable opportunities. These include\nthe potential role of FOXP1 in late myoblast proliferative arrest. Supportive\nmechanistic rationale includes the observations that FOXP1 coordinates\ncardiomyocyte proliferation [10] as well\nT-cell quiescence, as defined by reversible cell cycle arrest in the Go phase\n[60,61].We also point out that FOXP1 is processed into at least 5 previously\ncharacterized isoforms [5]. While our Fkh\n\u201conly\u201d DNA binding domain is not subject to alternative\nprocessing, our full-length experiments utilized only the ~80kD FOXP1\n\u201clong\u201d isoform [5], which is\nthe major species expressed in skeletal/cardiac muscle [4,7]. Extending\nthe studies presented here to alternative FOXP1 isoforms might prove useful in\ndeciphering the subtleties of FOXP1 structure with MyoD function.

The\ntypical EMSA mixture (20 pl) contained 12.5 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCI, 5 mM\nMgCl2 7.5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 pg of poly(dI-dC),\ndifferent concentrations of the bacterial-synthesized or in vitro translated\nproteins, and 10-20 fmol of 32P-labeled probe. In most cases, 1 pl of\nwhole-cell extract or nuclear extract (10 mg/ml) was added to the reaction. When\nheterodimeric complexes were formed, the proteins were added before the probe\nand left to incubate at 37\u00b0C for 10 min.The binding reaction took place at 30\u00b0C for 20 min. The reaction\nmixture was then applied to a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25X TBE\n(lx TBE = 90 mM Tris/64.6 mM borate/2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) and electrophoresed at\n20 mA at 40\u00b0C.In the dissociation-rate experiments, the same binding conditions were\napplied, but the reactions were scaled-up according to the number of time points\nthat were taken. After 30 min of binding at 30\u00b0C, 100 ng of\nnonradioactive competitor oligonucleotide at each time point was added (200-500\nexcess over probe DNA). Samples (20 pl) were then taken at different times after\nthe addition of nonradioactive competitor and loaded immediately onto a gel that\nwas running at 40\u00b0C.Transfections and luciferase AssaysTransient transfections were performed with Fugene6 (Boehringer\nMannheim) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. C2C12 and 10T\u00bd\ncells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO/BRL). Briefly, 0.3 \u03bcg of\nreporter [4R-tk-luc [64] or MCK4800-luc\n[65]] and 0.3-12 \u03bcg of each\nactivator (EMSV-MyoD, EMSV-FOXP1, EMSV-FOXP1R525A) was mixed with 3 \u03bcl of\nFugene6 and added to cells in six-well plates. After 24 hr, the medium was\nchanged to differentiation medium (DMEM with 2% horse serum), and 24 to 96 hr\nlater, cells were harvested for dual luciferase [66] and \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) [67]. Luciferase activities were normalized to\n\u03b2-gal and are reported in comparison to the basal activity of the\nparental vectors. Samples were processed at the above mentioned time points\nusing passive lysis buffer (Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system,\nE1910). Firefly luciferase activity was measured (Spectra max, Molecular devices\nand Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific) after adding the respective substrate in\nthe samples. P-values were calculated for 5 assays done in triplicates.In vitro transcription/translationbHLH proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated\nin a coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate using HA-tagged constructs in\npEMSVscribe, a plasmid in which the LTR and SV-40 poly(A) addition signal are\nflanked, respectively, by T3 and T7 promoters (Promega). Plasmids were\nlinearized and in vitro translation (l-2 ug RNA 50 ul/) was\ncarried out for 90 min at 30\u00b0C using rabbit reticulocyte lysate\n(Promega). To generate radiolabeled proteins, we employed\n35S-methionine (>800 mmol; New England Nuclear). Translation\nreactions were stored at \u221270\u00b0C prior to analysis on SDS-PAGE.In vitro transcriptionIn vitro transcription was performed according to the\nmethod of Bengal et al. [33] and detailed\nin S-Methods. Briefly, MyoD binding sites (MBS) were inserted into plasmid\npML-52/260, which carries the adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) major late promoter (MLP)\nand a G-less cassette of 260 bp. The clones used for our studies carried six MBS\n(generated as direct repeats of a 33 bp) and 4 mut MBS (two direct repeats of\nthe ds 33-mer). MyoD proteins were purified by standard procedures, and E47N\nprotein was expressed and purified as described [33]. Partial purification of basal TFs were prepared as described\n[34]. Transcription factors IIB and\nIIE (TFIIB and TFIIE) were purified from recombinant E. coli cells [68,69]. TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIF, and TFIIH were purified from 500 ml\nof HeLa nuclear extract. Steps used to generate the TFIIA, TFIID.TFIIF and TFIIH\nwere previously described [70]. RNA\npolymerase II was purified essentially as described [71].Transcription reaction mixtures for crude nuclear extracts are detailed\nin Bengal et al. [16]. Nuclear extract\nwas added together at the designated amounts of bacterially expressed proteins\nas described in the legend to Figure 4D.\nTwo DNA templates (control and test) were added to each reaction at 50-250 fmol\neach. Reaction mixtures were preincubated for 45-60 min at room temperature\nbefore nucleotides were added to initiate the reactions. Then nucleotide\ntriphosphates (NTPs) were added (0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CTP, and 15 \u03bcM UTP)\nplus ~10 \u03bcCi/reaction of [\u03b1-32P]UTP (800\nCi/mmol). Reactions were terminated by the addition of RNase T1 (Boehringer\nMannheim) at 300C for 60 min, 0.2% SDS and proteinase K (660 ug/ml). After 10\nmin at 37\u00b0C, reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol/chloroform 1:1\n(vol/vol), and transcripts were precipitated with ethanol. Reactions were then\nvisualized on SDS-PAGE.
