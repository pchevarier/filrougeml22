To repair damaged DNA and preserve genomic stability, eukaryotic cells developed sophisticated and highly efficient DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Defective DDR could lead therefore to accumulation of mutations and genetic instability fueling tumorigenesis 1, 2, 3. Growing body of evidence shows that transcription activity is rapidly and transiently paused in response to DNA damage to eliminate production of abnormal transcripts and to avoid deleterious collisions between transcription and repair machineries 4, 5, 6. UV\u2010induced DNA damage causes both global and local transcriptional repressions at sites of damage 7, 8, 9. Similarly, double\u2010strand breaks (DSBs) inhibit transcription activity of RNA polymerase I in ATM/NBS1/MDC1\u2010dependent manner 10. Moreover, the activity of ATM and DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK) is critical for local inhibition of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity at DSB sites 11, 12. Several targets of ATM kinase, such as the ubiquitin ligases RNF8/168 that monoubiquitinate H2A\u2010K119 and catalyze the formation of K63\u2010linked polyubiquitination chain of histones H1, H2A, and H2AX 13, 14, 15, 16, PBAF complex, PcG proteins, and the transcription elongation factor ENL, were recently shown to participate in blocking transcription after DSB induction 11, 17, 18. In addition, it was suggested that the activity of PARP1 enzyme promotes transcriptional repression at DNA damage sites likely by recruiting the repressive complexes NuRD and PcG 19, 20. However, depletion of these complexes shows partial alleviation of transcriptional repression after DNA damage, suggesting that additional yet unknown factors, regulated by PARP1 activity, are required to switch off transcription after DNA damage.The negative elongation factor (NELF) composes of WHSC2/NELF\u2010A, COBRA1/NELF\u2010B, NELF\u2010E, and NELF\u2010C/D subunits. NELF cooperates with DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) to repress transcriptional elongation by Pol II 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. NELF\u2010E, the smallest subunit of the NELF complex, composed of 380 amino acids that consists of an N\u2010terminal leucine zipper (LZ) motif, a central domain rich in Arg\u2010Asp dipeptide repeats (RD motif), and a C\u2010terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) 26. The LZ motif mediates proteins dimerization and facilitates binding to DNA 27, 28. NELF\u2010E RRM domain shows preference for RNA binding over DNA, and it is important for the transcriptional repression activity of NELF complex 21. Here, we unprecedentedly demonstrate that NELF\u2010E is preferentially recruited to DSBs nearby transcriptionally active genes in a PARP\u20101\u2010dependent manner to underpin transcriptional repression and promote timely repair of DSBs. ResultsThe negative transcription elongation complex NELF promotes transcriptional silencing following DSB inductionNELF complex cooperates with DSIF to repress transcriptional elongation by RNA Pol II 21, 22. In addition, three quantitative proteomics screens showed that NELF\u2010E subunit undergoes phosphorylation in response to DNA damage 29, 30, 31. These observations prompted us to determine whether NELF complex is implicated in DSB\u2010induced transcriptional silencing. Here, we present two lines of evidence showing that NELF\u2010E subunit is required for transcriptional silencing following DSB induction. First, we measured global transcription activity in mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells before and after ionizing radiation (IR) using CLICK\u2010IT methodology, which is based on incorporation of 5\u2010ethynyl uridine (5\u2010EU) into newly synthesized RNA 32. Consistent with previous reports 10, we observed that control cells exhibit ~40% reduction in transcription activity at 30 min after IR. On the other hand, NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells show milder reduction in transcription activity after IR (~5%; Fig \u200bFig1A1A and B). Interestingly, at 60 min after IR both mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells show recovery of transcriptional activity. However, NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells exhibit elevated rate of transcription compared to control cells (Fig \u200b(Fig1B).1B). We concluded therefore that NELF\u2010E contributes to transient transcription shutdown in response to IR. Second, we tested the effect of NELF\u2010E on transcription of a specific gene before and after DSB induction. Toward this end, we used an elegant reporter cell line named U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 33, 34, 35 that was recently modified by the Yasui laboratory 18. This single\u2010cell assay allows monitoring transcription of the MS2 gene following induction of DSB upstream of its promoter region using I\u2010SceI endonuclease (Fig \u200b(Fig1C).1C). To activate transcription of the MS2 gene, cells are transfected with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER plasmid, which expresses a cytoplasmic Cherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER chimera, and addition of tamoxifen (Tam) drives its migration into the nucleus, which binds the TRE repeats and induces transcription of the MS2 gene. To visualize nascent transcription of MS2, cells are co\u2010transfected with pYFP\u2010MS2 plasmid, which expresses YFP\u2010MS2 protein that binds the MS2 stem loops (Fig \u200b(Fig1C).1C). To study the effect of DSB on the transcription of the MS2 gene, U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells are transfected with pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmid expressing I\u2010SceI endonuclease that generates DSB upstream of the MS2 gene. DSB induction can be validated by immunostaining with \u03b3H2AX antibody 18. To test whether NELF\u2010E is involved in transcriptional repression after DSB induction, U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were transfected with control and NELF\u2010E siRNAs (Fig \u200b(Fig1D),1D), and 72 h post\u2010transfection, nascent MS2 transcripts were visualized in the absence of DSBs (by co\u2010transfecting the cells with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER and pYFP\u2010MS2 plasmids) and in the presence of DSBs (by co\u2010transfecting the cells with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER, pYFP\u2010MS2, and pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmids). In accordance with earlier findings 18, 35, the MS2 gene is transcribed in cells expressing Cherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER fusion as evident by the co\u2010localization of YFP and mCherry foci (Fig \u200b(Fig1E,1E, top panel), and DSB induction represses MS2 expression (Fig \u200b(Fig1E,1E, second panel). Similar to mock cells, NELF\u2010E depletion has no discernible effect on MS2 expression in the absence of DSBs (Fig \u200b(Fig1E,1E, third panel). However in striking contrast to mock cells, ~70% of NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells express MS2 in the presence of DSBs (Fig \u200b(Fig1E,1E, bottom panel). Of note, the intensity of \u03b3H2AX foci at DSB sites was not affected by NELF\u2010E depletion (Fig \u200b(Fig1F).1F). Altogether, these observations provide firm evidence that NELF\u2010E participates in DSB\u2010induced transcriptional silencing. Notably, as shown earlier 21, depletion of NELF\u2010E concomitantly disrupts the integrity of NELF complex as evident by the degradation of NELF\u2010A and NELF\u2010B proteins in MCF7 and U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells (Appendix Fig S1A\u2013D). Therefore, the alleviation of transcriptional repression following DSB is likely due to disruption of the entire NELF complex rather than sole depletion of NELF\u2010E subunit. In agreement with previous reports 11, 17, 18, pharmacological inhibition of ATM disrupts DSB\u2010induced transcriptional silencing of the MS2 gene (Appendix Fig S2A and B). Interestingly, ATM inhibition in NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells did not cause synergistic or additive effects on the transcription of the MS2 gene when compared to cells treated with ATM inhibitor only, indicating that ATM and NELF\u2010E might function in the same silencing pathway (Appendix Fig S2A and B).Open in a separate windowFigure 1NELF\u2010E contributes to transcriptional silencing in response to DSBs\nWestern blot shows knockdown of NELF\u2010E in U2OS cells.

Mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were transfected with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER and pYFP\u2010MS2 plasmids and treated with 1 \u03bcM tamoxifen for 2 h to activate transcription of the MS2 gene. To induce DSB upstream of the MS2 gene, cells were transfected with a third plasmid expressing I\u2010SceI endonuclease. Cells were fixed and immunostained with \u03b3H2AX. Representative images were acquired using confocal microscope. Graph displays the percentage of cells that show colocalization of YFP\u2010MS2 and Cherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER.

Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm.Quantitative measurements show that NELF\u2010E depletion has no detectable effect on the fluorescence intensity of \u03b3H2AX foci at DSB sites. Red horizontal bars indicate the mean fluorescence intensity of \u03b3H2AX in cells.\nNELF\u2010E is recruited to DNA damage sites to promote transcriptional silencingTo further investigate how NELF\u2010E promotes transcriptional silencing after DSB induction, we monitored the subcellular localization of NELF subunits after DNA damage. While NELF\u2010B and NELF\u2010C/D subunits show no detectable changes in their localization following laser microirradiation (Appendix Fig S3), EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E and EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010A show rapid recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sites. Their accumulation becomes detectable as early as 10 s with peak intensity at about 2\u20133 min (Fig \u200b(Fig2A).2A). Notably, NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A subunits are essential for the transcriptional pause activity of NELF complex 26. Hereafter, we decided to focus on NELF\u2010E subunit. Deletion mapping analysis shows that the N\u2010terminal (encompassing amino acids 1\u2013250 and containing the LZ domain), but not the C\u2010terminal of NELF\u2010E (encompassing amino acids 250\u2013380 and containing the RRM domain), is recruited to laser\u2010microirradiated sites (Appendix Fig S4A). Correspondingly, further deletion mapping revealed that the LZ motif, but not the RRM domain or the RD repeats, is essential for NELF\u2010E recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sites (Appendix Fig S4B and C). Importantly, these results genetically uncouple the two functional domains of NELF\u2010E: the first includes the LZ motif that is critical for NELF\u2010E accumulation at DNA damage sites, and the second is the RRM domain that is important for the transcriptional repression activity of NELF complex 21. We took advantage of these observations to address the role of NELF\u2010E domains in DSB\u2010induced transcriptional silencing. Complementing NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells with construct expressing Flag\u2010NELF\u2010Edel(LZ) (unable to accumulate at DNA damage sites) fails to restore DSB\u2010induced silencing of the MS2 gene. In addition, only ~40% of the cells that were complemented with Flag\u2010NELF\u2010Edel(RRM) (accumulates at DNA damage sites but lost its transcriptional repressive activity) show silencing of the MS2 gene after DSB induction (Fig \u200b(Fig2B2B and Appendix Fig S5). Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that the accumulation of NELF\u2010E at DNA damage sites and its repressive activity are both required for switching off transcription in response to DSBs.Open in a separate windowFigure 2NELF\u2010E is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites to induce transcriptional silencing\nRepresentative time\u2010lapse images showing the localization of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E and EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010A after laser microirradiation targeted to a particular region marked by white rectangle. Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm. Graph on the right shows fold increase in the relative fluorescence intensity at laser\u2010microirradiated sites. Results shown are typical of four independent experiments and represent 40 different cells. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM).NELF\u2010E recruitment to DSB is critical for transcriptional silencing. NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were transfected with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER, pYFP\u2010MS2, and pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmids along with either of the indicated constructs expressing Flag fused to NELF\u2010EWT, NELF\u2010Edel(LZ), or NELF\u2010Edel(RRM). Cells were immunostained with \u03b3H2AX (gray). Graph displays the percentage of \u03b3H2AX\u2010positive cells that show colocalization of YFP and Cherry foci. White arrowheads mark the location of the MS2 reporter cassette. Data represent the mean of two biological repeats. Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm.\nPreferential accumulation of endogenous NELF\u2010E at DSB nearby transcriptionally active genesTo further corroborate the recruitment of NELF\u2010E to DNA lesions, we decided to visualize the accumulation of endogenous NELF\u2010E protein at I\u2010SceI\u2010induced DSB using the reporter U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells. To achieve this, U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were transfected with pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmid and co\u2010stained for NELF\u2010E and \u03b3H2AX. Surprisingly, no accumulation of NELF\u2010E was observed at \u03b3H2AX\u2010positive regions (Fig \u200b(Fig3A;3A; suitability of NELF\u2010E antibody for immunofluorescence analysis was confirmed; Appendix Fig S6). Given that the MS2 gene is silent in these cells, we predicted that NELF\u2010E might accumulate at DSBs nearby transcriptionally active genes. To test this prediction, U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were subjected to two sequential transfections, first with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER and treated with Tam to activate transcription of the MS2 gene and second with pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmid to induce DSB, and then immunostained for NELF\u2010E and \u03b3H2AX antibodies. Results show remarkable accumulation of NELF\u2010E that co\u2010localizes with \u03b3H2AX foci (Fig \u200b(Fig3B,3B, top panel). Importantly, no detectable accumulation of NELF\u2010E was observed in cells transfected only with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER plasmid and treated with Tam, suggesting that the observed NELF\u2010E foci are due to DSBs rather than transcription activation of the MS2 gene (Fig \u200b(Fig3B,3B, bottom panel). Altogether, the interpretation of these experiments is that NELF\u2010E shows preferential accumulation at DSBs induced adjacent to transcriptionally active sites. To further substantiate this important finding, we set up a novel system to monitor the accumulation of endogenous NELF\u2010E at DSBs induced by CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system upstream of the A20 gene in its active and inactive transcriptional states (Fig \u200b(Fig3C).3C). Toward this end, we used HeLa cells in which the A20 gene is transcriptionally silent and becomes active following administration of TNF\u03b1 as evident by ~eightfold increase in its mRNA levels (Appendix Fig S7A). HeLa cells were untreated or treated with TNF\u03b1 and transfected with expression vectors encoding EGFP\u2010Cas9 endonuclease and a specific gRNA to introduce DSBs upstream of the promoter region of the A20 gene. Cells were then subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using NELF\u2010E antibody [the suitability of NELF\u2010E antibody for ChIP was confirmed (Appendix Fig S7B)] and \u03b3H2AX antibody as a positive control for DSB induction. NELF\u2010E shows ~30\u2010fold increase at sequences surrounding DSB sites of transcriptionally active A20 gene comparing to ~fivefold increase when A20 is silent (Fig \u200b(Fig3D).3D). On the other hand, only moderate changes in \u03b3H2AX levels at DSB sites were observed following A20 activation (Fig \u200b(Fig3D).3D). Importantly, the increase in the amount of NELF\u2010E at the A20 gene following TNF\u03b1 treatment is not due to overall increase in its protein levels (Appendix Fig S8). Altogether, these observations show that NELF\u2010E is preferentially recruited to DSBs nearby transcriptionally active genes. Broadly speaking, this preferential recruitment could be dependent on either the activity or the presence of RNA Pol II, which was shown to accumulate upstream of the A20 gene following TNF\u03b1 treatment 36.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Endogenous NELF\u2010E shows preferential recruitment to DSBs nearby transcriptionally active gene\nRepresentative cell showing that NELF\u2010E is not recruited to I\u2010SceI\u2010induced DSBs upstream of transcriptionally inactive MS2 gene. U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were transfected with pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI plasmid to induce DSB upstream of the silent MS2 gene. 24 h post\u2010transfection cells were fixed and co\u2010stained for NELF\u2010E (green) and \u03b3H2AX (gray).

Top panel shows that NELF\u2010E is recruited to I\u2010SceI\u2010induced DSBs upstream of transcriptionally active gene. Bottom panel shows no accumulation of NELF\u2010E at transcriptionally active MS2 gene in the absence of DSBs. Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm. Graph on the right displays the percentage of cells that show colocalization of NELF\u2010E and \u03b3H2AX. White arrowheads mark the location of the MS2 reporter cassette. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.A diagram showing the layout of a ChIP experiment that aims to test the accumulation of NELF\u2010E at DSBs induced by CRISPR\u2010Cas9 upstream of transcriptionally active or inactive A20 gene.Endogenous NELF\u2010E is preferentially recruited to DSBs induced upstream of active rather than inactive A20 gene. A schematic diagram depicting the position of the DSB induced by Cas9, A20 gene, and its promoter, and the position of three DNA sequences (P1, P2, and P3) that were tested by real\u2010time PCR for the presence of NELF\u2010E and \u03b3H2AX (top). Graph represents the results of ChIP analysis showing the binding of endogenous NELF\u2010E and the abundance of \u03b3H2AX at three positions near DSBs upstream of transcriptionally active (HeLa cells treated with TNF\u03b1) and inactive (untreated cells) A20 gene. The occupancy of NELF\u2010E and \u03b3H2AX at P1, P2, and P3 sites was determined by quantitative real\u2010time PCR analysis and normalized to input. Error bars represent SD from three independent experiments. Asterisks depict statistically significant differences in the values of P1, P2, and P3 when compared to the corresponding values of the control samples that were not treated with TNF\u03b1 and Cas9. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t\u2010test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.\nNext, we sought to determine the effect of NELF\u2010E on A20 expression after DSB induction. To do so, mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells were transiently treated with TNF\u03b1 to activate A20 expression and then transfected with vectors encoding EGFP\u2010Cas9 and a specific gRNA to induce DSB upstream of the A20 gene. Green cells expressing EGFP\u2010Cas9 were sorted, and A20 mRNA levels were measured by real\u2010time PCR (Fig EV1A). Upon DSB induction, NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells (Fig EV1B) exhibit ~15\u2010fold increase in the expression levels of the A20 gene compared to ~fourfold increase in control cells, suggesting that NELF\u2010E negatively regulates A20 expression at DSB sites (Fig EV1C). Notably, introducing DSBs upstream of the A20 gene, even in the presence of NELF\u2010E, facilitates A20 gene expression (Fig EV1C), likely because DSBs could trigger DNA unwinding and create permissive environment for transcription as previously reported 37.Open in a separate windowFigure EV1NELF\u2010E depletion alleviates A20 expression at DSB sites\nA flowchart depicting the layout of an experiment designed to determine the effect of NELF\u2010E on the transcription of A20 gene following DSB induction.Western blot shows NELF\u2010E knockdown in HeLa cells at 72 h after siRNA transfection. \u03b2\u2010actin was used as a loading control.Graph displays the effect of NELF\u2010E depletion on the transcription activity of A20 gene upon Cas9\u2010induced DSBs.

Data represent the mean of two biological repeats.\nPARP1\u2010dependent recruitment of NELF\u2010E to laser\u2010microirradiated sitesGiven the established role of ATM activity in promoting transcriptional repression after DNA damage, we tested whether ATM regulates NELF\u2010E recruitment to damage sites. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM has no detectable effect on NELF\u2010E recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated regions (Appendix Fig S9A). The efficacy of ATM inhibitor was validated by visualizing CtIP recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated regions during S and G2 cell cycle stages. Toward this, cells expressing MonoRed\u2010CtIP and EGFP fused to the N\u2010terminal domain of Geminin (which was previously shown to faithfully mark S/G2 and M phases 38) were subjected to laser microirradiation. In agreement with previous report 39, CtIP recruitment was abolished in cells treated with ATM inhibitor (Appendix Fig S9B). Altogether, we concluded that ATM activity is not required for NELF\u2010E accumulation at DNA damage sites. Given that PARP1 positively and negatively regulates gene expression 40 and the accumulation of several DDR responsive proteins to DNA damage sites 41, 42, we sought to determine whether PARP1 regulates the recruitment of NELF\u2010E to damage sites. Here, we provide two lines of evidence showing that PARP1 activity controls NELF\u2010E accumulation at laser\u2010microirradiated sites. First, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1/2 abrogates NELF\u2010E accumulation at DNA damage sites (Fig \u200b(Fig4A).4A). Second, PARP1 depletion (Fig \u200b(Fig4B)4B) leads to a remarkable decrease in the percentage of cells showing recruitment of NELF\u2010E to laser\u2010microirradiated sites (Fig \u200b(Fig4C).4C). It should be noted that comparable amounts of DNA damage were generated at laser\u2010microirradiated sites in control and PARP\u2010deficient cells, as evident by the intensity of \u03b3H2AX staining (Appendix Fig S10).Open in a separate windowFigure 4PARP1\u2010dependent recruitment of NELF\u2010E to laser\u2010microirradiated sites\nPharmacological inhibition of PARP abolished EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sites.

PAR\u2010binding assay was performed using EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E, EGFP\u2010NLS, GST\u2010N\u2010terminal, and GST\u2010C\u2010terminal of NELF\u2010E. Histone H3 was used as a positive control. IB: immunoblot. 32P: radiolabelled PAR.\nTo better understand how PARP1 regulates NELF\u2010E recruitment to DNA damage sites, we checked whether NELF\u2010E binds poly(ADP\u2010ribose; PAR) moieties. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that NELF\u2010E contains a potential PAR\u2010binding motif at its N\u2010terminal region 43 (Fig \u200b(Fig4D).4D). In line with this, in vitro PAR\u2010binding assay demonstrated that the N\u2010terminal, but not the C\u2010terminal, region of NELF\u2010E binds PAR moieties (Fig \u200b(Fig4E4E and F). We propose therefore that NELF\u2010E N\u2010terminal region might regulate its recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sites (Appendix Fig S4), through binding to DNA damage\u2010induced PAR moieties surrounding the damaged DNA. However, we cannot exclude the existence of additional sequence motifs within the N\u2010terminal region of NELF\u2010E that might bind PAR and contribute to its recruitment to DNA damage sites.Similar to the recruitment of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E to laser\u2010microirradiated sites, endogenous NELF\u2010E accumulation at I\u2010SceI sites was abrogated in cells pretreated with PARP inhibitor (Fig EV2A). Accordingly, PARP inhibition alleviates DSB\u2010induced transcriptional repression of the MS2 gene (Fig EV2B). Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of ATM and PARP showed no further increase in the percentage of cells that express MS2 upon DSB induction when compared to cells treated with ATM inhibitor only, suggesting that ATM and PARP may act in similar mechanisms (Fig EV2C; see Discussion below). On the other hand, inhibiting PARP in NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells showed increase in the percentage of cells that express MS2 nearby DSB sites compared to NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells (Fig EV2C). These observations raised a possibility that in addition to NELF\u2010E, PARP1 regulates the recruitment of other silencing factors such as NurD and PcG to DNA break sites 19, 20.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2The effect of PARP1 and ATM on the expression of the MS2 gene\nPharmacological inhibition of PARP1 inhibits NELF\u2010E accumulation at I\u2010SceI\u2010induced DSBs.

Data represent the mean of 20 cells collected from two biological repeats.\nNELF\u2010E poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation is reduced after DNA damageConsistent with a recent finding 44, we found that NELF\u2010E interacts with PARP1 and undergoes poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation in undamaged cells (Fig \u200b(Fig5A5A and B). Importantly, we observed that both NELF\u2010E\u2010PARP1 interaction and NELF\u2010E poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation were not increased after IR but rather showed consistent decrease (Fig \u200b(Fig5A5A and B). In addition, we found that the recently characterized NELF\u2010E ADP\u2010ribosylation sites mutant 44 [shows reduced level of ADP\u2010ribosylation (Appendix Fig S11)] is recruited to laser\u2010microirradiated sites in a similar fashion as NELF\u2010E wild\u2010type protein (Fig \u200b(Fig5C).5C). Altogether, these observations support the notion that NELF\u2010E ADP\u2010ribosylation is dispensable for its accumulation at DNA damage sites. Moreover, the decrease in NELF\u2010E ADP\u2010ribosylation following IR implies that NELF\u2010E molecules that accumulate at DNA break sites are less ADP\u2010ribosylated. These results fit well with a recent finding showing that the ADP\u2010ribosylated form of NELF\u2010E is not active in pausing elongation activity of Pol II 44 and support our data showing that NELF\u2010E recruitment is required for DSB\u2010induced transcriptional repression.Open in a separate windowFigure 5NELF\u2010E poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation is reduced after DNA damage\nNELF\u2010E\u2010PARP1 interaction is reduced after IR. U2OS cells were subjected to NELF\u2010E immunoprecipitation before and after IR (cells were exposed to 10 Gy of IR and recovered for 10 min). The immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with either PARP1 or NELF\u2010E. IgG pull\u2010down is used as a negative control. Input samples were blotted with the indicated antibodies.EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E is less ADP\u2010ribosylated after IR.

Next, the membrane was stripped and immunostained with GFP antibody. Input samples were immunostained with the indicated antibodies.Representative time\u2010lapse images show the localization of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E wild type and EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E\u2010EQ mutant at laser\u2010microirradiated sites (marked with white rectangle). Graph on the right shows fold increase in the relative fluorescence intensity (n = 2). Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm.\nRNA pol II is essential for NELF\u2010E recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sitesRNA degradation by RNase A treatment or inhibition of Pol II elongation using the adenosine analogue 5,6\u2010dichloro\u20101\u2010\u03b2\u2010D\u2010ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) prior to laser microirradiation shows no detectable effect on NELF\u2010E accumulation at sites of damage (Fig \u200b(Fig6A,6A, first and second panels). These observations are in agreement with our previous finding showing that NELF\u2010Edel(RRM) mutant (cannot bind RNA) is still recruited to DNA damage sites (Appendix Fig S4C). Hence, we concluded that RNA molecules and NELF\u2010E\u2010RNA interaction are not essential for NELF\u2010E recruitment to DNA break sites. Interestingly, transcription activation of the A20 gene by TNF\u03b1 is accompanied by enrichment of Pol II molecules at its promoter region 36. We speculated therefore that the presence of Pol II might be a prerequisite for NELF\u2010E accumulation at DSB sites nearby transcriptionally active regions. To test this, we induced Pol II degradation using \u03b1\u2010amanitin. Consistent with previous findings 45, 46, treating cells with \u03b1\u2010amanitin leads to a remarkable decrease in the protein levels of Pol II subunit, Rpb1 (Fig \u200b(Fig6B).6B). As shown in Fig \u200bFig6A6A (third panel), pretreating cells with \u03b1\u2010amanitin disrupts NELF\u2010E recruitment to laser\u2010microirradiated sites. Importantly, \u03b1\u2010amanitin treatment has no substantial effect on PARP1 recruitment and on the accumulation of \u03b3H2AX at DNA break sites (Appendix Fig S12A and B). On the other hand, \u03b1\u2010amanitin treatment caused a slight decrease in the intensity of PAR moieties at laser\u2010microirradiated sites, probably due to degradation of ADP\u2010ribosylated proteins (Appendix Fig S12B). Altogether, these observations suggest that Pol II is critical for recruiting NELF\u2010E to DSB sites and the increase in Pol II levels following A20 activation may mediate the preferential recruitment of NELF\u2010E to DSBs induced at transcriptionally active DNA. Interestingly, a recent work showed that various subunits of pol II undergo ADP\u2010ribosylation following genotoxic stress 47 raising a possibility that the ADP\u2010ribosylated subunits of Pol II may provide a platform for recruiting NELF\u2010E to DNA break sites. In support of this, we demonstrate that NELF\u2010E association with the largest subunit of Pol II, RPB1, is disrupted in cells treated with PARP inhibitor (Fig \u200b(Fig66C).Open in a separate windowFigure 6RNA pol II is required for NELF\u2010E accumulation at DNA break sites\nRepresentative time\u2010lapse images showing the localization of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E at laser\u2010microirradiated regions of cells that were untreated or treated with either RNase A, DRB, or \u03b1\u2010amanitin.

Colony formation assay revealed that NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells (Fig \u200b(Fig7A)7A) show moderate hypersensitivity to IR (Fig \u200b(Fig7B).7B). Next, we determined the effect of NELF\u2010E depletion on the integrity of homology\u2010directed repair (HDR) of DSB repair using U2OS\u2010HR\u2010ind cells 48. These cells express a cytoplasmic mCherry\u2010I\u2010SceI enzyme fused to glucocorticoid receptor, and treatment with dexamethasone (Dex) induces rapid entry of I\u2010SceI into the nucleus and induction of DSB at its recognition site within the GFP expression cassette. Repairing DSBs by HDR restores the integrity of the GFP gene and leads to the appearance of GFP\u2010positive cells 48, 49. Control, Rad51, and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted HR\u2010ind cells (Fig \u200b(Fig7C)7C) were treated with 0.1 \u03bcM Dex for 48 h, and the percentage of GFP\u2010positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Results show that NELF\u2010E depletion using two different siRNAs leads to a mild but significant decrease of 20\u201325% in GFP\u2010positive cells, when compared to cells depleted of Rad51 (a central protein of HDR) that exhibit ~60% decrease in GFP\u2010positive cells (Fig \u200b(Fig7D).7D). Similarly, we tested the effect of NELF\u2010E depletion on the efficiency of non\u2010homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DSBs using HeLa cells containing pEJSSA plasmid stably integrated into their genome 50. This plasmid contains a recognition site for I\u2010SceI endonuclease and repairing the DSB by NHEJ restores the functionality of the GFP gene, manifested in green\u2010colored cells. Results show that NELF\u2010E depletion (Fig \u200b(Fig7E)7E) leads to 35\u201340% decrease in the efficiency of NHEJ compared to 75% decrease in cells treated with siRNA against Ku80 (a central NHEJ factor; Fig \u200bFig7F).7F). Collectively, our results suggest that NELF\u2010E is required for fine\u2010tuning DSB repair.Open in a separate windowFigure 7NELF\u2010E promotes HDR and NHEJ of DSBs\nWestern blot shows NELF\u2010E knockdown using two different shRNAs (#2 and #4). \u03b2\u2010actin was used as a loading control.Colony formation assay shows that NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells are hypersensitive to IR.

We demonstrated that NELF\u2010E is preferentially recruited, in a PARP1\u2010dependent manner, to DSBs induced upstream of transcriptionally active genes to promote transcriptional repression and facilitate DSB repair. Similar to NELF\u2010E, previous reports revealed that BRCA1 and Rad51 exhibit preferential binding to DSBs that lie within transcriptionally active chromatin marked by H4 acetylation and H3K36 methylation 51, 52. In addition to NELF\u2010E, recent studies identified several factors, such as BAF180 and BRG1, which are involved in blocking transcription of active genes in response to DNA damage in an ATM\u2010dependent manner 17. However, it remains unknown whether, similar to NELF\u2010E, these factors show also preferential recruitment to transcriptionally active genes.This study showed that both the N\u2010terminal region (essential for NELF\u2010E accumulation at DNA damage sites) and the RRM domain (essential for NELF repressive activity) are crucial for intact DSB\u2010induced transcriptional repression (Fig \u200b(Fig22 and Appendix Fig S4). Unpredictably, complementing NELF\u2010E\u2010deficient cells with NELF\u2010Edel(RRM) mutant partially restored the transcriptional silencing of MS2 gene at DSB sites (Fig \u200b(Fig2B).2B). This finding raises a possibility that the LZ motif of NELF\u2010Edel(RRM) might confer silencing by promoting the recruitment of various silencing factors to DSB sites. In agreement with this, the LZ domain is known to mediate protein dimerization and facilitate binding to DNA 27, 28 and is found in multiple DDR proteins, such as ATM, DNA\u2010PK, and Ku70/80 proteins 53, 54, 55, 56.Our study also demonstrated that NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A, but not NELF\u2010B or NELF\u2010C/D, are recruited to DNA break sites (Fig \u200b(Fig2A2A and Appendix Fig S3). These findings suggest that subcomplexes, including NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A, might be formed following DNA damage. In support of this, functional NELF subcomplexes that bind RNA in vitro and in vivo were recently described in human cells 57. It should be noted in this regard that both NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A subunits are critical for transcriptional silencing activity of NELF complex 21, 26. Moreover, it was previously shown that NELF cooperates with DSIF complex to silence the activity of Pol II 21, 22, 23, 24 raising a possibility that NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A subunits may function with DSIF to promote transcription arrest at DSB sites.Our data implicate PARP1 enzyme in regulating transcription in response to DNA damage. A recent screen revealed that PARP1 ADP\u2010ribosylates NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A, which subsequently promotes transcription elongation 44. Interestingly, our data show that after IR the level of NELF\u2010E ADP\u2010ribosylation does not increase but rather shows a mild decrease. Given that NELF\u2010E recruitment is critical for transcriptional repression at DSB sites, we propose that NELF\u2010E molecules that accumulate at DNA break sites are less ADP\u2010ribosylated (Fig \u200b(Fig66D).This study showed that NELF\u2010E depletion or PARP inhibition alleviates DSB\u2010induced transcriptional repression. It is widely accepted that transcriptional silencing post\u2010DNA damage is tightly regulated, and its disruption can have harmful consequences leading to genomic instabilities and cancer 4, 5. In agreement with this, NELF\u2010E is required for fine\u2010tuning DSB repair (Fig \u200b(Fig7).7). Moreover, a growing number of studies suggested that PARP1 activity is required for timely repair of DSBs 49, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62. Besides PARP1, ATM and DNA\u2010PK kinases regulate the activity of several silencing factors at sites of DNA damage 11, 12, 18. Interestingly, inhibition of ATM and NELF\u2010E did not cause synergistic or additive effects on the transcription of the MS2 gene, indicating that they might function in the same pathway (Appendix Fig S2). It was recently shown that pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 led to a significant reduction in H3K9me3 at DSB sites and thus preventing ATM activation (evidenced by the absence of the DNA damage\u2010induced KAP1 phosphorylation) 61. On this basis, it is plausible to assume that the alleviation of MS2 repression at DSB sites following PARP inhibition could be mediated by ATM kinase activity. In line with this, the percentage of cells that express MS2 gene in the presence of DSB following pharmacological inhibition of both ATM and PARP is comparable to the percentage of cells that were treated only with ATM inhibitor (Fig EV2C). Nonetheless, the relationship between the DNA damage\u2010induced silencing pathways that are mediated by ATM, DNA\u2010PK, and PARP1 activity should be further clarified. Do these three pathways act in a sequential manner with overlapping functions, in parallel to complement each other, or in distinct pathways? How the cells determine which silencing pathway to activate? Is this dependent on the type of the lesion and/or on the chromatin context surrounding the damage sites?In summary, identifying NELF as a new player in DDR will help to better understand the molecular mechanisms that ensure efficient repair of DNA lesions to maintain genomic stability. Notably, different subunits of NELF complex are mutated in different types of human cancer 63, 64. Future studies will be essential to determine the impact of these cancer mutations on the newly identified functions of NELF complex in DDR and to investigate whether these mutations contribute to the alleged tumor suppressor activity of the different subunits of NELF complex.

U2OS, HeLa, and U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Scel\u201019 (kind gift from Dr. Yasui Akira, Tohoku University, Japan) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco). The MCF\u20107 cell line was cultured in RPMI\u20101640 media (Gibco). U2OS\u2010HR\u2010ind cell line (kind gift from Michal Goldberg, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel) was cultured as previously described 49.Generation of U2OS\u2010Tet\u2010ON\u2010EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E cell lineU2OS\u2010Tet\u2010ON cell line expressing the EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E fusion was established as previously described 49. Briefly, EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E fusion was subcloned into the pTRE2/Puro vector (Clontech) and transfected into U2OS\u2010Tet\u2010ON cell (Clontech). Puromycin\u2010resistant clones (0.6 \u03bcg/ml puromycin) were selected and tested for doxycycline (Dox)\u2010induced expression of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E by fluorescence microscopy. Clones that showed expression of EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E only after the addition of Dox (Sigma, D9891) were selected for further characterization.TransfectionsTransient transfections with plasmid DNA or siRNA were performed using Poly Jet (Bio Consult) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs used in this study included validated PARP1 siRNA (4390823 and 4390824; Ambion), Stealth RNAi negative control, and Stealth NELF\u2010E siRNA (Invitrogen).

Briefly, protein lysates were prepared using hot lysis and immunoblotted using the appropriate antibodies (a complete list of antibodies and their dilutions are described in Table 3). Rad51 and Ku80 antibodies were kind gifts from Michal Goldberg (Hebrew University of Jerusalem). Membranes were developed using Quantum ECL detection kit (K\u201012042\u2010D20, Advansta).ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described 49, 65. U2OS cells were lysed by Nonidet P\u201040 (NP\u201040) lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP\u201040, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM \u03b2\u2010glycerophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1.2 mM Na3VO4, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 25 U/ml Benzonase (Novagen)] for 30 min on ice, centrifuged at 20,000\u2009g for 25 min at 4\u00b0C and supernatant was recovered and pre\u2010cleared using protein A magnetic beads (GenScript). The pre\u2010cleared extracts were rotated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 1\u20134 \u03bcg of antibody and protein A magnetic beads. Then, the immunocomplexes were washed five times with IP buffer, resolved in gel and analyzed by Western blotting.GFP\u2010TRAP pull\u2010downGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E fusion was purified from doxycycline\u2010treated U2OS\u2010TetON\u2010EGFP\u2010NELF\u2010E cells using GFP\u2010TRAP methodology as previously described 49, 65. In brief, whole\u2010cell extracts were prepared using NP\u201040 lysis buffer (supplemented with 30 \u03bcM PARP inhibitor and protease inhibitor cocktail) and subjected to pull\u2010down using GFP\u2010Trap beads (Chromotek). Next, the immuno\u2010complexes were washed, resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and stained with Coomassie.Expression and purification of GST fusionsA single colony from E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells expressing either GST\u2010tagged NELF\u2010E N\u2010terminal 1\u2013250aa (60 kDa) or GST\u2010tagged NELF\u2010E C\u2010terminal 251\u2013380aa (42 kDa) was inoculated and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C into LB medium. The bacteria were transferred to 2\u00d7 TY medium and were grown until reaching O.D = 0.6. The expressions of glutathione S\u2010transferase (GST)\u2010tagged proteins were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 24 h at 18\u00b0C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication (four cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off at amplitude of 50%) in 1\u00d7 PBS containing 15 mM EDTA and PMSF and then treated with ~25 units Benzonase (Novagen) for 1 h. Lysed bacteria were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 g, and the supernatant was incubated with GST\u2010Bind Resin (Novagen) overnight. Beads were washed five times with 1\u00d7 PBS containing 0.2% Triton X\u2010100 and 0.7% NP\u201040, and the GST\u2010tagged proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM reduced glutathione, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X\u2010100, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.8, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors cocktail overnight at RT. The eluted proteins were then dialyzed 3 times against buffer containing 5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X\u2010100, and 1 mM DTT.PAR\u2010binding assayPurified NELF\u2010E (full\u2010length, N\u2010terminal, and C\u2010terminal) was tested for their ability to bind PAR moieties using the PAR\u2010binding assay as previously described 42.Drug treatmentCells were exposed to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation from an X\u2010ray machine (Faxitron, CellRad). Where indicated, cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM PARP inhibitor (Ku\u20100059436) for 1 h, 10 \u03bcM ATM inhibitor (KU\u201055933) for 2 h, 100 \u03bcM DRB (Sigma) for 3 h, and 20 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1\u2010amanitin (Sigma) for 4 h. For RNase A experiment, cells were permeabilized (0.5% or 2% Tween\u201020 in PBS for 10 min) and treated with or without 1 mg/ml RNase A in PBS for 15 min at room temperature 66.RNA Isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative real\u2010time PCRTo measure the expression levels of A20 gene, HeLa cells were untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). RNA (1 \u03bcg) was used for cDNA synthesis using the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta) with random primers. A20 mRNA levels were measured by real\u2010time PCR in the Step\u2010One\u2010Plus real\u2010time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using A20 and GAPDH primers (Table 2) and the Fast SYBR Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems) with three technical repeats for each PCR. Data analysis and quantification were performed using StepOne software V2.2 supplied by Applied Biosystems. GAPDH gene was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the amount of the cDNA. Fold induction of A20 mRNA levels was calculated using \u0394\u0394C\nt method from results that were normalized to GAPDH.Visualizing MS2 expression before and after DSB in U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019The effect of DSB on the transcription of MS2 gene was performed as previously described 18, 33, 34, 35. Briefly, to activate transcription of MS2 gene in U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019, cells were transfected with pCherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER plasmid, which expresses a cytoplasmic Cherry\u2010tTA\u2010ER chimera, and treated with 1 \u03bcM tamoxifen to drive its migration into the nucleus and induce transcription of MS2 gene. To visualize nascent transcription of MS2, cells were co\u2010transfected with pYFP\u2010MS2 plasmid, which expresses YFP\u2010MS2 protein that binds the MS2 stem loops. To induce DSB, U2OS\u2010TRE\u2010I\u2010Sce\u201019 cells were co\u2010transfected with pCMV\u2010NLS\u2010I\u2010SceI. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM ATM inhibitor for 24 h or with 4 \u03bcM PARP inhibitor prior to Tam treatment.Laser microirradiationLaser microirradiation was performed as previously described 49. Cells were grown on fluorodish and stained with 10 \u03bcM Hoechst 33342 for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, laser microirradiation was performed using LSM\u2010700 confocal microscope. Selected region within the nucleus was microirradiated with 10 iterations of a 405\u2010nm laser with 100% power to generate localized DNA damage. Cells were then subjected to time\u2010lapse images or fixed for immunofluorescence. Fluorescence intensity at DNA damaged sites was measured using Zen 2009 software.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)HeLa cells, untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (Peprotech #300\u201001A), were co\u2010transfected with expression vectors pSpCAS9(BB)\u20102A\u2010GFP(PX458) encoding GFP\u2010Cas9 and pSpgRNA vector containing a specific gRNA to introduce double\u2010strand break 4 kb upstream of the promoter region of A20 gene. ChIP was performed as described previously 49. Briefly, cells were cross\u2010linked in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, and then, the cross\u2010linking was stopped using 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. After cell lyses, the purified chromatin was sonicated to 300\u2013500 bp using a Vibra cell sonicator (15 s ON, 30 s OFF, 35% duty, 18 cycles). 5% of each supernatant was used as input control and processed with the cross\u2010linking reversal step. The rest of the supernatant was pre\u2010cleared with protein G agarose beads (26150; Pierce) and subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation (IP) using either 2 \u03bcg of NELF\u2010E (ab170104) or \u03b3H2AX antibody (Millipore 05\u2010636) and protein G magnetic beads (GenScript). Following reverse cross\u2010linking, the precipitated DNA was purified using the PureLinkTM PCR Micro Kit. Quantification of the immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out by Step\u2010One\u2010Plus real\u2010time PCR using Fast SYBR Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and different sets of primers (P1, P2, and P3) around the damage site (Table 2). Percentages of precipitated DNA surrounding the break site were calculated relative to input.Detection of global RNA synthesisGlobal transcription levels were determined using the Click\u2010IT Nascent RNA capture kit ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"E10345\",\"term_id\":\"22027175\",\"term_text\":\"E10345\"}}E10345) as previously described 67. Briefly, mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted cells were exposed to either 10 Gy ionizing radiation or 50 J/m2 UV light, incubated for 20 min with 5\u2010EU that was added directly to the growth medium. Next, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 in 1\u00d7 PBS for 15 min. Detection of 5\u2010EU incorporation was performed using Alexa Fluor 594 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Images were obtained using a high\u2010content screening microscope (In Cell Analyzer 2000; GE Healthcare) for automatic acquisition of at least 200 cells at each time point.Colony formation assayMCF\u20107 cells infected with either scramble or NELF\u2010E shRNAs were plated in triplicate at density of 500 cells per 35\u2010mm dish and incubated for 24 h before exposure to increasing doses of ionizing radiation. After ~15 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the plates were fixed and stained with 0.25% crystal violet dissolved in 25% methanol, and colonies were counted.Homology\u2010directed repair (HDR) assayThe efficiency of HDR of DSBs was performed as previously described 48, 49 in mock and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted U2OS\u2010HR\u2010ind cells. In brief, U2OS\u2010HR\u2010ind cells, which stably express cytoplasmic mCherry\u2010I\u2010SceI enzyme fused to glucocorticoid receptor (I\u2010SceI\u2010GR), were treated with 0.1 \u03bcM of dexamethasone (Dex) for 48 h. This treatment induces rapid entry of I\u2010SceI\u2010GR into the nucleus and generation of DSB at its recognition sequence within the reporter construct expressing GFP. Repairing the DSB by HDR restores the integrity of the GFP gene. The number of GFP\u2010positive cells was determined using a BD LSRII. Data analysis was performed using FCS\u2010Express software and was based on at least 10,000 events.Non\u2010homologous end joining (NHEJ)HeLa cells containing the plasmid pEJSSA stably integrated into their genome 50 were used to monitor the efficiency of NHEJ in vivo as previously described 49. In brief, control and NELF\u2010E\u2010depleted HeLa cells were co\u2010transfected with constructs expressing I\u2010SceI endonuclease and Red\u2010Monomer (MR) tag, and the percentage of GFP\u2010positive cells from the total number of red cells was determined by flow cytometry.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using the demo version of GraphPad Prism software version 6.
