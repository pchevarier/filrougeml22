A significant reduction in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was shown with methylprednisolone in patients with respiratory support (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.03\u20100.71), with \u22653 (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05\u20100.61) or \u22654 altered IB (HR: 0.15; 95% CI 0.04\u20100.54) and in patients with both respiratory support and \u22653 (HR: 0.11; 95% CI 0.02\u20100.53] or \u22654 altered IB (HR: 0.14; 95% CI 0.04\u20100.51). No significant differences were found in secondary outcomes.ConclusionIntermediate to high doses of methylprednisolone, initiated between 5 and 12\u00a0days after symptom onset, was associated with a significant reduction in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality in patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia and \u22653\u00a0o\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 altered IB, independently of the need of respiratory support. \nWhat\u2019s known\nSystemic corticosteroids are one of the few interventions that have succeeded in demonstrating its effect in mortality risk reduction in critical and severe COVID\u201019 patients who require respiratory support.WHO and scientific societies recommend the use of dexamethasone, at a dose of 6 mg orally or intravenously once daily, or 50 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously every 8 hours, for 7\u201310 days, in patients with severe and critical COVID\u201019 and in patients who require respiratory support, and it is now recognised as standard of care for these patients. Nevertheless, some uncertainties still remain about their optimal use in COVID\u201019 patients.\nWhat\u2019s new\nThis study shows that intermediate to high\u2010doses of methylprednisolone, initiated between 5\u201312 days after symptoms onset, decreases mortality risk in hospitalised patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced severe systemic inflammation.It suggests that the corticosteroid treatment effect in mortality risk reduction may be a function of hyperinflammation\u2019s degree, independently of the needs of respiratory support.Identify the profile of patients who might benefit most from corticosteroid therapy, defining inflammatory biomarkers and cut\u2010off values that will allow clinicians to tailor treatment strategies in hospitalised COVID\u201019 patients, to reduce mortality.\n\n 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONClinical manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102)\u2010associated disease, COVID\u201019, range from asymptomatic, mild pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death.\n1\n, \n2\n It is clear that the host immune response plays a key role in the pathophysiological effects of organ injury.\n2\n In severe COVID\u201019 pneumonia, patients' symptoms worsen and become more hypoxic 4\u20107\u00a0days after the onset of symptoms and can progress to ARDS between 8 and 12\u00a0days.\n3\n, \n4\n A macrophage activation syndrome with hyperinflammation and cytokine storm appear to be the ultimate cause of tissue damage and organ failure in these patients.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n The similarity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010induced hyperinflammation to hyperferritinemic syndromes supported the use of anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids.\n8\n, \n9\n\nInitially, corticosteroids were restricted to patients with SARS\u2010COV\u20102 pneumonia and ARDS by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to their potential effects on delayed viral clearance and the increased risk of secondary infections or death.\n10\n, \n11\n Later, the RECOVERY clinical trial\n12\n has demonstrated the benefit of low dose of dexamethasone in reducing 28\u2010day mortality risk among patients hospitalised with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia. This evidence has led the WHO and scientific societies to recommend the use of dexamethasone, at a dose of 6\u00a0mg orally or intravenously once daily, or 50\u00a0mg of hydrocortisone intravenously every 8\u00a0hours, for 7\u201010\u00a0days, in patients with severe and critical COVID\u201019 and in patients who require oxygen therapy with and without invasive mechanical ventilation, advising against the routine use of corticosteroids for mild clinical conditions.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n\nData on the efficacy of other corticosteroids are limited to smaller trials, and not all of them have reproduced similar results. While some failed to demonstrate efficacy,\n15\n, \n16\n others showed beneficial effects over the course of the disease regarding the duration of the need of mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n3\n, \n17\n, \n18\n Therefore, other corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone or prednisone are reserved in case of not having dexamethasone, using them at equivalent doses.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n\nDespite the growing evidence supporting the corticosteroid use, some uncertainties still remain regarding their optimal use in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia. It is known that, in addition to developing respiratory failure, a subgroup of patients will progress into a severe systemic inflammation (SSI) syndrome and several inflammatory biomarkers (IBs) have been associated with severity and a worse prognosis.\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n Hence, in order to better define the profile of patients who might benefit most from corticosteroid therapy, we conducted this study with the aim of assessing the impact of intermediate to high doses of methylprednisolone on mortality rate in patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced SSI. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Study design and participantsA single\u2010centre, observational, longitudinal, retrospective study was conducted at a 539\u2010bed general teaching hospital in Valencia (Spain), between 9 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The recruitment period extended from 9 March to 17 April 2020 and final follow\u2010up was completed on 2 July 2020.Patients eligible were aged 18\u00a0years or older with severe COVID\u201019 pneumonia, confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) test, and had progressed into SSI, defined as at least two out of six IB raised over the predefined cut\u2010off points\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n: fever (body temperature \u226538\u2103), absolute lymphocyte count \u2264800\u00a0cell/\u00b5L, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) \u2265100\u00a0mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \u2265300\u00a0units/L, ferritin \u22651000\u00a0mcg/L and D\u2010dimer \u2265500\u00a0ng/mL.Exclusion criteria were: previous long\u2010term systemic corticosteroid therapy (more than 6\u00a0months), methylprednisolone or equivalent treatment at doses out of range 0.5\u20101.0\u00a0mg/kg or duration less than 5\u00a0days and sepsis or ARDS according to Berlin criteria\n23\n at the beginning of corticosteroid use or progression into SSI. Pregnant or breast\u2010feeding women, patients transferred to an ICU or who died within the first 48\u00a0hours of admission were also excluded.A sample\u2010size calculation was performed to detect a 20% difference in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality assuming a test power of 0.80, a 95% confidence level and no drop\u2010out rate. Seventy patients in each group were required.Every patient was fully informed about the off\u2010label character of the treatment strategy and the potential side effects, and informed consent was obtained before initiating any treatment following the national protocol for treating hospitalised patients with COVID\u201019 developed by the Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare.\n24\n The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the local Clinical Research Ethics Committee (code 64/20) and classified by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (HDP\u2010GLU\u20102020\u201005).2.2. ProceduresElectronic health records, including laboratory results, prescribed medication, respiratory support received (oxygen with or without non\u2010invasive or invasive ventilation) and information on vital status were reviewed for all admitted patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed COVID\u201019 pneumonia at different time points containing the time of corticosteroid treatment beginning and progression into SSI, as appropriate.Patients were divided into two cohorts based on whether they received systemic corticosteroids (corticosteroid group), initiated between 5 and 12\u00a0days after symptom onset at intermediate to high doses of methylprednisolone (or equivalent) 0.5\u20101.0\u00a0mg/kg through intravenous perfusion daily for 5\u201010\u00a0days, plus standard care or standard care alone (control group).Decision to prescribe corticosteroids was at the discretion of the treating physician (based on time since symptom onset, respiratory compromise and the following IBs: fever, absolute lymphocyte count, CRP, LDH, ferritin and D\u2010dimer) in accordance with the institutional protocol developed on 9 March 2020. This was approved by the Doctor Peset COVID\u201019 working group consensus and based on the available literature, experience from other centres around the world affected by COVID\u201019\n25\n and the clinical rationale based on immunology to explain the torpid course of the disease in some patients. Standard care included treatment with antivirals (lopinavir\u2013ritonavir), antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftriaxone or others if needed), anti\u2010malarials (hydroxychloroquine) and tocilizumab (if raised interleukin\u20106 [IL\u20106], when available) according to the national protocol approved for treating hospitalised patients with COVID\u201019.\n24\n\n2.3. OutcomesThe primary outcome was 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality in overall population (\u22652 IB altered) and subgroups of patients classified according to respiratory support needs at the progression into SSI and/or the number of altered IB (\u22653 or \u22654). For a clearer understanding of risk, the outcomes were also modelled separately. A secondary outcome was \u22652 stages of improvement at Day 14 on a 7\u2010item WHO\u2010endorsed ordinal scale (ranging from 1 to 2, not hospitalised to 7, death).\n26\n The two outpatient strata (points 1 and 2) were combined into one, due to was not possible to know whether discharged patients were able to resume or not their normal activities. Other secondary outcomes were transfer to ICU, progression into ARDS and severe adverse effects (hyperglycaemia defined as glycaemia >200\u00a0mg/dL for two consecutive tests, nosocomial infection and sepsis).2.4. Statistical analysisThe demographic and clinical variables were described using univariate analysis. Distribution normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies (%); normally distributed quantitative variables, as mean and standard deviation (SD); and non\u2010normally distributed, as median and interquartile range (IQR). Chi\u2010square or Fisher's exact tests and t test for two independent samples or Mann\u2013Whitney U test were used for descriptive statistics, as appropriate.For the primary outcome of 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival plots were constructed, and survival curves for both groups were compared by use of log\u2010rank test. Survival data were censored when the patient died or on Day 28 for survived patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from Cox proportional hazard univariate and multivariate models to assess the relationship of corticosteroid treatment and 28\u2010day mortality in overall population and subgroups of patients classified as previously stated. Adjusted multivariate Cox models incorporated covariates including number of comorbidities, previous neurological antecedents, oxygen supplementation needed at the beginning of corticosteroid or progression to SSI, azithromycin therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, tocilizumab therapy and low\u2010molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapeutic dosage use.Statistical analysis was performed using PASW version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS\u2122, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two sided, and a P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Patient's characteristicsDuring the recruitment period, a total of 327 possible candidates were admitted to the hospital (Figure\u00a01). Of the 142 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 67.6 (13.8) years, 79 (55.6%) were men, and 63 (44.4%) were women. Distribution of age, sex, comorbidities and symptoms on admission was similar between groups, other than neurological history (13 [18.1%] vs 4 [5.7%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.045), two or more comorbidities (50 [69.4%] vs 34 [48.6%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and median time since symptom onset (6 vs 7\u00a0days; P\u00a0=\u00a0.045).

Oxygen saturation of 90% or less and/or respiratory rate of 30 per minute or more was observed in 36.1% of patients in the corticosteroid group and 25.7% in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.247). Statistical differences were not observed in CRP, LDH, D\u2010dimer, ferritin or fever, except a lower absolute lymphocyte count (896\u00a0cell/mL [95% CI 787\u20101005] vs 1069 [95% CI 940\u20101199]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.042) in the corticosteroid group.At the progression into SSI, in the corticosteroid group, significantly more patients were receiving supplemental oxygen with or without non\u2010invasive ventilation (59 [81.9%] vs 41 [58.6%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.004), presented \u22653 altered IB (62 [86.1%] vs 42 [60.0%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) or \u22654 altered IB (43 [59.7%] vs 23 [32.9%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). In the corticosteroid group, the proportion of patients with respiratory support needs and \u22653 (54 [75.0%] vs 30 [42.9%]; P\u00a0>\u00a0.001) or \u22654 altered IB (40 [55.6%] vs 19 [27.1%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) were also higher than in the control group.3.2. Survival outcomesMortality analyses are reported in Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a02. In the overall population, 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was non\u2010significantly lower in the corticosteroid group (5.6%), as compared with the control group (12.9%) (HR: 0.41; 95% CI 0.13\u20101.32; P\u00a0=\u00a0.134). Nevertheless, a significant reduction in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was shown in the corticosteroid group in patients with respiratory support needs (6.8% vs 22.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.032), with \u22653 altered IB (6.5% vs 19.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.046), with \u22654 altered IB (9.3% vs 30.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018), and in patients showing both respiratory support needs and \u22653 altered IB (7.4% vs 26.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) or \u22654 altered IB (10.0% vs 36.8%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.009).TABLE 2Effect of corticosteroids (vs control) on mortality at 28\u00a0days: Univariate and multivariate analysis28\u2010day mortalityNo. of deaths/total no. of patients (%)Univariate analysis HR (95% CI)\nP valueMultivariate analysis\na\n HR (95% CI)\nP valueCorticosteroids groupControl group\nSubgroups\nRespiratory support needed4/59 (6.8)9/41 (22.0)0.28 (0.08\u20100.89).0320.15 (0.03\u20100.71).016Three or more altered IB4/62 (6.5)8/42 (19.0)0.30 (0.09\u20100.98).0460.17 (0.05\u20100.61).007Four or more altered IB4/43 (9.3)7/23 (30.4)0.24 (0.07\u20100.78).0180.15 (0.04\u20100.54).004Respiratory support and \u22653 altered IB4/54 (7.4)8/30 (26.7)0.23 (0.07\u20100.77).0160.11 (0.02\u20100.53).006Respiratory support and \u22654 altered IB4/40 (10.0)7/19 (36.8)0.20 (0.06\u20100.67).0090.14 (0.04\u20100.51).002Open in a separate windowNoteResults from Cox proportional hazards univariate and multivariate models.Abbreviation: IB, inflammatory biomarker.aAdjusted for number of comorbidities, previous neurological antecedents, oxygen supplementation needed at the beginning of corticosteroid or progression to SSI, azithromycin therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, tocilizumab therapy and LMWH therapeutic dosage use.This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

Panels (A)\u2010(E) show 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality by subgroups: patients with respiratory support needs (A), \u22653 (B) or \u22654 (C) altered inflammatory biomarkers and patients with both respiratory support and \u22653 (D) or \u22654 (E) altered inflammatory biomarkers. Survival curves were compared by use of log\u2010rank test. Estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from adjusted multivariate Cox modelsIn both the unadjusted and the adjusted multivariate Cox models, treatment effect of corticosteroids showed a significant reduction in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality in all the subgroups of patients analysed, being lower in patients with \u22653 altered IB (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.05\u20100.61; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007) and higher in patients with respiratory support needs and \u22653 altered IB (HR: 0.11; 95% CI 0.02\u20100.53; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006). Treatment effect of corticosteroids in reduction of 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was independent of the number of comorbidities, previous neurological antecedents, oxygen supplementation needs at the beginning of corticosteroid or progression to SSI, azithromycin therapy, lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, tocilizumab therapy and LMWH therapeutic dosage use.3.3. Treatment received during hospitalisationMethylprednisolone (98.6%) or prednisone (1.4%) were initiated in the corticosteroid group at a mean (CI 95%) of 10.5 (9.4\u201011.6) days from symptom onset or at Day 3 (IQR: 1\u20106) from admission. The median dose was 1\u00a0mg/kg/day (IQR: 1\u20101) and the median duration of treatment 6.5\u00a0days (IQR: 5\u20108). Only one patient received two intravenous boluses of 250 and 500\u00a0mg of methylprednisolone. The corticosteroid group had more patients treated with azithromycin (P\u00a0=\u00a0.017), lopinavir/ritonavir (P\u00a0=\u00a0.029), tocilizumab (P\u00a0=\u00a0.013) and LMWH as therapeutic dosage use (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002).

Secondary clinical outcomesDespite the median (IQR) WHO scale scores at the progression into SSI were similar in both groups (4 [4\u20104] vs 4 [3\u20104]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006), scores 4 (hospitalised, requiring additional oxygen therapy) and 5 (hospitalised, requiring high\u2010flow nasal oxygen therapy, non\u2010invasive mechanical ventilation or both) were significantly higher in the corticosteroid group (59 [81.9%] vs 41 [58.6%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.004). Improvement in two or more points in the 7\u2010point WHO scale at Day 14 was statistically non\u2010significant higher in the corticosteroid group than in the control group in overall population (36 [50.0%] vs 31 [44.3%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.607).No differences in the proportion of patients with progression in respiratory support (4 [5.6%] vs 8 [11.4%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.339) or in patients transferred to the ICU at Day 28 from admission were found (4 [5.6%] vs 1 [1.4%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.366). Despite not significant, more patients progressed into ARDS in the corticosteroid group (19 [26.4%] vs 9 [12.9%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.069). Both groups had a similar proportion of severe adverse events such as hyperglycaemia (8 [11.1%] vs 4 [4.3%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.208), nosocomial infections (3 [4.2%] vs 2 [2.9%]; P\u00a0=\u00a01.000) and sepsis (0 [0.0%] vs 1 [1.4%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.493). 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONIn this study, including 142 patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced SSI, we found that intermediate to high\u2010dose (0.5\u20101.0\u00a0mg/kg/day) methylprednisolone therapy, initiated between 5 and 12\u00a0days after symptom onset, was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality in patients with \u22653\u00a0o\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 altered IB, independently of the need of respiratory support. A lower non\u2010significant 28\u2010day mortality was also observed in the overall population with \u22652 IB.Despite higher comorbidity and more SSI observed in the corticosteroid group, the effect of methylprednisolone in reduction of 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was demonstrated. In fact, significantly more patients were receiving respiratory support or presented \u22653 or \u22654 altered IB in this group. Improvement on \u22652 points in the 7\u2010point WHO scale at Day 14 was non\u2010significantly higher in the corticosteroid group, and no differences in the proportion of patients with progression in respiratory support or transferred to ICU at Day 28 from admission were found, showing that corticosteroid treatment not only reduced the risk of death but also may attenuate progression to the hyperinflammation phase that requires escalation of care in patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Also, there was no evidence of an increased risk of severe adverse events, like hyperglycaemia, nosocomial infections and sepsis in patients treated with methylprednisolone as previously reported.\n14\n\nAlthough seven patients in the corticosteroid group received tocilizumab and none in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.013), a recent systematic review,\n27\n including COVID\u201019 patients with similar characteristics of our study population, has shown inconsistent results regarding the efficacy of tocilizumab from retrospective studies with low\u2010moderate methodological biases. Even so, REMAP\u2010CAP study\n28\n has reported IL\u20106 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab seem to improve survival outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID\u201019.In our study population, 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality was up to four times lower than previous published studies.\n12\n, \n29\n However, mortality in the control group for patients with \u22653\u00a0o\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 altered IB, alone or combined with respiratory support, was similar (between 20% and 30%) to other studies.\n12\n, \n29\n Also, as can be seen in Table\u00a02, the mortality rate in each subgroup of patients increases according to the number of IB altered (\u22652, \u22653 or \u22654). In the control group, mortality rate increases around 10% by each altered IB added (from 12.9% to 30.4%), while in the corticosteroid group, only an absolute increase from 5.6% to 9.3% is shown between groups, demonstrating that the treatment effect of corticosteroids in our population may be until three times higher than previously reported in patients with severe and critical COVID\u201019.\n11\n, \n14\n, \n17\n\nThe clinical benefit of dexamethasone,\n11\n, \n12\n, \n17\n hydrocortisone\n3\n, \n16\n or methylprednisolone\n18\n, \n30\n has been evaluated in previous studies. In different trials, the corticosteroid dosing extended from low to high doses\n3\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n30\n and total duration of treatment varied between 3 and 14\u00a0days.\n3\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n30\n Studies comparing the efficacy of methylprednisolone and dexamethasone have obtained heterogeneous results.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n Clinical outcomes have also been very unequal between studies, and it is uncertain whether these apparent differences are related to the corticosteroid formulation and dose, the severity of illness or issues related to statistical power.\n3\n, \n11\n, \n12\n, \n14\n, \n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n30\n\nTrials evaluating methylprednisolone have not demonstrated a clear benefit. In a randomised trial that included 393 patients with severe COVID\u201019,\n30\n similar 28\u2010day mortality rates with 1\u00a0mg/kg/day methylprednisolone for 5\u00a0days compared to placebo were obtained (37.1% vs 38.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.629). In another trial conducted in 85 patients with moderate to severe disease with abnormal gas exchange and laboratory parameters suggesting a hyperinflammatory state,\n18\n methylprednisolone (40\u00a0mg/12\u00a0hour for 3\u00a0days, then 20\u00a0mg/12\u00a0hour for 3\u00a0days) reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of admission to ICU, non\u2010invasive ventilation or death, without showing significant differences in mortality (20% vs 18%, P\u00a0>\u00a0.05).Nevertheless, in a quasi\u2010experimental study\n4\n which used an early short course of methylprednisolone 0.5\u20101\u00a0mg/kg/day for 3\u00a0days in patients with moderate to severe COVID\u201019 reported a significantly lower rate of the primary composite endpoint of death, ICU transfer and, mechanical ventilation, as well as a significantly lower mortality rate (21.7% vs 26.3%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.024). It was advocated by corticosteroid timing as key factor and corticosteroid therapy at dyspnoea onset. These measures seemed to prevent from disease progression associated with the proinflammatory host response. On the contrary, in a retrospective cohort study\n34\n including 205 patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with methylprednisolone at a median or equivalent dose of 80\u00a0mg/day (IQR: 60\u2010107), a lower but non\u2010significant difference in mortality was found (14.5% vs 25.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.114), despite demonstrating a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation or in\u2010hospital death.Although data from observational and randomised trials overall support the role of corticosteroids for severe COVID\u201019,\n29\n, \n35\n most of the studies associate this benefit with the need for respiratory support. In addition, the variability in the clinical course of the disease, the evidence from different observational studies suggesting association of some IB with worse outcomes\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n and the different clinical response to corticosteroids confirmed by clinical observation in daily practice led us to hypothesise that the benefits of corticosteroid therapy could also depend on the degree of hyperinflammation.Hence, in order to identify which patients benefit the most from corticosteroid therapy, we conducted this study focusing on a subgroup of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced SSI and analysed the effect of methylprednisolone depending on respiratory support needs and the number of altered IB.\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n\nInterestingly, we found significant benefit in 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality among patients receiving methylprednisolone who had \u22653 and \u22654 altered IB, suggesting that the magnitude of the benefit seems to be closely related to the degree of hyperinflammation (see Table\u00a02, Figure\u00a02). In these patients, benefit was even higher if, in addition to the elevation in IB, they also needed respiratory support. Nevertheless, the results of this post hoc subgroup analysis should be confirmed in a randomised clinical trial with risk stratification based on the level of hyperinflammation.Our study has other limitations as it is a single\u2010centre study with an observational and retrospective nature. Prognostic similarity at baseline cannot be assumed. Despite being included in the institutional protocol from 29 March 2020, the prescription of corticosteroids was at the discretion of the treating physician and variability cannot be completely ruled out. Lastly, the selection of the IB to determine the progression into SSI was based on the outcomes from different observational studies, but the prognostic value and optimal clinical use of some of them are still uncertain.\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n\nThis study is unique in terms of the subset of patients included, since it focuses on a subgroup of patients progressing into a severe inflammatory syndrome. To our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the effect of corticosteroid therapy according to the inflammation degree, and our findings suggest that in this subgroup of patients, corticosteroids may be even more beneficial than shown in the RECOVERY trial.\n12\n\n 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONIntermediate or high dose (0.5\u20101.0\u00a0mg/kg/day) of methylprednisolone was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of 28\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia\u2010induced SSI, independently of the need of respiratory support. Benefits in mortality were higher in patients with both respiratory support and \u22653 or \u22654 altered IB. DISCLOSURESNone.
