It is defined by the Berlin definition according to clinical features, namely acute onset of respiratory failure, not fully explained by cardiac failure, and bilateral opacities in thoracal imaging, not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules [1]. Pathological there are three key components: 1. Pulmonal inflammation indicated by a neutrophilic alveolitis, 2. Disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier with deposition of hyaline membranes in the airspace, 3. Endothelial injury with activation of the coagulation cascade and formation of microthrombi [2]. Endothelial damage can lead to oxidative stress which aggravates inflammation, endothelial damage and the severity of the acute lung injury [3].Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome not only need intensive care and mechanical ventilation but also very often suffer from cognitive impairment after hospital discharge [4, 5]. The cause for this cognitive impairment is still not known, but several mechanisms, such as hypoxia [4], inflammation [6], or nitro-oxidative stress, are under discussion [7]. Another possible cause for cognitive impairment in ARDS could be mechanical ventilation itself, as this was shown to induce hippocampal apoptosis by vagal pathways [8], and hippocampal damage is associated with cognitive decline [9, 10]. Furthermore, the hippocampus is thought to be especially susceptible to hypoxia [11]; thus, hypoxia and mechanical ventilation should be even more deleterious for the hippocampus. Bickenbach et al. showed in a pig study that there is a difference in the results of neurologic tests after hypoxia due to a reduced fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and hypoxia due to HCl-induced lung injury [12]. They did not find a difference in hippocampal damage, even though the animals were ventilated with rather high tidal volumes (10\u00a0ml/kg) and without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which in itself should induce hippocampal damage, according to the aforementioned results.\u03b2-HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) are a class of drugs with pleiotropic effects. They reduce serum cholesterol and also show anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. There is evidence of neuroprotective effects of statins [13]. Some studies have demonstrated promising results for sepsis- and ventilator-induced ARDS [14, 15], suggesting that these drugs could be beneficial to patients with ARDS [16, 17]. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no significant differences regarding mortality, ventilator-free days, or length of hospital stay [18, 19]. A retrospective analysis of these studies after screening for hypo- and hyperinflammatory subgroups showed a significant reduction in patients with hyperinflammatory ARDS treated with simvastatin, but no effect in patients with sepsis-induced hyperinflammatory ARDS treated with rosuvastatin [20]. One retrospective study investigating the effect of statin therapy on cognitive impairment after sepsis-induced ARDS did not show convincing results [21]. Other studies have shown an improvement in the quality of life in simvastatin-treated patients with ARDS [22]. Nevertheless, the role of statins in ARDS remains controversial [23\u201328].Thus, there are many uncertainties about the concurrent cognitive decline in ARDS and the potential benefit of statins\u2014not in terms of reducing mortality or time to clinical discharge but after returning home\u2014for patients with ARDS. We hypothesised that cerebral cytokine production and nitro-oxidative stress could be attenuated by early treatment with rosuvastatin. MethodsAfter approval by the institutional and state animal care committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, Germany; approval number G15-1\u2013077), we performed this prospective randomized controlled animal study in accordance with the international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. This manuscript adheres to the applicable EQUATOR guidelines. Some of the animals used in this study were also part of other studies [29].Anaesthesia and instrumentationThirty-two healthy male pigs (sus scrofa domestica, weight: 26\u201333\u00a0kg) were randomized to one of four groups: lung injury by central venous injection of oleic acid (OAI, n\u2009=\u20098), statin treatment 12\u00a0h before and directly after lung injury (SBA, n\u2009=\u20098), statin treatment after lung injury (SA, n\u2009=\u20098), or ventilation only (VO, n\u2009=\u20098).The whole study and post-mortem analyses were done investigator-blinded. The person responsible for the treatment with rosuvastatin was not involved in any other part of the study.Anaesthesia and instrumentation were conducted as described before [30]. All animals were delivered sedated (4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 ketamine, 8\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 azaperon intramuscular) by a local breeder. After establishing an intravenous line, anaesthesia was induced and maintained by propofol (8\u201312\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0h\u22121) and fentanyl (0.1\u20130.2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0h\u22121). A single dose of atracurium (0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) was administered to facilitate orotracheal intubation. Ventilation (respirator: Engstr\u00f6m Carestation\u00ae, GE Healthcare, Germany) was started in pressure-controlled mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 7\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 0.4, and a variable respiratory rate to maintain normocapnia. A balanced electrolyte solution (Sterofundin ISO, B. Braun, Germany) was continuously infused at a rate of 5\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0h\u22121. Vascular catheters were placed ultrasound-guided: an arterial line, a pulse contour cardiac output catheter (PiCCO, Pulsion Medical Systems, Germany), a central venous line, and a 7.5 French introducer for a pulmonary arterial catheter were inserted via femoral vascular access. Respiratory and extended hemodynamic parameters were recorded continuously (Datex S/5, GE Healthcare, Germany). The PiCCO was calibrated regularly for measurement of extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) as marker for pulmonary oedema and cardiac index (CI) to rule out acute cardiac failure. Further respiratory parameters and measurements were recorded by the respirator. Normothermia was maintained by body surface warming.Study protocolThe study protocol was described before [30]. Following instrumentation, we set the FiO2 to 1.0 and conducted a lung recruitment manoeuvre (plateau pressure 40 cmH2O for 10\u00a0s). Baseline parameters were then assessed at healthy state. For the animals in the lung injury and treatment groups (OAI, SBA, SA), 0.1\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121 of oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) was dissolved in 20\u00a0ml saline solution and injected via the central venous line in fractions of 2\u00a0ml every 3\u00a0min. The procedure was repeated with another 0.1\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121 after 15\u00a0min if the PaO2/FiO2 was higher than 200\u00a0mmHg. After the ARDS criteria [1] were fulfilled, the animals were treated according to a standard protocol that was closely adapted to that used in human treatment in ICUs. The respirator was set at Vt 6\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121, FiO2 and PEEP, as displayed in Table \u200bTable1,1, with an intended SpO2 of 94\u201398%. If necessary to warrant stable hemodynamics during the experiments (mean arterial pressure\u2009>\u200965\u00a0mmHg), norepinephrine was administered. We collected blood samples directly after induction of lung injury and 6, 12, and 18\u00a0h later. After 18\u00a0h, the animals were sacrificed under deep general anaesthesia by injection of 200\u00a0mg propofol and 40\u00a0mmol potassium.Table 1PEEP/FiO2 setting according to the low PEEP/high FiO2 table of the ARDSnetFiO20.40.40.50.50.60.70.70.7PEEP5881010101214FiO20.80.90.90.91.01.01.01.0PEEP1414161818202224Open in a separate windowRosuvastatin treatmentAnimals of two groups were treated with rosuvastatin: the animals of the SA group and the animals of the SBA group.The animals of the SA group received 1\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight rosuvastatin intravenously after induction of the lung injury. Rosuvastatin for intravenous treatment was dissolved in saline as described by Prinz et al. [31].The animals of the SBA group received rosuvastatin at two different time points during the study. 12\u00a0h before the lung injury was induced, the animals were fed with one tablet rosuvastatin (25\u00a0mg). Additionally, the animals of this group received 1\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight rosuvastatin intravenously after induction of the lung injury. Rosuvastatin for intravenous treatment was dissolved in saline as described by Prinz et al. [31].Post-Mortem analysisAfter death, the brains and lungs were harvested for further investigations. We obtained a defined slice of the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of the brain samples. All samples were shock frosted (in liquid nitrogen) for molecular biological analysis and assessment of nitro-oxidative stress.The lungs were used for wet/dry ratio, histopathology, TNFalpha mRNA and nitro-oxidative stress measurements.Wet-to-dry ratioThe left lung was weighted immediately after removal and dried afterwards at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h to determine the dry weight and wet-to-dry ratio.Lung histopathologyAfter extraction of the lungs, dependent and non-dependent lung regions were sampled, fixed in formalin for paraffin sectioning and stained with HE. The lung injury score was assessed as previously described [32]. In short, 7 different parameters in 4 non-overlapping regions are evaluated by a blinded investigator and scored with a severity grade between 0 and 5 points. These points add up to the total lung injury score with a maximum of 140 points.Cerebral cytokine expressionTo determine the cerebral production of mRNA of TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8, and iNOS we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, Lightcycler 480 PCR System, Roche Applied Science, Germany) as previously described [33]. mRNA expression data were normalized against peptidylprolyl isomerase A as a control gene.

Analysis of total protein homogenates was performed by dot blot as previously described [34]. For this, equal amounts of protein homogenates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and each sample applied to a buffer-soaked nitrocellulose membrane Protran BA85 (0.45\u00a0\u03bcm) using a Minifold I vacuum dot-blot system device (Whatman Schleicher& Schuell, Dassel, Germany) with a 96-well top frame. Each slot was washed with 250\u00a0\u03bcl PBS and the membrane was dried for 60\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. For detection of nitrated protein, a mouse monoclonal 3NT antibody (Millipore) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence after incubation with a peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 (Vector Lab, USA). Densitometric quantification was performed with a ChemiLux Imager (CsX-1400\u00a0M, Intas, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and Gel-Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD).StatisticsThe results were analysed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc tests for multiple testing (SNK), a p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. Sigmaplot 12.5 was used for analysation of the data and graphing the plots. ResultsOxygenation ratio dropped significantly and peak pressure increased significantly after induction of lung injury at all measured time points in OAI animals compared to ventilation-only animals. This effect was not affected by treatment with statins. Furthermore, induction of lung injury led to a significant increase in PEEP, fiO2, and EVLWI at certain time points compared to VO without amelioration by statin treatment.

Rosuvastatin treatment reduced IL-6 mRNA production and 3-nitrotyrosine concentrations in the brains of the animals.Central venous injection of oleic acid is an established animal model of acute lung injury [35], characterised by alveolar haemorrhage, intravascular thrombosis, PMN infiltration, and an increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability. These conditions lead to severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and increased shunt, which results in hypoxaemia and increased mean airway pressures. Furthermore, pulmonary oedema, characterised by elevation of extravascular lung water and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the airspace and interstitium, develops. These hemodynamic effects lead to myocardial depression, early systemic hypotension, and pulmonary hypertension [2]. Our study animals reliably developed the described pathologic changes. Some of these pathologies ameliorated (paO2, MPAP) over time. This is in contrast to the study by Matute-Bello et al., who reported the maximal effect of oleic acid after 12\u00a0h [2]. This may be attributable to persistent protective ventilation, which may prevent the aggravation of inflammation through mechanical ventilation by minimizing alveolar stress, strain, and cyclic recruitment and derecruitment [36]. Even though treatment with rosuvastatin reduced the pulmonary damage assessed by histopathology, it did not improve oxygenation. This could explain partly the results of a clinical trial that showed no improvement of \u201chard\u201d outcome parameters, such as mortality or ventilator-free days, in ARDS patients treated with statins [18].TNFalpha is a central cytokine in the inflammatory response. It is involved in the development of various pulmonary diseases, including acute lung injury and ARDS [37]. It also plays an important role in the cognitive decline of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [38] and is associated with postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction [39]. The lungs of our animals showed no intergroup differences in TNFalpha concentration. TNFalpha accumulates usually very rapidly after an insult to the lungs [40]; thus, expect higher levels were expected, at least in the animals of the oleic acid group. As mentioned above, the absence of TNFalpha may be due to the protective ventilation in our study setting, which might have prevented further biotrauma to the lungs and thereby enabled the amelioration of lung function and immune response. Nonetheless, oleic acid-induced lung injury led to persistent damage to the lungs, as shown by a significant increase in the lung injury score in the animals of the oleic acid group compared to ventilation-only animals. The lungs of the animals in the SA group showed a similar result, whereas the damage to the lungs of the SBA animals was non-significantly lower than that of the oleic-acid animals, but simultaneously non-significantly higher than that of the VO-animals. Dot blot revealed significantly higher 3-nitrotyrosine concentrations in the animals of the oleic acid groups compared to all other groups, whereas there was no difference between the animals in the VO, SA, or SBA group. This could be attributable to the antioxidant capacity of rosuvastatin.The time course of TNFalpha blood levels supports the idea of an only short-term immune response in our study setting. Immediately after induction of lung injury, TNFalpha increased significantly in the blood samples of the animals in the OAI group but decreased rapidly after and reached baseline values. The comparison of TNAalpha blood levels in OAI animals with VO animals directly after ARDS induction missed significance, but showed a strong tendency to higher values in OAI animals (OAI 147\u2009\u00b1\u200985\u00a0pg/ml, VO 65\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u00a0pg/ml p\u2009=\u20090.06). This is similar to the study of Bickenbach et al., who found a non-significant tendency for an increase in serum TNFalpha in an animal model of acid aspiration-induced lung injury [12]. Statin treatment blunted this initial increase, which may be due to the anti-inflammatory properties of rosuvastatin.Circulating TNFalpha can compromise the blood brain barrier [41]. Furthermore, it can activate microglia cells through receptors present in cerebral blood vessels [42]. Activated microglia cells, in turn, produce and release TNFalpha [43]. In our study, we found no difference in cerebral or hippocampal TNFalpha mRNA concentrations between the groups. Whether this is indicative of a non-activation of microglia cells or of a transient effect parallel to the blood levels of TNFalpha remains unclear. IL-8, another cytokine, showed no difference between the groups either. A third indicator of cerebral inflammation is IL-6. In our study, IL-6 mRNA significantly increased in the hippocampus of the OA animals compared to the VO animals. Bellaver et al. examined cerebral cytokine production in animals treated with intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found an increase in hippocampal IL-6 production [44]. Intraperitoneal application of LPS is a sepsis model, not a pure ARDS model, as sepsis leads to a fast breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier, causing cerebral inflammation [45]. Cytokine release in ARDS is lower than in sepsis; therefore, the breakdown\u2014or potential breakdown\u2014of the blood\u2013brain barrier may take longer, which could explain these results. Treatment with rosuvastatin seems to reduce the hippocampal production of IL-6.Nitric oxide (NO) production by iNOS is thought to cause neuronal damage under several conditions [46], especially in early inflammatory syndromes [47]. NO production in the presence of superoxide leads to peroxynitrite formation, which in turn leads to the nitration of various molecules and subsequently to neuronal cell death [48]. We found no difference in iNOS mRNA between the groups in cortical nor in hippocampal tissue. Nevertheless, we found an increase in 3-nitrotyrosine production. This effect was significantly blunted in the animals of the statin groups, perhaps due to its antioxidant properties. This is concordant with a study by Kadoi et al., who found an increase in cerebral nitrotyrosine formation 24\u00a0h after caecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis [49]. The missing induction of iNOS mRNA may be due to the time course used in our study. In mice, hippocampal iNOS increased significantly 24\u00a0h after LPS-induced sepsis [50], whereas there was no increase in iNOS in other brain regions.Our study features some limitations. Lung injury induced by injection of oleic acid is a well-established model for acute ARDS and is characterized by a profound change in oxygenation due to microvascular thrombosis, PMN infiltration, necrosis, and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the airspace, with extravascular lung water accumulation [51]. All these features were reproduced in our study after the onset of ARDS but improved during the course of the study. In particular, the wet-to-dry ratio as a marker for pulmonary oedema did not differ between the lung injury group and the control group. Even though the pulmonary damage score was significantly higher in the lung injury group, the lack of difference in the wet-to-dry ratio indicates a certain amelioration of the lung injury, possibly due to the lung-protective ventilator setting. Furthermore, the observed amelioration could go along with an amelioration of lung inflammation. This amelioration, in turn, could lead to an attenuated cytokine release in the blood with a less pronounced systemic inflammatory response and accordingly reduced cerebral inflammation compared to septic conditions. Another limitation is the duration of our experiment. Usually, patients with ARDS are in need of mechanical ventilation for several days [52], whereas our experiment was limited to 18\u00a0h. This may be too short to induce a cerebral reaction not mediated by the nervous system but by the circulatory system. The systemic immune response usually lags some days after localised infection. Lastly, we examined only the mRNA of the cerebral cytokines, not proteins. We did this to rule out an overspill of plasmatic cytokines into the brain. Finally, oleic acid is known to transiently open the blood\u2013brain-barrier [53, 54], so maybe the observed changes in cerebral IL-6 and nitro-tyrosine are due to an oleic acid effect. This seems rather unlikely, because to examine effects of oleic acid on the blood\u2013brain-barrier, it has to be injected intra-arterial. It seems doubtful that a relevant amount of oleic acid reaches the brain after passing through the pulmonal vasculature. ConclusionThis is the first study to show an increase in cerebral nitro-oxidative stress after experimental ARDS in pigs and an attenuation of this effect through treatment with rosuvastatin. Previous studies failed to show an effect of statin treatment on \u201chard\u201d outcome parameters, such as mortality, length of hospital stay, or ventilator-free days in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS [19, 55]. Some studies have found a significant increase in quality of life and cost reduction in patients treated with simvastatin compared to a placebo [22]. Considering these with our results, it can be concluded that treating ARDS patients with statins may not affect the immediate outcome but could have positive effects in the long run. These effects may be due to the reduction of cerebral inflammation and accompanying neurocognitive disorders. Further investigations regarding possible cerebral inflammation after a longer duration of ARDS and a possible protective effect of statin treatment are necessary.
