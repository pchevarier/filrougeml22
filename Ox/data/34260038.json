A non-negligible percentage of 5\u201315% patients with coronavirus disease\u00a02019 (COVID-19) need hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs) [1]. According to a recent meta-analysis, overall mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been calculated at 35.5% (0\u201385%) although the attributable mortality was not reported [2]. Additionally, the incidence of respiratory co-infection with gram-negative pathogens seems to be higher in patients with COVID-19 [3].Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) has been described in patients with influenza and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the ICU and is no longer considered a rare complication [3]. Similarly, early during the pandemic suspected cases of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) were described [4]. The airway epithelium is directly damaged by respiratory viruses, enabling Aspergillus to invade tissue. Immune dysregulation, treatment with systemic corticosteroid or anti-interleukin-6 agents and diffuse alveolar damage in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are included in the risk factors predisposing to ventilator-associated pneumonia and CAPA [5, 6]. However, the exact incidence of CAPA is not known since the typical host, clinical and radiological factors often used to diagnose invasive fungal diseases are not present in patients with CAPA [7], whereas mycological evidence is based on positive Aspergillus cultures in non-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, such as bronchial secretions, tracheal aspirates and sputum, which may reflect colonization rather than infection. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that CAPA diagnosis was made on the basis of AspICU criteria which were initially developed for IAPA [3, 8] and may not be applicable to CAPA [9]. CAPA-specific diagnostic criteria have been recently developed by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) [9] (Table\u00a01). Furthermore, the mortality of CAPA in the setting of co-infections with gram-negative pathogens is unknown.\nTable\u00a01Different criteria for defining invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

MethodsPatientsThe study was conducted at Attikon University hospital (Athens, Greece) during the COVID-19 pandemic between 22\u00a0March 2020 and 28\u00a0February 2021. During this period three waves of COVID-19 occurred in Greece, the first between March and July 2020, the second between August and December 2020 while the third is ongoing. \u201cAttikon\u201d University hospital is a tertiary 650-bed teaching hospital and referral centre for central and south Greece as well as most of the Aegean islands with a total ICU capacity of 23 beds. During the pandemic all 23 beds were dedicated to mechanically ventilated patients infected by coronavirus, while non-COVID-19 cases were hospitalized in newly opened ICU beds. Data regarding patients admitted to the ICU with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. In our ICU, respiratory samples are routinely collected once a week for surveillance bacterial and fungal cultures. In case of clinical deterioration new cultures are also collected, a BAL is performed if considered necessary and respiratory and serum samples are sent for full mycological diagnostic workup as described below. A CT scan of the chest is performed if the patient can be safely transferred. Clinical records were analysed including demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features, treatment and outcomes of patients with CAPA.The study protocol was approved by the local institutional Review Board and Bioethics Committee (\u0395\u0392\u039496/15-2-2021).Samples for Mycological WorkupRespiratory samples were analysed by direct and fluorescence microscopy using Blankophor P and cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar with gentamicin and chloramphenicol plates (SGC2; bioMerieux) incubated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 3\u00a0weeks. Recovered isolates were identified macro-/microscopically to species level. Aspergillus fumigatus sensu stricto (SS) was identified on the basis of growth at 48\u00a0\u00b0C. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) to amphotericin\u00a0B, caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin, isavuconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and posaconazole was performed in all isolates using the EUCAST E. Def 9.3.2 reference broth microdilution method [10]. Serum and respiratory samples were stored at\u2009\u2212\u200970\u00a0\u00b0C until tested for galactomannan (GM), (1,3)-\u03b2-d-glucan (BDG) and Aspergillus DNA (PCR). A commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (Platelia Aspergillus EIA; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to quantify GM antigen in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A result was considered positive when the index value was\u2009\u2265\u20090.5. BDG was detected with the Dynamiker Fungus BDG assay (Dynamiker Biothechnology-Tianjin Co, Ltd, China) as recommended by the manufacturer. BDG levels of \u2265\u200995, 70\u201394 and\u2009<\u200970\u00a0pg/mL were considered positive, inconclusive and negative results, respectively. Serum assays were performed in duplicate. A real-time PCR was developed in line with the published European Aspergillus PCR Initiative recommendations for serum [11]. Aspergillus DNA was extracted from 1\u00a0mL serum after enzymatic (incubation with protease\u00a0K at 56\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min) and mechanical (15\u00a0min vortex with glass beads) pre-treatment using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche, Athens, Greece) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed with a previously validated assay (2Asp assay) using Aspergillus-specific primers (ASF1 and ADR1) targeting the 28S rRNA gene and an Aspergillus-specific hydrolysis probe (ASP28P). All PCR runs included a positive (spiked human sera) and a negative (water in place of DNA extract) control. When no amplification was observed after 43 PCR cycles (Ct), the sample was considered negative by PCR [12].DefinitionsCAPA was classified by clinical, mycological and radiological criteria according to both the modified AspICU [3, 8] and 2020 ECMM/ISHAM criteria [9] (Table\u00a01). Classification according to the revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) 2020 criteria [7, 13] was not feasible because none of the included patients presented any of the required host risk factors. Moreover, no case could be classified as proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) because neither lung biopsy nor autopsy was performed. ResultsDuring the study period 1161 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital with a total of 179 admissions in the ICU, 35 in the first wave. Among the 179 critically ill patients, six (3.3%) had clinical and mycological characteristics of invasive aspergillosis and were treated accordingly. Detailed clinical and radiological characteristics of all patients are presented in Table\u00a02, whereas the time course of infection and treatment is shown in Fig.\u00a01. Of note, all cases were noticed during the second wave. BAL was performed in one patient for therapeutic reasons. Median age was 78\u00a0years (55\u201382) and 50% were male. All patients received dexamethasone 6\u00a0mg/day for 10\u00a0days, 3/6 remdesivir and 1/6 anakinra\u2009+\u2009convalescent plasma. No patient had a history of immunosuppression. All patients were diagnosed with ARDS according to Berlin definition [14]. The median time from intubation to diagnosis of CAPA was 6\u00a0days (range 1\u201314). Signs of clinical deterioration and septic shock have been recorded in four patients at the time of diagnosis. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanni was isolated from the blood of 5/6 patients. Five patients had positive Aspergillus cultures in bronchial secretions (1 A.\u00a0fumigatus species complex (SS), 1 A.\u00a0flavus SC, 1 A.\u00a0fumigatus SS\u2009+\u2009A.\u00a0flavus SC, 1 A.\u00a0fumigatus SS\u2009+\u2009A.\u00a0terreus SC and 1 A.\u00a0terreus SC) while culture was negative in one patient. Serum GM index and Aspergillus PCR were positive in 4/6 patients (67%) and 5/6 (83%) although PCR was positive in two consecutive samples in 3 patients. BDG was positive in sera of 4/6 patients with CAPA (all 4 with consecutive samples). Furthermore, GM and PCR were positive in 4/4 bronchial secretions analysed for GM and Aspergillus DNA with GM indices\u2009>\u20099.95 and PCR Ct\u2009<\u200934. Detailed microbiology data are presented in Table\u00a02. According to the AST all isolates were susceptible to voriconazole and isavuconazole. Three patients completed the treatment. Mortality was as high as 67% (4/6) and 1/4 was attributed to CAPA.Table\u00a02Characteristics of ICU patients with CAPACase123456SexFemaleFemaleFemaleMaleMaleMaleAge558282667581Underlying diseaseNoneHypertension, diabetesHypertension, dementiaSmoking, obesity, sleep apneaSmokingHypertension, diabetes, COPD, ischemic strokePaO2/FiO2 admission90901201007080ARDSSevereSevereModerateSevereSevereSevereImagining findingsEmphysema, pneumomediastinum, crazy paving, ground glass opacities and bronchiectasisNAMultiple bilateral infiltrates, ground glass opacitiesAtelectasisGround glass opacities 75%NADexamethasone6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0days6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0days6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0days6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0days6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0days6\u00a0mg/day, 10\u00a0daysAnti-COVID-19 TxNoNoConvalescent plasma\u2009+\u2009anakinraRemdesivirRemdesivirRemdesivirDays on mechanical ventilation till CAPA diagnosis9141537SARS-COV-2 PCR (Ct) on day of CAPA diagnosisNegativeNegativePositive (16)Positive (24)Positive (33)Positive (25)SOFA score647788Antifungal Tx (days)Isavuconazole (36)Isavuconazole (13)Isavuconazole (7)Isavuconazole (7)Caspofungin, LipAmpho\u00a0B (4)Isavuconazole (35)Septic shockYesYesNoYesYesNoLOS (days)42281841845MortalityYesYesYesNoYesNoSerum fungal biomarkers (max values)\u00a0BDG (pg/mL)NegativePositive (106.7)Inconclusive (75.4)Positive (151.4)Positive (171.5)Positive (242)\u00a0GM (Index)Positive (2.5)NegativePositive (1.51)NegativePositive (8.9)Positive (1.03)\u00a0PCR (Ct)Positive (36.8)Positive (35.7)Positive (34.9)NegativePositive (28.9)Positive (36.8)Respiratory samples fungal biomarkers (max values)\u00a0BDG (pg/mL)Positive (833.7)NAPositive (913.7)Positive (906.7)NAPositive (772.33)\u00a0GM (Index)Positive (2.4)NAPositive (9.9)Positive (11.4)NAPositive (10.0)\u00a0PCR (Ct)Positive (32.6)NAPositive (25.3)Positive (33.7)NAPositive (34.0)\u00a0CultureA.\u00a0fumigatus SSA.\u00a0flavus SCA.\u00a0fumigatus SS, A. flavus SCA.\u00a0fumigatus SS, A. terreus SCNegativeA.\u00a0terreus SCAspICU modifiedPutative aspergillosisPutative aspergillosisPutative aspergillosisPutative aspergillosisPutative aspergillosisPutative aspergillosisECMM/ISHAMProbable CAPAPossible CAPAProbable CAPAPossible CAPAProbable CAPAProbable CAPAOpen in a separate windowARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, BDG (1,3)-\u03b2-d-glucan, CAPA COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, COVID-19 coronovirus disease 2019, Ct cycle threshold, ECMM European Clinical Medical Mycology, GM galactomannan, ISHAM International Society Human and Animal Mycology, LOS length of stay, PCR polymerase chain reaction, SC species complex, SS sensu stricto, NA not availableOpen in a separate windowFig. 1Kinetics of galactomannan (GM) index and C-reactive protein (CRP) together with microbiological and treatment data for each patient.

She was extubated after a week, but she had to be intubated again 2\u00a0days later. GM and Aspergillus PCR were positive in serum. A.\u00a0fumigatus SS was then isolated in bronchial secretions. Her deterioration was partly attributed to a putative infection by the fungus, so she was started on isavuconazole 2\u00a0days after the result of the culture. Her respiratory function was ameliorated. Multidrug-resistant A.\u00a0baumanni was cultured from blood on day\u00a040. On day\u00a053, she presented pyopneumothorax and CT scan was performed showing subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, crazy paving, ground glass opacities and bronchiectasis (Fig.\u00a02).

CT chest showing ground glass opacities with bronchiectatic regions and thickening of intralobular septal (ICU day\u00a02)Patient 2An 82-year-old woman was admitted to the infectious diseases department because of fever and hypoxemia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Ten days later the patient was intubated and transferred to our ICU. A.\u00a0flavus SC was isolated in the bronchial secretions. Although GM in serum was negative, PCR and BDG were positive in two samples. Isavuconazole was started 8\u00a0days after the first isolation of the mould. Multidrug-resistant A.\u00a0baumanni was cultured from blood on day\u00a05 in the ICU. The patient presented deterioration of respiratory and hemodynamic function and died 13\u00a0days later.Patient 3An 82-year-old woman was admitted to the ICU 2\u00a0days after her admission to the infectious diseases department being positive for SARS-CoV-2. She was under treatment with convalescent plasma therapy and anakinra. The first sample of bronchial secretions was positive for A.\u00a0fumigatus SS and the second sample taken by mini-BAL 9\u00a0days later was positive for A.\u00a0flavus SC. Multidrug-resistant A.\u00a0baumanni was cultured from blood on day\u00a08 in the ICU. A CT scan was performed showing multiple bilateral infiltrates and ground glass opacities covering 50\u201375% of lung parenchyma (Fig.\u00a02). The GM antigen and Aspergillus PCR in the serum were positive. The patient was started on isavuconazole 9\u00a0days after the first culture, but her respiratory function was further deteriorated and she died 9\u00a0days later.Patient 4A 66-year-old man was admitted to the ICU 7\u00a0days after his admission to the infectious diseases department with dyspnea, weakness and fever and a positive SARS-CoV-2 with severe ARDS and hemodynamic instability. He was treated with remdesivir. On day\u00a03 he developed septic shock that was managed with adequate antibiotic therapy and vasopressors. On day\u00a010, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was performed because of a right lung atelectasis (Fig.\u00a02). A.\u00a0baumanni was isolated from the BAL. GM and PCR were negative in serum and positive in bronchial secretions from where A.\u00a0fumigatus SS and A.\u00a0terreus SC were isolated. The patient received isavuconazole starting on day\u00a06 of the diagnosis. A.\u00a0baumanni was cultured from blood on day\u00a020. His situation ameliorated and after a tracheostomy was performed, he was able to be transferred for further treatment to the clinical floor.Patient 5A 75-year-old man was admitted to the infectious diseases department with dyspnea, weakness and fever and a test positive for SARS-CoV-2. The CT scan of the chest showed ground glass opacities occupying about 75% of lung parenchyma (Fig.\u00a02). During the next 9\u00a0days his situation deteriorated so he was intubated and admitted to the ICU with severe ARDS and multiorgan failure. GM and Aspergillus PCR in serum were positive. The patient was initially treated with caspofungin and then with liposomal amphotericin\u00a0B, but he died because of multiorgan failure.Patient 6An 81-year-old man was admitted to the ICU after 4\u00a0days of hospitalisation in the infectious diseases department for COVID-19 infection. On day\u00a06 in the ICU he presented fever, elevated inflammatory markers and deterioration of respiratory function. GM was positive in serum and 2\u00a0days after culture of bronchial secretions were positive for A.\u00a0terreus SC. Isavuconazole was started. On day\u00a08, A.\u00a0baumanni was cultured from blood. The patient\u2019s condition ameliorated, a tracheostomy was performed and he was transferred to a step-down unit. DiscussionThe coronavirus pandemic first appeared in Greece on 26\u00a0February 2020, about 2\u00a0months after the outbreak of the disease in China. In a population of just over 11\u00a0million, Greek authorities have recorded 263,689 confirmed cases of the disease and a death toll of 8093 (3%) as of March 2021 [13]. Patients with several comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases and malignancy present a higher rate of severe illness [15]. Several cases of CAPA have been described globally. According to a recent study, a total of 151 cases of patients on mechanical ventilation have been published until now [16]. To our knowledge these are the first six cases of CAPA in critically ill patients ever described in Greece and the first one in the setting of gram-negative bacterial infections.The incidence of CAPA in our single-centre study was as high as 3.3%, similar to the studies by Machado et al. [17] and Lamoth et al. [18], but considerably lower in comparison to other studies [19\u201321]. Of note most of those studies did not use the recently published CAPA-specific criteria defined by ECMM/ISHAM. On the basis of those criteria, the rates of possible and probable CAPA were 1.1% and 2.2%, respectively, in our centre. For the two patients with possible CAPA, the first patient had Aspergillus PCR+ in serum but not in two consecutive samples and positive Aspergillus non-BAL culture and for the second patient GM, Aspergillus PCR and cultures were positive in bronchial secretions. In a recent study performing extensive diagnostic testing in the UK, rates of 5% and 15% of proven/probable and possible diagnosis of CAPA, respectively, were reported [22]. Significant differences are observed between countries. Possible explanations could include geographical differences, different risk factors and different applied diagnostic algorithms [19].COVID-19 pneumonia per se has been suggested as a possible risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. Furthermore, treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone, usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics and dysregulated immune response have been proposed as predisposing factors favouring Aspergillus infections [23] in the setting of COVID-19. A cumulative azithromycin dose of at least 1500\u00a0mg and a high dose of dexamethasone have also been mentioned as possible risk factors associated with CAPA in a recent French multicentre cohort study [24, 25]. Our patients received a total azithromycin dose exceeding 1500\u00a0mg. Treatment with medicine other than dexamethasone could possibly explain the absence of Aspergillus cases during the first wave along with the small number of patients in our study.Differentiating between colonization and invasive Aspergillus disease is difficult, especially in immunocompetent patients. Therefore, a full mycological workup is imperative. GM detection is more sensitive in BAL than in blood in non-neutropenic patients who are more likely to have a non-angioinvasive IPA, as opposed to neutropenic patients [7, 26]. It has been emphasized that since GM detection is not validated on non-BAL respiratory samples, its use may contribute to overdiagnosis of IPA in patients with COVID-19. According to the recent 2020 ECMM/ISHAM consensus criteria, a non-BAL GM index of >\u20094.5 or twice\u2009>\u20091\u20132 is suggested [9]. Indeed, in 3/4 cases where non-BAL GM was available, indices were\u2009>\u20099.95. Interestingly, while in most studies serum GM and PCR were negative in patients with CAPA as opposed to IAPA [16], in our patients the serum GM index and Aspergillus PCR were positive in 4/6 patients (67%) and 5/6 (83%) although PCR was positive in two consecutive samples only in 3 patients. BDG was positive in sera of 4/6 patients with CAPA (all 4 with consecutive samples). Some authors suggested that receiving hydroxychloroquine could negatively influence the GM measurement in serum [27]. Of note, none of our patients received hydroxychloroquine since all cases were registered in the second wave of the disease. Another explanation could be the severity of COVID-19 infection as in three of our patients the SARS-CoV-2 inoculum as quantified by RT-PCR Ct values was rather low (persistent high viral load) at the time of Aspergillus infection, a parameter rarely reported in the literature [28].The impact of Aspergillus treatment on survival of patients with CAPA is currently unknown. The overall mortality was 67% (4/6 patients). A similar cause of death and a high mortality are reported in earlier studies [25, 29]. However, in the setting of gram-negative multidrug-resistant bacterial infections the attributable mortality of CAPA was only 17% (1/6 patients) as bacterial septic shock and multiorgan failure was the cause of death for the 3/4 patients who died. Nevertheless antifungal treatment has to be implemented and, while voriconazole remains the main treatment for IPA, we preferred the use of isavuconazole owing to its lack of nephrotoxicity, fewer drug\u2013drug interactions observed than with voriconazole, especially with COVID-19 addressed therapies such as remdesivir [29]. Furthermore, there was no need for monitoring drug levels. Most patients in the literature have been treated with voriconazole and more rarely with echinocandins or amphotericin\u00a0B. Treatment with voriconazole is probably associated with a better prognosis compared to echinocandins or amphotericin\u00a0B [28]. Suggested treatment duration according to the guidelines is between 6 and 12\u00a0weeks. Three of our patients (50%) were treated for more than 2\u00a0weeks.In conclusion, the strength of our study was that many patients with CAPA had positive biomarkers in serum in combination with positive cultures in respiratory samples which increased the certainty of diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in ICU patients with COVID-19 and the fact that it provides one of the first estimates of CAPA incidence and attributable mortality using the CAPA-specific criteria recently determined by ECMM/ISHAM in 2020 in the setting of gram-negative bacterial infections. Among the limitations are that our data are derived from only one centre and the definite diagnosis lacks histological confirmation. Further studies are needed in order to (a) elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the association between COVID-19 and CAPA and (b) to define the true incidence of the disease. Since difficulties in diagnosing CAPA have contributed to increased mortality rates via delayed diagnosis, a high level of awareness of ICU physicians for CAPA might prove lifesaving. Thus, early identification and treatment need to be implemented.
