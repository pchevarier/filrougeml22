Using whole-genome ChIP-on-chip analysis, we demonstrate that, in addition to miRNA sequences, Drosha specifically binds promoter-proximal regions of many human genes in a transcription-dependent manner. This binding is not associated with miRNA production or RNA cleavage. Drosha knockdown in HeLa cells downregulated nascent gene transcription, resulting in a reduction of polyadenylated mRNA produced from these gene regions. Furthermore, we show that this function of Drosha is dependent on its N-terminal protein-interaction domain, which associates with the RNA-binding protein CBP80 and RNA Polymerase II. Consequently, we uncover a previously unsuspected RNA cleavage-independent function of Drosha in the regulation of human gene expression. Graphical AbstractOpen in a separate window IntroductionMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding regulatory molecules, involved in diverse biological processes. Biogenesis of miRNAs involve a nuclear phase, where the Microprocessor complex, comprising Drosha, an RNase III-like enzyme and its cofactor DGCR8, process primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into a 70 nt pre-miRNA (Han et\u00a0al., 2004, Lee et\u00a0al., 2003, Zeng et\u00a0al., 2005). This occurs cotranscriptionally from both independently transcribed and intron-encoded miRNAs (Ballarino et\u00a0al., 2009, Kim and Kim, 2007, Morlando et\u00a0al., 2008). Following Drosha-mediated RNA cleavage and pre-miRNA release from the nascent RNA, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nascent RNA ends are trimmed by 5\u2032-3\u2032 Xrn2 and 3\u2032-5\u2032 exosome (Morlando et\u00a0al., 2008), and the pre-miRNA precursor is exported to the cytoplasm (Lund et\u00a0al., 2004, Yi et\u00a0al., 2003). Here, a second RNase III enzyme, Dicer, further processes the pre-miRNA into the mature miRNA duplex (Bernstein et\u00a0al., 2001) that targets specific mRNAs for degradation or translational inactivation (reviewed in Bartel, 2009).MiRNA levels are tightly regulated at the posttranscriptional level by a number of RNA-binding proteins (Siomi and Siomi, 2010). Furthermore, Drosha can directly regulate levels of Microprocessor complex by cleaving hairpin structures in DGCR8 mRNA, thereby decreasing DGCR8 protein levels (Han et\u00a0al., 2009, Triboulet et\u00a0al., 2009). Along the same lines, Drosha knockdown in Drosophila leads to upregulation of some mRNAs containing conserved RNA hairpins, potentially recognized by the Microprocessor complex (Kadener et\u00a0al., 2009). Several recent studies demonstrated the ability of Microprocessor complex to cleave mRNAs, thus regulating their expression. Many Drosha-dependent mRNA cleavage events were identified in mESCs, consistent with Microprocessor regulation of coding mRNAs through direct cleavage (Karginov et\u00a0al., 2010). Drosha can also cleave the TAR hairpin of the HIV-1 transcript, resulting in premature termination of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Wagschal et\u00a0al., 2012). A recent DGCR8 HITS-CLIP analysis extended these observations and revealed general noncanonical functions of the Microprocessor complex (Macias et\u00a0al., 2012). Transcriptome and proteome studies of mice lacking Drosha and Dicer suggest that both enzymes have nonredundant functions, as their deficiency can induce different phenotypes (Chong et\u00a0al., 2010). Although many RNAs were stabilized by Drosha depletion, some were downregulated, consistent with Drosha possessing independent functions to its role in canonical miRNA biogenesis.In human cells Drosha exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes (Gregory et\u00a0al., 2004). The smaller complex, containing just Drosha and DGCR8, is necessary and sufficient for miRNA processing. The larger complex, displaying only weak pre-miRNA processing activity in\u00a0vitro, contains DEAD-box RNA helicases, double-stranded RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP proteins, members of FUS/TLS family of proteins, and the SNIP1 protein, implying additional functions in gene expression. Thus, DEAD box helicases p68/p72 increase Drosha processing efficiency for a subset of miRNAs and at gene-specific promoters interact with transcriptional coactivators and Pol II and regulate alternative splicing (Fuller-Pace and Ali, 2008). Nuclear scaffolding protein hnRNPU and members of FUS/TLS family are also associated with regulation of transcription (Wang et\u00a0al., 2008). SNIP1, a component of a large SNIP1/SkIP-associated complex, involved in transcriptional regulation and cotranscriptional processing, interacts with Drosha and plays a role in miRNA biogenesis (Fujii et\u00a0al., 2006, Yu et\u00a0al., 2008). Ars2 is implicated in RNA silencing that functions in antiviral defense in flies and cell proliferation in mammals (Gruber et\u00a0al., 2009, Sabin et\u00a0al., 2009). It interacts with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBP20/CBP80) and is involved in miRNA biogenesis, suggesting a link\u00a0between RNA silencing and RNA-processing pathways. CBP20/CBP80 proteins are also implicated in miRNA biogenesis in plants (Kim et\u00a0al., 2008). Overall, the existence of this large Drosha-complex with only weak miRNA-processing activity suggests that Drosha\u00a0may play multiple roles in miRNA-independent gene regulation.Using genome-wide and gene-specific approaches we now show that Drosha binds to the promoter-proximal regions of many human genes in a transcription-dependent manner. Similarly, DGCR8 binds promoter-proximal regions of many human genes, suggesting that the whole Microprocessor is recruited at promoter regions. We also find that Drosha interacts with Pol II and its depletion from human cells causes transcriptional downregulation with a concomitant decrease in nascent and mature mRNA levels. This positive function of Drosha in gene expression is mediated through its interaction with the RNA-binding protein CBP80 and dependent on the N-terminal protein-interaction domain of Drosha. Thus, results presented in this paper demonstrate an miRNA- and cleavage-independent function of Drosha. ResultsDrosha Binds 5\u2032 Ends of Human Genes in a Transcription-Dependent MannerPre-miRNA processing occurs cotranscriptionally. Consequently binding of Drosha to nascent miRNA sequences can be detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Morlando et\u00a0al., 2008). To investigate genome-wide binding of Drosha, we employed a ChIP-on-chip approach using human 5.1.1 ENCODE array. Our results show that, in addition to miRNA regions, Drosha binds many human genes. This binding is enriched at the transcriptional start sites (TSSs), compared to the ends of transcripts (TxEnd), other gene body, or intergenic regions (Figure\u00a01A; full gene list in Table S1). In particular, we observed that, out of 160 TSS-proximal probes, 55 (34%) had more than 2-fold enrichment of Drosha-ChIP signal over the input signal. This is significantly more than 1,669 (10%) out of 15,998 total probes or 953 (11%) out of 8,333 probes in the gene bodies (p\u00a0< 0.0001, Fisher\u2019s exact test). The same level of enrichment was observed for four (40%) out of ten probes overlapping with annotated miRNA regions (Figure\u00a01Aii). By way of illustration, we present SELENPB1 and EEF1A1 genes, which scored positively in our genomic analysis, where Drosha selectively binds to 5\u2032-proximal gene regions (Figure\u00a0S1). Genes that are not expressed in HeLa cells such as IL4 and TARM1 demonstrated only background Drosha signal (Figure\u00a0S1). We also identified genes, such as G6PD, ZNF687, and FUNDC2, which are expressed in HeLa cells but did not demonstrate any\u00a0significant Drosha enrichment (Figure\u00a0S3A). We further confirmed these array data using gene-specific primers in ChIP\u00a0experiments. In particular, we observed an enrichment of Drosha binding to promoter-proximal region of SELENBP1 gene, colocalizing with Pol II peak (Figure\u00a0S2A). We did not detect any significant binding of Drosha or Pol II to IL4 and TARM1 genes, further confirming ChIP-on-chip results (Figures S2B and S2C). We also did not detect any significant Drosha binding over promoter-proximal region, enriched for Pol II, on G6PD gene (Figure\u00a0S3C).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Drosha Binds 5\u2032 Ends of Human Genes in a Transcription-Dependent Manner(A) (i) Metagene profiles of Drosha binding around transcriptional start sites (TSS, top) and transcriptional termination sites (TxEnd, bottom) based on Drosha ChIP-on-chip analysis in HeLa cells using ENCODE array.

The amount of RNA in the untreated cells was taken as 1.

See Figures S1\u2013S5.To investigate the function of Drosha at the beginning of human genes in more detail, we compared Pol II and Drosha binding profiles for specific human genes. Both Pol II and Drosha were enriched over the promoter-proximal regions of human \u03b3-actin, GAPDH, PTB, \u03b2-actin, and intronless TAF7 genes (Figures 1B, 1C, and S4A\u2013S4C). The enrichment of Drosha observed over these genes is higher than over the miR-330 locus within the EML2 gene, used as a positive control for Drosha binding (Morlando et\u00a0al., 2008) (Figure\u00a01D). As a negative control, we used ChIP for histone H3, which was found to be depleted from promoter-proximal regions and enriched in the body of these genes (Figure\u00a01Eiii). To test if Drosha binding to these genes is transcription dependent, we treated HeLa cells with Pol II transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Following this treatment, we observed \u223c80% reduction in pre-mRNA levels and a substantial reduction in Drosha binding to miR-330 locus, \u03b3-actin, and \u03b2-actin genes (Figures 1E and S4C). In contrast, we saw no effect on histone H3 binding (Figure\u00a01Eiii). These results indicate that, in addition to miRNA sequences, Drosha binds 5\u2032 end regions of human protein-coding genes in a transcription-dependent manner. Furthermore, we also searched for potential correlation between Drosha recruitment using our Drosha ChIP-array data and level of Pol II signal determined from available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in UCSC depository. We have calculated Pol II signal in 1 kb region around the TSS for Refseq transcripts covered by probes in the Drosha array. Following this analysis, we identified a weak (Pearson R\u00a0= 0.41) but significant (p\u00a0= 1e-6) correlation between the Drosha probe signal at TSS and Pol II ChIP density (Figure\u00a0S5), indicating that Drosha is preferentially recruited to the Pol II-rich regions. Overall, these results suggest that Drosha binding may be required for enhanced gene expression.DGCR8 Binds Promoter-Proximal Regions of Human GenesDrosha is known to bind miRNA sequences as part of the Microprocessor complex, which also contains DGCR8, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that is deleted in the DiGeorge syndrome (Landthaler et\u00a0al., 2004). To investigate whether Drosha binds 5\u2032 regions of human genes together with DGCR8, we carried out ChIP experiments in HeLa cells (Figure\u00a02A). DGCR8 was found to be enriched over the miR-330 locus, \u03b3-actin, GAPDH, and SELENBP1 promoter-proximal gene regions (Figure\u00a02A). These regions overlap Drosha binding regions (Figures 1, S2, and S4), suggesting that Drosha and DGCR8 may form a complex at promoter-proximal regions of human genes.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02DGCR8 Binds Promoter-Proximal Regions of Human Genes(A) DGCR8 ChIP analysis on \u03b3-actin, GAPDH, and SELENBP1 genes and the miR-330 genomic locus in HeLa cells.

The y axis shows the number of genes detected as a percentage, whereas the x axis represents the location in relation to the position of TSS and TTS.(C) Distribution of sense and antisense DRCG8 CLIP binding sites. 1,101 DGCR8 binding sites in the sense orientation correspond to 967 genes, and 196 DGCR8 antisense binding sites correspond to 174 genes.(D) Drosha in\u00a0vitro processing reactions in HeLa nuclear extracts with \u03b2-actin promoter-proximal region and miR17-18-19a sequences. Arrows indicate the positions of pre-miRNAs.See also Figures S6 and S7.To substantiate these findings in a genome-wide fashion, we analyzed a DGCR8 HITS-CLIP experiment that was performed with endogenous and overexpressed DGCR8 protein in HEK293T cells to identify DGCR8 endogenous RNA targets (Macias et\u00a0al., 2012). In particular, we observed 1,101 DGCR8 clusters, corresponding to 967 genes, in the sense orientation (see supplemental material in Macias et\u00a0al., 2012) and 196 DGCR8 clusters, corresponding to 174 genes, in antisense orientation (Figure\u00a02C; Table S2 for gene identity). Interestingly,\u00a0significant clusters of DGCR8 binding were seen at\u00a0\u22121,000/+200\u00a0bp from the TSSs and just upstream of the transcription termination regions (TTSs) (false discovery rate [FDR]\u00a0< 0.01) (Figure\u00a02B). In particular, we observed significant enrichment of DGCR8 binding in the region within 200 nt downstream of the TSS (sense versus antisense ks test p\u00a0< 2.2e-16; Figure\u00a02B). DGCR8 binding in this region is most pronounced in genes expressed at medium and high levels when compared to genes expressed at lower levels (ks test p\u00a0< 2.2e-16 in both cases) (Figure\u00a0S7A). These results clearly indicate that DGCR8, similar to Drosha, binds to promoter-proximal regions of human genes. However, it should be noted that when we analyzed DGCR8 binding to spliced mRNA transcripts (cDNAs) (Figure\u00a0S6), we also see an enrichment over exonic sequences immediately downstream of the TSS. Again, this is seen in genes with medium and high expression (ks test p\u00a0< 2.2e-16 in both cases) (Figure\u00a0S7B). This may be related to the reported binding of DGCR8 to multiple exonic regions (Macias et\u00a0al., 2012), potentially reflecting an additional function.Promoter-Proximal Binding of Drosha Is Not Related to miRNA Synthesis or RNA CleavageBinding of Drosha to promoter-proximal regions of human genes may be related to its potential role in processing miRNAs from these genomic regions, even though such elements are not annotated in the human genome databases. To test if Drosha binds and cleaves miRNAs present in promoter-proximal regions, we performed in\u00a0vitro pri-miRNA cleavage assays in HeLa nuclear extracts (Guil and C\u00e1ceres, 2007). Using in\u00a0vitro transcription reactions, we generated radiolabeled RNAs from gene regions, identified by Drosha ChIP. We employed miR-17-92 cluster within the C13orf25 human genomic region as a positive control for miRNA production. Following in\u00a0vitro cleavage assay in HeLa extracts, miRNAs were generated from the control miR-17-19a sequences but not from the promoter-proximal region of the \u03b2-actin gene (Figure\u00a02D). We also failed to detect pre-miRNAs or RNA cleavage products in\u00a0vitro for promoter-proximal regions of other genes, identified in Drosha ChIP assays (data not shown). These findings suggest that Drosha binding over promoter-proximal regions is not associated with miRNA synthesis and RNA cleavage.Drosha Knockdown Causes Transcriptional Downregulation and a Decrease in Pre-mRNA and Poly(A)+ RNATo investigate the promoter-associated function of Drosha, we performed RNAi-induced Drosha knockdown in HeLa cells (Figure\u00a03A). Following Drosha depletion, we observed a small increase in Pol II binding over the promoters of \u03b3-actin and GAPDH genes, using ChIP analysis (Figure\u00a03A). We also observed an \u223c20%\u201340% decrease in pre-mRNA levels and \u223c30%\u201360% decrease in poly(A)+ RNA levels in HeLa cells depleted for Drosha (Figure\u00a03B). In contrast, we did not detect any significant change in the levels of poly(A)+ and pre-mRNA corresponding to G6PD, ZNF687, and FUNDC2 genes, for which we observed lack of promoter-proximal Drosha binding (Figures S3B and S3C). This suggests the specificity of observed transcriptional effects, following Drosha depletion.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Drosha Depletion Causes Transcriptional Downregulation and Decreases Pre-mRNA and Poly(A)+ RNA Levels(A) Western blot analysis of protein extracts (50\u00a0\u03bcg) from mock-treated and Drosha siRNA-treated HeLa cells, probed with Drosha and GAPDH antibodies (i).

In (B), (D), and (E), the levels of RNA were normalized to 5S rRNA.To evaluate if Drosha has a direct effect on transcription, we employed nuclear run-on (NRO) using Br-UTP as the labeled nucleotide (Core and Lis, 2008, Lin et\u00a0al., 2008). The advantage of Br-UTP NRO over Pol II ChIP is the ability of Br-UTP NRO to detect actively transcribing polymerases, as opposed to total Pol II levels detected by ChIP. As demonstrated in Figure\u00a03C, we observed a substantial decrease in the level of nascent transcription for TAF7, PTB, and SELENBP1 genes in Drosha-knocked-down cells. As a negative control for this experiment, we used IL4 and TARM1 genes. These genes are not expressed in HeLa cells; hence, we did not observe any detectable transcription signal in Br-UTP NRO reactions. These results suggest that Drosha has a direct positive effect on transcription, consistent with the genome-wide expression data, where highly expressed genes correlated with increased Drosha binding on TSSs (Figure\u00a01A). Furthermore, the antisense transcripts detected over the promoter-proximal region of the \u03b2-actin gene were also decreased upon Drosha depletion (Figure\u00a0S4D). These results further indicate that Drosha is not involved in the cleavage\u00a0of nascent sense or antisense RNA transcripts, pointing toward a cleavage-independent function of Drosha in human gene expression.Drosha Regulates the Expression of a Heterologous ReporterWe next employed a \u03b2-actin/EGFP reporter plasmid, where transcription of EGFP is driven by the \u03b2-actin promoter, fused to\u00a0\u03b2-actin exon 1 and intron 1 regions (Qin and Gunning, 1997) (Figure\u00a03D). As described above, Drosha binds the promoter-proximal region of \u03b2-actin gene (Figure\u00a0S4C). Interestingly, in HeLa cells depleted for Drosha we observed \u223c75% reduction in expression of EGFP mRNA from the plasmid (Figure\u00a03D), recapitulating downregulation of endogenous \u03b2-actin mature and pre-mRNAs (Figure\u00a03B). These results suggest that Drosha plays a positive role in the regulation of \u03b2-actin/EGFP expression.Next, we cotransfected \u03b2-actin/EGFP reporter plasmid with RNAi-resistant Flag-tagged Drosha (WT), a catalytic mutant E110aQ (aQ), unable to process miRNAs, and \u0394390 construct into 293 cells, depleted for Drosha, using siRNA2 (Han et\u00a0al., 2004). The \u0394390 Drosha construct is active in miRNA processing but lacks the N-terminal proline-rich and RS-rich domains, proposed to be important for Drosha protein-protein interactions (Han et\u00a0al., 2004) (Figure\u00a03E). Both mRNAs and proteins corresponding to WT, aQ, and \u0394390 Drosha were expressed at a high level in 293T cells, depleted for endogenous Drosha (Figure\u00a03Ei and 3Eii). Overexpression of both WT and aQ catalytic Drosha mutant resulted in the increase of EGFP mRNA (Figure\u00a03Eiii). In contrast, overexpression of \u0394390 construct had no significant effect on the expression of EGFP mRNA. These results suggest that Drosha plays a positive role in the regulation of the \u03b2-actin promoter. Importantly, this Drosha function is independent of its ability to cleave RNA but does require the N-terminal protein-protein interaction domain.Drosha Regulates Human Gene Expression through Interaction with CBP80 and RNA Polymerase IIWe hypothesize that the cleavage-independent stimulatory role of Drosha on gene expression may be mediated through its association with protein cofactors. We therefore performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments and found that transiently overexpressed Flag-tagged Drosha interacts with both unphosphorylated (IIA) and phosphorylated (IIO) forms of Pol II in 293T cells, supporting its role in transcriptional regulation. Drosha also interacts with CBP80 and Ars2 proteins, involved in miRNA biogenesis and RNA processing pathways, respectively (Gruber et\u00a0al., 2009, Sabin et\u00a0al., 2009) (Figure\u00a04A). Furthermore, by ChIP analysis we found that CBP80 protein binds promoter-proximal regions of \u03b3-actin and GAPDH genes, colocalizing with Drosha binding (Figures 4B and 4C). We next observed that Drosha-CBP80 interaction is not affected by the aQ mutation in the catalytic domain of Drosha but is significantly reduced when the N-terminal domain of Drosha is deleted in \u0394390 construct or when both \u0394390 and aQ mutations are combined (Figure\u00a04D, top panel). These results strongly support the view that Drosha interacts with CBP80 through its N-terminal RS domain. We also studied the interaction of Drosha with Pol II (Figure 4D, middle). Similar to CBP80, a catalytic mutation in Drosha (aQ) does not affect its interaction with Pol II. However, the Drosha \u0394390 construct showed reduced interaction with Pol II, and specifically with its phosphorylated form (IIO). A similar effect was observed with \u0394390 aQ construct. This suggests that the N-terminal domain of Drosha is particularly important for Drosha-mediated transcriptional effects in human cells because it mediates interaction of Drosha with CBP80 and Pol II. We also observed that interaction of Drosha with CBP80 and Pol II is RNA independent (Figure\u00a04E). Consequently, this result provides a molecular explanation for the ability of Drosha to regulate gene expression in a miRNA- and cleavage-independent manner.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Drosha Regulates Human Gene Expression through Its Interaction with CBP80 and Pol II(A) Pull-down experiments performed with anti-Flag in 293 cells, overexpressed with Flag and Drosha WT-Flag constructs.

Western blot was probed with CBP80 (top panel) and Pol II (bottom panel) antibodies.(F) Model for the function of Drosha in the regulation of human gene expression. Following transcription of nascent RNA by Pol II, Drosha, most probably in a complex with DGCR8, binds GC-rich hairpins at the promoter-proximal regions of human genes. Drosha does not cleave such hairpins, but it interacts with Pol II and CBP80 through its N-terminal proline-rich domain. Drosha can enhance gene expression, independently of its RNA cleavage function. Depletion of Drosha results in decrease of nascent transcription and subsequent decrease in the amount of nascent and poly(A)+ mRNA. DiscussionWe demonstrate the existence of a miRNA- and cleavage-independent function of Drosha in the regulation of human gene expression. Combining whole-genome analysis with gene-specific approaches, we demonstrate that Drosha binds to the 5\u2032 ends of human genes in a transcription-dependent manner (Figure\u00a01). This binding is not associated with miRNA biogenesis or RNA cleavage but correlates with the level of gene expression (Figures\u00a01 and \u200band2).2). Depletion of Drosha from HeLa cells led to direct downregulation of transcription based on nuclear run-on and Pol II accumulation at the promoters of these genes, resulting in reduced levels of pre-mRNA and poly(A)+ mRNA (Figure\u00a03). This suggests a positive effect of Drosha on gene transcription. ChIP and HITS-CLIP analysis of DGCR8 also revealed binding sites at promoter-proximal regions, enriched at genes expressed at a higher level, suggesting that Drosha and DGCR8 may bind to promoter regions as a complex (Figures 2 and S7). A positive function of Drosha in the regulation of gene expression was further confirmed using a heterologous reporter construct, where Drosha overexpression influences reporter expression (Figure\u00a03). This function of Drosha is independent of its catalytic activity and mediated through its N-terminal domain, which interacts with the RNA-binding protein CBP80 and Pol II, which also bind to the 5\u2032 end of human genes (Figures 3 and \u200band4).4). Taken together, these results suggest a model whereby Drosha promotes gene expression in a cleavage-independent manner by binding to RNA hairpins formed at the 5\u2032 ends of the nascent RNAs and interacting with CBP80 and Pol II, through its N-terminal RS domain (Figure\u00a04F).Initially, we hypothesized that this positive function of Drosha may be associated with generation/regulation of short promoter-associated transcripts (PROMPTs), originally predicted to regulate transcription through changes in chromatin structure, promoter methylation, or Pol II recycling (Preker et\u00a0al., 2008). PROMPTs may direct Drosha to the beginning of the gene through interaction with its binding factors. In our studies, both sense and antisense transcripts, detected over the promoter-proximal regions, were destabilized in Drosha-depleted cells (Figure\u00a0S4D), suggesting that Drosha does not cleave these transcripts and its function is not mediated through PROMPTs.Drosha binding at the beginning of human genes may be also related to Pol II release from promoter-proximal pausing events and be required for the recruitment of transcription/RNA processing factors. Interestingly, Drosha binding coincides with the binding site of the negative elongation factor NELF, which defines the \u201clate\u201d elongation checkpoint, ensuring conversion to productive elongation mediated by phosphorylation of Pol II CTD, NELF, and DSIF by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009). As both nucleosome positioning and chromatin modifications play an important role in the elongation functions of P-TEFb, we also checked whether Drosha knockdown causes a change in chromatin modifications. However, we did not observe any significant changes (data not shown). This suggests that Drosha regulates gene expression through a different mechanism. GC-rich sequences are known to be enriched in the promoter regions of human genes (Calistri et\u00a0al., 2011). Transcripts for these sequences are likely to form RNA hairpin structures, predicted to be suitable for Microprocessor binding mediated by DGCR8 (Macias et\u00a0al., 2012; Table S1). If Drosha were to cleave such RNAs, the consequences of Drosha cleavage across the whole human genome would be detrimental to cellular survival. We hypothesize that Drosha does not cleave promoter-associated RNA but is instead utilized as a positive regulator of gene expression. We further analyzed the structures found in promoter transcripts and compared them to miRNA, snoRNAs, and protein-coding region structures, found to be bound by DGCR8 in CLIP analysis. Our bioinformatic analysis confirmed that structures in promoter regions have shorter stems, higher minimum free energy, and lower base-pairing probability (Figure\u00a0S8). In addition, promoter transcripts also lack motifs important for the processing of the stem, such as TG dinucleotide at the base of the stem and CNNC motif downstream of the stem, as described in Auyeung et\u00a0al. (2013). Taken together, this analysis suggests that promoter structures may be less stable, and their recognition and processing by the Microprocessor complex may be less efficient compared to miRNAs or other sequences cleaved by Drosha.Evidence that components of the miRNA machinery may have additional functions comes from several previous studies. In early-stage thymocytes, Drosha recognizes and cleaves mRNAs harboring secondary stem-loop structures (Chong et\u00a0al., 2010). Drosha can also regulate viral gene expression of Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) (Lin and Sullivan, 2011). DGCR8 together with Drosha controls the abundance of many cellular RNAs, including noncoding RNAs, mRNAs, and alternatively spliced isoforms (Macias et\u00a0al., 2012). Finally, Microprocessor can regulate transcription of some cellular mRNA and HIV provirus, causing Pol II premature termination through the cleavage of the TAR stem-loop structure (Wagschal et\u00a0al., 2012). These regulatory activities of Drosha each involve recognition and cleavage of target RNAs in an analogous manner to its function in miRNA biogenesis in contrast to the positive function of Drosha on transcription described here. Possibly this positive function of Drosha is related to the action of RNA-binding factors, known to modulate the function of Drosha in human cells. Such factors are likely to interact with the N-terminal proline-rich and RS domains, proposed to be the main sites of Drosha protein-protein interactions. We confirmed the previously described interaction between Drosha and CBP80 and Ars2 proteins (Gruber et\u00a0al., 2009, Sabin et\u00a0al., 2009). Furthermore, our results also show that Drosha interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II (Figure\u00a04). This interaction may be direct or mediated via proteins, containing RS domains and interacting with the CTD, potentially modulating Drosha\u2019s cleavage-independent function. Interestingly, in Drosophila the key RNAi components Dicer 2 and Argonaute 2 associate with chromatin and interact with the core transcription machinery, affecting Pol II dynamics (Cernilogar et\u00a0al., 2011), further supporting the role of RNAi machinery in transcriptional regulation. Because both Drosha and Dicer may have additional roles to miRNA biogenesis future studies will be necessary to evaluate the full spectrum of molecular functions that these RNase-III-like enzymes play in human cells. This will represent an exciting avenue for future research in gene expression. Experimental ProceduresPlasmidspCK-Flag WT, aQ, and \u0394390 Drosha constructs (Han et\u00a0al., 2004) and \u03b2-actin/EGFP plasmid (Qin and Gunning, 1997) were described previously. pflag-CMV-2 (Flag) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (E7398).RNA AnalysisTotal RNA was harvested using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase I treatment (Roche). Total RNA (2\u00a0\u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) or gene-specific primers, as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Table S3, followed by qPCR. Gene-specific primers were used in all figures, apart from Figure\u00a03Eiii, where random hexamers were used for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), following the manufacturer\u2019s description (Invitrogen).In\u00a0Vitro Processing AssaysMiR-17-19 and \u03b3-actin gene regions were amplified from genomic DNA using T7+\u03b2-actin (F/R) and T7+miR-17-19 (F/R) primers accordingly. In\u00a0vitro processing was performed as in Guil and C\u00e1ceres (2007).RNAi and Protein AnalysisThe RNAi was carried out as described (Wollerton et\u00a0al., 2004). mRNA target sequence for Drosha small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex was 5\u2032-CGAGUAGGCUUCGUGACUU-3\u2032 (siRNA1) and 5\u2032-GAGUAUUUACUUGCUCAG UAA-3\u2032 (siRNA2). siRNA1 was used in all figures apart from Figure\u00a03E, where siRNA2 was used. Pull-downs were carried out in RNase A nontreated extracts, except Figure\u00a04E where 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml RNase A was used to treat cell extracts during the pull-down procedure as described in Gruber et\u00a0al. (2009). The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by western blotting. Western blots were probed with Drosha (AbCam), actin (Sigma-Aldrich), GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich), Pol II (Covance), and CBP80 (Sigma) antibodies.ChIP and HITS-CLIP AnalysesChIP analysis was carried out as previously described (West et\u00a0al., 2004). Five micrograms of each antibody was used per ChIP. The immunoprecipitated DNAs were used as templates for qPCR. Drosha Chip-on-chip experiments were carried out as described in De Gobbi et\u00a0al. (2007) and in the Supplemental Information. HITS-CLIP for DGCR8 was based on a published protocol (Wang et\u00a0al., 2009) with minor modifications, as described in Macias et\u00a0al. (2012) and the Supplemental Information.Br-UTP Nuclear Run-on AnalysisThe Br-UTP NRO was carried out largely as described (Lin et\u00a0al., 2008, Skourti-Stathaki et\u00a0al., 2011) with some modifications. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in transcription buffer (40\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 300\u00a0mM KCl, 10\u00a0mM MgCl2, 40% glycerol, 2\u00a0mM DTT) and 10\u00a0mM mix of rATP, rCTP, rGTP, and Br-UTP or rUTP (in the control samples). The NRO reaction was performed at 30\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche). Two microliters of anti-BrU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was preincubated with 30\u00a0\u03bcl of Protein G Dynabeads (Upstate) and 10\u00a0\u03bcg tRNA per sample for 1\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed three times with RSB-100 buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.4% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 150\u00a0\u03bcl RSB-100 with 40\u00a0U RNase-OUT (Invitrogen) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg of glycogen. Total RNA was added to the beads and incubated for additional 1\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed three times with RSB-100 buffer. RNA bound to the beads was extracted with TRIzol reagent followed by DNase I treatment. The RT reaction was performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene GG-3000 machine. The PCR mixture contained QuantiTest SYBR green PCR master mix (Qiagen), 2\u00a0\u03bcl of template cDNA, and primers from Table S3. Cycling parameters were 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. Fluorescence intensities were plotted against the number of cycles by using an algorithm provided by the manufacturer. Amount of nascent Br-UTP RNA was calculated by subtracting the background of U-RNA produced over a specific gene probe.Statistical AnalysisUnless otherwise stated, results are shown as the average values from at least three independent biological experiments \u00b1SD.
