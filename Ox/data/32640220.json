One of the most studied pathways repairing this type of DNA damage in humans is the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. Individuals with an inactive FA pathway suffer from the FA disease, which is a rare, autosomal, recessive disorder with incidence estimated to be between 1/200,000 and 1/400,000 in the general population (Dong et\u00a0al., 2015). Although FA primarily presents as a bone marrow failure disease, it has been associated with several other clinical manifestations, such as immune deficiency (Fagerlie and Bagby, 2006), endocrine dysfunction, osteoporosis, and cancer (Giri et\u00a0al., 2007).The molecular basis for the phenotype in patients is mutation of any of the 22 FA genes associated with DNA crosslink repair, although it remains a subject of discussion as to whether all clinical manifestations of FA stem directly from impaired DNA damage repair or from other not fully investigated causes (Niraj et\u00a0al., 2019). Not all FA genes have been identified, and the mechanism of repair is not fully understood (Lopez-Martinez et\u00a0al., 2016).Controlled ubiquitination and deubiquitination of several interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair proteins is essential for the pathway. For instance, both the FANCD2 and the FANCI proteins are monoubiquitinated, an event essential to their repair functions. In addition, the presence of ubiquitin binding domains, such as the UBZ domain, plays an important function for ICL repair. For instance, SLX4 harbors such a domain, which is important for its repair function. The WRNIP1 protein both harbors a UBZ domain and is ubiquitinated (Bish et\u00a0al., 2008), but it has not yet been linked to ICL repair. The protein is 665 aa long and possesses an AAA+ ATPase domain. Its UBZ domain is capable of binding both monoubiquitin (Crosetto et\u00a0al., 2008) and polyubiquitin (Bish and Myers, 2007). Apart from being modified by ubiquitination, WRNIP1 is sumoylated (Bish and Myers, 2007), but the exact functions of these post-translational modifications remain elusive.The ATPase domain consists of Walker A and Walker B motifs that trap and hydrolyze ATP. This domain was shown to interact with WRN helicase (Kawabe et\u00a0al., 2006). Finally, the C terminus of the protein contains a predicted leucine zipper domain, which consists of two putative leucine zipper motifs between 519 and 655 aa.WRNIP1 was first identified by a yeast two-hybrid assay as a binding partner of the mouse WRN helicase (Kawabe et\u00a0al., 2001). In the same study, it was confirmed that this interaction is direct, which raised the question of whether WRNIP1 and WRN act in the same pathway. This hypothesis was later disproved (Kawabe et\u00a0al., 2006). WRNIP1 has also been reported to interact with three of the four subunits of DNA polymerase delta, presumably stimulating its activity (Tsurimoto et\u00a0al., 2005), as well as with polymerase eta (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2014). A physical interaction with the E3 ligase RAD18 has been shown (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2009), and WRNIP1 was found to interact with the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) cofactor ATMIN (Kanu et\u00a0al., 2016).The best characterized homolog of WRNIP1 in other eukaryotes is the yeast protein Mgs1 (maintenance of genome stability), which interacts physically and functionally with Pol31, a subunit of polymerase delta (Vijeh Motlagh et\u00a0al., 2006) and was reported to bind PCNA (Saugar et\u00a0al., 2012). Although genetic analyses of Mgs1 have shown that the protein is required for genome stability (Hishida et\u00a0al., 2001), the role of WRNIP1 remains elusive. WRNIP1 shares sequence similarity with the bacterial replication protein RarA (Lau et\u00a0al., 2003; Sherratt et\u00a0al., 2004). WRNIP1 also shares sequence similarity with the bacterial RuvB protein, which also exhibits ATPase activity, forms a hexameric ring complex, and is known to drive DNA strand migration at Holliday junction structures in complex with the RuvA protein (Yamada et\u00a0al., 2002). It was reported that WRNIP1 can form a homo-octameric complex under certain conditions (Tsurimoto et\u00a0al., 2005). These data were obtained using WRNIP1 expressed and purified from insect cells. So far, no functional involvement of WRNIP1 in Holliday junction migration in eukaryotes has been reported.It has been suggested that WRNIP1 accumulates at DNA damage sites in response to double-stranded breaks (Nomura et\u00a0al., 2012) and that UVC treatment causes an increase in the number of WRNIP1 nuclear foci (Crosetto et\u00a0al., 2008). Microscopy data showed that WRNIP1 foci tend to overlap with replication factories, which reinforces the hypothesis of a function at replication forks (Crosetto et\u00a0al., 2008). In\u00a0vitro analysis has shown that WRNIP1 binds to forked DNA that mimics stalled replication forks in an ATP-dependent manner (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2009), as well as DNA with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhang (Kanamori et\u00a0al., 2011). It has been reported that WRNIP1 plays a role in protecting stalled replication forks from degradation and promoting fork restart (Leuzzi et\u00a0al., 2016; Marabitti et\u00a0al., 2020; Porebski et\u00a0al., 2019). The first of these studies described a process entailing stabilization of RAD51 on ssDNA by WRNIP1, thereby preventing uncontrolled MRE11-mediated degradation of stalled replication forks. The study suggests that although the protection does not require the ATPase activity of WRNIP1, this activity is needed for the recovery of the stalled fork. The second study reported stabilization of the stalled replication fork by protection against MUS81- and EME1-mediated degradation. In addition, WRNIP1 was recently found enriched at chromosomal fragile sites, suggesting a role in maintaining their stability (Pladevall-Morera et\u00a0al., 2019).Here we report the identification of a new role of WRNIP1, functioning in the FA pathway to repair DNA ICLs. Using live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that WRNIP1 is specifically recruited to ICLs quickly after their appearance in the genome. Importantly, the UBZ domain of WRNIP1, as well as its own ubiquitination, is critical for this process. WRNIP1 physically interacts with the FANCD2/FANCI complex and promotes its recruitment to ICLs. ResultsPurification of a FANCD2 Complex Containing WRNIP1 as a SubunitTo identify putative novel ICL repair proteins, we purified FANCD2, together with associated proteins, as protein complexes from HeLa cells. Functional fusion protein of FANCD2 tagged by Flag and hemagglutinin (HA) (Flag-HA-FANCD2) (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016) was stably expressed in HeLa cells. Cells were treated with mitomycin C (MMC) to introduce ICLs into the genome, triggering an activation of the FA pathway and ICL repair. Nuclear extract was prepared and Flag-HA-FANCD2 was purified, together with associated proteins, by a modified version of a previously reported two-step immunoaffinity purification scheme (Cohn et\u00a0al., 2007). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified complexes revealed the presence of multiple polypeptides (Figure\u00a01A, lane 2). No polypeptides were observed in a mock purification from HeLa cells not expressing Flag-HA-FANCD2 (Figure\u00a01A, lane 1), indicating that the polypeptides copurified with Flag-HA-FANCD2 were bona fide subunits of FANCD2 complexes. To identify the subunits of the purified FANCD2 complex, we repeated the purification on a larger scale, now 6\u00a0L of suspension HeLa culture, and concentrated the purified protein complexes by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation. Precipitated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. As expected, several DNA repair proteins that have been shown to either physically or functionally interact with FANCD2 and the FA pathway and ICL repair were identified. Examples of these are FANCI, FANCA, UHRF1, and BRCA1 (Figure\u00a01B; see Table S1 for a complete list of proteins). Homologous recombination (HR) is an integral part of ICL repair via the FA pathway. Several HR factors, such as MRE11, RAD50, and BLM, were identified as subunits. We also identified several DNA replication factors, such as MCM2-7 and TOP2A, in accordance with previous reports (Lossaint et\u00a0al., 2013). In addition to these expected subunits, several proteins that have not been connected to ICL repair were found. One such protein, WRNIP1, was identified by 21 peptides (Figure\u00a01C) and can be observed on silver stain of the protein complex (Figure\u00a01A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Purification of the FANCD2 Protein Complex Containing WRNIP1(A) The FANCD2 complex was purified from HeLa cells. Proteins were resolved via SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized using silver stain.(B) Three groups of proteins identified in the purified complexes.

To test this, we purified both proteins to homogeneity (Figure\u00a01D) and assessed their abilities to interact with each other in\u00a0vitro. WRNIP1 formed a direct protein-protein interaction with FANCD2, whereas no interaction was observed between MBP and FANCD2, underscoring the specificity of the interaction (Figure\u00a01E). Because the FANCD2/FANCI complex undergoes a conformational change upon monoubiquitination, it is plausible that the interaction with WRNIP1 could be altered as a result. Therefore, we assessed the interaction of WRNIP1 with the FANCD2/FANCI complex and the ubiquitin-FANCD2/FANCI (Ub-FANCD2/FANCI) complex. We found that WRNIP1 interacted with both complexes (Figure\u00a0S1A). However, it cannot be excluded that the interaction of WRNIP1 and the FANCD2/FANCI complex is regulated upon DNA damage in live cells, in particular when the proteins are docked on DNA. Further experimentation might shed light on this.WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 Cells Are Sensitive to ICL-Inducing AgentsGiven the presence of WRNIP1 in the FANCD2 complex and that the two proteins interact directly, we decided to determine whether WRNIP1 is functionally important for the cellular response to ICLs. To test this directly, we disrupted the WRNIP1 gene in HeLa Flp-in T-Rex cells using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The resulting cell line was deficient for WRNIP1 (Figure\u00a02A). We then subjected these cells to a clonogenic survival assay, assessing their ability to survive after the introduction of increasing amounts of ICLs formed by trioxsalen (TMP)/UVA treatment. We found that depletion of WRNIP1 sensitized cells to ICLs when compared with control cells (Figure\u00a02B). In addition, we generated a second independent cell line with the WRNIP1 gene disrupted and observed identical results (Figure\u00a0S1B). To ensure that the observed phenotype results from ICLs formed by TMP/UVA and is not an effect of UVA alone, we assessed the sensitivity of the cells after treatment with increasing doses of UVA in the absence of TMP. No significant reduction in viability was observed, confirming our conclusion that WRNIP1 contributes to the repair of ICLs formed by TMP/UVA (Figure\u00a02C).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02WRNIP1 Is Important for ICL Repair(A) CRISPR-Cas9 technique was used to disrupt the WRNIP1 gene in HeLa cells, creating a WRNIP1-deficient HeLa cell line.

We therefore subjected HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells, a third independent clone, to a clonogenic survival assay in which we introduced ICLs caused by MMC. These experiments demonstrated that WRNIP1 is also required for the cellular response to this type of ICL (Figure\u00a02D). These data were confirmed using an independently obtained clone, showing similar results (Figure\u00a0S1C). Importantly, expressing WRNIP1-EGFP in the deficient cells (Figure\u00a02A) restored the resistance to ICLs to the level observed in control cells, ruling out off-target and clonal effects (Figure\u00a02D).We also observed sensitivity of WRNIP1-deficient cells to cisplatin, which forms yet another type of ICL (Figure\u00a02E). UVC and hydroxyurea treatments, which do not introduce ICLs, did not affect survival of the WRNIP1-deficient cell line (Figures S1D and S1E).Altogether, our data show that WRNIP1 is necessary for the cellular response to a range of ICLs.WRNIP1 Cooperates with FANCD2 in ICL RepairOur data show that the WRNIP1 protein is functionally important for ICL repair. The FANCD2 protein is central to the FA pathway repairing ICLs in human cells. Therefore, we sought to determine whether depleting WRNIP1 further sensitizes HeLa cells deficient in FANCD2. We created HeLa cell lines depleted of FANCD2, WRNIP1, or both using CRISPR-Cas9 (Figure\u00a03A). The resulting cell lines were subjected to a clonogenic survival assay in which we introduced an increasing number of ICLs using TMP/UVA. As expected, depletion of FANCD2 sensitized cells significantly (Figure\u00a03B). When we depleted WRNIP1 in these FANCD2-deficient cells, we observed no further sensitization. Similar results were seen when ICLs were introduced using MMC (Figure\u00a03C). To rule out clonal effects, we repeated the experiment using a second independent cell clone (Figure\u00a0S2A) and obtained identical results (Figure\u00a0S2B). These data suggest that the two proteins interact functionally and place the WRNIP1 protein in the FA ICL repair pathway.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03WRNIP1 Is Recruited to ICLs(A) CRISPR-Cas9 technique was used to disrupt the WRNIP1 and FANCD2 genes in HeLa cells, creating HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 (clone 1), HeLa FANCD2\u2212/\u2212, and HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 FANCD2\u2212/\u2212 (clone 1) cell lines.

To test this directly, we applied live-cell microscopy. We expressed EGFP-tagged WRNIP1 in HeLa Flp-in T-Rex cells, ensuring that the fusion protein is expressed at the same level as endogenous WRNIP1 (Figure\u00a0S3A). The cells were then treated with TMP and ICLs were introduced in a local area of the nucleus using a UVA laser while the cells were observed using a microscope. We observed strong recruitment of WRNIP1-EGFP to ICLs within minutes of their introduction into the chromosomes (Figure\u00a03D).To gain insight into how WRNIP1 functions in ICL repair, we decided to determine the kinetics of WRNIP1 recruitment to ICLs relative to the well-characterized kinetics of FANCD2 recruitment and to test whether recruitment of one protein affects recruitment of the other. Whereas WRNIP1 was recruited relatively quickly (Figure\u00a03D), the kinetics of the FANCD2 recruitment appeared to be slower (Figure\u00a03E). The difference in timing of recruitment suggested that WRNIP1 might be recruited to ICLs before FANCD2. If WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs before FANCD2, recruitment of WRNIP1 may affect the subsequent recruitment of FANCD2. Such a functional relationship would be in good agreement with the data showing that depletion of WRNIP1 in cells from which FANCD2 is depleted does not further sensitize cells to ICLs (Figures 3B and 3C). To test this hypothesis directly, we depleted WRNIP1 in cells stably expressing EGFP-FANCD2 and mCherry-UHRF1, as a marker of ICLs (Figure\u00a0S3B), and assessed the recruitment of FANCD2 to ICLs compared with control cells. Depletion of WRNIP1 caused a clear reduction in FANCD2 recruitment, whereas the recruitment of UHRF1 as a control for the generation of ICLs was unaffected (Figures 3E and 3F). To test whether WRNIP1 also assists FANCD2 recruitment in response to other types of ICLs, we determined its effect on FANCD2 foci formation in response to MMC using live-cell imaging. We observed that depletion of WRNIP1 suppresses the accumulation of FANCD2 nuclear foci over time (Figures S3C and S3D).FANCD2 functions as a heterodimer with the FANCI protein in ICL repair. Therefore, we tested whether WRNIP1 is required for the recruitment of EGFP-FANCI (Figure\u00a0S3B) to ICLs. As observed for FANCD2, the recruitment of FANCI is reduced when WRNIP1 is depleted (Figures S3E and S3F).Because the recruitment of both FANCD2 and FANCI was reduced upon depletion of WRNIP1 in relatively short timescales using live-cell imaging, we decided to test whether cells would be able to support full FANCD2 recruitment over longer periods in the absence of WRNIP1. Therefore, we monitored EGFP-FANCD2 recruitment over 6 h. Even during such long periods, we observed a reduction in FANCD2 recruitment (Figures S4A and S4B). These data are in good agreement with other longer-timescale experiments, clonogenic survival assays, demonstrating that depletion of WRNIP1 sensitized cells to ICLs (Figures 3B and 3C).To test whether FANCD2 affects the recruitment of WRNIP1, we depleted FANCD2 in cells expressing WRNIP1-EGFP (Figure\u00a0S3A) and assessed whether the recruitment of WRNIP1 was affected. We observed no change in the recruitment of WRNIP1 in the absence of FANCD2 (Figure\u00a0S4C).Altogether, these data show that WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs and that this recruitment facilitates the recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex, potentially via a direct protein-protein interaction between the two proteins.Ubiquitination of WRNIP1 Is Required for Its Recruitment to ICLsWe noticed that WRNIP1 migrates as two species in SDS-PAGE: a major fast-migrating form and a less abundant slower-migrating form (for instance, Figures 1D and \u200band2A).2A). We hypothesized that the slow-migrating form of WRNIP1 could be a result of ubiquitination, supported by an earlier report on WRNIP1 (Bish et\u00a0al., 2008). We examined both species by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies against WRNIP1, 6xHis, and ubiquitin. Although both species were detected using the first two antibodies, only the upper species was detected by the anti-ubiquitin antibody, indicating that WRNIP1 indeed is ubiquitinated (Figure\u00a04A). The anti-ubiquitin antibody also detected less abundant species with a higher molecular weight. Because these species could not be detected using the antibodies against WRNIP1 or 6xHis, they are likely low in abundance compared with the faster-migrating species of WRNIP1.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Ubiquitination of WRNIP1 Is Required for Recruitment to ICLs(A) His-tagged WRNIP1 was purified from Sf9 insect cells and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using the antibodies indicated.(B) Coomassie blue staining of Flag-HA-WRNIP1 purified together with associated proteins from HeLa S3 cells.(C) Magnified view of part of (B), showing the area of the gel that was excised for mass spectrometry analysis.(D) Schematic showing locations of amino acids in WRNIP1 that were found to be modified by ubiquitin.(E) Schematic showing locations of lysines in WRNIP1 that were mutated into arginines in WRNIP1-19R.(F) Live-cell imaging of HeLa-WRNIP1-EGFP and HeLa-WRNIP1-19R-EGFP cells.

Data represent 2 independent experiments (n\u00a0= 2), and 10 cells were quantified for each chart (mean \u00b1 SEM). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm.Ubiquitination often plays key regulatory roles in DNA repair. Therefore, we decided to investigate the nature of WRNIP1 ubiquitination. To determine which lysine or lysines in WRNIP1 were modified by ubiquitin, we stably expressed and purified Flag-HA-WRNIP1 from HeLa S3 cells. Flag-HA-WRNIP1 was purified as the two described characteristic species, along with several interacting proteins (Figure\u00a04B).We excised the modified form of WRNIP1 from the gel (Figure\u00a04C) and identified lysines modified by ubiquitin using mass spectrometry, detecting the characteristic residual Gly-Gly signature peptide following trypsinization. Surprisingly, not one but several ubiquitinated lysines were identified in this analysis (Figures 4D and S5A; Table S2). Because the difference in molecular weight between the upper and the lower forms of WRNIP1 is not large enough for all identified lysines to be monoubiquitinated simultaneously, the data indicate that the upper form of WRNIP1 is heterogenous. Most likely, this upper form consists of WRNIP1 molecules that are mono- or multiubiquitinated at various lysine residues.To determine whether ubiquitination of individual lysines in WRNIP1 is important for its ICL repair function, we selected the lysines that were most frequently ubiquitinated in our dataset, as well as in previous data (Bish et\u00a0al., 2008). The selected lysines were mutated into arginines in WRNIP1-EGFP one at a time. The resulting derivatives of WRNIP1-EGFP were then expressed in HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells, ensuring protein levels comparable to endogenous WRNIP1 in HeLa cells (Figures S5B and S5C). We then tested whether the point mutations affected the ability of WRNIP1-EGFP to be recruited to ICLs using live-cell imaging. All mutant versions of WRNIP1 were recruited normally to ICLs (Figure\u00a0S5D).These data suggest that ubiquitination of individual lysines is not required for the recruitment of WRNIP1 to ICLs. It is possible that there is some redundancy in ubiquitination of residues or that ubiquitination is not strictly required for WRNIP1 recruitment. To test these hypotheses directly, we mutated into arginines the 17 most frequently ubiquitinated lysines, as determined in either the present study or a previous study (Bish et\u00a0al., 2008), together with two additional lysines positioned next to two of the 17 lysines, resulting in the WRNIP1-19R derivative (Figure\u00a04E). WRNIP1-EGFP or WRNIP1-19R-EGFP were stably expressed in HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure\u00a0S5E). Using these cell lines, we then assessed the recruitment of WRNIP1 and WRNIP1-19R to ICLs. Although WRNIP1 was recruited rapidly and strongly to ICLs, the WRNIP1-19R protein was defective in recruitment (Figure\u00a04F). We noticed some diffusion of the recruited WRNIP1 at later time points in some cells, causing quantification of the initially narrow irradiated area to drop mildly over time. A marker for ICLs, mCherry-UHRF1, was recruited strongly and equally in both cell lines.Altogether, these data show that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 is required for its active recruitment to ICLs in live cells.Ubiquitination of WRNIP1 Is Required for ICL RepairBecause recruitment of WRNIP1 promotes the recruitment of FANCD2, and ubiquitination of WRNIP1 is required for its timely recruitment to ICLs, one would expect that this ubiquitination would be necessary to promote the recruitment of FANCD2 to ICLs. To test this directly, we established HeLa cell lines from which WRNIP1 was depleted by CRISPR-Cas9, followed by stable expression of mCherry-FANCD2, and either WRNIP1-EGFP or WRNIP1-19R-EGFP (Figure\u00a0S5F). The amount of residual WRNIP1 ubiquitination varied slightly depending on the experimental conditions (Figures S5E and S5F). We then assessed the ability of these proteins to be recruited to ICLs. As expected, WRNIP1-EGFP was recruited rapidly and efficiently, whereas WRNIP1-19R-EGFP was essentially defective (Figure\u00a05A). Although cells expressing WRNIP1-EGFP displayed robust recruitment of FANCD2 to ICLs, only weak recruitment was observed in cells expressing WRNIP1-19R-EGFP (Figures 5A and 5B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Ubiquitination of WRNIP1 Is Required for ICL Repair(A) Live-cell imaging of HeLa-WRNIP1-EGFP, mCherry-FANCD2 cells and of HeLa-WRNIP1-19R-EGFP, mCherry-FANCD2 cells.

To test this, we decided to determine the ability of WRNIP1-19R to functionally complement HeLa cells from which endogenous WRNIP1 is depleted. HeLa-WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells were stably complemented with either WRNIP1-EGFP or WRNIP1-19R-EGFP (Figure\u00a0S5E). The resulting cell lines were then treated with increasing amounts of MMC, and their ability to survive was assessed using a clonogenic survival assay. Stable expression of WRNIP1-EGFP restored resistance to MMC, whereas stable expression of WRNIP1-19R-EGFP did not, suggesting that this ubiquitination of WRNIP1 is critical forICL repair (Figure\u00a05C). We also noticed a slight increase in ubiquitination of WRNIP1 following the introduction of ICLs (Figure\u00a0S5G), whereas the overall amount of ubiquitinated FANCD2 did not alter upon abrogation of WRNIP1.Altogether, these data show that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 is required for its active recruitment to ICLs in live cells and that this facilitates local recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex and promotes ICL repair.The UBZ Domain of WRNIP1 Is Crucial for Its Ubiquitination and Recruitment to ChromatinWRNIP1 harbors a UBZ domain at its N-terminus. UBZ domains interact with ubiquitin, either in its free form or when conjugated to other proteins. As such, these domains often mediate the regulatory functions of the proteins in which they reside. Several DNA repair proteins possess such domains, including multiple proteins in ICL repair, such as FAAP20, FAN1, and SLX4. Therefore, we speculated that the UBZ domain of WRNIP1 could be important for its ICL repair function. The crystal structure of the UBZ domain of WRNIP1 interacting with ubiquitin has been solved (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2016). Careful examination of the interphase between the two proteins revealed critical hydrogen bonds between N33 of the UBZ domain and L71 and R42 of ubiquitin, as well as an important salt bridge between D37 of the UBZ domain and R42 of ubiquitin (Figure\u00a06A). A potential weaker interaction between A45 of the UBZ domain and K48 of ubiquitin was also observed. Alignment of the UBZ domain from WRNIP1 with the UBZ domains of other DNA repair proteins revealed that the N33 and D37 residues are well conserved, whereas A45 is not (Figure\u00a06B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06The UBZ Domain of WRNIP1 Is Necessary for Its Recruitment to ICLs(A) Three potential polar interactions between WRNIP1\u2019s UBZ domain and ubiquitin are indicated with dashed lines (GFP-WRNIP1\u00a0UBZ/ubiquitin, PDB: 3VHT).(B) Alignment of UBZ domains from WRNIP1, RAD18, polymerase kappa, and polymerase eta.

The presented data represents 2 independent experiments with 3 technical repeats each (mean \u00b1 SEM, n\u00a0= 2).We speculated that the interaction between ubiquitin and WRNIP1\u2019s UBZ domain could be important for the ICL repair function of WRNIP1. To investigate this possibility, we decided to create specific point mutations in WRNIP1 to disrupt the interaction. Mutating the zinc-coordinating amino acids (C20, C23, H35, or C39) would abrogate the interaction; however, such mutations could cause larger conformational changes in WRNIP1. Therefore, we instead chose to mutate N33 and D37, individually, to alanines. As expected, mutating these residues has been shown to disrupt the interaction between WRNIP1\u2019s UBZ domain and ubiquitin (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2016). WRNIP1-EGFP, WRNIP1-N33A-EGFP, and WRNIP1-D37A-EGFP were expressed in HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells at levels similar to that of endogenous WRNIP1 (Figure\u00a0S6A). We then assessed the ability of the two UBZ mutant proteins to be recruited to ICLs using live-cell imaging. Although WRNIP1-EGFP was strongly recruited to ICLs within minutes of their appearance, both UBZ point mutant proteins were defective in recruitment to ICLs (Figure\u00a0S6B).Because the UBZ domain of WRNIP1 is critical for its recruitment to ICLs, we speculated that this domain might consequently be required for WRNIP1 to facilitate loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex onto DNA. We stably expressed WRNIP1-EGFP or WRNIP1-D37A-EGFP, together with mCherry-FANCD2 in HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells (Figure\u00a0S6C), and assessed how the various proteins were recruited to ICLs. As expected, WRNIP1-EGFP was recruited robustly and supported strong recruitment of mCherry-FANCD2 (Figures 6C and 6D). Meanwhile, WRNIP1-D37A-EGFP was barely recruited, resulting in poor recruitment of mCherry-FANCD2 (Figures 6C and 6D).Given the critical role of the UBZ domain for the recruitment of WRNIP1 to ICLs, we hypothesized that this domain consequently might play an important functional role for WRNIP1 in ICL repair. To test this directly, we evaluated the ability of the WRNIP1-N33A-EGFP and WRNIP1-D37A-EGFP proteins to functionally complement HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells. The two proteins were expressed stably at endogenous levels in HeLa WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 cells, and the ability of the resulting cell lines to survive upon introduction of an increasing amount of ICLs was assessed. Although WRNIP1-EGFP fully restored resistance to ICLs, both WRNIP1-N33A-EGFP and WRNIP1-D37A-EGFP were defective (Figure\u00a06E).These experiments show that two events are critical for the ICL repair function of WRNIP1. First, its ubiquitination is essential, and second, the activity of its UBZ domain is required for repair. However, if the activity of the UBZ domain were affected in the WRNIP1-19R mutant, interpretation of these data would be different. Although none of the point mutations are within the UBZ domain (Figure 4E), it is important to ensure that the full-length protein maintains full ubiquitin binding activity like wild-type WRNIP1. Therefore, we expressed and purified the WRNIP1 and WRNIP1-19R proteins from Sf9 cells (Figure\u00a0S7) and assessed their abilities to interact with recombinant ubiquitin. Both proteins interacted equally well with ubiquitin, demonstrating that the UBZ domain was not affected by the point mutations in WRNIP1-19R (Figure\u00a0S6D).Altogether, mechanistically, both ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and activity of its UBZ domain are required for the ICL repair function of WRNIP1 in human cells. DiscussionRepair of ICLs entails a series of key events, most of which require specific and timely recruitment of DNA repair factors to the site of damage. In this work, we have biochemically purified and identified several novel ICL repair factors that are recruited to damaged DNA. The function of one of these factors, WRNIP1, is presented.WRNIP1 Is Recruited to ICLs in Live CellsWe found that WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs within minutes of their appearance in the genome. Such kinetic of recruitment is relatively quick compared with other DNA repair proteins, indicating an early role in the repair pathway. For instance, the well-characterized FANCD2 protein is detected later in similar experimental settings (Lopez-Martinez et\u00a0al., 2019), suggesting that WRNIP1 might act before FANCD2. We found that depletion of cellular WRNIP1 leads to a reduction in recruitment of FANCD2 and of its heterodimerization partner, FANCI. Residual recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex was observed upon depletion of WRNIP1, suggesting the presence of alternative mechanisms to support recruitment in the absence of WRNIP1. Perhaps the ICL sensor proteins UHRF1 and UHRF2 provide this activity (Liang et\u00a0al., 2015; Motnenko et\u00a0al., 2018; Tian et\u00a0al., 2015).Our cell-based assays suggested an interaction between WRNIP1 and the FANCD2/FANCI complex, and using highly purified recombinant proteins, we demonstrated a direct protein-protein interaction with the FANCD2/FANCI complex, as well as monoubiquitinated FANCD2 in complex with FANCI, or Ub-FANCD2/FANCI. Recent work has demonstrated how monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI complex leads to a substantial conformational change, creating a more stable ring-like structure by which the complex surrounds the DNA (Alc\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2020; Rennie et\u00a0al., 2020; Tan et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020). An important part of the conformational change entails rearrangement of the C-terminal Tower domain of FANCD2, which previously was found to be critical for the activity of the FANCD2/FANCI complex via its interaction with DNA (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016). This interaction with DNA is necessary for the complex to become monoubiquitinated and thereby activated (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016; Sato et\u00a0al., 2012). However, for the complex to interact with DNA, it first needs to be recruited to DNA, and we found that WRNIP1 triggered this initial step of the pathway.Altogether, WRNIP1 is an early responder to ICLs that, when recruited, facilitates the subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex, likely via a direct protein-protein interaction (Figure\u00a07).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07Model Showing How WRNIP1 Functions in ICL Repair(1) WRNIP1 is recruited to an ICL in the chromatin, potentially assisted by a hypothetical protein that is ubiquitinated. (2) The FANCD2/FANCI complex is recruited, causing a conformational change upon interaction with DNA. (3) The FANCD2/FANCI complex is monoubiquitinated, causing another conformational change that leads to its ring-like structure encircling the DNA helix. (4) Additional ICL repair factors are recruited. (5) The ICL is repaired.WRNIP1 Is Required for Active ICL RepairBecause WRNIP1 facilitates the recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex to ICLs, one would expect cells deficient in WRNIP1 to be sensitive to agents causing ICLs. We found WRNIP1\u2212/\u2212 knockout cells to be sensitive to three types of ICLs, namely, those caused by MMC, cisplatin, and TMP/UVA. In addition, cells already deficient in FANCD2 were not further sensitized by WRNIP1 depletion, reinforcing a functional relationship between WRNIP1 and FANCD2 in ICL repair.The UBZ Domain and Ubiquitination of WRNIP1 Are Required for the ICL Repair FunctionWRNIP1 harbors a UBZ domain, which we found to be strictly required for the ICL repair function of WRNIP1. Unconventional amino acid interactions between the UBZ domain and ubiquitin (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2016) ensure functional binding, and it is known that this domain can interact with free ubiquitin, as well as with K48 and K63 chains (Crosetto et\u00a0al., 2008). It will be interesting to determine which ubiquitinated protein or proteins WRNIP1 interacts with during ICL repair (Figure\u00a07). WRNIP1 was previously shown to interact with monoubiquitinated PCNA in yeast (Hishida et al., 2006) and humans (Saugar et\u00a0al., 2012), an interaction that was later reported to involve ATMIN to augment ATR signaling in response to replication stress (Kanu et\u00a0al., 2016). WRNIP1 was previously shown to bind DNA directly (Kim et\u00a0al., 2005; Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2009), an activity that could contribute to its recruitment to chromatin.We also found that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 is required for its ICL repair activity, similar to that of FANCD2 and FANCI. WRNIP1 is reported to functionally interact with RAD18 in chicken cells (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2006), as well as in human cells (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2009). Furthermore, RAD18 is known to be ubiquitinated; thus, WRNIP1 may form contacts to ubiquitinated RAD18 via its UBZ domain. It is also possible that RAD6/RAD18 directly contributes to the ubiquitination of WRNIP1, thereby facilitating repair. It will be important to determine which ubiquitin E3 ligase or ligases act on WRNIP1.In addition to its role in translesion synthesis, RAD18 was shown to play an active role in HR (Huang et\u00a0al., 2009). Likewise, WRNIP1 was shown to stabilize RAD51 filaments in response to replication stress, thereby preventing unsolicited resection by MRE11 (Leuzzi et\u00a0al., 2016). Perhaps this mechanism of resection control involves recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex. We found MRE11 to be a subunit of the purified FANCD2 complex. It is possible that WRNIP1 contributes to stabilization of stalled replication forks as part of the ICL repair by recruiting and stabilizing the FANCD2/FANCI complex at the site of damage.WRNIP1 Is Important for Several Types of DNA TransactionsDNA synthesis is an important element of ICL repair. WRNIP1 was shown to interact with DNA polymerase delta in yeast (Branzei et\u00a0al., 2002) and humans (Tsurimoto et\u00a0al., 2005). We identified three of the four DNA polymerase delta subunits (POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3) as subunits of the purified FANCD2 complex. WRNIP1 was found to stimulate the DNA polymerase activity of polymerase delta in\u00a0vitro by increasing its initiation activity (Tsurimoto et\u00a0al., 2005). WRNIP1 was also shown to stimulate the FEN1 endonuclease in yeast, thereby positively affecting Okazaki fragment processing (Kim et\u00a0al., 2005) and agreeing with related findings in humans (Ward et\u00a0al., 2017). We identified both FEN1 and PRIM2 in our FANCD2 complex. PRIM2 primase is the enzyme synthesizing small RNA primers for Okazaki fragments. Furthermore, WRNIP1 was recently shown to be functionally linked to Primpol via a direct interaction (Yoshimura et\u00a0al., 2019). Altogether, it is possible that WRNIP1 directly or indirectly promotes DNA synthesis as part of the ICL repair reaction. WRNIP1 shares sequence similarity with the bacterial RuvB motor protein, which drives branch migration during Holiday junction resolution as a part of HR (Yamada et\u00a0al., 2002). Future studies will reveal whether WRNIP1 also possesses such activities during ICL repair.ConclusionsWe report the identification of WRNIP1 as a new ICL repair factor operating within the FA DNA repair pathway. WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs quickly after their appearance in the genome in a process requiring both ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and activity of its intrinsic UBZ domain. Mechanistically, recruitment of WRNIP1 facilitates subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex, in turn initiating DNA repair. Importantly, this work also reports the identification of several additional new ICL repair factors. A few of these are discussed in the paper; however, most of these factors are presented as a list of subunits identified in the purified complex. We hope that reporting this full list of subunits will provide a rich source for other investigators to study DNA repair in humans and likely other species.

PBS was aspirated, the tube spun down again and the remains of the supernatant was aspirated. The volume of the pellet was estimated and an equal volume of benzonase buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) with Benzonase (12.5 units/ml) was added. The sample was vortexed then put on ice for 10\u00a0min. Thereafter an equal volume of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (twice the volume of the pellet) was added and the sample was vortexed and incubated at 70\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min. The amount of protein in each lysate sample was measured and samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared with the concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl. Antibodies were used as follows, anti-WRNIP1 (WHIP A8, sc-376438, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:3,000 or 1:10,000 dilution depending on the experiment; anti-FANCD2 (sc-20022, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:100 dilution; anti-Flag (M5, F4042, Sigma-Aldrich), 1:1,000 dilution, anti-HA (12CA5, 11583816001, Roche) 1:1,000 dilution; anti-Ubiquitin (FK2, ST1200, Merck-Millipore), 1:400 dilution; anti-\u03b1-Tubulin (5829, Millipore), 1:2,000 dilution; and anti-poly-Histidine (H1029, Sigma-Aldrich) 1:1,000 dilution.ICL induction with TMP Cells were incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml TMP for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and then irradiated with 50 mJ/cm2 UVA (365\u00a0nm) in a Spectrolinker XL-1500.Clonogenic survival assay Cells (250\u20134,000) were plated in six-well plates and treated as indicated on the next day. Colony formation was scored after 10\u201314\u00a0days using 1% (w/v) crystal violet in methanol.Protein purification Purification of FANCD2-containing complexes. HeLa S3 cells stably expressing Flag-HA-FANCD2 were cultured in Joklik\u2019s medium in suspension supplemented with non-essential amino acids, L-glutamine and Penicillin-Streptomycin, and treated with 160\u00a0ng/ml mitomycin C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS, and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min. The cell pellet was then resuspended with hypotonic buffer (10\u00a0mM KCl, 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 2\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF and 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2), and incubated on ice for 10\u00a0min. Cells were ruptured using a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 3,900\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to separate the cytoplasmic fraction and nuclei. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 0.5 pellet volume of low salt nuclear extraction buffer (50\u00a0mM KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 2\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF and 25% glycerol) supplemented with 75 units/ml Benzonase (Merck Millipore, 70664), and incubated on ice for 30\u00a0min. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3\u00a0min followed by quenching using glycine. The sample was centrifuged at 4,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min, and washed with cold PBS three times. The nuclei pellet was resuspended with an equal pellet volume of high salt\u00a0nuclear\u00a0extraction buffer (1\u00a0M KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Tween-20, 0.15% SDS, 2\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF and 25% glycerol), and sonicated with 4\u00a0W and 1\u00a0s on/off interval for 10\u00a0min on ice. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30\u00a0min, and drop-wise diluted 5-fold to 0.03% SDS, 1% Tween-20 and 0.3M NaCl. The sample was centrifuged at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was collected as nuclear extract. Equilibrated M2 anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) was added to the nuclear extract, and incubated in the cold room for 2\u00a0h with constant rotation. The M2 anti-FLAG agarose was washed with a buffer containing 100\u00a0mM KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 2\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF and 10% glycerol, and eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 0.5\u00a0mg/ml FLAG peptide. Equilibrated anti-HA Sepharose was added to the FLAG eluate, and incubated in the cold room for 2\u00a0h with constant rotation. The anti-HA Sepharose was washed with buffer containing 100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 100\u00a0mM KCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 2\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF and 10% glycerol, and eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5\u00a0mg/ml HA peptide. The purified FANCD2-containing complexes were precipitated with 10% TCA. The precipitated pellet was washed with 100% acetone and air-dried before SDS-PAGE/Silver stain or MS/MS analysis.Purification of Flag-HA-WRNIP1 from HeLa S3 cells for MS/MS analysis. HeLa S3 cells stably expressing Flag-HA-WRNIP1 were split into three 15\u00a0cm dishes with approximately 70% confluency. All three dishes were left in 37\u00b0C incubator overnight. The next day the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4,000\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min. The pellet was resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of Buffer A (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH\u00a08.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50\u00a0unit/ml Benzonase, 2\u00a0mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and left on ice for 10\u00a0min. 2.5\u00a0mL (10x pellet volume) of Buffer B (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200\u00a0mM KCl, 2\u00a0mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF) was mixed into the sample, and the falcon tube was incubated on ice for 10\u00a0min. The solution was spun down at 18,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and spun again (18,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C), before it was collected. 100\u00a0\u03bcL of M2 beads (\u03b1-FLAG) 50% slurry (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the falcon tube was incubated for 2\u00a0h under gentle rotation (4\u00b0C). The lysate/beads slurry was transferred to an empty chromatography column (10\u00a0mL volume, equilibrated with 1\u00a0mL of Buffer B beforehand) and washed with 5\u00a0mL of Buffer B. The column was closed, and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of elution buffer was added (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl Flag peptide in buffer B). The lysate/beads slurry was incubated with Flag peptide in the cold room for 1.5\u00a0h (mixed every 15\u00a0min). The eluate was collected and the elution step was repeated (the same volume of the Flag peptide solution was added, and incubated for 1.5 h), the eluate from the second elution was consolidated with the eluate from the first elution. The samples were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie blue staining or immunoblot analysis (\u03b1-WRNIP1, \u03b1-HA and \u03b1-Ubiquitin (FK2)). Flag-HA-WRNIP1 analyzed by MS/MS was first precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (75\u00a0\u03bcL Flag eluate plus 75\u00a0\u03bcL 20% TCA). The sample was incubated on ice for 4 h, and then centrifuged (13,000\u00a0rpm, 30\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C). Supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 800\u00a0\u03bcL ice cold acetone. The sample was centrifuged again (13,000\u00a0rpm, 30\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) and the pellet was dried in air for 10\u00a0min and resuspended in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of LDS loading buffer. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9%) followed by Coomassie blue staining. The upper form of WRNIP1 was carefully cut out of the gel using a scalpel and provided to the Dunn School of Pathology Proteomics Facility for MS/MS analysis.Mass Spectrometric Analysis Initial identification of subunits of the FANCD2 complexes was performed as follows. Flag-HA-FANCD2 purified from HeLa cells was reduced with DTT, cysteine residues were derivatized with iodoacetamide, and the proteins were digested with trypsin. The generated peptide mixtures were subjected to LC-MS/MS using a hybrid linear ion trap/FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT, Thermo Electron) essentially as described previously (Haas et\u00a0al., 2006). MS/MS spectra were assigned by searching them with the SEQUEST algorithm (Eng et\u00a0al., 1994) against the human International Protein Index sequence database. Analysis of ubiquitinated WRNIP1 was performed by the Dunn School of Pathology Proteomics Facility.Protein-protein interaction assay 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of Flag-HA-FANCD2 and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of His-Strep(II)-WRNIP1 or 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of His-MBP were combined in an Eppendorf tube. For the binding assay with the Ub-FANCD2/FANCI complex, Flag-HA-FANCD2/His-FANCI was first monoubiquitinated as previously described (Lopez-Martinez et\u00a0al., 2019). After the ubiquitination reaction, 3\u00a0\u03bcL of benzonase (250U/\u03bcl) was added followed by 30\u00a0min incubation at room temperature. For the binding assay, FANCD2, WRNIP1 or MBP, 1\u00a0\u03bcL BSA (150\u00a0mg/ml) and binding buffer (150\u00a0mM KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF, 2\u00a0mM \u03b2-mercapthoethanol) were added to a final volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcl. The sample was mixed by vortexing and spun quickly. 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL of the input sample was taken from each Eppendorf for immunoblot analysis. The sample was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. After the incubation the binding buffer was supplemented with 0.1% of Tween-20 (v/v). \u03b1-HA Sepharose beads were washed two times in the Tween-20 supplemented binding buffer (resuspended and spun down at 2,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min). 10\u00a0\u03bcL of \u03b1-HA bead 50% slurry was added to each Eppendorf tube. The samples were incubated for half an hour with slow rotation in the cold room. Afterwards, the samples were transported into emptry 3\u00a0mL chromatography columns and washed with 3\u00a0mL of the binding buffer. Thereafter proteins were eluted with 30\u00a0\u03bcL glycine buffer (0.1\u00a0M glycine (pH 2.5)). The column was centrifuged at 1,000\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to collect the eluate. Afterwards, the pH of the sample was neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. Samples were mixed with LDS loading buffer and heated at 70\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and subjected to immunoblot analysis using \u03b1-WRNIP1, \u03b1-FANCD2 or \u03b1-His antibodies.Ubiquitin binding assay Flag-HA-WRNIP1 purified from Sf9 cells was used for ubiquitin binding assays. Protein purification from Sf9 cells were carried out as previously described (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016). 2\u00a0\u03bcg Flag-HA-WRNIP1 or Flag-HA-WRNIP1-19R were mixed with 2\u00a0\u03bcg His-ubiquitin in a binding buffer (300\u00a0mM KCl, 40\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml BSA and 4\u00a0mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. Then the protein mixture was incubated with \u03b1-HA Sepharose beads at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After incubation the beads were transferred to an empty chromatography column where beads were washed by a wash buffer (300\u00a0mM KCl, 100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF, 2\u00a0mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% Tween-20 (v/v)). The wash buffer was removed by spinning at 1,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0s before proteins were eluted by 1x LDS loading buffer. Eluted proteins were examined by 9% and 20% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using antibodies against WRNIP1 and Ubiquitin, respectively.Live-cell microscopy Cells used for live-cell microscopy were plated into microscopy dishes (MatTek Glass Bottom Microwell Dishes P35G-1.5-20-C) and pre-treated accordingly (in case of WRNIP1-EGFP cells and the variants of WRNIP1-EGFP with point mutations, the media was supplemented with 0.005\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of Doxycycline 3\u00a0h before imaging). The media was supplemented with 500\u00a0ng/ml of TMP (Sigma, T6137) and the dish was placed in the stand of the PE UltraVIEW spinning disk microscope for 15\u00a0min. The used objective properties were as follows: magnification: 60x, numerical aperture: 1.4, immersion medium: oil (N\u00a0= 1.514). 405\u00a0nm wavelength laser irradiation was used to irradiate the samples along indicated lines and the before and after images were acquired for each sample. The images were acquired in the green (488\u00a0nm) and/or red (561\u00a0nm) fluorescence channels. The camera used for acquisition was Hamamatsu C9100-13. All images were acquired and processed using the Volocity software. After acquisition the images were analyzed with FiJi software where the following measurements were taken. First, the areas where the cells were irradiated were circled by hand using the free-select tool. It was necessary to do this by hand for each image because the irradiated areas sometimes move slightly during long acquisitions due to cell migration. Second, measurement of the brightness of the selected field was performed and recorded. Third, the rest of the cell nucleus was selected avoiding the irradiated area, and the same measurement was performed. Fourth, the background was selected and its intensity measured. Then for each cell the following formula was used: Sx\u00a0= (Ax-B)/(Cx-B), where Ax represents the brightness of the stripe, Cx the brightness of the rest of the rest of the cell nucleus and B the brightness of the background in given field of view. The formula is returning Sx, which represents the relative brightness of the stripe compared to the rest of the nucleus in the given cell. After obtaining Sx values for each of the cells in the view field and for each time point of interest, the average S value was calculated along with the standard error (here standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of all the cells taken into consideration in the given view field). To make the comparison between the experiments easier, measurements were then normalized in such way that the first time point (before the irradiation) would always equal 1. To normalize, the difference between the first time point and 1 was added or subtracted in all later measurements (so for example if the average value for all cells in the first time point was giving the value of 1.12, 0.12 would be subtracted from this and all future time points). It was a necessary adjustment since, the distribution of the proteins used in our experiments is not uniform in the nucleus, with dark areas and sometimes bright foci. Since we usually tried to locate the irradiation area in such a way to avoid irradiating these non-uniform areas, its brightness would not exactly be equal to that of the rest of the nucleus even in the first time point before the irradiation.Analysis of nuclear FANCD2 foci using live-cell imaging was performed using cells expressing Halo-tagged FANCD2, either with or without additional WRNIP1 knockdown using shRNA. Immediately before the experiment, the cells were labeled with Janelia Fluor 549 for 30\u00a0min and then washed thrice in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2\u00a0mM L-Gln (without Phenol Red). They were then left to recover for 30\u00a0min in the incubator. The cells were subsequently exposed to 160\u00a0ng/mL mitomycin C (MMC) and followed for 4 h. Images from twelve fields of view, with 21\u00a0z stacks each, were collected at 0 h, 2 h, and 4\u00a0h time points. For each time point, the percentage of cells with > 10 foci/nucleus was quantified. For control cells, a total of 373, 414 and 361 cells were quantified from 3 independent experiments at 0 h, 2 h, and 4\u00a0h time points, respectively. For WRNIP1 knockdown cells, a total of 465, 588 and 511 cells were quantified from 3 independent experiments at 0 h, 2 h, and 4\u00a0h time points, respectively. Error bar shows mean \u00b1 SEM from 3 independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using the Student\u2019s t test with a p value cut-off of 0.05.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisStatistical parameters, including statistical tests used, number of events quantified, standard error of the mean, and statistical significance are reported in the figures and in the figure legends. Statistical analysis has been performed using Microsoft Office Excel software and statistical significance is determined by the value of p\u00a0< 0.05.
