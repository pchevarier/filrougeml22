Two nonallelic Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype C24) T-DNA insertional mutations, cpl1 and cpl3, were identified based on hyperinduction of RD29A expression that was monitored by using the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (RD29A:LUC) imaging system.

Hence AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 are negative regulators of stress responsive gene transcription and modulators of growth and development. These results suggest that C-terminal domain phosphatase regulation of RNAP II phosphorylation status is a focal control point of complex processes like plant stress responses and development. AtCPL family members apparently have both unique and overlapping transcriptional regulatory functions that differentiate the signal output that determines the plant response. Plants tolerate environmental  stress because of numerous physiological adaptations, which have been  attributed to the function of various determinant genes (1). In  Arabidopsis thaliana, transcription of RD  (Responsive to Dehydration) (2) and COR (Cold Responsive)  (3) genes is activated by cold or hyperosmotic stress. The plant  hormone abscisic acid (ABA) activates transcription of some  RD and COR genes through an interaction involving  the cis element ABRE (ABA-responsive element) and basic  leucine zipper transcription factors such as ABFs/AREBs (4,  5). However, expression of some RD or COR genes  is activated by low temperature or desiccation, independent of ABA, by  the interaction of CBF/DREB DNA-binding proteins with another cis  element, DRE (6, 7). Overexpression of CBF/DREB in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants induces ectopic expression of  RD/COR genes and confers desiccation and cold tolerance  (7, 8).Recent genetic dissection of cold-, hyperosmolarity-, and  ABA-induced signaling that regulates gene expression and adaptation  indicates that the cascade signature is modulated by numerous positive  and negative regulators (9\u201314). Signaling control of plant gene  expression is known now to include components that function at various  stages in mRNA metabolism (15). Gene expression regulation that is a  consequence of controlling transcript processing and elongation is an  emerging topic in biology (16).RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) is a core component of the transcription  complex. RNAP II catalyzes mRNA synthesis and is also involved in the  regulation of various mRNA maturation processes such as capping,  splicing, and polyadenylation (see review ref. 15). The largest subunit  of RNAP II contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) that consists of an  evolutionally conserved heptapeptide consensus sequence  Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser, which is the pivotal phosphorylation  target (17). In Arabidopsis, 41 repeats of the consensus  sequence are present in RNAP II CTD (18). Evidence in nonplant systems  indicates that RNAP II function is specified by the phosphorylation  status of the CTD. RNAP II with an unphosphorylated CTD participates in  the formation of the preinitiation complex (19). During the  transcription cycle, the CTD is differentially phosphorylated,  predominantly at Ser-2 or Ser-5. Ser-5 is phosphorylated by the TFIIH  (Kin28) at promoters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  which facilitates recruitment of capping enzyme (20). Ctk1  phosphorylates CTD at Ser-2 to facilitate transcription elongation.  Ctk1 appears to be a yeast ortholog of mammalian P-TEFb that  hyperphosphorylates CTD as the early elongation complex transitions  into a productive elongation complex (16).Although several kinases phosphorylate the CTD of RNAP II, the function  of only one CTD phosphatase (yeast FCP1 and its human homolog hFCP1)  has been reported (21). The essential yeast gene product  FCP1 (TFIIF-associating CTD phosphatase) dephosphorylates  CTD at Ser-2 (19). FCP1 apparently associates with RNAP II through  interaction with the RNAP74 subunit of the TFIIF complex (21, 22),  controls the phosphorylation status of Ser-2 during elongation, and  promotes RNAP II recycling presumably by dephosphorylating the CTD at  the termination step (19, 23). TFIIF is an integral component of the  transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with RNAP II to  facilitate message chain elongation (24\u201328).Both positive and negative regulation of transcription by FCP1 has been  reported. Inhibition of human (h)FCP1 in T cells by HIV-1 Tat protein  is necessary for proliferation of the retrovirus HIV-1 (29). This  finding indicates that hFCP1 antagonizes the capacity of the Tat  protein to recruit the CTD kinase to RNAP II, which is necessary for  hyperphosphorylation and chain elongation of the HIV-1 genome. Heat  shock inactivates hFCP1, which leads to hyperphosphorylation of RNAP II  CTD that is presumed to promote heat shock gene transcription (30).  Transcript levels are reduced substantially when cells of the yeast  fcp1 mutant are exposed to restrictive high temperature  (22). These results indicate that the FCP1 phosphatase is a critical  regulator of the phosphorylation status of the CTD, the biological  consequences of which are only now beginning to emerge. It is now known  that FCP1 functions in the dephosphorylation of Ser-2 in the  CTD, but another phosphatase(s) dephosphorylates Ser-5 (19).Screening of an Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant population for  hyperactivation of the RD29A promoter after cold or ABA  treatment resulted in the identification of two monogenic recessive  hos (high expression of osmotically regulated genes)  mutations, cpl1 and cpl3. Interestingly,  cpl1 and cpl3 mutations are caused by T-DNA  insertions in different members of the Arabidopsis CTD  phosphatase-like (AtCPL) gene family and exhibit distinct  RD29A activation, growth, and flowering time phenotypes.  AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 phosphatases apparently  are global regulatory entities that coordinate gene expression most  likely by modulating the phosphorylation of RNAP II. Materials and MethodsPlant Materials and Growth Conditions. A T-DNA population in the A. thaliana C24 line that is  homozygous for the chimeric RD29A:LUC  reporter gene (31) was obtained after floral transformation of  inflorescences with Agrobacterium GV3101 (pMP90RK) carrying  the binary vector pSKI015 (provided by D. Weigel, The Salk Institute,  La Jolla, CA). T1 plants were selected  based on Liberty (30 mg/liter) resistance (32) and combined into  10-plant pools. Plants were grown either in a controlled room with  16 h of light at 22\u00b0C and 8 h of darkness at 18\u00b0C or in a  greenhouse.In vitro grown seedlings to be used for luciferase (LUC)  imaging were obtained after seeds were surface-sterilized (1% sodium  hypochlorite and 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 min), stratified for 2\u20134 days  at 4\u00b0C, and sowed onto medium (pH 5.7) containing Murashige and Skoog  (MS) salts, 30 g/liter sucrose, and 6 g/liter agar (31). For  hygromycin selection, seeds were plated onto medium containing  1/4 \u00d7 MS salts, 30 mg/liter hygromycin B, 100 mg/liter  Timentin, and 8 g/liter agar.LUC Imaging. About 200 T2 seedlings from each 10-plant pool  were screened for constitutive or cold-modulated (0\u00b0C, 2 days) or  ABA-modulated (100 \u03bcM, 4 h) RD29A:LUC  expression as described by Ishitani et al. (31). Mutants  were also evaluated after NaCl (300 mM, 4 h) treatment. Image  acquisition (5 min) with a charge-coupled device (CCD) system  and processing with winview software (Roper  Scientific, Trenton, NJ) were performed as described (31).Molecular Analysis. Genomic sequence flanking the T-DNA insertion was determined by using  the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR procedure of Liu et  al. (33) with primers corresponding to nested regions internal to  the left border and degenerate primers as listed in Table 1, which is  published as supporting information on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org.  For reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR analysis, 5 \u03bcg of total RNA from  wild-type, cpl1, or cpl3 seedlings was used as  template for reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen).  Specific AtCPL fragments (AtCPL1: 0.5 kbp and  AtCPL3: 0.7 kbp) were amplified from a fraction (1/100) of  the reverse transcriptase reaction product by PCR [94\u00b0C 5 min  (94\u00b0C 30 sec, 60\u00b0C 1 min, 72\u00b0C 2 min) \u00d7 30 and 72\u00b0C 5  min] using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) and the  appropriate primers (CPL1F and CPL1R or CPL3F and CPL3R, Table 1). For  Northern blot analysis, seedlings growing in vitro were  stress-treated similarly to those used for LUC analysis. Total RNA was  isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Ten micrograms of total RNA was  size-fractioned by electrophoresis and then blotted onto nylon  membrane. Digoxygenin-labeled probe was prepared by PCR, hybridized to  the blotted RNA, and detected according to the manufacturer's protocol  (Roche).Nuclear Run-On Analysis. One-week-old wild-type (C24) and cpl1 seedlings grown  in vitro were cold-treated (0\u00b0C, 15 h). Nuclei were  isolated, and the reaction was performed as described by Cushman (34).  Labeled transcripts were purified with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to  the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare immobilized probes, PCR  products of cDNAs encoding RD29A (GenBank accession no.  L22567: positions 79\u2013640 and 1339\u20132096), pyrroline-5-carboxylate  synthase (P5CS) (GenBank accession no. X86777: positions  73\u2013671 and 1424\u20132142), proline oxidase (POX) (GenBank  accession no. D83025: position 113\u2013627), tubulin (GenBank accession  no. AF367301: position 76\u20131551), LUC (GenBank accession no. U03687:  position 1430\u20132230), and genomic fragment of 18S RNA (GenBank  accession no.{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"X52322\",\"term_id\":\"16472\",\"term_text\":\"X52322\"}}X52322: position 4135\u20134927) were produced by using cDNA  or genomic fragments that have been cloned into pBluescript as  templates. Three hundred nanograms of purified PCR product was  slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, hybridized with purified  run-on product for 48 h, and washed twice for 15 min with 6  \u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then twice for 15 min with  0.1 \u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55\u00b0C. The blot was placed onto an  imaging plate overnight and analyzed by using the Typhoon 8600  PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Genetic Complementation Analysis. The complementation constructs for expressing AtCPL1 or AtCPL3 were  produced by joining PCR fragments of the AtCPL promoter  region and the cDNA encoding AtCPL. The PCR products were first cloned  into pBluescript derivatives, and the sequence was confirmed. The  AtCPL1 cassette consists of the promoter (bacterial  artificial chromosome F17L22, position 42149\u201343915) joined to  the cDNA corresponding to entire coding sequence (F17L22.130) at a  unique NheI site and placed between the SalI and  SmaI sites upstream of the Nos terminator in pBIB-HYG binary  vector (35) to produce pBCPL1. Similarly, pBCPL3 contains a cassette  that encompasses the AtCPL3 promoter region to the middle of  the fifth exon (F4P9 position 110851\u2013113732) and a cDNA fragment (from  SacI at 1311 to the stop codon of AF486633) joined by using  a unique SacI site and placed between HindIII and  XbaI sites in pBIB-HYG. The resulting plasmids pBCPL1 and  pBCPL3 were introduced into Agrobacterium GV3101 and used  for transformation of cpl1 and cpl3 mutant  plants, respectively. T1 plants were selected by  using hygromycin.Phosphatase Assay. cDNA fragments encoding AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 were amplified by Pfx  polymerase with primers containing attB1 (5\u2032 primers) and attB2 (3\u2032  primers) sequence (B1C15 and B2C13, B1C35 and B2C33, Table 1) and  recombined into pDONR201 and then recombined into pDEST17 according to  the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) to produce pDCPL1 and pDCPL3.  pDCPL1 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21SI and  pDCPL3 into BL21-star (Invitrogen). For recombinant protein synthesis,  BL21SI cells without and with pDCPL1 plasmid were induced for 10 h  by adding 0.3 M NaCl into the medium. pDCPL3 was introduced into BL21  star because of low AtCPL3 expression in BL21SI, and cells were induced  with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactoside for  10 h. The recombinant AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 proteins were recovered in  the insoluble fraction after sonication of bacterial cells in 50 mM  Tris (pH 7.5) buffer and extensive washes with 1% Triton X-100. AtCPL  proteins were prepared in nonreducing SDS/PAGE loading buffer and  size-fractioned in a 6.25% SDS/PAGE gel (36). After eletrophoresis,  the gel was incubated in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then  phosphatase assay buffer (50 mM Tris\u22c5HCl, pH 7.9/10%  glycerol/10 mM MgCl2/10 mM potassium  acetate/1 mM ZnCl2) for 30 min. The  equilibrated gel was then sealed in a plastic bag with 10 ml of  phosphatase buffer containing 33 \u03bcM CDP-star, a phosphate ester  substrate (37). The chemiluminescent signal was collected by using the  CCD imaging system for 60 min at room temperature. ResultsIsolation of cpl Mutants. A screen of 6,000 T2 lines by CCD imaging  identified two mutations that exhibit a hos phenotype based  on RD29A:LUC expression after cold and/or  ABA treatment of seedlings (31). These mutations were designated as  cpl1 and cpl3 (see below for explanation).  Hyperinduction of LUC occurred in response to cold, ABA, or  salt in cpl1 seedlings but only in response to ABA in  cpl3 seedlings (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1).  Northern blot analysis determined that the  RD29A:LUC transcript increases concomitantly  with luminescence. Only a small increase in the expression level of  endogenous RD29A was detected (data not shown).  Although a modest increase in LUC, RD29A, and  CBF3 (encodes upstream transcription factor) transcript  accumulation was observed when cpl1 seedlings were  cold-treated (Fig. \u200b(Fig.11B, data not shown), nuclear run-on  analysis did not differentiate expression between wild-type and  cpl1 seedlings after cold treatment (Fig. \u200b(Fig.11C).  These results suggest that CPL1 functions downstream of  transcription initiation, i.e., in transcription elongation, RNA  processing, or degradation. cpl1 plants grow more vigorously  and flower later than wild type whereas cpl3 plants exhibit  reduced fresh weight gain and flower early (Fig.  \u200b(Fig.2).2). cpl1 and cpl3  seedlings have longer hypocotyls than wild type when grown under light.  Root growth in medium with NaCl (0\u2013180 mM), freezing tolerance before  and after cold acclimatization, and germination in the presence of ABA  were not affected in cpl1 and cpl3 plants when  compared with wild type (data not shown).      Open in a separate windowFig 1.A. thaliana cpl1 and cpl3 cause differential RD29A:LUC hyperexpression in response to cold, ABA, and NaCl. (A) Ten-day-old cpl1 and cpl3 T4 and wild-type (C24) seedlings were analyzed after no treatment (control) and after cold (0\u00b0C, 2 days), ABA (100 \u03bcM, 4 h), and NaCl (300 mM, 4 h) treatment. (B) Luminescence intensity of 8\u201320 plants per treatment was determined by quantitative analysis of the image recorded with the CCD camera. Error bar represents standard error of the mean. Steady-state transcript level of the LUC transgene was determined after plants were treated as indicated above except for the cold (0\u00b0C, 24 h) treatment. The RNA gel blot was hybridized with a digoxygenin-labeled probe corresponding to the entire LUC coding region. (C) Nuclear run-on transcription analysis of cold-treated seedlings. Eight-day-old seedlings growing in vitro were incubated either in 25\u00b0C or 0\u00b0C for 15 h before isolation of nuclei. Nuclear isolation, run-on reaction, and hybridization were performed as described by Cushman (34). Transcripts hybridized to immobilized probe were detected by Typhoon phosphorimager after 16 h of exposure.Open in a separate windowFig 2.cpl1 and cpl3 mutations differentially affect biomass accumulation and flowering time and increase hypocotyl length.

Thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR analysis (33) located a T-DNA  insertion in the fourth intron of AtCPL1 (chromosome IV,  position 45179 of bacterial artificial chromosome F17L22) and in the  seventh exon of AtCPL3 (chromosome II, position 120888 of  bacterial artificial chromosome F4P9), in the genome of cpl1  and cpl3 plants, respectively (Fig.  \u200b(Fig.33A). AtCPL1 and  AtCPL3 encode proteins with high sequence similarity to the  evolutionarily conserved CTD phosphatases (21) as shown in Fig.  \u200bFig.33B and Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information  on the PNAS web site. Four genes encoding CTD phosphatase family  members can be identified in the Arabidopsis genome  (www.tair.org), and the corresponding proteins are now designated as  CPL phosphatases (Fig. \u200b(Fig.33B). The existence of  AtCPL1-4 expressed sequence tag sequences  (GenBank accession nos. T44887, AV530190, F15563, and BE529486)  indicate that all are functional genes. AtCPL3 transcript  was undetectable in cpl3 plants, whereas a very low  abundance of AtCPL1 transcript was detectable in  cpl1 plants (Fig. \u200b(Fig.33C).  Open in a separate windowFig 3.T-DNA insertional mutations (cpl1 and cpl3) abrogate the expression of AtCPL1 and AtCPL3, respectively, which are members of a four-gene family in A. thaliana. (A) Schematic illustration indicates the location of the T-DNA insertions in AtCPL1 and AcCPL3. Exons (\u25aa) were deduced from the cDNA sequence corresponding to AtCPL1 and AtCPL3. The open boxes indicate the 3\u2032 untranslated region. Sequences at the T-DNA left border (lowercase)-genome (uppercase) junctions were determined by thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR analysis. The cpl3 contains a 43-bp insertion of unknown origin between the T-DNA left border and genomic sequence. (B) Schematic of AtCPLs 1\u20134 (GenBank accession nos.

Identified are the phosphatase catalytic domain (19), the BRCT domain for proposed RAP74 interaction (19), the CES1 (capping enzyme suppressor) (41)-like region, and the dsRNA-binding domain (43). (C) Transcript abundance in wild-type (C24), cpl1, or cpl3 plants determined by reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR using gene-specific primers for AtCPL1 (CPL1) and AtCPL3 (CPL3) (see Table 1). M, Promega 1-kbp DNA ladder.Genetic cosegregation analysis of progeny from the backcross to  C24(RD29A:LUC)  established a linkage between phenotype and T-DNA insertion in each  AtCPL gene. All 54 (C24 \u00d7 cpl1) and 64  (C24 \u00d7 cpl3) F1 plants were  similar to wild type, indicating that both mutations are recessive. All  48 hos plants selected from F2 progeny  by CCD imaging contained a homozygous T-DNA insertion. These results  indicate that a tight linkage existed between each mutated  cpl locus and the hos phenotype (data not shown).  Expression of AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 cDNAs driven by  the native promoter suppressed the mutant  phenotype of cpl1 and cpl3, respectively (Fig.  \u200b(Fig.4).4). Furthermore, Xiong, et al. (38) indicate that  several mutant alleles of CPL1/FRY2 exhibit phenotypes  similar to cpl1. These results confirm that AtCPL1 and  AtCPL3 are negative regulators of RD29A expression.  Open in a separate windowFig 4.AtCPL expression functionally complements the hos (high expression of osmotically regulated genes) phenotype of cpl seedlings. Illustrated are wild-type (C24), cpl1, or cpl3 T1 seedlings transformed with vector (pBIB: empty bars in B) or AtCPL1 (pBCPL1: solid bar in B), or AtCPL3 (pBCPL3: hatched bar in B). T1 transformants were transferred to hygromycin-free Murashige and Skoog medium before image acquisition. LUC luminescence image (A) was captured after ABA treatment (100 \u03bcM, 3 h) and quantified (B). Bars represent standard error of the mean. Subsequently cpl3 transformants were transferred to soil (C). (Magnifications: \u00d70.16.)Structure and Enzymatic Activity of AtCPL1 and AtCPL3. Fig. \u200bFig.33B illustrates the domains in AtCPLs that can be  deduced from cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequence data.  AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 encode CPLs of 995 and 1,241  aa, respectively. When AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 were expressed in E.  coli as (His)6-tagged recombinant proteins,  the proteins migrated on SDS/PAGE gels with  Mr of 100 kDa and 130 kDa,  respectively. Both AtCPL proteins contain the highly conserved  phosphatase motif \u03a8\u03a8\u03a8DXDX(T/V)\u03a8\u03a8 (39). Recombinant AtCPL1  and AtCPL3 exhibit phosphatase activity that is detected based on  hydrolysis of artificial phosphatase substrate CDP-star (Fig.  \u200b(Fig.5).5). We identified two consensus  double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding motifs (40) in the C terminus of  AtCPL1. This motif was also found in Arabidopsis HYL1 that  regulates plant ABA sensitivity (41). The AtCPL1 dsRNA-binding domain  is most homologous to that in TRBP (TAR-RNA binding protein) that binds  to the TAR-RNA in the long terminal repeat of the HIV genome (42).  Similarly, AtCPL2 contains one dsRNA-binding domain. In contrast, C  termini of AtCPL3 and AtCPL4 contain a motif with marked similarity to  BRCA C-terminal (BRCT) domain, which is found in many proteins involved  in DNA damage responsive cell cycle checkpoint (43). The BRCT domain is  also in human and yeast FCP1, making AtCPL3 and AtCPL4 strong  candidates for FCP1 orthologs.  Open in a separate windowFig 5.AtCPL are phosphatases. AtCPL1 and AtCPL3 cDNAs were placed under the control of the T7 promoter in the vectors pCPL1 and pCPL3 and expressed in E. coli BL21SI and BL21 star cells to produce rCPL1 and rCPL3, respectively. Protein was isolated from cells without and with pCPL1 or pCPL3 plasmid, normalized based on the culture volume (0.25 ml culture per lane), and then fractionated by SDS/PAGE (6.25% gel). Phosphatase activity was visualized by CCD imaging, after impregnating the gel with CDP star substrate (Zymogram). Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue R-25 (CBB) staining after image acquisition. Innate phosphatase activity of bacterial cells is indicated by *. Zymogram indicates the presence of low Mr degradation product of rCPL3 in bacterial cells. DiscussionFine Tuning of Gene Expression at the Level of Transcription  Elongation. Plant stress adaptation and development requires the coordination of  diverse cellular process including positive and negative regulation of  gene expression. Constitutive activation of the stress response by  overexpression of DREB/CBF transcription factors facilitates stress  adaptation but is disadvantageous to plants growing in the absence of  the stress (7, 8). As environmental conditions can change rapidly, the  ability to modulate gene expression after transcriptional activation is  presumably an adaptive capacity of plants. We have determined that two  Arabidopsis loci encoding FCP-like phosphatases (AtCPLs)  function genetically as negative regulators of RD29A  expression whose up-regulation is linked to cold and osmotic stress  adaptation (7, 8). cpl1 and cpl3 mutations also  alter growth and flowering time. Nuclear run-on analysis indicated that  the transcription initiation rate of several cold-inducible genes and  LUC was not affected by the cpl1 mutation, even  though the steady-state LUC transcript level was clearly  increased in response to cold stress. This finding is consistent with  the hypothesis that cpl mutations affect transcription  elongation; a difference would not be detected by nuclear run-on  analysis. However, it is not possible to exclude equivocally that the  undetectable increase in transcription initiation rate can contribute  to the difference in steady-state transcript level.The fry2 mutations reported by Xiong et  al. (38) are allelic to cpl1. fry2\u20131 is a  nonsense mutation caused by an internal stop codon in  CPL1/FRY2 coding sequence whereas cpl1 is an  allele that results in reduced CPL1/FRY2 expression.  Stress-induced gene expression in fry2\u20131 is much higher  than in cpl1. This allelic difference also may explain why  it is not possible to establish that a cold stress-sensitive phenotype  is associated with cpl1 mutation even though  fry2\u20131 mutants displayed cold stress sensitivity. However,  further analysis is required to dissect additional diverse  phenotypes of different cpl1 alleles.Two Arabidopsis CTD Phosphatase Subfamilies and  Different Phenotypes. Neither the cpl1 nor the cpl3 mutation, unlike  the fcp1 mutation, is lethal and each causes some unique  phenotypes. Therefore, AtCPL gene products apparently have  an overlapping function that may be associated with the duplicate genes  that exist in the two AtCPL subfamilies (see below). Each  may also regulate the expression of specific gene sets when plants  respond to environmental changes or proceed through development.The phosphorylation status of RNAP II CTD coordinates transcription and  RNA processing, such as mRNA capping, splicing, and polyadenylation  (15). Most of the RNAP II CTD kinases, Ctk1, Kin28, and Srb10, belong  to the same cyclin-dependent kinase superfamily (19). However, FCP1 is  the only characterized CTD phosphatase. It has been established  recently that yeast FCP1 is a Ser-2-specific CTD phosphatase but an, as  yet, unidentified enzyme(s) is responsible for Ser-5 dephosphorylation.  Perhaps other members of the FCP1 family are to be identified in yeast.  The human FCP1 produces two alternatively spliced products,  FCP1a and FCP1b, although the biochemical function of FCP1b has not  been elucidated (43).Several genes in the Arabidopsis genome have been annotated  as encoding CTD phosphatases but most are composed of about 300 aa and  are likely \u201cDDDD\u201d nonspecific acid phosphatase superfamily  members (39). AtCPLs 1\u20134 encode peptides that contain not  only the catalytic FCP CTD phosphatase domain (21) but additional  domains that are associated with proteins that function in the  transcription elongation complex (Figs. \u200b(Figs.33 and 6). Although these four  AtCPLs are likely CTD phosphatases, the presence of distinct domains  within the proteins facilitates categorization into two groups based on  predicted mode of interaction with RNAP II. The BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT)  domain (43) in AtCPL3 and AtCPL4 resembles that in the prototypical CTD  phosphatases such as FCP1 of S. cerevisiae or hFCP. The BRCT  domain in FCP1 proteins interact with RAP74 subunit of TFIIF of the  RNAP II complex during transcription elongation (21, 22).AtCPL1 and AtCPL2 are the only known examples of peptides containing  both dsRNA-binding and FCP-like phosphatase domains. Consequently,  there is no precedence on which to base prediction about the biological  substrate(s), although the presence of the FCP homology domain strongly  implicates the CTD of RNAP II as a substrate for catalysis. The  dsRNA-binding domain of AtCPL1 is homologous to human TRBP that was  isolated based on molecular interaction with TAR RNA (40). TAR RNA  plays a critical role in proliferation of HIV-1, as it is the  interaction site for Tat protein complexed with CTD kinase that  hyperphosphorylates RNAP II, which is transcribing the HIV-1 genome  (45). Furthermore, a putative RNA-binding protein RD is an essential  subunit of NELF (negative elongation factor), which represses  transcription elongation (46) and is a target of hepatitis delta  antigen (HDAg) that stimulates the transcription elongation by RNAP II  (47). It is proposed that the RD subunit stabilizes interaction of NELF  and RNAP II by binding to a nascent transcript (46). By analogy, AtCPL1  may bind to the 5\u2032 region of elongating mRNA, a process that positions  its phosphatase domain in close proximity to the CTD of RNAP II. The  sequence specificity of the dsRNA-binding domains in AtCPL1 and AtCPL2  may direct targeting to specific RNA substrates (48). Specific  protein\u2013protein interaction with regions in the N termini of AtCPL3  and AtCPL4 could facilitate the targeting of each to unique transcript  species. The presence of an AtCPL3 region that is homologous to CES1  (capping enzyme suppressor) in yeast (49) is unique among known CTD  phosphatases and may imply that AtCPL3 may be directly involved in  capping process. Further experimentation is required for unequivocal  identification of the biological target(s).RNA Metabolism and Signaling. In Arabidopsis, several genes encoding proteins related to  RNA metabolism are involved in osmotic stress and ABA signaling (50).  Deficiency of mRNA cap-binding protein ABH1, Sm-like protein SAD1, or  dsRNA-binding protein HYL1 causes hypersensitivity to ABA (9, 10, 41).  Control of transcription is achieved by a combination of positive and  negative regulatory factors that facilitate cycling of RNAP II through  the active and inactive states (51). It is conceivable that  modulation of the phosphorylation status of the CTD by different  phosphatase family members is a focal regulatory process in the  coordination of transcription in plants. As stress-induced regulation  of RNAP II functions in plants is largely unexplored, identification of  downstream regulons controlled by AtCPL family members and the signal  perception mechanism that activates AtCPLs are likely the next focus  for dissection of this global regulatory mechanism.
