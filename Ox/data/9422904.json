{"title": "Extra-pulmonary effects of inhaled nitric oxide in swine with and without phenylephrine", "pubDate": "1997", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1093/bja/79.5.631", "PMID": "9422904", "abstract": "We have compared the effects of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and i.v. nitroglycerin (ivGTN) on the haemodynamic response to phenylephrine-induced hypertension (PEHT) in anaesthetized pigs. PEHT did not change either pulmonary vascular resistance or gas exchange throughout all experiments. Both treatments lowered pulmonary arterial pressure to the same extent (-12.4% iNO; -13.7% ivGTN) and passively via an effect on left atrial pressure (-26.3% iNO; -31.4% ivGTN). Both treatments failed to reverse the decrease in renal blood flow (RBFc) induced by PEHT, but both increased urinary flow (UF) (+128% iNO; +148% ivGTN). IvGTN significantly increased plasma concentrations of nitrite and nitrate during (+22.7% arterial blood; +26.2% venous blood) and beyond the period of infusion (iNO: +6.4% and +4.9%, respectively). In four control pigs (no PEHT), iNO markedly increased RBFc (+109%), glomerular filtration rate (+72.5%) and UF (+68.7%). We conclude that iNO may have direct cardiac and renal effects, probably via intervention of NO carrier forms such as S-nitroso compounds.", "author": [{"author": "E Troncy", "affiliation": ["Anaesthesia Laboratory, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al-Pavillon Notre-Dame, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."], "href": "/?term=Troncy+E&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "M Francoeur", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Francoeur+M&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "I Salazkin", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Salazkin+I&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "F Yang", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Yang+F&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "M Charbonneau", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Charbonneau+M&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "G Leclerc", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Leclerc+G&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "P Vinay", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Vinay+P&cauthor_id=9422904"}, {"author": "G Blaise", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Blaise+G&cauthor_id=9422904"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["9422904", "31754841", "31469867", "31197492", "31143123", "28658254", "28008339", "25887847", "24763419", "21987110", "21907348", "19251721", "18685092", "18535482", "18439194", "16565424", "11457881", "10954746", "10468537", "10430889"], "body": ""}
