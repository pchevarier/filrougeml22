Previously, hypercapnia during lung-protective ventilation was accepted (permissive hypercapnia).[2]However, recently, it has become clear that hypercapnia is associated with adverse outcomes.[3] This association is due to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular dysfunction caused by hypercapnia.[4] As a result, it has been proposed that PaCO2 levels should remain <48 to 50\u200amm Hg to protect the right ventricular function.[5,6] Concurrently, a high respiratory rate to improve hypercapnia may cause dynamic hyperinflation, which may drastically impair right heart function.[7] In addition, recent studies have examined the increase in in-hospital mortality rates associated with an increase in mechanical power,[8] which is derived from tidal volume, driving pressure, flow rate, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate values.[9] In addition to limiting the tidal volume, plateau, and driving pressure values, a high respiratory rate must be avoided. Extracorporeal CO2 removal may improve hypercapnia[10]; however, this approach requires special equipment, and the number of facilities that performs it is limited. A simple intervention to improve hypercapnia is required.Using heated humidifiers (HH) instead of a heat-and-moisture exchanger (HME) and reducing the mechanical dead space created by HME may improve hypercapnia.[11\u201316] Although a catheter mount (CM) (or extension tube, flexible tubing) is a tubing system commonly inserted between the breathing circuit and endotracheal tube to create a flexible connection and prevent circuit disconnection and accidental extubation, it may create a mechanical dead space for the patients. It has been reported that its removal in addition to HME removal may improve hypercapnia.[17] However, previous studies involved relatively few patients with ARDS; moreover, no previous study has evaluated the effectiveness and safety of CM and HME removal in daily clinical practice.The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a CM and HME removal (replaced with HH) at reducing mechanical dead space during lung-protective ventilation and improving hypercapnia in patients with ARDS. 2.\u2003MethodsThis retrospective observational study was conducted at an 8-bed general intensive care unit (ICU) at the Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki, Japan). This study protocol adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ethical approval was provided by the Institutional Review Board of the Nagasaki University Hospital (No. 20072007-2). The informed consent requirement was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.2.1. Study populationThis study included adult (age >18\u200ayears) patients with ARDS, who developed hypercapnia (PaCO2 level >45\u200amm Hg) during mechanical ventilation targeting tidal volumes between 6 and 8\u200amL/kg and a plateau pressure of \u226430\u200acmH2O with a CM and an HME, while under deep sedation at our institution's ICU between November 2018 and November 2020. The patients underwent stepwise removal of CM and HME (replaced with HH) for mechanical dead space reduction. The diagnosis of ARDS was based on the Berlin definition.[18] Patients were excluded from the present study if they met the following criteria: lack of data on blood gas analysis performed before or after each step, >90\u200aminutes required for blood gas analysis before and after the removal of CM and HME, changes to ventilator settings or dose of sedatives, required fluid resuscitation or cardiovascular agonists dose adjustment owing to cardiovascular instability during the observation period, underwent bronchoscopy or repositioning during the observation period.2.2. Data collectionThe primary endpoints were PaCO2 values at 3 points: the use of a ventilator circuit (VC) with a CM and an HME (CM + HME) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A),1A), an HME (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B),1B), and an HH (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C).1C). These data were extracted from the ICU information system (Prescient ICU; FUJIFILM Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The values of tidal volume, tidal volume/predicted body weight (PBW), respiratory rate, minute volume, and blood gas analysis data (pH, PaO2, and base excess values) at CM + HME, HME, and HH, and the time interval between CM + HME and HH were also extracted. The secondary endpoint in the present study was the overall number of accidental extubations after the removal of CM during ICU stay.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Configuration of the catheter mount and heat-and-moisture exchanger ventilator circuit, heat-and-moisture exchanger ventilator circuit, and head humidifiers.

Clinical managementIn our institution, the initial circuit during ventilation is HME with CM. At the discretion of the attending ICU physician, removal of CM and HME was occasionally performed for patients presenting with hypercapnia; however, it was not a routine practice before October 2018. Since November 2018, it has been routinely performed in all patients presenting with hypercapnia. First the CM is removed, followed by the HME, after preparing the HH.The Puritan Benett 840 and 980 ventilators (Medtronic plc., Dublin, Ireland) were used for mechanical ventilation. The initial VC was configured as follows: closed ventilation suction catheter (SC) with a T connector (SuctionPro72, Smiths Medical International Ltd., Kent, UK), 15-cm CM (DAR PVC Catheter Mounts with Double Swivel Elbow Connector; Medtoronic plc., Dublin, Ireland), an HME (DAR Adult-Pediatric Electrostatic Filter HME Small, Medtoronic plc., Dublin, Ireland), and a VC (DAR Adult Polyvinyl Chloride-Smoothbore Breathing Systems, 150\u200acm, detachable Y\u2013piece; Medtoronic plc., Dublin, Ireland) (CM + HME) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A).1A). When CM was removed to improve hypercapnia, the SC, and HME were connected directly (HME) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B).1B). The VC for use with the HH to further improve hypercapnia was configured as follows: closed ventilation SC with a T connector (SuctionPro72, Smiths Medical International Ltd., Kent, UK) and VC with the HH (EVAQUA 2, Fisher&Paykel Healthcare KK, Auckland, New Zealand) (HH) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C).1C). The dead space values provided in the manufacturer's manual were 36 and 45\u200amL for CM and HME, respectively.Ventilator settings were adjusted according to the ARDS clinical practice guidelines.[1] The selected mode of the ventilator was assist/control (A/C)-pressure control ventilation. Whenever possible, the driving pressure was adjusted so that the tidal volume was 6 to 8\u200amL/PBW and the plateau pressure was \u226430\u200acmH2O. PEEP was adjusted according to the FiO2 value.[22] The respiratory rate and inspiratory time were determined at the discretion of the attending ICU physician. Inspiratory time was as long as possible, aiming to prevent the induction of intrinsic PEEP and patient-ventilator asynchrony and improve hypercapnia.[23] Blood samples for blood gas analysis were collected using the arterial catheter after at least 10\u200aminutes of dead space removal according to our routine practice. Blood gases were analyzed using the ABL800 FLEX system (Radiometer Medical, Copenhagen, Denmark) available within the ICU.To prevent metabolic acidosis under hypercapnia, trometamol, a buffer that does not create additional CO2, was administered through a continuous intravenous infusion to maintain the pH >7.2.[24]Sedation was induced by a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine, and with fentanyl, as required; it was adjusted to achieve deep sedation and suppress spontaneous breathing and patient-ventilator asynchrony. The neuromuscular blocking agent, rocuronium, was used for lung protection, as required.[25]Circulatory management was performed by the attending ICU physicians. In case of complications such as septic shock, interventions were administered, according to clinical practice guidelines.[26] In the case of renal dysfunction, continuous renal replacement therapy was performed at the discretion of the attending ICU physicians.2.4.

Statistical analyses were conducted using JMP pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 3.\u2003ResultsDuring the study period, 973 patients were admitted to our ICU; among them, 876 patients required mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five of these patients met the present inclusion criteria; moreover, 4 patients were excluded, as they required >90\u200aminutes for blood gas measurements before and after the removal of CM and HME. Finally, data of 21 patients were included in the analysis.Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics are presented in Table \u200bTable1.1. Sepsis was the most common cause of ARDS. Nine (43%) and 12 (57%) patients were diagnosed with moderate and mild ARDS, respectively. The patients\u2019 sequential organ failure assessment scores were relatively high; most patients presented with organ dysfunction in systems other than the respiratory system. Most patients presented with septic shock and a high vasoactive-inotropic score. A neuromuscular blocker was used in more than one-third of patients, and all patients were under deep sedation. Ventilator settings observed during the study period are presented in Table \u200bTable2.2. In all patients, the plateau pressure was <30\u200acmH2O.Table 1Participants\u2019 baseline characteristics.CharacteristicValueAge, y69.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.2Men, n (%)12 (57.1)Body mass index, kg/m221.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.3Predicted body weight, kg56.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a8.0Etiology of ARDS\u2003Sepsis, n (%)10 (47.6)\u2003Pneumonia, n (%)8 (38.1)\u2003Aspiration, n (%)3 (14.3)COPD, n (%)5 (23.8)SOFA score11 (7\u201315)Vasoactive-inotropic score\u221717.3 (8.1\u201334.6)Neuromuscular blocker, n (%)8 (38.1)CRRT, n (%)13 (61.9)RASS\u20135 (\u20135 to \u20134)In-hospital mortality, n (%)6 (28.6)Open in a separate windowTable 2Ventilator settings during the study period.CharacteristicValueAssist/control (PCV) mode, n (%)21 (100)FiO20.45 (0.33\u20130.6)PEEP, mmH2O10 (8\u201310)Driving pressure, mmH2O13 (12\u201317.5)Inspiratory time, sec1.5 (1.3\u20131.5)Respiratory rate, bpm18 (15\u201320)Open in a separate window3.1.

The PaCO2 value at HH was also significantly lower than that at HME (P\u200a<\u200a.0001) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). The values of tidal volume, tidal volume/PBW, respiratory rate, minute volume, and blood gas analysis at CM + HME, HME, and HH are presented in Table \u200bTable3.3. Ventilator values were similar during the study period and, in most patients, ventilation was performed with tidal volumes between 6 and 8\u200amL/kg. All patients presented with respiratory acidosis, and trometamol was administered to 8 patients during the study period.

Adverse events after the removal of CMThere were no cases of reintubation due to accidental extubation. CM was reinstalled for all patients who no longer required strict lung-protective ventilation and had improved hypercapnia. 4.\u2003DiscussionIn this retrospective study, we found that the removal of CM and HME could reduce PaCO2 levels in patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS and hypercapnia. This approach may enhance lung-protective ventilation and improve hypercapnia, which may be harmful. The removal of CM and HME to reduce the mechanical dead space is straightforward to perform and unlikely to cause adverse events in patients under deep sedation.In a prospective observational study of 11 ARDS patients with hypercapnia, the removal of HME (dead space of 100\u200amL) reduced PaCO2 levels by 11\u200a\u00b1\u200a5\u200amm Hg.[7] Subsequently, a prospective study of a small number of ARDS patients reported that the removal of HME significantly improved hypercapnia, confirming the usefulness of this intervention.[12\u201314] Moreover, in some of these studies, it was possible to achieve lung-protective ventilation by improving hypercapnia.[13,14] In contrast, one prospective study examined the effect of removing CM in addition to removing HME on improving hypercapnia in 7 ARDS patients; the removal of CM and HME (total dead space of 115\u200amL) reduced PaCO2 levels by 11\u200amm Hg.[17] Consistent with that study, in the present study, the removal of CM and HME (total dead space of 81\u200amL) resulted in 9.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.2\u200ammHg reduction in PaCO2 levels in 21 patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS.As the effect of PaCO2 value reduction is associated with dead space capacity,[27] active apparatus dead space reduction by the removal of HME and CM may be effective at improving hypercapnia. The relief of hypercapnia may improve patient prognosis independently and by reducing the tidal volume, driving pressure values, and respiratory rate. Following the report of a negative impact of hypercapnia on the prognosis of patients with ARDS, the removal of the mechanical dead space was recommended in recent reviews and guidelines[28,29]; however, it may still be an intervention that is not commonly implemented. The removal of CM in addition to HME is another straightforward procedure that may safely and effectively improve hypercapnia in deeply sedated ARDS patients without increasing the risk of accidental extubation.The present study has several limitations. First, this was a small, retrospective observational study. The number of patients with ARDS and hypercapnia treated at a single ICU facility tends to be small; in fact, previous studies included approximately 10 patients. However, the present study has demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of this intervention in daily clinical practice. Second, the preintervention PaCO2 values in the present study were relatively low (55.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a7.9\u200amm Hg). In the present study, patients had mild-to-moderate ARDS, which may be one of the causes of this condition. Moreover, the prolonged inspiratory time may have improved hypercapnia. In the A/C-pressure control ventilation mode, the inspiratory time tends to be within the range of 0.7 to 1.0\u200aseconds.[30] However, in the present study, the median inspiratory time was 1.5 (1.3\u20131.5)\u200aseconds. In a recent study of ARDS patients, the end-inspiratory pause prolongation was reported to induce a significant decrease in the levels of PaCO2.[23] This intervention may be another reason why the observed PaCO2 levels were relatively low. Although end-inspiratory pause prolongation may trigger intrinsic PEEP and patient-ventilator asynchrony, it is straightforward to perform and may have a greater effect when used in combination with the interventions presented in this study. Large prospective studies are required to verify the efficacy of these simultaneous interventions. 5.\u2003ConclusionsIn this retrospective observational study, the removal of CM and HME reduced PaCO2 values without changing ventilator settings in deeply sedated patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS on lung-protective ventilation. Although the removal of CM may result in circuit disconnection or accidental extubation, and thus, must be performed with caution, this simple intervention may improve hypercapnia and promote further lung-protective ventilation in this patient group.
