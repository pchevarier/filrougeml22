Here we find that the nuclear exon junction complex (pre-EJC) is a critical and conserved regulator of this process. Depletion of pre-EJC subunits leads to a global decrease in Pol II pausing and to premature entry into elongation. This effect occurs, at least in part, via non-canonical recruitment of pre-EJC components at promoters. Failure to recruit the pre-EJC at promoters results in increased binding of the positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) and in enhanced Pol II release. Notably, restoring pausing is sufficient to rescue exon skipping and the photoreceptor differentiation defect associated with depletion of pre-EJC components in vivo. We propose that the pre-EJC serves as an early transcriptional checkpoint to prevent premature entry into elongation, ensuring proper recruitment of RNA processing components that are necessary for exon definition. IntroductionTranscripts produced by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) undergo several modifications before being translated, including 5\u02b9-end capping, intron removal, 3\u02b9-end cleavage and polyadenylation. These events usually initiate co-transcriptionally while the nascent transcript is still tethered to the DNA by Pol II1\u20134. This temporal overlap is important for the coupling between these processes5\u20139. Initially, Pol II is found in a hypophosphorylated form at promoters. At the onset of initiation, the CTD of Pol II becomes phosphorylated at the Ser5 position. Pol II subsequently elongates and often stalls 20\u201360 nucleotides downstream of transcription start sites (TSS), an event commonly referred to promoter proximal pausing10,11. Promoter proximal pausing of Pol II is widely seen at developmentally regulated genes, and is thought to play critical roles in facilitating rapid and synchronous transcriptional activity upon stimulation12\u201317. Pol II pausing is also suggested to act as a checkpoint influencing downstream RNA processing events such as capping and splicing, but evidence for this function is still limited. The transition from the paused state to elongation is promoted by the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) complex, which includes the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and cyclin T18\u201321. P-TEFb phosphorylates Ser2 of the CTD as well as the negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), leading to the release of Pol II from promoter22\u201324. Another related kinase, Cdk12, was also recently suggested to affect Pol II pausing after its recruitment through Pol II-associated factor 1 (PAF1)25,26.The exon junction complex (EJC) is a ribonucleoprotein complex, which assembles on RNA upstream of exon-exon boundaries as a consequence of pre-mRNA splicing27,28. The spliceosome-associated factor CWC22 is essential to initiate this recruitment29\u201332. The nuclear EJC core complex, also called pre-EJC, is composed of the DEAD box RNA helicase eIF4AIII33, the heterodimer Mago nashi (Mago)34 and Tsunagi (Tsu/Y14)35,36. The last core component, Barentsz\u00a0(Btz), joins and stabilizes the complex during or after export of the RNA to the cytoplasm37. Non-canonical association of Y14 at promoters has also been previously reported, although the significance of this binding remains unknown38. The EJC has been shown to play crucial roles in post-transcriptional events such as RNA localization, translation and nonsense-mediated decay39\u201341. These functions are mediated by transient interactions of the core complex with effector proteins42.The pre-EJC, along with the accessory factors RnpS1 and Acinus, participate in intron definition43,44. In absence of the pre-EJC, many introns containing weak splice sites are retained. The pre-EJC facilitates removal of weak introns by a mechanism involving its prior deposition to adjacent exon junctions. In addition, the depletion of pre-EJC components results in frequent exon-skipping events, particularly at large intron-containing transcripts, although the mechanism is poorly understood45\u201347. In Drosophila, loss of Mago in the eye leads to several exon skipping in MAPK, resulting in photoreceptor differentiation defects. Other large transcripts, often expressed from heterochromatic regions, show the same Mago-splicing dependency. Similarly, in human, exons flanked by longer introns are more dependent on the EJC for their splicing47.Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the role of the pre-EJC in exon definition in Drosophila. We observed that depletion of pre-EJC components, but not of the EJC splicing subunit RnpS1, lead to a global decrease in promoter proximal pausing, altered Pol II phosphorylation state and premature entry into elongation. These changes are concomitant with underlying changes in chromatin architecture and correlate strongly with exon skipping events. These effects are driven by non-canonical recruitment of pre-EJC components at promoters. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Mago associates with Pol II but this association is largely dependent on nascent RNA. Upon knockdown (KD) of pre-EJC components, Cdk9 binding to Pol II is increased, partly accounting for the premature Pol II release. Remarkably, genetically increasing\u00a0Pol II pausing rescues exon skipping events and the eye phenotype associated with KD of pre-EJC components, indicating that restraining Pol II release into gene bodies is sufficient to complement the loss of pre-EJC components in exon definition. Altogether, our results demonstrate a direct role of the pre-EJC in exon definition via the control of promoter proximal pausing. ResultsThe pre-EJC regulates expression of long genesTo investigate the role of the EJC in exon definition, we performed RNAi in Drosophila S2R+ cells. As expected, Mago depletion triggered exon skipping in MAPK in Drosophila cells (Supplementary Figure\u00a01a-c)45,46. Further, we found that depletion of other pre-EJC components (eIF4AIII and Y14), but not of the cytoplasmic EJC subunit Btz or the accessory factor RnpS1, strongly impaired MAPK splicing and expression of large-intron containing transcripts (Supplementary Figure\u00a01a\u2013c, f, g). In particular, depletion of pre-EJC components led to a higher number of exon skipping events than depletion of Btz or RnpS1 (Supplementary Figure\u00a01h and data not shown). This effect requires pre-EJC assembly as a mutant version of Mago, which is unable to bind Y14, failed to rescue the MAPK splicing defect (Supplementary Figure\u00a01d, e). Thus, the pre-EJC is required for proper expression and splicing of large intron-containing genes. In contrast to intron definition, this exon definition activity only slightly required the EJC splicing subunit RnpS1, suggesting a distinct mechanism.Lack of pre-EJC alters Pol II phosphorylationIntrons are spliced while nascent RNA is still tethered to Pol II, allowing coupling between splicing and transcription machineries6,7,9,48\u201350. To address whether the pre-EJC regulates splicing via modulation of transcription, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments for the different forms of Pol II. We found that Mago KD results in decrease of total Pol II occupancy at the 5\u02b9 end of MAPK while the distribution in the rest of the gene body was comparable to the control (Fig.\u00a01a). In addition, the elongating Ser2-phosphorylated (Ser2P) form of Pol II was mildly decreased at the TSS, but significantly enriched along the gene body (Fig.\u00a01a). This was specific to Mago depletion and on pre-EJC assembly, as reintroducing WT Mago cDNA, unlike the mutant version, restores the wild type profiles (Supplementary Figure\u00a02a, b). Examining Pol II and Ser2P profiles in a genome-wide manner show extensive changes with decrease at the TSS and increase towards transcription end sites (TES) (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013e and supplementary Figure\u00a02c). Similar changes in Pol II occupancy were observed upon depletion of Y14 and eIF4AIII, especially at the TSS (Supplementary Figure\u00a02d\u2013f), but neither on depletion\u00a0of RnPS1 nor of Btz (Supplementary Figure\u00a02d\u2013h). Thus, pre-EJC components regulate Pol II distribution genome-wide.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Mago prevents premature release into transcription elongation. a ChIP-qPCR analysis of Pol II and Ser2P occupancies at MAPK locus.

Nascent RNA was fragmented to \u2264100\u2009bp during enrichment. Averaged read counts per million of mapped reads of two independent biological replicates from 4sU-Seq are shown on Y-axis while X-axis depicts genomic coordinatesThe pre-EJC facilitates pol II pausingTo further investigate transcriptional changes in pre-EJC-depleted cells, we analyzed the Pol II release ratio (PRR), which is the ratio of Pol II occupancy between gene bodies and promoter regions (Fig.\u00a01f). Notably, depletion of pre-EJC components, but not of RnpS1, significantly increased the PRR (Fig.\u00a01g and Supplementary Figure\u00a02i,j). Together, these results indicate an unanticipated and specific role for pre-EJC components in promoting promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol II. We next divided the changes in PRR into four equal size quartiles, from low to high PRR derived from Pol II occupancy in WT condition. When classified accordingly, the quartile with the lowest PRRs showed largest increase in PRR upon Mago KD (Fig.\u00a01h), suggesting that strongly paused genes are more affected upon the loss of the pre-EJC.Next, we performed 4sU-seq to detect nascent transcripts (a modified approach of51, see Material and methods), (Fig.\u00a01i). The 4sU-Seq metagene profile of Mago KD cells revealed lower read counts at the TSS and an increase towards the 3\u02b9 end of transcripts, consistent with the Pol II ChIP-Seq and reduced pausing (Fig.\u00a01j, k). To monitor nascent transcription overtime, we coupled this approach to treatment with the pausing inhibitor 5,6- dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoide (DRB), (4sU-DRB-seq)52,53. Our analysis revealed an average elongation rate of 1\u2009kb per minute in Drosophila S2 cells, in agreement with previous reports but slower than in human cells (Supplementary Figure\u00a03a\u2013c)54\u201357. Importantly, in contrast to the widespread change in promoter-proximal pausing, the average elongation rate was unaffected in Mago-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c), and the moderate gene-to-gene variation in elongation rate did not correlate with changes in exon inclusion (Supplementary Figure\u00a03d). Altogether, our data suggest that the pre-EJC controls Pol II pausing but does not significantly affect the elongation rate.To better dissect the role of pre-EJC in Pol II pausing we examined heat shock (hsp) genes, which possess a promoter-proximal Pol II that has been extensively characterized58. We performed Pol II ChIP-qPCR to monitor Pol II occupancy before, during and after HS on the Hsp70Aa gene. We found that Pol II occupancy at the 5\u02b9 end of the gene was higher in control cells compared to Mago-depleted cells before HS (Supplementary Figure\u00a04). During HS, Pol II occupancy rose dramatically and the extent of this increase was similar in control versus Mago KD, suggesting that Mago has no impact on transcription initiation. However, during recovery after HS, Pol II occupancy remained high at the 5\u02b9 end of the gene in control condition but was significantly lower in the Mago KD. These results thus further suggest that the pre-EJC is specifically involved in the control of Pol II pausing rather than in transcription initiation.Pre-EJC components associate at promoter regionsTo investigate how the pre-EJC controls Pol II pausing, first we evaluated the expression of known pausing factors. Depletion of pre-EJC components did not affect the expression of Cdk9, Spt5, subunits of the NELF complex, GAGA, Med26, TFIID (Supplementary Figure\u00a05a\u2013d). To test whether the pre-EJC might itself associate with chromatin, as suggested by previous immunostaining of pre-EJC components on polytene chromosomes of Drosophila salivary glands38, we performed ChIP-Seq experiments. We observed genome-wide enrichment of HA-tagged pre-EJC components, but not of RnpS1-HA, primarily at promoters of expressed genes (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c and Supplementary Figure\u00a06a, c). Mago depletion reduced the Mago-HA enrichment, demonstrating the specificity of the signal (Supplementary Figure\u00a06c). The degree of overlap between the bound targets of pre-EJC components was 34%, corresponding to 816 genes (Supplementary Figure\u00a06d).Open in a separate windowFig. 2Mago binding to promoter regions modulates Pol II pausing. a Metagene profiles of ChIP-Seq performed with HA-tagged Mago, Y14, eIF4AIII, and Ctrl, with standard error of the\u00a0mean for all the expressed genes based on averaged enrichment over input for two independent biological replicates.

Note that Mago interacts with total Pol II, both hypo (IIA) and hyper phosphorylated (IIO) forms (indicated with the arrowheads). Mago also interacts with Ser5P but not with Ser2P, and this interaction with Pol II is partially dependent on RNA. e Heatmaps of HA-tagged pre-EJC components and change in total Pol II, centered at the TSS (\u22121\u2009kb to +1\u2009kb).

For quartile classification, all of the expressed genes in S2R+ cells were divided into four equal sized quartiles according to the level of expression, from low to high level. p-values for significance of the associations, derived from Fisher\u2019s exact test, are shown on top of the histogram. g Log2 fold changes in Ser2P level at the TSS upon control and Mago knockdowns, when separated according to pre-EJC binding. p-value is derived from a two-sample t-test. h Recruitment of Mago at the 5\u02b9 end of RNA is sufficient to induce pausing. (Top) Schematic of the BoxB-\u03bbN tethering assay. BoxB sequences (blue rectangles) were inserted upstream of the CDS of Firefly luciferase (green rectangle). The \u03bbN peptide (blue) was fused to Mago (shown in red), GFP or RnpS1, and transfected into S2R+ cells along with the modified Firefly luciferase plasmid as well as with a Renilla luciferase construct. (Bottom) Quantification of the ChIP experiment. Chromatin was prepared for the different conditions and followed by immunoprecipitation using antibody directed against total Pol II. The enrichment of Pol II at the promoter and at the 3\u02b9 end of Firefly luciferase was calculated after normalizing against a negative loci and Renilla. The enrichment for three independent biological replicates is shown along with p-values for tested conditionsNext, we tested whether Mago might associate with promoters via an interaction with RNA Pol II. We found that Flag-tagged Mago bound to Pol II by co-IP (Fig.\u00a02d). Importantly, FLAG-Mago interacted with Pol II Ser5P but not with elongating Ser2P, potentially explaining the enrichment of pre-EJC binding at promoter regions. In addition, interaction with Pol II was reduced after treatment with RNase T1, indicating that a RNA intermediate facilitates this association (Fig.\u00a02d). Accordingly, most of Mago binding to promoters was lost when the chromatin was treated with RNAse T1 prior to immunoprecipitation (Fig.\u00a02e and Supplementary Figure\u00a06a, 6c). Furthermore, only mRNAs whose corresponding genes were bound by pre-EJC co-immunoprecipitated with Mago-HA, including intronless transcripts, indicating that in contrast to canonical EJC deposition, association of Mago at promoters can occur independently of pre-mRNA splicing (Supplementary Figure\u00a06e). Further, the association of Mago-HA with the TSS was not substantially affected by the depletion of the spliceosome-associated factor CWC22 (Supplementary Figure\u00a06f, g) or by treatment with a splicing inhibitor on intronless genes. Nevertheless, applying the same condition on intron-containing genes significantly reduced Mago binding, suggesting that splicing can contribute to Mago enrichment at promoters (Supplementary Figure\u00a06g). Finally, pre-treatment with a general inhibitor of RNA Pol II such as \u03b1-amanitin reduced Mago binding at TSS (Supplementary Figure\u00a06h). A similar result was obtained when Pol II initiation was blocked using Triptolide treatment, while preventing Pol II elongation after pausing using DRB did not alter Mago binding (Supplementary Figure\u00a06i, j). Collectively our data suggest that pre-EJC components bind to promoters via Ser5P Pol II, and that nascent RNA is required to stabilize this interaction.Pre-EJC binding to nascent RNA increases Pol II pausingTo define the relationship between pre-EJC-binding and promoter proximal pausing, we evaluated all genes bound by pre-EJC components (n\u2009=\u2009816) by several criteria. First, heatmaps show a positive correlation between Pol II occupancy and pre-EJC binding at TSS (Fig.\u00a02e). Consistently, the proportion of Mago or pre-EJC-bound genes was higher at highly expressed genes (Fig.\u00a02f and Supplementary Figure\u00a06k). Second, we noticed that Mago was highly enriched at the TSS of strongly paused genes, which have a low PRR (Supplementary Figure\u00a06l). Lastly, we found a positive correlation between pre-EJC binding and changes in Ser2P levels upon Mago KD (Fig.\u00a02g, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). Altogether these results suggest that pre-EJC binding to promoters might modulate promoter-proximal pausing.To examine whether the pre-EJC is sufficient to promote Pol II pausing, we tethered Mago to the 5\u2019 end of a nascent RNA via the \u03bbN-boxB heterologous system59. Compared to \u03bbN alone, ectopic expression of \u03bbN-Mago (p\u2009=\u20099.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125) led to increased enrichment of Pol II at the luciferase promoter and a slight depletion of Pol II at the 3\u02b9 end of luciferase (Fig.\u00a02h). In contrast, ectopic expression of \u03bbN-GFP had no effect, whereas expression of \u03bbN-RnpS1 had an opposite effect regarding Pol II occupancy (Fig.\u00a02h). These tethering experiments were repeated using additional genes selected on specific criteria: piwi, whose splicing is dependent on pre-EJC43,44; BBS8, which is unbound by the pre-EJC but has a paused Pol II; Crk, which is unbound by the pre-EJC and does not have a paused Pol II. In all conditions, tethering Mago to their 5\u02b9 UTR increased Pol II occupancy at 5\u02b9 end of the corresponding locus. Moreover, the decrease in Pol II occupancy observed upon Mago KD could be rescued by tethering Mago but not the GFP control (Supplementary Figure\u00a07a). Thus, Mago recruitment to the 5\u02b9 end of nascent RNA is sufficient to increase promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol II at the corresponding locus, irrespective of whether the endogenous gene is bound by the pre-EJC.Loss of Mago results in changes in chromatin accessibilityTranscription is tightly coupled to chromatin architecture60. To address whether KD of pre-EJC components affects chromatin organization, we performed MNase-Seq. We observed an increase in nucleosomal occupancy at the TSS upon depletion of Mago (Fig.\u00a03a, b), consistent with elevated promoter-proximal pausing and with previous reports that paused Pol II competes with nucleosomes at TSS60. Furthermore, the phasing of nucleosomes within the gene body was strongly altered upon Mago depletion (Fig.\u00a03a, b). Pre-EJC-bound promoters showed the most significant changes, consistent with a direct effect (Fig.\u00a03c, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). We also detected a mild but significant negative correlation between changes in Ser2P enrichment and chromatin accessibility (Fig.\u00a03d, coefficient of determination R2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.2274). Mago KD also led to depletion of the activating histone mark H3K4me3, in particular at pre-EJC-bound genes (Fig.\u00a03e, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). Therefore, Mago modulates histone marks and chromatin accessibility, likely via its promoter-proximal pausing activity.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Mago controls chromatin accessibility. a Heatmaps of nucleosomal occupancy from MNase-seq experiments performed in biological duplicates from S2R+ cells in control or Mago knockdown conditions centered at the TSS in a \u00b11 Kb window.

The changes were separated according to pre-EJC binding and a two-sample t-test was performedPre-EJC gene size dependency is mediated transcriptionallyDepletion of pre-EJC components primarily affected the expression of genes containing larger introns (Supplementary Figure\u00a01). We hypothesized that the underlying transcriptional changes upon Mago depletion might drive this size dependency. Indeed, Mago depletion led to an intron-size dependent increase in nucleosomal occupancy at promoters, and decrease in nucleosome occupancy along the gene body and at the TES (Fig.\u00a04a). In contrast, Ser2P enrichment displayed anti-correlative changes with respect to the nucleosomal occupancy (Fig.\u00a04b). Further, the increase in PRR upon Mago depletion also correlated with intron size (Fig.\u00a04c). Thus, Mago has a stronger impact on the transcriptional regulation of genes with longer introns than genes with shorter introns. To determine whether these changes in nucleosomal and Ser2P occupancies result from pre-EJC binding, we calculated the percentage of genes bound by the pre-EJC in different classes relative to their representation in the total number of expressed genes. Interestingly, we found that pre-EJC binding was significantly over represented at genes containing longer introns (Fig.\u00a04d, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). Consistent with a direct control of gene expression by pre-EJC components on long intron-containing genes, we found that expression of pre-EJC-bound genes was significantly decreased upon KD of pre-EJC components (Fig.\u00a04e\u2013g, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216) and this decrease was also largely observed at nascent RNA (Fig.\u00a04h, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). Collectively, our results suggest that pre-EJC components preferentially bind and regulate the expression of large intron-containing genes via a direct transcriptional effect.Open in a separate windowFig. 4Mago controls chromatin accessibility and Pol II pausing in a gene size dependent manner. a, b Changes in nucleosome occupancy (a) and Ser2P levels (b) in control and Mago knockdown in\u00a0S2R+ cells at the promoter, gene body, and TES, separated according to the size of the largest intron (ANOVA, p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). c Box plots showing changes in PRRs upon Mago depletion when compared to control, separated into different intron classes. d Percentage of pre-EJC-bound genes in different intron classes, along with the percentage of each class amongst all the expressed genes.

To determine whether pre-EJC components influence pausing through an interplay with NELF we re-analyzed the publicly dataset available from the ref. 60. We first noticed that NELF binds substantially more genes in comparison to the pre-EJC (3796 vs. 816), and that 45% of pre-EJC-bound genes does not overlap with NELF binding (Supplementary Figure\u00a08a). Furthermore, like Mago, NELF-bound genes are overrepresented on highly expressed genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b, c) and on promoters that are strongly paused (Supplementary Figure\u00a08d, e). Accordingly, NELF KD affects PRR more strongly on highly paused genes (Supplementary Figure\u00a08f, g). Given the similarity of NELF and Mago on pausing we tested whether their binding to promoters was dependent on each other. However, we found only minor effect on their binding upon the respective KD (Supplementary Figure\u00a08h, j). Furthermore, NELF does not bind MAPK and its depletion had no effect on MAPK splicing (Supplementary Figure\u00a08k), strongly suggesting independent mode of actions.To determine whether the pre-EJC influences pausing by regulating P-TEFb occupancy, we monitored occupancy of Cdk9 via DamID61,62. We expressed N-terminally tagged Dam-Cdk9 in control and Mago-depleted S2R+ cells and observed increased Cdk9 enrichment at the TSS upon Mago depletion (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Furthermore, the increase in Cdk9 enrichment correlated with Pol II occupancy (Fig.\u00a05c). To validate the increased occupancy of Cdk9 in the absence of Mago we also performed ChIP-qPCR. In agreement with\u00a0the DamID result, Cdk9 occupancy was increased at the 5\u02b9 end of MAPK (Fig.\u00a05d). Importantly, Mago KD did not alter Cdk9 levels, indicating that this increased enrichment was not due to changes in protein expression (Supplementary Figure\u00a09a). To evaluate whether the change in Cdk9 occupancy was directly driven by Mago occupancy, we analyzed pre-EJC-bound and unbound genes. The increase in Cdk9 enrichment for pre-EJC-bound class was mild albeit significantly higher than the unbound class (Fig.\u00a05e, p\u2009=\u20090.02508). These data suggest that pre-EJC binding at the TSS controls Ser2 phosphorylation and Pol II pausing by restricting Cdk9 recruitment.Open in a separate windowFig. 5Loss of pre-EJC core components results in increased Cdk9 binding to Pol II. a Metagene profiles of Cdk9-DamID in control and Mago knockdown cells as averaged enrichment over input from two independent biological replicates with standard error of the\u00a0mean for all the expressed genes.

The changes were separated according to pre-EJC binding and a two-sample t-test was performed. f Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from S2R+ cells extracts expressing either HA-SBP-Cdk9 or HA-SBP alone, revealed with Pol II Ser5P antibody. Immunoprecipitations were performed from control cells or cells depleted for pre-EJC core components (Mago, Y14, and elF4AIII). Shown also is the western blot against HA tag to assess the efficiency of the pull-down of HA-SBP-Cdk9 in each knockdown conditionTo address whether Mago inhibits P-TEFb recruitment by restricting its binding to Pol II, we evaluated the association of Cdk9 with Ser5P Pol II. We immunoprecipitated HA-SBP-tagged Cdk9 from control and pre-EJC KD cells and observed a substantial increase in the interaction between Cdk9 and Ser5P Pol II upon Mago depletion (Fig.\u00a05f). Similar results were obtained upon KD of other pre-EJC components. Thus, these data strongly suggest that the pre-EJC restricts binding of P-TEFb to Pol II, which in turn reduces Ser2P levels and the entry of Pol II into elongation.Reducing Pol II release rescues Mago defects in vivoWe hypothesized that reduced Pol II pausing upon Mago KD accounts for some of the increased exon skipping. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to rescue the splicing defects by decreasing the release of Pol II into gene bodies via simultaneously depleting Cdk9. We found that Cdk9 KD restored Ser2P levels upon Mago depletion (Fig.\u00a06a) and partially rescued Ser2P occupancy at the MAPK gene (Fig.\u00a06b). Further, the dependence of gene expression on intron size observed upon Mago KD was lost in the double KD (Supplementary Figure\u00a09b). These data suggest that Cdk9 and Mago antagonistically regulate transcription. Importantly, reducing Cdk9 levels almost fully rescued MAPK splicing (Fig.\u00a06c\u2013e) as well as other Mago-dependent exon skipping events (Fig.\u00a06f, p\u2009=\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128) in Mago KD cells. Consistent with the pre-EJC influencing splicing via modulation of promoter-proximal pausing, we found that genes that display differential splicing upon depletion of pre-EJC components were significantly enriched for pre-EJC binding (Supplementary Figure\u00a09c\u2013e, Fisher\u2019s test p\u2009<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216). Futhermore, the tethering of Mago to the 5\u02b9 end of piwi or Crk that increased Pol II pausing was sufficient to rescue splicing defects associated with the Mago KD (Supplementary Figure\u00a07b). Lastly, depletion of Cdk12, another kinase involved in the release of promoter-proximal pausing26, also rescued MAPK splicing of Mago-depleted cells (Supplementary Figure\u00a09f, g). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that Mago regulates gene expression and exon definition via regulation of Pol II promoter-proximal pausing.Open in a separate windowFig. 6Restoring pausing is sufficient to rescue Mago-associated exon skipping defects. a Mago knockdown results in elevated level of Ser2P phosphorylation of Pol II.

Lower panel: Adult eyes of a control fly and flies with indicated KDMAPK is the main target of the EJC during Drosophila eye development46. As shown previously, eye-specific depletion of Mago strongly impairs photoreceptor differentiation45,46. Strikingly, decreasing Cdk9 function in a similar background rescued eye development (Fig.\u00a06g). Notably, the number of differentiated photoreceptors in larvae and adults was substantially increased. We observed a similar rescue of photoreceptor differentiation in a double KD for Mago and Cdk12 (Supplementary Figure\u00a010a). Further, depletion of Cdk9 rescued the lethality and the eye defects associated with eIF4AIII KD (Supplementary Figure\u00a010b). In contrast, reducing the speed of Pol II or depleting several transcription elongation factors failed to substantially rescue eye development in the absence of Mago (Supplementary Figure\u00a010c\u2013f), providing additional evidence that Mago transcriptional function occurs at the level of promoter-proximal pausing rather than at the transcription elongation stage. Thus, despite the numerous post-transcriptional functions of the EJC, modulating Pol II release is sufficient to rescue the eye defect associated\u00a0with pre-EJC depletion.The function of Mago in Pol II pausing is conservedTo determine if EJC-mediated promoter-proximal pausing is conserved in vertebrates, we investigated the function of Magoh, the human ortholog of Drosophila Mago. We found that depletion of Magoh in HeLa cells led to an increased release of Pol II from the promoter to the gene body, and in turn to a higher PRR (Fig.\u00a07a\u2013d), as well as higher level of Ser2P, but not of Ser5P (Fig.\u00a07e). Additionally, Magoh specifically interacted with Pol II and Ser5P, but not Ser2P (Fig.\u00a07f\u2013h). Finally, we immunoprecipitated Cdk9 from control and Magoh KD cells, and observed a stronger interaction between Ser5P and Cdk9 upon depletion of Magoh (Fig.\u00a07i). Thus, the function and mechanism of the pre-EJC in the control of promoter proximal pausing is conserved in human cells.Open in a separate windowFig. 7The role of Mago on promoter proximal pausing is conserved in human. a Metagene profiles based on averaged enrichment over input from two independent biological replicates of total Pol II occupancies in control and Magoh-depleted HeLa cells with standard error of the\u00a0mean for all the Pol II bound genes.

The quantification of the intensity was performed with ImageJ. j Model: The pre-EJC stabilizes Pol II pausing by restricting P-TEFb binding at promoter, and possibly by sequestering Cdk12. This activity is required for proper recognition of exons DiscussionOur work uncovers an unexpected connection between the nuclear EJC and the transcription machinery via the regulation of Pol II pausing, which is conserved from flies to human. The pre-EJC stabilizes Pol II in a paused state, at least in part, by restricting the association of P-TEFb with Pol II via non-canonical binding to promoter regions. The premature release of Pol II into elongation in absence of the EJC results in splicing defects, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step in controlling downstream RNA processing events (Fig.\u00a07j).Promoter proximal pausing is a widespread transcriptional checkpoint, whose functions and mechanisms have been extensively studied. Several regulators have been identified, which includes P-TEFb, NELF and DSIF. Our data reveal that the pre-EJC plays a\u00a0similar role as the previously described negative factors by preventing premature Pol II release into elongation. How does the pre-EJC control Pol II pausing and how does it interplay with other pausing regulators? Our study provides some answers to these questions. In absence of pre-EJC components, P-TEFb associates more strongly with Pol II, which results in increased Ser2 phosphorylation, demonstrating that one of the activities of the pre-EJC is to restrain P-TEFb function by diminishing its association with chromatin. While it is not clear yet how the pre-EJC exerts this function, a simple mechanism would be by steric interference for Pol II binding, although more indirect mechanisms might also exist. This mechanism infers that both the pre-EJC and Cdk9 bind similar sites on the CTD on Pol II, which fits with the association of the pre-EJC with the Ser5 phosphorylated form of Pol II and not with Ser2P. However, we also found elevated Cdk9 binding and premature release of Pol II at Mago-unbound genes, albeit to a lesser extent compared to Mago-bound genes, suggesting that additional mechanisms must be involved.It is interesting to note that the binding of the pre-EJC to Pol II requires the presence of nascent RNA. A recent study also supports these findings showing specific association of pre-EJC components on polytene chromosomes that depends on nascent transcription but is independent of splicing38. This is reminiscent to the binding of DSIF and NELF63\u201368, suggesting that interaction with Pol II and stabilization via nascent RNA is a general mechanism to ensure that pausing regulators exert their function at the right time and at the right location. Upon external cues, P-TEFb modifies the activities of both NELF and DSIF through phosphorylation, promoting Pol II release. It would be of interest to address whether P-TEFb also regulates the EJC in a similar manner. Intriguingly, previous studies revealed that eIF4AIII is present in the nuclear cap-binding complex69, while Y14 directly recognizes and binds the mRNA cap structure70,71. It is therefore possible that this cap-binding activity confers the ability of the EJC to bind nascent RNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, the KD of Cap binding protein (Cbp) strongly reduced association of Mago to chromatin (Supplementary Figure\u00a08h). Nevertheless, since Cbp is also required to stabilize transcripts, the reduced Mago binding might result from this confounding effect. Moreover, other factors must be clearly involved as only a subset of genes is bound by the pre-EJC.SRSF2 is another splicing regulator that was previously demonstrated to modulate Pol II pausing via binding to nascent RNAs72. In this case, SRSF2 exerts an opposite effect by facilitating\u00a0Pol II release into the elongation phase. This effect occurs via increased P-TEFb recruitment to gene promoters. Although we have not found convincing evidence for a conserved role of the Drosophila SRSF2 homolog in this process (unpublished data), one may envision that the pre-EJC counteracts the effect of SRSF2 to stabilize Pol II pausing. Consistent with this possibility, EJC binding sites are often associated with RNA motifs that resemble the binding sites for SR proteins73. It is therefore possible that SR proteins influence pre-EJC loading to mRNA and vice versa.Our previous work along with studies from other groups suggested that the EJC modulates splicing by two distinct mechanisms43\u201346. On one hand, the EJC facilitates the recognition and removal of weak introns after prior deposition to flanking exon-exon boundaries. We proposed that EJC deposition occurs in a splicing dependent manner after rapid removal of bona fide introns, which are present in the same transcript. Thus, a mixture of \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d introns ensures EJC\u2019s requirement in helping intron definition. This function requires the activity of the EJC splicing subunits Acinus and RnpS1, which are likely involved in the subsequent recruitment of the splicing machinery near the weak introns. While this model is attractive, it does not however explain every EJC-regulated splicing event. In particular, depletion of pre-EJC components results in a myriad of exon-skipping events, which occur frequently on large intron-containing transcripts (this study and refs. 45,46). In contrast to intron definition, this exon definition activity only slightly required the EJC splicing subunits, suggesting an additional mechanism. We now show that the pre-EJC controls exon definition at least in part by preventing premature release of Pol II into transcription elongation. Our results shed light on a recent observation in human cells showing that the usage of general transcription inhibitors improve splicing efficiency on two EJC-mediated exon skipping events47.\u00a0Of note, two recent studies suggested a third\u00a0mechanism\u00a0for splicing regulation by the EJC\u00a0that involves the repression\u00a0of cryptic splice sites (PMID: 30388410, 30388411).\u00a0The notion that splicing takes place co-transcriptionally is now a general consensus and two non-exclusive models regarding the impact of transcription on splicing have been proposed. Through the ability of the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of its large subunit, RNA Pol II can recruit a wide range of proteins to nascent transcripts74\u201377, thereby influencing intron removal. Pol II can influence splicing via a second mechanism referred to as kinetic coupling. According to the model, changes of elongation rates can alter the recognition of exons containing weak splice sites78\u201380. In regards to pre-EJC\u2019s activity we favor the first model. First, our genome wide studies demonstrate a global impact of the pre-EJC on promoter proximal pausing. Second, we did not observe substantial alteration of the average rate of transcription elongation upon Mago depletion. We did find however some gene-to-gene differences but they poorly correlate with the degree of exon inclusion. Still, this effect might be a secondary consequence of splicing defects, as a previous study suggested the existence of a\u00a0splicing-dependent elongation checkpoint81. Third, reducing the speed of Pol II or depleting the function of transcription elongation factors failed to rescue Mago-splicing defects, arguing that the positive impact of reducing P-TEFb levels on exon definition is dependent on its function in Pol II release rather than in regulating the elongation stage. Thus, in the light of previous model regarding the interplay between pre-mRNA capping and transcription, we propose that by stabilizing Pol II pausing the EJC provides enough time for the recruitment of additional splicing factors that play a\u00a0critical role in exon definition.Pol II pausing is found more prominently at developmentally regulated genes, which tend to be long and frequently regulated by alternative splicing. We found a size dependency for Mago-bound genes as well as for Mago-regulated gene expression, suggesting that pre-EJC function is adapted to regulate exon definition of large genes by enhancing their promoter proximal pausing. Interestingly, a recent study shows that genes with long introns tend to be spliced faster and more accurately82. Whether this function depends on EJC binding to nascent RNA constitutes an interesting possibility. The next important challenge will be to address the precise mechanisms by which promoter proximal pausing influences pre-mRNA splicing at these developmental genes. MethodsCloningThe plasmids used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and co-IP assays in Drosophila S2R+ cells were constructed by cloning the corresponding cDNA in the pPAC vector either with N-terminal Flag\u20143\u00d7 HA tag or with HA-SBP tag. The CDS were cloned in pPAC vector with N-terminal tags between EcoRV and NotI. The lambdaN and Box-B constructs are derived from the plasmids described earlier83. The lambdaN constructs were made by cloning different CDS in frame at the C-terminal, between EcoRV and NotI sites. The boxB constructs were made by cutting out the 3\u02b9 boxB sites, and cloning it upstream of luciferase gene with KpnI site. For endogenous genes, the luciferase CDS was first removed using SpeI, followed by blunting the ends. BoxB sites were reintroduced using NotI and StuI sites, and these sites were used to clone endogenous genes.RNA isolation and RT-PCRRNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For reverse transcription, cDNA was synthesized using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Cat No-M1701). For semi-quantitative RT-PCR 2\u2009\u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed. Five microliter of the cDNA was amplified using the respective primers in 50\u2009\u03bcl PCR reaction, using One Taq polymerase (NEB, Cat No-M0480). After 40 cycles of amplification half of the PCR product was loaded on 1% agarose gel to qualitatively analyze the splicing products. For real time PCR, RpL15 was used as an internal control. Relative abundance of transcripts was calculated by the 2\u0394 Ct method. PCR primers used for semi-quantitative and real time PCR are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01.Cell culture, RNAi, and transfectionDrosophila S2R+ cells were cultured in Schneider Cell\u2019s Medium (GIBCO, Cat No-21720) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin.

For knock down experiments, dsRNA was synthesized overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C using Hi-Scribe T7 transcription kit (NEB, Cat No-E2040). dsRNA was transfected in S2R+ cells by serum starvation for 6\u2009h. The treatment was repeated three times and cells were harvested 7 days after the first treatment for Mago. For knockdown of other pre-EJC components and Btz, the treatment was repeated two times and cells were harvested 5 days after the first treatment. The primers used for generating dsRNA are listed on Supplementary Table\u00a01. S2R+ cells were treated with 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml of \u03b1-amanitin for 7\u2009h to block transcription.

For siRNA knockdown, cells were transfected with 10\u2009nM of siRNA using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells were harvested 48\u2009h after transfection. A mixture of three siRNA was used to deplete Magoh, two against MagohA isoform (siRNA sequence; 1-CGGGAAGTTAAGATATGCCAA; 2-CAGGCTGTTTGTATATTTAAT) and one targeting MagohB isoform (siRNA sequence; GATATGCCAACAACAGCAA).AntibodiesThe following antibodies were used in this study. For total Pol II ChIP, RBP1 (Diagenode Cat No-15200004) was used. Ser2P ChIP was performed using ab5095 (Abcam); 3E10 (Chromotek) was used for western blotting. Anti-Ser5P Pol II (Chromotek, Cat No-3E8) and ARNA3 (Pol II) antibodies (Progen, Cat No-65123) were used for western blot assays. For immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-Flag M2 (Sigma, Cat No-F3165) and M-280 streptavidin beads (ThermoFisher, Cat No-11205) were used. A polyclonal rabbit anti-Mago antibody was generated from Metabion (Germany). Anti-hCdk9 (Santa Cruz, Cat No-8338) was used for immunoprecipitation from HeLa cells extracts. The Cdk9 western blot from S2R+ cell extract was performed by anti-dCdk9 antibody, a kind gift from Akira Nakamura.ImmunostainingThe primary antibodies used were rat anti-Elav (1:5; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and guinea pig anti-Senseless (1:1000)84.

Washes were done in 0.1\u2009M phosphate buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. Appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Images were collected on Zeiss TCS SP5 confocal microscope.Co-IP assay and western blot analysisFor co-IP assay in S2R+ cells, cells were plated in 10\u2009cm cell culture dish, and respective transgenes were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent, according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Forty-eight hours post transfection cells were collected, washed once with PBS and re-suspended in swelling buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 3\u2009mM CaCl2, and protease inhibitors). After incubating 10\u2009min on ice, the suspension was spun at 600\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After discarding the supernatant the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 3\u2009mM CaCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 600 \u00d7 g. Nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer (40\u2009mM HEPES pH7.4, 140\u2009mM NaCl, 10\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) and sonicated in the bioruptor plus (Diagenode) for 6 cycles with 30\u2009s \u201cON/OFF\u201d at low settings. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cat No-5000006). For IP 2\u2009mg of proteins were incubated with respective antibody in lysis buffer and rotated head-over-tail O/N at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The beads were washed 3\u00d7 for 10\u2009min with lysis buffer and IP proteins were eluted by incubation in 1\u00d7 SDS buffer at 85\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Immunoprecipitated and input proteins were analyzed by western blot, after separating them on 4\u201315% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad, Cat No-4561083) and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Cat No-IPVH00010). After blocking with 5% milk in TBST (0,05% Tween in 10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.4 and 140\u2009mM NaCl) for O/N at 4\u2009\u00b0C, the membrane was incubated with respective primary antibody in blocking solution O/N at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The antibodies were used at following dilution: Ser2P: 1:500; Ser5P: 1:500; ARNA-3: 1:1000; HA: 1:2500; Mago: 1:2000; and Magoh: 1:1000. Membrane was washed 4\u00d7 in TBST for 15\u2009min and incubated 1\u2009h at RT with secondary antibody in blocking solution. Blots were developed using SuperSignal\u2122 West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Cat No-34080) and visualized using BioRad Gel documentation system. Full-length blots with molecular weight standards are provided in the Supplementary Figure\u00a011.For co-IP assay in HeLa, cells were plated in 10\u2009cm cell culture dish. Afterwards, cells were collected washed once with PBS and re-suspended in swelling buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 3\u2009mM CaCl2, and protease inhibitors), identical to the approach as in S2R+ cells. After incubating 10\u2009min on ice, the suspension was spun at 600\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After discarding the supernatant the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 3\u2009mM CaCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 600 \u00d7 g. Nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer (40\u2009mM HEPES pH7.4, 140\u2009mM NaCl, 10\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) and sonicated in the bioruptor plus (Diagenode) for 6 cycles with 30\u2009s \u201cON/OFF\u201d at low settings. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cat No-5000006). For IP 2\u2009mg of proteins were incubated with anti-Magoh antibody in lysis buffer and rotated head-over-tail O/N at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The beads were washed 3\u00d7 for 10\u2009min with lysis buffer and IP proteins were eluted by incubation in 1\u00d7 SDS buffer at 85\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, immunoprecipitated and input proteins were analyzed by western blot, as described above.RNA extraction and RNA-seqRNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA was further cleaned for organic contaminants by RNeasy MinElute Spin columns (Qiagen, Cat No-74204). The purified RNA was subjected to oligodT (NEB, Cat No-S1419S) selection to isolate mRNA. The resulting mRNA was fragmented and converted into libraries using illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (illumina, Cat No- 20020594) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol.ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-SeqS2R+ cells and HeLa cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and harvested in SDS buffer resuspended in RIPA buffer (140\u2009mM NaCl, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% DOC), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and incubated with respective antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Antibody complexes bound to protein G beads were washed once with 140\u2009mM RIPA, four times with 500\u2009mM RIPA, once with LiCl buffer and twice with TE buffer for 10\u2009min each at 4\u2009\u00b0C. DNA was recovered after reverse crosslinking and phenol chloroform extraction. After precipitating and pelleting, DNA was dissolved in 30\u2009\u03bcl of TE. Control immunoprecipitations were done in parallel with either tag alone or knock down controls, and processed identically. Five microliters of immunoprecipitated DNA were used for checking enrichment with various primer pairs (listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01) on Applied Biosystem ViiA\u2122 7 real time machine using SYBR green reagent (Life technologies, Cat No-4367659). To examine whether these changes in Pol II distribution were widespread, we performed ChIP-Seq experiments in control and Mago KD conditions. To exclude the possibility of changes in Pol II occupancy driven by differences in immunoprecipitation efficiency and technical variance during library preparation in different knock down conditions, we used yeast chromatin as \u201cspike-in\u201d control (Orlando et al.85). With this approach, we confirmed the decrease in Ser2P levels and Pol II at the promoter region and an increase within the gene body of MAPK. After validating enrichment, the recovered DNA was converted into libraries using NebNext Ultra DNA library preparation kit, following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. DNA libraries were multiplexed, pooled and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.DRB-4sU-SeqS2R+ cells were grown in Schneider\u2019s Cell Medium with 10% bovine serum supplemented with antibiotics and maintained at 25\u2009\u00b0C. 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside (DRB) from Sigma (D1916) was used at a final concentration of 300\u2009\u03bcM, dissolved in water, for 5\u2009h. 4-thiouridine (4sU) was purchased from Sigma (Cat No-T4509) and used at a final concentration of 100\u2009\u03bcM. Control and Mago KD was performed as described before. All the samples were labeled for 6\u2009min with 4-thiouridine, and transcription was allowed to proceed after DRB removal for 0, 2, 8, and 16\u2009min along with one non-DRB treated control.A total of 100\u2013130\u2009\u03bcg RNA was used for the biotinylation reaction. 4sU-labeled RNA was biotinylated with EZ-Link Biotin-HPDP (Thermo Scientific, Cat No-21341), dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma Cat No-D4551) at a concentration of 1\u2009mg/ml. Biotinylation was done in labeling buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.4, 1\u2009mM EDTA) and 0.2\u2009mg/ml Biotin-HPDP for 2\u2009h with rotation at room temperature. Two rounds of chloroform extractions removed unbound Biotin-HPDP. RNA was precipitated at 20,000\u00d7g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C with a 1:10 volume of 5\u2009M NaCl and an equal volume of isopropanol. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and precipitated again at 20,000\u00d7g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The pellet was left to dry, followed by resuspension in 100\u2009\u03bcl RNase-free water. Biotinylated RNA was captured using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads (Invitrogen, Cat No-65601). Biotinylated RNA was incubated with 50\u2009\u03bcl Dynabeads with rotation for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C. Beads were magnetically fixed and washed with 3\u00d7 Dynabeads washing buffer. RNA-4sU was eluted with 100\u2009\u03bcl of freshly prepared 100\u2009mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and cleaned on RNeasy MinElute Spin columns (Qiagen, Cat No-74204). For the untreated 4sU-Seq version used for calculating polymerase release ratio (PRR), an identical approach was used with following modifications. During the period when biotinylated RNA was incubated with 50\u2009\u03bcl Dynabeads with rotation for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C, RNAse T1 was added in order to fragment RNA to 100\u2009bp. Beads were magnetically fixed and washed with 3\u00d7 Dynabeads washing buffer, as described before. RNA-4sU was eluted with 100\u2009\u03bcl of freshly prepared 100\u2009mM DTT, and cleaned on RNeasy MinElute Spin columns (Qiagen, Cat No-74204). Enriched nascent RNAs were converted to cDNA libraries with Drosophila Ovation Kit (Nugen- Cat No-7102\u201332) with integrated ribosomal depletion workflow. Amplified cDNA libraries were pooled, multiplexed, and sequenced on two lanes of Illumina HiSeq 2000.MNase-SeqS2R+ cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min at RT. Cells were harvested and 20 million nuclei were spun at 3500\u2009g at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 300\u2009\u03bcl of MNase digestion buffer (0.5\u2009mM spermidine, 0.075% NP40, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM CaCl2, 1\u2009mM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol and complete protease inhibitors). Reaction was spun at 3200\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min and resuspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl of MNase digestion buffer and digested with 30U of MNase at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min at 300\u2009rpm in mixing block. The MNase digestion reaction was quenched with EDTA at 10\u2009mM final concentration. After 10\u2009min on ice, the nuclei were washed once with 1\u2009ml of RIPA buffer (140\u2009mM NaCl and complete protease inhibitors). Pellets were resuspended in 300\u2009\u03bcl of RIPA buffer (140\u2009mM) and sonicated (3 cycles, medium intensity, 30\u2009s on/off intervals) and centrifuged at 18,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. DNA was recovered after reverse crosslinking and phenol chloroform extraction. After precipitating and pelleting, DNA was dissolved in 30\u2009\u03bcl of TE and resolved on agarose gel. The ~147\u2009bp fragments corresponding to the mono nucleosomal fragments were gel extracted and after library prepararion, were\u00a0subjected to 50\u2009bp paired end sequencing on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.DamID-SeqpUAST- LT3- ORF1 vector (kind gift from A. Brand) was used to clone Cdk9 as a C-terminal Dam-fusion protein. The Dam-Cdk9 itself was cloned downstream of mcherry (as a primary ORF) separated by stop codon. This ensured low level expression of the Dam-Cdk9 fusion protein. S2R+ cells were plated in 10\u2009cm dish and subjected to control and Mago knockdowns using dsRNA, as described earlier. On the sixth day of knockdown pUAST-LT3-Dam-Cdk9 was co-transfected with pActin-Gal4 vector to induce Dam-Cdk9 expression, using effectene transfection reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The Dam alone control was similarly transfected in control and Mago depleted S2R+ cells. DNA was isolated from cells after 16\u2009h of transfection and subsequent treatments were performed as described86. Purified and processed genomic DNA of two biological duplicates was subjected to library preparation using the NebNext DNA Ultra II library kit (New England Biolabs) and sequenced on a NextSeq500.Computational analysisRNA-Seq: The libraries were sequenced with a read length of 71\u2009bp in paired end mode. Mapping was performed using STAR87 (v. 2.5.1b) against ENSEMBL release 84. Counts per gene were derived using htseq count (v.0.6.1p1). Differential expression analysis was done using DESeq288 (v.1.10.1), differential expressed genes were filtered for an FDR of 1% and a fold change of 1.3. Splicing analysis was done using DEXSeq89 (v. 1.16.10), and rMATS90 (v. 3.2.1b) with 10% FDR\u00a0filtering. Genes were defined as expressed if they had coverage above 1 rpkm in the averaged control samples.ChIP-Seq: The libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500/NextSeq500 in either paired end or single end mode. De-multiplexing and fastq file conversion was performed using blc2fastq (v.1.8.4/v2.19.1) for all libraries save the Ser2P ChIPs. Ser2P ChIP libraries were de-multiplexed using 6\u2009bp front tags. After sorting, the tags and the A-overhang base were trimmed (7\u2009bp in total). Reads from ChIP-Seq libraries were mapped using bowtie291 (v. 2.2.8), and filtered for uniquely mapped reads. The genome build and annotation used for all Drosophila samples was BDGP6 (ensemble release 84). The genome build and annotation used for the HeLa samples was hg38 (ENSEMBL release 84). Peak calling was performed using MACS292 (v 2.1.1\u201320160309). Further processing was done using R and Bioconductor packages. Input normalized bigwig tracks were produced using Deeptools93. The spike-in normalization was done according to the Orlando et al.85. All the libraries (including input) where calibrated using a normalization factor; defined as the number of reads mapped to the yeast genome (used as a reference/non-test genome) per million of reads mapped to the Drosophila genome. Once the libraries were calibrated according to the respective normalization factor, the enrichment was computed for every condition against their respective input.To assign the target genes bound by pre-EJC components, peaks were called using MACS2 with 2.0-fold enrichment as cut-off. The resulting peaks were annotated with the ChIPseeker package on Bioconductor, using nearest gene to the peak summit as assignment criteria. The intersection of genes bound by all pre-EJC components, i.e., Mago-HA, Y14-HA, and eIF4A3-HA, was defined as pre-EJC bound.4sU-Seq: The libraries were sequenced with a read length of 50\u2009bp in single end mode. Mapping was performed using STAR (v. 2.5.1b) and ENSEMBL release 84 for Drosophila. Multimapped reads were filtered out, and uniquely mapped reads to the transcript were considered.Calculation of polymerase release ratio (PRR): PRRs were calculated as follows: for each gene, the TSS region was defined as 250\u2009bp upstream to 250\u2009bp downstream of the TSS. The gene body was defined as 500\u2009bp downstream of the TSS to 500\u2009bp upstream of the TES. The PRR ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the enrichment in the downstream region towards the enrichment at the TSS. For each gene, the TSS with the highest average signal around the TSS in the Control condition was selected. Enrichment calculations were based on the enrichment over the input (ChIP-Seq) or t0 (4sU-Seq). The TSS reference was taken from ENSEMBL release 84. Genes with a length smaller than the required length for the calculation were excluded. All libraries containing spike-in controls were normalized to spike-ins following the method described before.Calculation of elongation rate: For elongation rate calculation, all the genes longer than 10\u2009kb were divided into 100\u2009bp bins (to a total of 20\u2009kb) and the transcriptional wave front was identified in the bin with lowest local minimum signal. The distance in base pairs covered by the wave front between 2\u2009min after DRB removal and 8\u2009min is then divided by the corresponding time interval of 6\u2009min to calculate elongation rates (bp/min).MNase-Seq: The libraries were sequenced with a read length of 50\u2009bp in paired end mode. De-multiplexing and fastq file conversion was performed using blc2fastq (v.1.8.4). Libraries were de-multiplexed using 6\u2009bp front tags. After sorting, the tags and the A-overhang base were trimmed (7\u2009bp in total). Reads from MNase-Seq libraries were mapped using bowtie2 (v. 2.2.8), and filtered for uniquely mapped reads. The genome build and annotation used for all Drosophila samples was BDGP6 (ensemble release 84). Further processing was done using R and Bioconductor packages. Heatmaps and input normalized tracks were produced using Deeptools (v. 2.2.3). Metagene profiles were produced using NGS.plot (v. 2.61).Targeted DamID-Seq: The libraries were sequenced with a read length of 50\u2009bp in paired end mode. The first read was mapped to Drosophila melanogaster genome (BDGP6) using bowtie (v.2.2.9), binned to GATC fragments, and normalized against the Dam-only control94 using the available damidseq_pipeline on GitHub. The resulting bedgraph files were averaged and smoothened using BEDOPS95 (v. 2.4.30). The smoothened bedgraph files were converted to bigwig file using SeqPlot, and processed through Deeptools (v. 2.2.3) to generate heatmaps. To quantify the changes at the promoter, the signals in the bedgraph were mapped to the promoters using bedmap tool available in BEDOPS software. The further quantification and plots were generated using R (v 3.4.2), and ggplot2 package available on Bioconductor.NELF microarray analysisTo compare our data with NELF knockdown we used data from this study60. The NELF data was retrieved from GEO ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20471\",\"term_id\":\"20471\"}}GSE20471) and processed in R. Preprocessing was done as described in the original paper. The TSS used for pausing index calculations were determined as the ones with the highest average enrichment\u2009+\u2009\u2212250 bp around the TSS in the control condition. Calculation of pausing index was done as described in the study.NELF bound genes were determined as the genes which have an average enrichment >1.3 in the \u2009+\u2009\u2212250 bp around the TSS (based on the TSS used for pausing index calculations). Any gene ids not matching our reference were converted using the Flybase ID converter tool96.Quantification and statistical analysisStatistical parameters and significance are reported in the Figures and the Figure legends. For comparisons of the distribution of different classes we used ANOVA. t-Test, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Fisher\u2019s test were used for testing the statistical significance. Number of genes used in the box plots is indicated in Supplementary Table\u00a02.Reporting SummaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this Article.
