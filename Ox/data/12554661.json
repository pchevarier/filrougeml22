Here we analyze the ability of mutants of different transcription elongation factors to transcribe lacZ. We found that spt4\u0394, like THO mutants, impaired transcription of lacZ and of long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoter. Using a newly developed in vitro transcription elongation assay, we show that Spt4 is required in elongation. There is a functional interaction between Spt4 and THO, detected by the lethality or strong gene expression defect and hyper-recombination phenotypes of double mutants in the W303 genetic background. Our results indicate that Spt4\u2013Spt5 has a positive role in transcription elongation and suggest that Spt4\u2013Spt5 and THO act at different steps during mRNA biogenesis.Keywords: lacZ/SPT4/SPT5/THO complex/transcription elongation IntroductionTranscription is a complex cellular process that involves three differentiated steps: initiation, elongation and termination. During elongation, RNA polymerase\u00a0II (RNAPII) has to overcome situations derived from transient pausing caused by regulatory signals. This is achieved with the help of positive and negative transcriptional elongation factors. Positive factors include TFIIS (Wind and Reines, 2000), TFIIF (Bengal et al., 1991), human Elongin (Aso et al., 1995), ELL (Shilatifard et al., 1996), FACT (LeRoy et al., 1998; Orphanides et al., 1998; Wada et al., 2000), Elongator (Otero et al., 1999; Wittschieben et al., 1999), CSB/Rad26 (van Gool et al., 1997) and the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome (Ferdous et al., 2001). Negative elongation factors include DSIF and NELF (Hartzog et al., 1998; Wada et al., 1998a; Yamaguchi et al., 1999a, 2002).DSIF was isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts as a transcription elongation factor that causes pausing of RNAPII when cells are treated with 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (Wada et al., 1998a; Yamaguchi et al., 1999b). It is formed by two subunits, which are the human homologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors Spt4 and Spt5 (Wada et al., 1998a; Yamaguchi et al., 1999b). Consistent with the role of Spt4\u2013Spt5/DSIF in transcription elongation, Drosophila Spt5 has been shown to colocalize with RNAPII at highly transcribed sites of polytene chromosomes and at heat-shock genes upon induction (Andrulis et al., 2000; Kaplan et al., 2000). Also, Drosophila and yeast Spt5 proteins are bound to open reading frames (ORFs) when they are transcriptionally active, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (Andrulis et al., 2000; Pokholok et al., 2002). Furthermore, yeast Spt4 and Spt5\u00a0are tightly associated in a protein complex that interacts with RNAPII (Hartzog et al., 1998).In vitro studies indicate that DSIF acts as a negative elongation factor, increasing the pausing of RNAPII (Yamaguchi et al., 1999b; Renner et al., 2001). The pausing is reversed by P-TEFb, which phosphorylates the RNAPII CTD and the DSIF hSpt5 subunit (Wada et al., 1998b; Kim and Sharp, 2001; Renner et al., 2001). Spt4\u2013Spt5/DSIF complex has also been suggested to have a positive role in transcription elongation, although this has not been demonstrated yet. Thus, spt4\u0394 mutants are sensitive to 6-azauracil (6-AU; Hartzog et al., 1998; Costa and Arndt, 2000), a phenotypic landmark of transcription elongation defects caused by the in vivo depletion of GTP and UTP pools provoked by 6-AU (Shaw and Reines, 2000). In addition, it has been shown that S.cerevisiae spt5-194 mutation causes a decrease in the levels of some RNAPII transcripts (Compagnone-Post and Osley, 1996) and that purified human DSIF stimulates transcription under limiting NTP concentrations (Wada et al., 1998a) or when added in excess to isolated early elongation complexes (Renner et al., 2001).THO was identified in yeast as a four-protein complex that included Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1 and Thp2 (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2000). Previous genetic and functional evidence indicated that mutations in the THO complex caused a strong transcription-dependent hyper-recombination phenotype and a defect in gene expression (Ch\u00e1vez and Aguilera, 1997; Piruat and Aguilera, 1998; Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). THO mutants, such as hpr1, are preferentially affected in their ability to express long and GC-rich DNA sequences driven from a strong promoter, as is the case of lacZ fused to the GAL1 promoter (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). It has recently been shown that THO is present, together with the components of the mRNA export machinery Sub2 and Yra1, in a larger complex conserved in yeast and humans, termed TREX. This complex is associated with ORFs in a transcription-dependent manner (Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002). THO and mRNA-export mutants show, indeed, similar defects in transcription suggesting a connection between both transcription and mRNA metabolism (Jimeno et al., 2002). Our actual view is that THO has a major role in the metabolism of nascent mRNA during transcription, suggesting that the status of the nascent RNA becomes important for proper transcription (Jimeno et al., 2002).In this study, we developed a new in vitro assay for the analysis of transcription elongation in whole-cell extracts (WCEs). With this assay, we showed that Spt4 is strongly required for transcription elongation. In addition, we found that spt4\u0394 mutants are strongly impaired in transcription of lacZ and other long and GC-rich DNA sequences driven from a strong promoter, phenotypes observed previously for the mutants of the THO complex. In contrast to THO mutations, spt4 does not confer a transcription-dependent hyper-recombination phenotype. In the W303 genetic background, double mutant strains carrying spt4\u0394 and a THO mutation are either inviable or show stronger transcription and recombination phenotypes than the single mutants. We conclude that Spt4 has a positive role in transcription elongation and that this role is different from that of THO during mRNA biogenesis. ResultsAnalysis of gene expression in different transcription elongation mutants: impairment of lacZ expression in spt4 and spt5Mutants of the THO complex are defective in lacZ gene expression (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2000). In order to establish whether the incapacity to express lacZ could be used as a phenotype linked to transcription elongation defects, we determined the ability of a number of known transcription elongation mutants to transcribe lacZ. We performed northern analysis of mutants and their respective wild-type isogenic strains transformed with centromeric plasmid pSCh204 (Ch\u00e1vez and Aguilera, 1997), in which the complete lacZ ORF is located between two truncated copies of LEU2 transcribed from the LEU2 promoter, yielding a 4.5\u00a0kb transcript. Figure\u00a01 shows that the spt4-3 mutant had a dramatic effect on the level of lacZ mRNA; reduced to 7% of the level of a wild-type strain. Among the other mutants tested (ela1\u0394, elp1\u0394, elp2\u0394, elp3\u0394, spt6-140, spt16-197, rpb2-10, dst1 and rpb2-10 dst1), lacZ mRNA levels were slightly reduced in elp3\u0394 (30% of the wild-type levels), spt6-140 and rpb2-10 mutants (50% the wild-type levels) and was not affected in the rest of the mutants.Open in a separate windowFig. 1. Transcription analysis of a leu2\u03943\u2032::lacZ fusion in different transcription elongation mutants and their respective isogenic wild-type strains. Northern analyses were performed from overnight cultures of yeast cells transformed with plasmid pSCh204. Strains used were W303-1A (WT), ela1\u0394 (ela1\u0394), JSY102 (elp1\u0394), elp2\u0394 (elp2\u0394), JSY130 (elp3\u0394), MH236H-1B (WT), MH236H-1D (spt4-3), MH137H-1B (WT), MH137H-4A (spt6-140), MF348-5B (WT), MF348-1A (spt16-197), ADW11-7C (WT), ADW11-11A (rpb2-10), ADW11-4B (dst1), ALY95-4A (WT), ALY95-1B (rpb2-10 dst1\u0394). The DNA probes used were the 3\u00a0kb BamHI 5\u2032-end fragment of lacZ and a 589\u00a0bp 28S rDNA internal fragment obtained by PCR. The relative amount of lacZ mRNA values normalized with the corresponding WT value for each mutant analyzed is shown at the bottom.Spt4 forms a complex with Spt5 that is homologous to the human DSIF complex. Whereas Spt5 is essential for cell viability, Spt4 is not. For this reason, we decided to extend our functional analysis of lacZ transcription to null spt4\u0394 mutants. In this case, we analyzed gene expression in the Ptet::lacZ-URA3 translational fusion (Jimeno et al., 2002). We have shown previously that mutants with an impaired ability to express lacZ, such as the mutants of the THO complex, are incapable of expressing this fusion. They yield a Ura\u2013 phenotype and white colonies in X-gal-containing medium in contrast to the Ura+ phenotype and blue-color forming colonies of wild-type cells (Jimeno et al., 2002). As expected, spt4\u0394 cells carrying Ptet::lacZ-URA3 are Ura\u2013 and they do not form blue-color colonies when adding X-gal to the medium (data not shown). They showed lacZ mRNA levels that were 20% of the wild type, confirming that spt4\u0394 cells are impaired in expression of lacZ driven from a Ptet promoter (Figure\u00a02B). Next, we determined whether the leaky mutations spt5-194 and spt5-242 also conferred a defect in lacZ transcription. As can be seen in Figure\u00a02B, both alleles reduced the efficiency of transcription of Ptet::lacZ-URA3 to levels in the range of those of spt4\u0394. As spt4 and spt5 have similar transcription phenotypes, we decided to continue our analysis with the spt4\u0394 null mutant only.Open in a separate windowFig. 2. Transcription analysis of lacZ in wild-type, spt4\u0394 and spt5 mutant cells. (A)\u00a0Scheme of the lacZ-URA3 translational fusion under the control of the tet promoter. (B)\u00a0Northern analyses of lacZ-URA3 expression in wild-type (SPT4TW-1A or OY 97), spt4\u0394 (SPT4TW-1B), spt5-194 (GHY 94) and spt5-242 (GHY 828) strains transformed with plasmid pCM184-LAUR. DNA probes used were the 3\u00a0kb BamHI 5\u2032-end fragment of lacZ fragment and a 589\u00a0bp 28S rDNA internal fragment obtained by PCR. For more details, see Figure\u00a01. Shown values are the mean of two independent experiments.spt4\u0394 cells have a strongly reduced capacity to express lacZ and long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoterUsing a GAL1p::lacZ fusion, we showed, by kinetic analysis of transcription activation, that spt4\u0394 cells show low levels of accumulation of lacZ mRNA for 170\u00a0min after activation by galactose addition (Figure\u00a03). The low mRNA levels are not due to a defect in activation of the GAL1 promoter, but rather to an incapacity to properly transcribe lacZ. When an identical experiment was performed with a GAL1p::PHO5 fusion, in which the bacterial lacZ sequence was replaced by the yeast PHO5 sequence, accumulation of PHO5 mRNA occurred with the same kinetics as the wild type, reaching similar wild-type levels of transcription after 170\u00a0min of galactose addition (Figure\u00a03). This result demonstrates that it is the transcription through lacZ, and not the activation of the GAL1 promoter, that is impaired in spt4\u0394 cells.Open in a separate windowFig. 3. Transcription analysis of GAL1p::lacZ, GAL1p::PHO5, GAL1p::klLAC4, GAL1p::LYS2 and GAL1p::YAT1 in wild-type and spt4\u0394 cells. Northern analyses of lacZ, PHO5, klLAC4, LYS2 and YAT1 mRNAs driven from the GAL1 promoter in the strains BY4741 (WT) and YGR063c (spt4\u0394) transformed with plasmids p416GAL1lacZ, pSCh202, pSCh255, pSCh227 and pSCh247 are shown. Mid-log phase cells grown in 2% glucose SC medium lacking uracil were washed and diluted into SC 3% glycerol-2% lactate medium lacking uracil to an OD600 of 0.8 and incubated for 14\u00a0h. Galactose was then added and samples were taken for northern analyses at different times, as specified. DNA probes used were the 3\u00a0kb BamHI 5\u2032-end fragment of lacZ, a 0.9\u00a0kb EcoRV PHO5 internal fragment, 3\u00a0kb XbaI fragment containing klLAC4 ORF, a 2\u00a0kb XhoI\u2013XbaI fragment containing YAT1, LYS2 internal fragment obtained by PCR and a 589\u00a0bp 28S rDNA internal fragment obtained by PCR. Plotted mRNA values are given in arbitrary units (AU) with respect to rRNA levels. For more details, see Figure\u00a01. The YAT1 and LYS2 expression levels observed at 0\u00a0min is due to transcription of the endogenous genes copies. Other details are as in Figure\u00a01.So far spt4\u0394 mutants have shown identical transcription defects to those described previously for mutants of the THO complex. In addition, the bacterial lacZ ORF is a 3\u00a0kb long sequence with a 56% GC content, whereas PHO5 is a 1.5\u00a0kb long DNA sequence with a 40% GC content. We showed that lacZ sequences were not properly transcribed in an hpr1\u0394 mutant because these mutants were impaired in their ability to express long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoter (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). Consequently, in order to determine whether the inability of spt4\u0394 cells to express lacZ reflects their incapacity to properly express long and GC-rich DNA sequences, we extended the kinetic analysis of transcription activation of spt4\u0394 cells to the following three fusion constructs: GAL1p::klLAC4, GAL1p::LYS2 and GAL1p:: YAT1. The klLAC4 sequence was a 3\u00a0kb long ORF from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, homologous to lacZ but with a typical yeast GC content (40%). LYS2 was a 3.5\u00a0kb long S.cerevisiae DNA sequence with a standard yeast GC content (40%). YAT1 was a 2\u00a0kb long S.cerevisiae ORF with an unusually high GC-content (58%). Kinetics of transcription activation of GAL1p::klLAC4 showed that transcription was also impaired in this construct (Figure\u00a03), presumably due to the fact that klLAC4 was a long ORF (3\u00a0kb). However, in contrast to bacterial lacZ (56% GC content), significant levels of klLAC4 transcript were accumulated after 170\u00a0min of galactose addition. Therefore, lowering the GC content of a 3\u00a0kb long ORF facilitated its transcription in spt4\u0394 cells. Figure\u00a03 shows that spt4\u0394 cells accumulated almost undetectable levels of mRNA from either the GAL1p::LYS2 or the GAL1p::YAT1 constructs after 170\u00a0min of transcription activation by galactose addition. However, spt4\u0394 cells did accumulate PHO5 mRNA (1.5\u00a0kb long with 40% GC content) like wild-type cells. Therefore, these results are consistent with the idea that Spt4 is required for proper transcription of long and GC-rich DNA sequences driven from the GAL1 promoter.Defective transcription elongation in spt4\u0394 WCEsOur functional analysis of transcription in spt4-3 and spt4\u0394 cells indicates that Spt4 may have a positive role in transcription elongation. In order to test this possibility directly, we assayed the ability of spt4\u0394 WCEs to promote transcription elongation in vitro. To accomplish this, we developed an in vitro transcription system based on plasmid pGCYC1-402 in which a hybrid GAL4-CYC1 promoter containing a Gal4-binding site was fused to a 1.88\u00a0kb DNA fragment coding two G-less cassettes separated by 1.4\u00a0kb. The first G-less cassette was right downstream of the promoter and it was 84\u00a0nucleotides (nt) long. The second one was located at 1.48\u00a0kb from the promoter and was 376\u00a0nt long. In this assay, transcription activated by Gal4-VP16\u00a0led to an mRNA, which was then digested with RNase\u00a0T1, an RNase that degrades all G-containing mRNA sequences, leaving the two G-less cassettes intact (Figure\u00a04A and B). The efficiency of transcription elongation was determined as the percentage of all mRNAs reaching the 376\u00a0nt long G-less cassette among the total mRNA covering the 87\u00a0nt long G-less cassette (Figure\u00a04C). As can be seen in Figure\u00a04C, after Gal4-VP16 activation, spt4\u0394 cell extracts fully transcribed the 376\u00a0nt G-less cassette with a clearly reduced efficiency with respect to the wild type, as determined by kinetic analysis of transcription elongation. This is the first molecular demonstration that Spt4 has a positive role in transcription elongation.Open in a separate windowFig. 4. In vitro transcription assays of wild-type and spt4\u0394 WCEs.

Reactions were stopped at 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40\u00a0min, treated with 160\u00a0U of RNaseT1 and run in a 6% PAGE. Two bands from each G-less cassette were obtained probably due to incomplete action of RNase\u00a0T1. (C)\u00a0Percentage of total transcripts that reach the 376\u00a0bp G-less cassette in both wild-type and spt4\u0394 cells with respect to the transcripts that cover the 84\u00a0bp cassette, taken as 100%. Each result is the mean value of two independent in vitro transcription assays. Radioactivity incorporated into the G-less cassettes was quantified in a Fuji FLA3000 and normalized with respect to the C content of each G-less cassette.Genetic interaction between Spt4 and the THO complexConsidering the similarity of in vivo transcription phenotypes conferred by spt4\u0394 and by the mutations of the THO complex, we decided to investigate whether there was a genetic relationship between these mutations by performing genetic analyses of double mutant combinations. With this purpose, we crossed a spt4\u0394 strain with single mutants of the THO complex (tho2\u0394, hpr1\u0394 and mft1\u0394) and performed tetrad analysis. Figure\u00a05 shows that tho2\u0394 spt4\u0394 and hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutants were inviable (hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 divided 5\u201310 times after germination). We show that the inviability of spt4\u0394 hpr1\u0394 mutants is, indeed, rescued by HPR1 carried in a plasmid. The mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutant was viable but sick; it grew poorly compared with single mutants (Figure\u00a05). However, this result was dependent on genetic background. When we repeated the same experiments in the BY4741 instead of the W303 genetic background, we found that double mutants were viable. This result is consistent with our previous observation that Tho2 and Hpr1 are the most prominent components of the THO complex (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2000).Open in a separate windowFig. 5. Genetic analysis of the growth phenotype conferred by spt4\u0394 in combination with mutations of the THO complex. Tetrad analyses of the diploid strains obtained by crossing spt4\u0394 strain with either tho2\u0394, hpr1\u0394 and mft1\u0394 null mutants are shown in the W303 genetic background. Whereas tho2\u0394 spt4\u0394 and hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 were synthetically lethal (double-mutant spores were able to germinate but died after several divisions), mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 were able to grow. hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double-mutant spores were rescued by the YEpHPR1 plasmid containing a wild-type HPR1 copy. The THO null mutations, which contained the KAN cassette, were scored by G418 resistance and the spt4\u0394::URA3 by the Ura+ phenotype. Double-mutant spores are indicated with circles.As the most relevant features of the THO mutants were the transcription, hyper-recombination and plasmid-loss phenotypes, we took advantage of the viability of mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 cells in the isogenic W303 genetic background to explore further the functional relationship between Spt4 and THO by analyzing these three phenotypes. We analyzed the effect on transcription by determining the kinetics of activation of the endogenous GAL1 gene. As can be seen in Figure\u00a06, both wild-type and mft1\u0394 cells had almost no effect on the kinetics of activation of GAL1. However, spt4\u0394 cells clearly showed slower kinetics of activation of GAL1 mRNA accumulation, whereas the mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutant showed about half that of spt4\u0394.Open in a separate windowFig. 6.

Northern blot analyses of GAL1 mRNA in the strains W303-1A (WT), MGSC339 (spt4\u0394), WMS-1C (mft1\u0394) and WMS-7C (spt4\u0394 mft1\u0394). DNA probes used were the 750-bp AvaI\u2013PvuII fragment of GAL1 and a 589\u00a0bp 28S rDNA internal fragment obtained by PCR. Other details are as in Figure\u00a01.For the analysis of recombination, we first observed that spt4\u0394 had wild-type levels of recombination in the chromosomal direct-repeat construct leu2-k::ADE2-URA3::leu2-k (data not shown), a system in which mft1\u0394 and other mutations of the THO complex conferred an increase in deletions two orders of magnitude above wild-type levels (Piruat and Aguilera, 1998). We then analyzed recombination in the direct-repeat construct leu2\u03943\u2032:: ADE2::leu2\u03945\u2032 in centromeric plasmid pRS314-LA (Prado et al., 1997). As can be seen in Figure\u00a07A, mft1\u0394 and spt4\u0394 single mutants showed 4- and 6-fold increases in recombination, respectively, whereas the mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutant showed a 25-fold increase.Open in a separate windowFig. 7.

The frequency of colonies that have retained the plasmid were determined as the number of colonies growing in SC-his.Plasmid stability was analyzed for centromeric plasmid pRS313GZ containing the GAL4-CYC1p::lacZ fusion and the HIS3 marker. As shown in Figure\u00a07B, when transcription of lacZ was inactive, mft1\u0394 reduced the stability of the plasmid 3.7-fold below wild-type levels, spt4\u0394 1.3-fold and the double mutant 13.5-fold. When transcription of lacZ was active, the reduction was 82-fold for mft1\u0394 cells, 0.6-fold in spt4\u0394 and 245-fold in the mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutant as compared with the wild type. DiscussionWe have shown that Spt4 has a positive role in transcription elongation. The ability of spt4\u0394 cell extracts to elongate transcription in vitro is clearly reduced with respect to the wild type. Furthermore, spt4 and spt5 cells are impaired in transcription of lacZ and other long and GC-rich DNA sequences driven from the GAL1 promoter. There is a genetic interaction between Spt4 and THO, detected in the W303 genetic background by the lethality of tho2\u0394 spt4\u0394 and hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutants, and by a stronger transcription and hyper-recombination phenotypes of the mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 double mutant. These results are consistent with the idea that Spt4\u2013Spt5 has a positive role in transcription elongation and that Spt4 and THO act at different levels during mRNA biogenesis.Spt4 forms, together with Spt5, the yeast homolog of DSIF, a human factor whose negative role in transcription elongation has been well documented. In vitro it is required, together with NELF, for RNAPII pausing (Wada et al., 1998a; Yamaguchi et al., 1999a; Renner et al., 2001). DSIF has been found tightly bound to hypo-phosphorylated RNAPII in HeLa nuclear extracts (Wada et al., 1998a; Yamaguchi et al., 1999b) as well as to hyper-phosphorylated RNAPII (Lindstrom and Hartzog, 2001). Consistent with a negative role at the early steps of transcription elongation, DSIF has been shown to inhibit only hypo-phosphorylated RNAPII (Yamaguchi et al., 1999a). It has been suggested that DSIF dissociates from RNAPII upon CTD phosphorylation by P-TEFb (Wada et al., 1998b). However, there are data suggesting that Spt4\u2013Spt5/DSIF may have a positive role in elongation also. These data include the 6-AU sensitivity of yeast spt4\u0394 mutants (Hartzog et al., 1998; Costa and Arndt, 2000) and the stimulation of in vitro transcription by DSIF or under limiting NTPs (Wada et al., 1998a) or when purified DSIF was added in excess to early elongation complexes (Renner et al., 2001). Here we demonstrate, with a newly developed in vitro transcription assay, that Spt4 plays a positive role in transcription elongation. The spt4\u0394 null mutation reduces the efficiency of elongation at least 4-fold below wild-type levels (Figure\u00a04). This result is consistent with our observation that spt4\u0394 cells are impaired in their ability to transcribe lacZ in vivo, regardless of the promoter from which transcription is driven, or in their ability to transcribe long and GC-rich DNA sequences (Figures\u00a02 and \u200band3).3). The spt5-194 and spt5-242 alleles reduced the efficiency of transcription of Ptet::lacZ-URA3 to levels similar to those of spt4\u0394 (Figure\u00a02B). This positive role in transcription elongation is consistent with recent data showing that in an HIV-Tat based system, Spt5, in cooperation with Tat, prevents the premature dissociation of RNA from the transcription complex at terminator sequences and reduces the amount of RNAPII pausing at arrest sites (Bourgeois et al., 2002). This function resembles that of bacterial NusG, which contacts and enhances RNA polymerase stability on DNA templates (Li et al., 1992; Sullivan and Gottesman, 1992) and has a region homologous to Spt5 (Hartzog et al., 1998; Wada et al., 1998a; Ponting, 2002).Mutants of the THO complex, such as hpr1 and tho2, show a similar incapacity to express long and GC-rich DNA sequences fused to the GAL1 promoter (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). Indeed, it has recently been shown by ChIP analysis that Spt5 and Tho2/Hpr1 associate with transcriptionally active ORFs (Andrulis et al., 2000; Pokholok et al., 2002; Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002). These results suggest that both Spt4\u2013Spt5/DSIF and THO act during transcription. This is consistent with the isolation of Hpr1 and Spt4\u2013Spt5 in combination with components of the Paf1\u2013Cdc73 complex associated with RNAPII (Chang et al., 1999; Squazzo et al., 2002).It is important to note that THO is associated with the mRNA export proteins Sub2 and Yra1 in a larger complex (Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002), that THO associates with RNA and that THO mutants accumulates mRNA in the nucleus (Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002; Jimeno et al., 2002). This, together with the synthetic lethality of double mutants of THO and Mex67, indicates that THO may function at the level of the nascent mRNA. However, in contrast to THO mutants, spt4 cells do not accumulate mRNA in the nucleus (data not shown) and, in contrast to tho2 mex67-5 mutants, spt4 mex67-5 double mutants are viable (S.Jimeno and A.Aguilera, unpublished data). The synthetic lethality of hpr1 spt4 and tho2 spt4, the high genetic instability phenotype of mft1\u0394 spt4\u0394 (Figure\u00a07) and the fact that the observed hyper-recombination in spt4\u0394 cells is not linked to transcription (data not shown; Malag\u00f3n and Aguilera, 1996) suggests that THO and Spt4 act at different levels.A distinctive feature of lacZ with respect to yeast ORFs such as GAL1, through which transcription is either poorly or not affected in hpr1\u0394, is a lack of nucleosome positioning (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). It is possible that the Spt4\u2013Spt5 function was more acute during transcription of DNA sequences with a poorly organized chromatin. However, it is important to note that the positive role of Spt4 in transcription elongation is observed in vitro with naked DNA (Figure\u00a04). This indicates that the major function of Spt4 in elongation is independent of chromatin structure. Nevertheless, we cannot discard that, in addition, Spt4 might have in vivo a positive role in transcription elongation related to chromatin structure (see Winston and Carlson, 1992). In this sense, it is worth mentioning that spt4\u0394 strains transcribe a HTA1-lacZ fusion with an efficiency 5-fold below wild-type levels, a defect that is suppressed by overexpression of histones H2A and H2B (Compagnone-Post and Osley, 1996). This may be due to a defect in the regulation and feedback repression of histone genes in spt4 mutants (Compagnone-Post and Osley, 1996), but it could also be due to the inefficient lacZ transcription of spt4 mutants or to the effect that histone imbalance may cause on the nucleosome assembly. In any case, since imbalance of histone stoichiometry alters transcription of a number of yeast genes (Wyrick et al., 1999), we cannot disregard that phenotypes associated with histone imbalance are due to the secondary effect on transcription regulation of other genes.We believe that Spt4 acts upstream of the THO complex during transcription as a bona fide transcription elongation factor. The THO complex might act downstream of Spt4\u2013Spt5 in association with the nascent mRNA and other proteins whose specific functions are related to mRNA metabolism (Str\u00e4sser et al., 2002; Jimeno et al., 2002). It is likely that the effect of THO mutations in transcription is mediated by a possible role in the stabilization or processing of the nascent mRNA (Jimeno et al., 2002). We need to understand better the molecular basis of the requirement of Spt4\u2013Spt5 for expression of DNA sequences such as lacZ in order to decipher why the effect of Spt4\u2013Spt5 on lacZ expression differs from those of other putative elongation factors (Figure\u00a01). However, our novel in vitro transcription analysis demonstrates for the first time that Spt4\u2013Spt5 plays a positive role in transcription elongation, which might explain the lacZ expression defects of spt4 and spt5 cells. Materials and methodsYeast strains and plasmidsYeast strains used are listed in Table\u00a0I. Plasmids used for expression analyses were p416GAL1lacZ (Mumberg et al., 1994), pSCh202 and pSCh204 (Ch\u00e1vez and Aguilera, 1997), pSCh255, pSCh227 and pSCh247 (Ch\u00e1vez et al., 2001). pRS314-LA (Prado et al., 1997) and pRS313GZ (P.Huertas, unpublished data) were used to determine recombination frequencies and plasmid stability, respectively. The latter plasmid contains the lacZ fusion under GAL4-CYC1 hybrid promoter cloned in vivo from pSEZT (J.Svejstrup, Cancer Research UK, South Mimms, UK) into pRS313 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) as described previously (Prado and Aguilera, 1994). YEpHPR1 used to rescue hpr1\u0394 spt4\u0394 derives from YEp13. Plasmid pRJRGAL4-VP16 (M.Ptashne, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY) was used to purify the His6-tagged Gal4-VP16 recombinant protein from E.coli. For in vitro transcription, we constructed plasmid pGCYC1-402, which contains double-G-less cassettes of 84 and 376\u00a0bp separated by 1.4\u00a0kb fused to a GAL4-CYC1 hybrid promoter. For the construction of this plasmid, the 300\u00a0bp GAL4-CYC1 promoter was obtained by PCR from pGAL4CG (Lue et al., 1989) using primers CTAGAGGATCCGGGTGACAGCCCTCCG and CGA TACATCGATAGGAGACTAGGGTGGTATAG and cloned into the SmaI site of pBSK+ to give pGCYC1. The new plasmid was then used to clone at the ClaI site generated at the 3\u2032-end of the promoter, the double-G-less cassette system obtained by PCR from pSLG402 (Lee and Greenleaf, 1997) using primers CATGAAATCGATGGGTGTTCCTGAAGGGGGGC and GCAGGCCTAATCGATTCTAGAGGATCCCCG.Table I.StrainsStrainGenotypeSource/ReferenceW303-1AMATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15\u00a0leu2-3, 112\u00a0trp1-1 ura3-1R.RothsteinSChY58aMATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15\u00a0leu2-3, 112\u00a0trp1-1 ura3-1 hpr1\u0394::kanMX4S.Ch\u00e1vezRK2-6CMATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15\u00a0leu2-3, 112\u00a0trp1-1 ura3-1 tho2\u0394::kanMX4Piruat and Aguilera (1998)WMK-2AMATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3, 112\u00a0trp1-1 ura3-1 mft1\u0394::kanMX4Ch\u00e1vez et al.

DNA filters were hybridized first with 32P-labelled DNA probes as specified. For determination of the total amount of RNA used, filters were stripped and re-hybridized with 32P-labelled 28S rDNA obtained by PCR as described previously (Ch\u00e1vez and Aguilera, 1997).Frequency of recombination and plasmid stabilityFor the determination of the recombination frequencies, six independent colonies were obtained from SC-trp and recombinants were scored as Leu+ colonies on SC-trp-leu. Recombination frequencies were calculated as the median frequency of six independent cultures as described previously (Prado and Aguilera, 1995). Plasmid stability was determined as the median frequency of plasmid-containing cells (His+ colonies) from a total of six independent colonies isolated from non-selective synthetic complete medium, as described previously (Piruat and Aguilera, 1998). Each recombination frequency value represents the mean of two independent experiments.Preparation of yeast WCEsYeast cells were grown in rich medium YEPD at 30\u00b0C to an OD600 of 1. WCEs were prepared essentially as described in Schultz et al. (1991), with the exception that the extraction buffer and precipitation and dialysis were performed as described by Woontner et al. (1991). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The final protein concentrations of the WCEs varied from 30 to 40\u00a0mg/ml. WCEs were distributed in aliquots and stored in liquid nitrogen. They were stable after repeated cycles of freezing and thawing.In vitro transcriptionEach reaction was performed in a final volume of 20\u00a0\u00b5l of buffer\u00a0A 0.5 (20\u00a0mM HEPES pH\u00a07.5, 20% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT and 500\u00a0mM KAc) with 100\u00a0\u00b5g of WCE (3\u00a0\u00b5l) and 100\u00a0ng of Gal4-VP16 purified as described by Cho et al. (1997) and dialyzed in buffer\u00a0A 0.05 (as A 0.5 but with 50\u00a0mM KAc). Final KAc concentration should be lower than 150\u00a0mM. The reaction was set up adding 20\u00a0\u00b5l of transcription buffer 2\u00d7 [final concentration: 40\u00a0mM HEPES\u2013KOH pH\u00a07.5, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1\u00a0mM ATP, 1\u00a0mM GTP, 0.5\u00a0mM UTP, 0.03\u00a0mM CTP, 40\u00a0mM phosphocreatine, 32\u00a0\u00b5g of creatine kinase (CK), 5\u00a0mM dithiothreitol and 7.5\u00a0U of the RNase inhibitor RNAguard (Amersham)]. After 20\u00a0min of pre-incubation at room temperature 400\u00a0ng of pGCYC402 and 1\u00a0\u00b5l [\u03b1-32P]CTP (3000\u00a0Ci/mmol) were added. The reaction was stopped at the indicated times by addition of 200\u00a0\u00b5l of stop buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH7.5, 0.3\u00a0M NaCl and 5\u00a0mM EDTA) and 160\u00a0U RNaseT1 for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Samples were treated with proteinase K, phenol-extracted and run in a sequencing gel as described in Sayre et al. (1992). The amount of radiactivity incorporated was quantified with a Fuji FLA3000.MiscellaneousDNA isolation, 32P-radiolabeling, genetic crosses and yeast transformations were performed according to standard procedures (Prado and Aguilera, 1995).
