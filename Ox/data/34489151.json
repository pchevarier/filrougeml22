DoGs arise from around 10% of human protein-coding genes and are retained in the nucleus. They are produced minutes after cell exposure to stress and can be detected hours after stress removal. However, their biogenesis and the role(s) that DoGs or their production play in the cellular stress response are incompletely understood. We discuss findings that implicate host and viral proteins in the mechanisms underlying DoG production, as well as the transcriptional landscapes that accompany DoG induction under different stress conditions.", "author": [{"author": "Nicolle A Rosa-Mercado", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."], "href": "/?term=Rosa-Mercado+NA&cauthor_id=34489151"}, {"author": "Joan A Steitz", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.
