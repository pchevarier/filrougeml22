Considerable variability exists among studies evaluating clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with outcomes.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Although some variation may be driven by case ascertainment bias, underlying differences in demographics, socioeconomics, access to care, and clinical characteristics across countries likely drive true differences in prevalence of disease and risk for mortality. With the first case in the United States identified in Washington State, the greater Seattle area was the initial epicenter for transmission in the country.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n In this case series, we describe clinical characteristics, interventions including palliative care consultation, and risk factors associated with COVID\u201019 among the initial hospitalized cases at three major hospitals in Seattle. We focus on palliative care involvement as a crucial component of the pandemic response, including a description of the effect of our system\u2010wide Palliative Care Response Plan in the COVID\u201019 pandemic, while highlighting the importance of goal\u2010concordant care. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Study designSymptomatic, non\u2010pregnant adult patients (age\u2009\u226518\u2009years) with laboratory\u2010confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 admitted consecutively three University of Washington (UW) hospitals (UW Medical Center \u2013 Montlake, UW Medical Center \u2013 Northwest, and Harborview Medical Center) between February 24 and March 30, 2020 were included. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Washington (STUDY00009893). Diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was performed in the clinical virology laboratory of UW by detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA with real\u2010time PCR. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and COVID\u201019\u2010specific treatment and outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records by manual chart review.2.2. Patient and public involvementPatients were not involved in the development of the study design.2.3. DefinitionsPatients admitted from congregate living resided at a skilled nursing facility (SNF), a long\u2010term care facility (LTAC), or an assisted\u2010living facility (ALF). Timing of symptom onset was estimated from chart review. Fever was defined as a core temperature\u2009\u226538\u00b0C. Hypoxemia was defined as SaO2\u2009<90% on presentation or\u2009<88% in patients with chronic lung disease, or new requirement of supplemental O2. Tachycardia was defined as a heart rate\u2009of \u2265100 beats per minute. Tachypnea was defined as a respiratory rate\u2009of \u226520 respirations per minute. Immunosuppression was defined as a history of solid organ or bone marrow transplant, immunodeficiency, hematologic malignancy, active chemotherapy, neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500 \u00d7\u2009109/L), or the use of biologic agents for immunosuppression or corticosteroid equivalent >20\u2009mg/day of prednisone. Malignancy included active cancer, excluding non\u2010melanoma skin cancers. Cardiovascular disease was defined as hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or a history of cerebrovascular accident. Dementia was included as a comorbidity in those with a diagnosis of dementia in their medical chart. Leukocytosis was defined as a leukocyte count \u226510.0 \u00d7\u2009109/L; neutrophilia as neutrophil count >7.0 \u00d7\u2009109/L; and lymphopenia as lymphocyte count <1.0 \u00d7\u2009109/L. Acute myocardial injury was defined as troponin\u2010I above the 99th percentile of the institutional upper reference limit for normal, regardless of new onset abnormalities on electrocardiography or echocardiography. Arrhythmias were sub\u2010classified as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation persisting for more than 30\u2009seconds, as documented in the medical record or a 12\u2010lead electrocardiogram. Cardiomyopathy was defined as newly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of <50% on transthoracic echocardiography by biplane Simpson's method. The Berlin criteria were used to define acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n10\n Shock was defined by the use of supportive interventions to maintain arterial blood pressure.2.4. Statistical analysisContinuous variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), and categorical variables as counts and percentages. Among patients with known outcomes of death or discharge, we compared between\u2010group differences using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables and Pearson's Chi\u2010squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Univariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and death. For risk of ICU admission and IMV, the entire sample was included in these models since these events tended to occur early in the hospital course. For risk of death, the sample was restricted to patients with a definitive outcome of discharge or death. A two\u2010sided P\u2010value \u2264.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.1 (Stata Corp.,Texas). 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristicsAmong the 100 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019, the mean age was 67\u2009years (IQR 54\u201078) and 55% were male. Cough (76%), fever (60%), and dyspnea (60%) were the most common presenting symptoms (Figure\u00a0S1). Of the 100 patients, 85 (85%) had at least one coexisting medical condition, with cardiovascular disease (66%), hypertension (54%), diabetes mellitus (37%), and obesity with BMI \u226535 (31%) being the most common (Table\u00a01).TABLE 1Patient demographics and clinical data by outcomeTotal N\u00a0=\u00a0100 No. (%)Remain inpatient N\u00a0=\u00a08 No. (%)Discharged N\u00a0=\u00a058 No. (%)Died N\u00a0=\u00a034 No. (%)\nP\u2010value\na\n\nAge group (years)20\u20104915 (15.0)2 (25.0)10 (17.2)3 (8.8).03050\u20106429 (29.0)2 (25.0)22 (37.9)5 (14.7)65\u20107936 (36.0)3 (37.5)16 (27.6)17 (50.0)80\u20109720 (20.0)1 (12.5)10 (17.2)9 (26.5)SexFemale45 (45.0)4 (50.0)29 (50.0)12 (35.3).17Male55 (55.0)4 (50.0)29 (50.0)22 (64.7).17HousingCongregate living facility28 (28.0)0 (0.0)10 (17.2)18 (52.9)<.001ComorbiditiesCardiovascular disease\nb\n\n66 (66.0)6 (75.0)37 (63.8)23 (67.6).71Hypertension54 (54.0)6 (75.0)31 (53.4)17 (50.0).75CHF20 (20.0)1 (12.5)11 (19.0)8 (23.5).60CVA17 (17.0)2 (25.0)8 (13.8)7 (20.6).39CAD12 (12.0)0 (0.0)5 (8.6)7 (20.6).12Diabetes mellitus37 (37.0)3 (37.5)22 (37.9)12 (35.3).80Obesity (BMI \u2265\u200935)31 (31.0)2 (25.0)19 (33.3)10 (32.3).92Chronic kidney disease21 (21.0)0 (0.0)10 (17.2)11 (324).10Obstructive lung disease19 (19.0)0 (0.0)10 (17.2)9 (26.5).29Immunosuppression18 (18.0)0 (0.0)12 (20.7)6 (17.6).72Dementia14 (14.0)0 (0.0)4 (6.9)10 (29.4).006Presenting vital sign abnormalities\nc\n\nHypoxemia64 (64.0)4 (50.0)30 (51.7)30 (88.2)<.001Tachypnea59 (59.0)5 (62.5)29 (50.0)25 (73.5).027Fever33 (33.3)2 (25.0)18 (31.6)13 (38.2).52Tachycardia32 (32.0)3 (37.5)17 (29.3)12 (35.3).55Oxygen delivery methodNasal cannula79 (79.0)5 (62.5)45 (77.6)29 (85.3).37High\u2010flow nasal cannula21 (21.0)3 (37.5)10 (17.2)8 (23.5).59Invasive mechanical ventilation22 (22.0)5 (62.5)7 (12.1)10 (29.4).05Proning8 (8.0)4 (50.0)2 (3.4)2 (5.9).62ComplicationsARDS26 (26.0)4 (50.0)8 (13.8)14 (41.2).005Shock19 (19.0)3 (37.5)5 (8.6)11 (32.4).008Arrhythmia18 (18.0)1 (12.5)7 (12.1)10 (29.4).05Cardiomyopathy3 (3.0)1 (12.5)0 (0.00)2 (5.9).13Hospital unit or serviceIntensive care unit41 (41.0)5 (62.5)19 (32.8)17 (50.0).10Acute care unit59 (59.0)3 (37.5)39 (67.2)17 (50.0).10Open in a separate window\nNote: Data are presented as N (percent) for categorical variables.

Hospital admission and length of stayFifty\u2010eight percent of patients recovered to discharge, 8% remained hospitalized, and 34% died. Fifty\u2010nine percent were treated in the acute care ward alone and 41% in the intensive care unit (ICU) (Table\u00a01). Discharged patients had significantly longer time between symptom onset and admission compared to patients who died (7\u2009days vs 3\u2009days, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The average length of stay was 11\u2009days in discharged patients and 7.5\u2009days in non\u2010survivors. Each patient was followed through his or her admission or at least 22\u2009days if still hospitalized at time of data censoring.3.3. ComorbiditiesOlder patients were more likely to die than be discharged, with the age groups 65 to 79\u2009years and 80 to 97\u2009years having odds of death of 4.7 [95% CI 1.4, 15.3] and 4.0 [1.1, 14.9], respectively, compared to those 50 to 64\u2009years old (Table\u00a02, Figure\u00a01). Older age was associated with decreased odds of ICU admission, with ORs of 0.27 [0.1, 0.77] and 0.18 [0.05, 0.66], respectively, for age groups 65 to 79\u2009years and 80 to 97\u2009years compared to those 50 to 64\u2009years (Table\u00a02, Figure\u00a01). Dementia was associated with increased morality (OR 5.62 [1.60, 19.74]), and patients with dementia were less likely to be admitted to the ICU (OR 0.20 [0.04, 0.95]) (Table\u00a02). Patients who were admitted from a congregate living facility were significantly less likely to be admitted to the ICU (OR 0.16 [0.05, 0.50]) or be intubated (OR 0.09 [0.01, 0.71]). Congregate living was associated with fivefold increased odds of death (OR 5.40 [2.07, 14.07]).TABLE 2Odds of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and deathICU admissionInvasive mechanical ventilationDeathOR\na\n [95% CI]OR [95% CI]OR [95% CI]Age (years)20\u2010491.41 [0.38, 5.20]1.31 [0.34, 5.05]1.32 [0.26, 6.64]50\u201064ReferenceReferenceReference65\u2010790.27* [0.10, 0.77]0.75 [0.24, 2.33]4.67* [1.43, 15.32]80\u2010970.18* [0.05, 0.66]0.14 [0.02, 1.21]3.96* [1.05, 14.89]SexFemaleReferenceReferenceReferenceMale1.79 [0.79, 4.05]2.67 [0.94, 7.53]1.83 [0.77, 4.38]HousingCongregate living facility0.16** [0.05, 0.50]0.09* [0.01, 0.71]5.40*** [2.07, 14.07]ComorbiditiesCardiovascular disease0.48 [0.20, 1.10]0.42 [0.16, 1.10]1.19 [0.48, 2.91]Diabetes mellitus1.97 [0.86, 4.50]1.24 [0.47, 3.25]0.89 [0.37, 2.15]Obesity (BMI \u226535)2.71* [1.12, 6.52]3.47* [1.29, 9.33]0.95 [0.37, 2.42]Chronic kidney disease0.86 [0.32, 2.30]0.53 [0.14, 1.98]2.30 [0.85, 6.18]Obstructive lung disease0.21* [0.06, 0.78]0.61 [0.16, 2.33]1.73 [0.62, 4.80]Dementia0.20* [0.04, 0.95]1.00 [1.00, 1.00]5.62** [1.60,19.74]Presenting vital sign abnormalities\nb\n\nHypoxemia3.73**[1.48, 9.41]3.13 [0.97, 10.12]7.00** [2.19, 22.41]Tachypnea3.43** [1.43, 8.25]2.91 [0.98, 8.69]2.78* [1.11, 6.97]Fever1.54 [0.66, 3.59]0.92 [0.33, 2.52]1.34 [0.55, 3.26]Tachycardia2.08 [0.88,4.88]1.29 [0.48, 3.47]1.32 [0.53, 3.24]Laboratory abnormalities on admissionLeukocytosis16.15*** [3.44, 75.88]17.28*** [5.02, 59.43]10.48*** [2.69, 40.87]Neutrophilia3.68** [1.47, 9.23]5.87*** [2.12, 16.30]2.76* [1.08, 7.07]Lymphopenia1.00 [0.44, 2.24]0.81 [0.31, 2.10]2.00 [0.82, 4.86]Troponin\u2010I\u2009\u2265\u20090.04\u2009ng/mL1.29 [0.43, 3.88]1.97 [0.59, 6.53]2.33 [0.71, 7.65]Elevated liver function tests\nc\n\n1.71 [0.74, 3.96]2.35 [0.89, 6.18]0.89 [0.35, 2.25]Elevated venous lactate\nd\n\n0.83 [0.24, 2.90]1.48 [0.33, 6.70]4.93* [1.21, 20.16]Open in a separate window\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index (kg/m2); ICU, intensive care unit; IMV, invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\na\n\nStatistical significance: *\u00a0P \u2264 .05; ** P\u2009\u2264 .01; ***P\u2009\u2264\u2009.001 based on univariate logistic regression.\n\nb\n\nHypoxemia, \u226490% on pulse oximetry or newly requiring supplemental oxygen; tachypnea, respiratory rate\u2009\u226520 breaths per minute; fever, oral, or temporal temperature\u2009\u226538\u00b0C; tachycardia, heart rate\u2009\u2265100 beats per minute.\n\nc\n\nAspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase greater than upper limit of normal.\n\nd\n\nVenous lactate greater than upper limit of normal.\nOpen in a separate windowFIGURE 1Relationship between mortality and ICU admission by age group.

Vital signs and end\u2010organ dysfunctionHypoxemia and tachypnea were present in 64% and 59% of patients, respectively (Table\u00a01). Hypoxemia on presentation was associated with increased odds of ICU admission (OR 3.72 [1.48, 9.41]) and death (OR 7.00 [2.19, 22.41]) (Table\u00a02). Tachypnea on presentation was associated with increased odds of ICU admission (OR 3.43 [1.43, 8.25]) and death (OR 2.78 [1.11, 6.97]) (Table\u00a02). Eighty\u2010six percent of patients required oxygen therapy during admission. Most patients (79%) were placed on nasal cannula, 20% received high\u2010flow nasal cannula, and 22% required intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) (Table\u00a01). Abnormal chest image was common (90%) on presentation, with bilateral patchy opacities (73%) being the most common finding (Table\u00a0S1).The most common complications were ARDS (26%), shock (19%), and cardiac arrhythmia (18%) (Table\u00a01). The frequency of complications was significantly higher in patients who died compared to patients discharged. Forty\u2010one percent of deceased patients developed ARDS compared to 13.8% of discharged patients (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). A higher proportion of deceased patients developed shock requiring vasopressor support compared to discharged patients (32.4% vs 8.6%, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Cardiac arrhythmia was observed in 18% of all patients and was more commonly seen in patients who died (29.4% vs 10.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.052). Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia (58.8%) (Table\u00a01).3.5. Profile of laboratory abnormalitiesSeventeen percent of patients presented with leukocytosis, primarily neutrophil\u2010predominant, which was associated with significantly increased risk of ICU admission (OR 16.15 [3.44, 75.88]), IMV (OR 17.28 [5.02, 59.43]), and death (OR 10.48 [2.69, 40.87]). Lymphopenia was common on admission (58.6%) but not associated with severe disease or death. Elevated D\u2010dimer and elevated lactate were significantly associated with death (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.024, respectively). Higher peak troponin\u2010I and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels during hospitalization were significantly associated with death (P\u2009<\u2009.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.004, respectively) (Table\u00a0S1).3.6. Resuscitation status and palliative careA formal palliative care consultation was documented in 46% of all patients, 67.6% of those who died, and 31% of those who survived to discharge (Table\u00a03). Similar percentages of patients in the ICU and acute care settings had palliative care consultations. The Palliative Care Response Plan service was most frequently consulted by patients aged 65 to 79\u2009years (69%), followed by patients aged 50 to 64\u2009years (41%). A quarter of patients aged 20 to 49\u2009years and 80 to 97\u2009years had a formal palliative care consultation. Overall, 33% of patients changed their code status during hospitalization, from Full Code to Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Intubate (DNI), or DNR/Intubation OK. Of those seen by a palliative care consultant, 56% changed their code status, and of those who died, 59% had their code status changed prior to death. In contrast, only 16% of patients who survived to discharge changed their code status.TABLE 3Formal palliative care consultationTotal N\u00a0=\u00a0100 No. (%)Remain inpatient N\u00a0=\u00a08 No. (%)Discharged N\u00a0=\u00a058 No. (%)Died N\u00a0=\u00a034 No. (%)\nP\u2010valueFormal palliative care consult46 (46.0)5 (62.5)18 (31.0)23 (67.6)<.001\na\n\nCode status change\nb\n\n33 (33.0)4 (50.0)9 (15.5)20 (58.8)<.001\na\n\nPalliative care consult\nc\n\n25 (75.7)3 (75.0)8 (88.9)14 (70.0)No palliative care consult\nc\n\n8 (24.3)1 (25.0)1 (11.1)6 (30.0)<.001\nd\n\nOpen in a separate windowFormal palliative care consult by age (years)20\u201049 N\u00a0=\u00a015 No. (%)50\u201064 N\u00a0=\u00a029 No. (%)65\u201079 N\u00a0=\u00a036 No. (%)80\u201097 N\u00a0=\u00a020 No. (%)4 (26.6)12 (41.4)25 (69.4)5 (25.0)NSOpen in a separate window\nAbbreviation: NS, not significant.\n\na\n\nP\u2010values compare discharged and died groups only.

Medical therapiesFifty\u2010two percent of patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine and 51% received azithromycin, typically as part of empirical bacterial community\u2010acquired pneumonia treatment. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin was not associated with death. There was no association between the incidence of arrhythmia and hydroxychloroquine (data not shown). Seventeen percent of patients received tocilizumab, three patients received remdesivir for compassionate use, and an additional 25 patients were enrolled in a randomized, double\u2010blinded, placebo\u2010controlled trial of remdesivir vs placebo with a 1:1 randomization scheme ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04280705\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04280705\"}}NCT04280705). No medication treatment was associated with either discharge or death (Table S2). No patients received corticosteroids as treatment for COVID\u201019 infection during this early phase of the pandemic. 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors associated with ICU admission, IMV, and mortality among 100 consecutive patients with documented COVID\u201019 admitted to three hospitals in Seattle. The overall in\u2010hospital mortality rate in these patients was 34%, which is comparable to that in studies of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China\n11\n, \n12\n as well as a recent case series from New York City.\n13\n Of the 34 patients who died, the mean age was 72% and 64.7% were male. In contrast to other studies, in our study the time from symptom\u2010onset to admission was significantly shorter among patients who died, while patients requiring the ICU had abrupt deteriorations in respiratory status with subsequent need for IMV, typically 1 day after admission.\n2\n Our findings suggest that patients with poor outcomes have a rapid progression of disease, perhaps due to shorter time from symptom onset to hospitalization, or, alternatively, these patients experienced subtle symptoms early on that went unnoticed.Early case series from China reported fever, cough, and fatigue as the most frequently reported symptoms of COVID\u201019 on presentation.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were reported in <5% of patients.\n4\n Although fever and cough were common among our patients, nausea or vomiting was present in 24% and diarrhea in 29%. This is consistent with more recent studies suggesting that GI symptoms may be underreported.\n14\n, \n15\n Importantly, under\u2010recognition of GI manifestations of COVID\u201019 may lead to delayed diagnoses, increasing the spread from undiagnosed individuals.In our study, dementia was the only comorbidity significantly associated with mortality. With regard to other comorbidities, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were the most common in our patients, which is consistent with a recent report of adult patients with COVID\u201019 in the United States.\n15\n Obesity was shown to be an independent risk factor for death in H1N1 influenza, and higher BMI has been associated with more severe disease and death in COVID\u201019.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n In our study, obesity was a common comorbidity; 47.9% of patients had a BMI \u226530% and 31% of patients had a BMI \u226535 (Table\u00a01). Importantly, BMI \u226535 was associated with an increased risk of both ICU admission and intubation. This association may be due to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases in this population, decreased respiratory reserve, and increased inflammatory cytokines.\n16\n\nCompared to this national cohort, chronic renal disease and immunosuppression were more common among our patients (21% vs 13% and 18% vs 9.6%, respectively). Previous reports from China also reported that hypertension, diabetes, and chronic lung disease were associated with ARDS or death.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n19\n\nIn our study, 40.6% of patients had evidence of myocardial injury during admission. Notably, this is even greater than reported in previous studies, which demonstrated substantial rates of acute myocardial injury in COVID\u201019, ranging from 7.2% to 27.8%.\n3\n, \n12\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n Mechanisms for myocardial injury remain unclear, but proposed pathways include demand ischemia, plaque rupture, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), myocarditis, or stress cardiomyopathy.\n23\n Regardless of the mechanism, in this study, myocardial injury and elevated BNP were associated with mortality. Arrhythmia during hospitalization was observed in 18% of patients. Of those, 58.8% were atrial fibrillation, 23.5% were bradycardia, and 11.8% were ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. The predominance of atrial fibrillation suggests that arrhythmia may be a byproduct of systemic illness and global inflammation.Specific laboratory abnormalities have begun to emerge as prognostic indicators for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections.\n24\n, \n25\n Interestingly, leukocytosis, specifically neutrophilia, was associated with ICU admission, IMV, and mortality. These may be signs of dysregulated inflammatory response as observed in sepsis or evidence of a secondary bacterial infection, contributing to death. An elevated D\u2010dimer was associated with death, which is consistent with the observations of Zhou et al, who reported elevated D\u2010dimer to be an independent risk factor for mortality.\n12\n This may be a marker of inflammation, CRS, venous thromboembolism, and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy\u2014all of which have been proposed as underlying mechanisms driving mortality in COVID\u201019.\n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n\nConsistent with prior reports, older age was associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality. Age above 65\u2009years was associated with increasing odds of death. Those with dementia or admitted from congregate living facilities experienced increased mortality. Importantly, these findings highlight the significant vulnerability of older cohorts to viral pandemics. Following identification of early outbreaks in local congregate living facilities,\n8\n our institution developed a system\u2010wide Palliative Care Response (PCR) plan in anticipation of these high\u2010risk patients. This initiative included daily remote palliative care support for the emergency department (ED), ICU, and acute care services.\n28\n As such, while palliative care was formally consulted in 46% of cases, clinicians had daily access to palliative care consultants to discuss clinical questions regarding most or all patients. The PCR plan focused on identifying and addressing goals of care, including discussions on code status, in an effort to reduce the risk of unwanted or non\u2010beneficial cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n28\nThis plan facilitated early prognosis and goals\u2010of\u2010care discussions with patients at risk for poor outcomes and placement of DNR orders when appropriate. Indeed, a higher percentage of patients who were seen by the palliative care team changed their code status during hospitalization. These results align with a study done in an ED, which found that after systematic implementation of palliative care, most patients chose to forgo mechanical ventilation and/or CPR.\n29\n Importantly, our data suggest that palliative care interventions resulted in the avoidance of ICU admissions and invasive procedures for many elderly patients with chronic comorbid conditions for whom such aggressive or invasive procedures were not consistent with the goals of care (Figure\u00a01). Consequently, patients 65\u2009years or older were less likely to be admitted to the ICU and very few were intubated. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to describe the impact of systematic implementation of palliative care in the inpatient setting to guide appropriate resource utilization and harmonize clinical trajectory with goals of care.Our observations regarding the impact of palliative care contrast with those in other countries, such as China and Italy, where the elderly made up a significant portion of critical care admissions. In Italy, 22.8% of patients admitted to intensive care were over the age of 70% and 72% of those patients received IMV.\n30\n The strong presence of our palliative care consultation service likely accounts for this difference and was instrumental in ensuring the care delivered aligned with the goals and values of our patients. This is particularly salient as our knowledge of the challenges of extubating patients with COVID\u201019 infection evolves. Indeed, more data are emerging on the challenges regarding extubation of COVID\u201019 patients.\n31\n, \n32\n In one study, 88% of those who received mechanical ventilation died.\n13\n\nIn the ongoing response to the COVID\u201019 pandemic, strategies to ensure access to palliative care consultation for patients and clinicians are essential. As clear risk factors for morbidity and mortality such as those detailed in this study, including age, other medical comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities, begin to emerge, these data can be used to identify patients who may benefit from early involvement of palliative care. Early involvement may help identify groups not likely to benefit from aggressive care and minimize misalignment of scarce resource allocation in regions that are heavily burdened by the pandemic. This approach to allocation of resources may help to relieve the strain on the system, particularly ICUs, and appropriately avoid medical futility.This study has several limitations. Similar to any observational study, associations may reflect residual confounding. Complete documentation of presenting symptoms was not obtainable on all patients due to comorbid conditions such as dementia or respiratory distress. Comprehensive laboratory values were not routinely obtained, as laboratory abnormalities associated with COVID\u201019 were unknown early on during the pandemic. Because only 3% of patients in our study required veno\u2010venous extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) and only 4% required renal replacement therapy (RRT), we were unable to reliably evaluate the impact of these clinical interventions on outcome. At the time of data censoring, 8 (8%) patients remained hospitalized. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONIn this case series, 100 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with COVID\u201019 in Seattle, presenting clinical characteristics and laboratory indices associated with more severe disease and mortality, were identified. During the initial stages of the COVID\u201019 pandemic in Seattle, recognition of risk factors associated with poor prognosis, in conjunction with a systematic palliative care response plan, played an important role in the provision of goal\u2010concordant care while maintaining functional resilience, rational utilization of finite medical resources, and sustainability of the healthcare system.The provision of an operational PCR plan will be critical for healthcare systems to respond appropriately and effectively to not only the ongoing COVID\u201019 pandemic but also other pandemics that will arise inevitably in the future.
