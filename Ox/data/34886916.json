Objectives:                       To describe the effect of ECMO rescue therapy on patient-important outcomes in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2.                  Methods:                       A case series study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients who were admitted to the ICUs of 22 Saudi hospitals, between March 1, 2020, and October 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records prospectively.                  Results:                       ECMO use was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (40.2% vs. 48.9%; p = 0.000); lower COVID-19 virological cure (41.3% vs 14.1%, p = 0.000); and longer hospitalization (20.2 days vs 29.1 days; p = 0.000), ICU stay (12.6 vs 26 days; p = 0.000) and mechanical ventilation use (14.2 days vs 22.4 days; p = 0.000) compared to non-ECMO group. Also, there was a high number of patients with septic shock (19.6%) and multiple organ failure (10.9%); and more complications occurred at any time during hospitalization [pneumothorax (5% vs 29.3%, p = 0.000), bleeding requiring blood transfusion (7.1% vs 38%, p = 0.000), pulmonary embolism (6.4% vs 15.2%, p = 0.016), and gastrointestinal bleeding (3.3% vs 8.7%, p = 0.017)] in the ECMO group. However, PaO2 was significantly higher in the 72-h post-ECMO initiation group and PCO2 was significantly lower in the 72-h post-ECMO start group than those in the 12-h pre-ECMO group (62.9 vs. 70 mmHg, p = 0.002 and 61.8 vs. 51 mmHg, p = 0.042, respectively).                  Conclusion:                       Following the use of ECMO, the mortality rate of patients and length of ICU and hospital stay were not improved. However, these findings need to be carefully interpreted, as most of our cohort patients were relatively old and had multiple severe comorbidities.

Studies shown up to 20% of the patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop high disease severity and need to be hospitalized [3, 4]. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is a requirement for up to 26% among those who are hospitalized [5]. Evidence on the efficacy of current interventions like prone ventilation [6], pulmonary vasodilators [7] and neuromuscular blocking agents [8\u201310] for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is limited and based on anecdotal observations and data on outcomes are conflicting. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support device that serves as a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass and was regarded as a rescue therapy in previous H1N1 influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) outbreaks [11\u201313]. However, ECMO is complex and expensive to be delivered; and requires the recruitment of additional specialized healthcare providers with the potential for significant complications, in particular hemorrhage and hospital-acquired infections. Although ECMO has a role in critically ill patients, there is currently inadequate data to determine the efficacy, optimal patient selection and management on ECMO. It is essential that we learn and understand throughout the current pandemic, in order determine the risk\u2013benefit ratio of ECMO in COVID-19. Therefore, observational studies are a reasonable alternative to randomized clinical trials; hence ECMO recruitment in critical COVID-19 patients is difficult and associated with ethical concerns. ObjectivesWe aimed to describe the effect of ECMO rescue therapy on patient-important outcomes in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2. MethodsDesignThis prospective observational study was performed at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, which is the national coordinating center for the Saudi ECMO Program implemented by the Saudi Ministry of Health in April, 2014. All consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, admitted to one of the ICUs among selected 22 hospitals between 1st March and 30th October, 2020, were enrolled.Definitions and ECMO eligibilityCase definitions of confirmed human infection with SARS-Cov-2 were in accordance with the interim guidance from the WHO [14]. Only patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection were enrolled in this study.Guidelines of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) on COVID-19 [15] were used to help prepare and plan provision of ECMO for patients included in this study during the ongoing pandemic. The ECMO group included patients who were admitted to the ICU and on invasive mechanical ventilation, and received ECMO as they met the indications for ECMO initiation.Indications for ECMO initiation were [15]:When PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mmHg for\u2009>\u20096\u00a0h and/orWhen PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u200950\u00a0mmHg for\u2009>\u20093\u00a0h and/orpH\u2009<\u20097.20\u2009+\u2009PaCO2\u2009>\u200980\u00a0mmHg for\u2009>\u20096\u00a0h.ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition [16]. Septic shock was defined as sepsis with circulatory and cellular or metabolic dysfunction associated with a higher risk of mortality. The septic shock definition followed the international guidelines for the management of septic shock: 2018 update [17].We included all patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received ECMO during that period. The control group included patients who were admitted to the ICU and some received invasive mechanical ventilation, but never required ECMO.Weaning from ECMO was primarily based on clinical improvement demonstrated by adequate oxygenation and gas exchange shown in vital signs, blood gases, and chest X-ray.The decision for readiness of a patient to be weaned from ECMO was left to the judgment of treating clinician and the ECMO team. To maintain the highest quality of ECMO management, an ECMO team with 1 physician perfusionist, 1 ICU physician, and 1 pulmonologist, are available at all times to oversee ECMO management, participate in clinical evaluation and treatment, and communicate with the ECMO expert team in KFSH&RC in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for guidance.The weaning process followed the ELSO criteria as follow: tidal volume [VT]\u2009\u2264\u20096\u20138\u00a0ml/kg, PPLAT\u2009\u2264\u200930\u00a0cm H2O, PEEP\u2009\u2264\u200916\u00a0cm H2O, FiO2\u2009\u2264\u20090.5, pH\u2009>\u20097.3, and arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2]\u2009>\u200988% [15]. If gas exchange is adequate for a 2\u20134\u00a0h period, the patient can be decannulated.No exclusion criteria were applied for all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in this study.Main outcome measuresResearch Electronic Data Capture (REDCap); a web-based software tool which allowed researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis; developed by (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) [18], was used to collect required data on all targeted COVID-19 patients by each research coordinator at the participating hospitals under the supervision of the primary investigator intensivist.Variables included patients\u2019 demographics, information on the name of the hospital and patient\u2019s data, co-morbid conditions, signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 illness, chest radiological findings, laboratory abnormalities, and microbiological testing, use of mechanical ventilation, ventilator modes and settings, interventions used to treat refractory hypoxemia (prone ventilation, pulmonary vasodilators and ECMO), indications for ECMO and outcomes at ECMO removal, results of blood gas analyses before and after ECMO, vasoactive support, medications offered to the patient and treatment outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, transferred, died, or discharged) on hospital admission, during patient\u2019s ICU stay and at hospital discharge.Information sources were medical files, electronic health information records and laboratories reports of COVID-19 patients. If data were missing from the records or clarification is needed, data were gathered by direct communication with attending doctors and other health care providers.Patients were stratified based on ECMO use status. Data management and analysisDescriptive statistics were used to describe the data. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were reported. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Chi-square (\u03c72) tests (or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for expected cell count\u2009<\u20095 in more than 20% of the cells). For continuous variables, mean and standard deviation were used to summarize the data and analyses were performed using Student\u2019s t-tests (Mann\u2013Whitney U test if data are not normally distributed). The difference in ventilatory settings, arterial blood gas analyses, and vital signs pre-ECMO, post-ECMO initiation and pre-ECMO removal were examined using the repeated measures analysis of variance\u00a0(ANOVA). An a priori two-tailed level of significance was set at 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).Ethics considerationsThis study obtained approval from the King Fahad Medical City (KACST) [Approval Number Federal Wide Assurance NIH, USA: FWA00018774]. Ethics approval from the Saudi Ministry of Health ethics review board and from individual centers\u2019 ethics boards were also obtained. Study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Unique patient codes were issued to each study participant to maintain anonymity and confidentiality was maintained throughout the study. ResultsPatient demographics and baseline clinical characteristicsPatient baseline characteristics, categorized by all, non-ECMO group and ECMO group are shown in Table \u200bTable1.1. The overall mean age of the hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cohort was 55.7\u2009\u00b1\u200915.2\u00a0years, ranging from 1\u00a0month to\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0years. A total of 73.7% (n\u2009=\u20091,099) of the patients were males and 49.8% (n\u2009=\u2009742) were Saudi citizens. Diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m2) and ischemic heart disease were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (52%, 45%, 41% and 12%, respectively). The most prescribed pre-hospital medications were insulin therapy (16%; n\u2009=\u2009243), aspirin (13.6%; n\u2009=\u2009203), calcium channel blockers (11%; n\u2009=\u2009166), beta blockers (9.8%; n\u2009=\u2009147), ARBs (8%; n\u2009=\u2009122) and ACEIs (7%; n\u2009=\u2009109). MERS-CoV co-infection was confirmed in 8 (0.5%) and Legionella pneumophila co-infection was confirmed in 1 (0.1%) of 1,491 patients.Table 1Patients characteristics and clinical dataVariableAll

Patients who were placed on ECMO were more likely to be presented with higher levels of the following: triglycerides (227\u00a0mg/dl vs 258\u00a0mg/dl; p\u2009=\u20090.006), white blood cell count (10.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L vs 12.4\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L; p\u2009=\u20090.001), absolute neutrophil count (11.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L vs 21\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L; p\u2009=\u20090.000), bilirubin (13.9\u00a0mg/dl vs 27\u00a0mg/dl; p\u2009=\u20090.003), procalcitonin (6.2\u00a0ng/ml vs 55.5\u00a0ng/ml; p\u2009=\u20090.000), lactate dehydrogenase level (515 U/L vs 817 U/L; p\u2009=\u20090.000), Troponin I (4.2\u00a0ng/ml vs 515\u00a0ng/ml; p\u2009=\u20090.001), Troponin T (9.4\u00a0ng/ml vs 16.5\u00a0ng/ml; p\u2009=\u20090.004), creatinine kinase (459 U/l vs 867 U/l; p\u2009=\u20090.005), and D-dimer (14\u00a0mg/l vs 32\u00a0mg/l; p\u2009=\u20090.000). However, ECMO group had lower hemoglobin levels (12.6\u00a0g/dL vs 11.4\u00a0g/dL; p\u2009=\u20090.000), prothrombin time (15.5\u00a0s vs 13.6\u00a0s; p\u2009=\u20090.046), fibrinogen (66\u00a0mg/dl vs 5\u00a0mg/dl; p\u2009=\u20090.014), C-reactive protein (140\u00a0mg/l vs 89.5\u00a0mg/l; p\u2009=\u20090.016), and BNP (1400\u00a0pg/ml vs 99\u00a0pg/ml; p\u2009=\u20090.002).ICU managementAll hospitalized patients included in this study were admitted to ICU mostly due to ARDS (86.5%) (Table \u200b(Table2).2). All ECMO group patients were intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation compared to 52% in the non-ECMO group (p\u2009=\u20090.005). ECMO patients had higher APACHE II score (34 vs 42; p\u2009=\u20090.000). In the first 24\u00a0h of ICU admission, ECMO group patients had statistically significant lower systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and Glasgow coma scale; and higher heart rate (p\u2009<\u20090.05). All ECMO-group patients needed oxygen during the ICU stay (7.3% vs 100%; p\u2009=\u20090.002); and non-rebreather mask was the most common device used to deliver oxygen therapy (49.3%).Table 2Patients

non-ECMO patients at least once (24.6% vs 16.3%; p\u2009=\u20090.03) and inhaled nitric oxide was used less before intubation during the ICU stay (0.8% vs 2.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.043). Use of dialysis was more in the ECMO group (14% vs 42%; p\u2009=\u20090.000). There were significant differences between the non-ECMO and ECMO groups for the use of paralysis infusion (38% vs 53%; p\u2009=\u20090.035), inhaled nitric oxide (4.2% vs 10.9%; p\u2009=\u20090.023), and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (0.6% vs 4.3%; p\u2009=\u20090.01) while patients were placed on mechanical ventilation.Significant differences between the two groups were also found for most medications used as adjunctive pharmacotherapies in patients from hospital admission and during the ICU stay (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Anticoagulation was indicated mainly as a part of the COVID-19 therapy protocol and LMWHs were the most prescribed anticoagulants (70%) at a higher frequency in the non-ECMO group (73% vs 37%; p\u2009=\u20090.000). Favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone were used significantly more often in the ECMO group compared to the non-ECMO group (20% vs 53%, p\u2009=\u20090.000; 28.5% vs 43.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.003; 15% vs 33%, p\u2009=\u20090.000; and 24% vs 50%, p\u2009=\u20090.000, respectively).Complications during hospitalizationOverall, patients in the ECMO group experienced more complications at any time during hospitalization: pneumothorax (5% vs 29%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), bleeding requiring blood transfusion (7% vs 38%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), pulmonary embolism (6.4% vs 15.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.016), gastrointestinal bleeding (3.3% vs 8.7%; p\u2009=\u20090.017), lower limb DVT (1.4% vs 5.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.016), cardiac arrest (24% vs 45%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), rhabdomyolysis (2.8% vs 14%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), cardiac arrhythmias (4% vs 14%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), bed sores (7.8% vs 16%; p\u2009=\u20090.01), arterial lower limb ischemia (0.3% vs 5.4%; p\u2009=\u20090.000), and intracerebral bleeding (1.4% vs 15%; p\u2009=\u20090.000). Other investigations of the cohort are outlined in Table \u200bTable22.Clinical course in patients treated with ECMOAt day one of eligibility to ICU, all patients had a normal mean body temperature till day 21; however, patients\u2019 level of consciousness estimated by Glasgow Coma Scale kept to decline and patients maintained a mean arterial pressure\u2009\u2265\u200980\u00a0mmHg in both groups from day 1 to day 21 (Table \u200b(Table3).3). More patients in the ECMO group required hemodynamic support with epinephrine, dobutamine and phenylephrine compared to non-ECMO group; however, both groups had similar use of norepinephrine and dopamine. Throughout days 1\u201321, blood gas analysis shown lower PO2 levels and higher PCO2 levels, and lower respiratory rates in ECMO patients (Table \u200b(Table4).4). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was improved from day 1 to day 21 in both groups: (non-ECMO group: 118 vs 144) and (ECMO group: 95.2 vs 119.4). For modes of ventilation, pressure and volume-controlled ventilations were used more in the ECMO group; however, pressure-regulated volume-controlled ventilation was applied more in the non-ECMO group. Peak pressure\u2009<\u200945 cmH2O and plateau pressure\u2009<\u200930 cmH2O were maintained during the 21\u00a0days in both groups to prevent barotrauma in patients. Tidal volume of 2\u20134\u00a0ml/kg per patient\u2019s ideal body weight was also applied to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. High mean PEEP was employed in the first few days to maintain oxygen saturation of 88\u201392% and as patients recovered, the value was gradually reduced (Table \u200b(Table44).Table 3Hemodynamic data

venovenous mode was used in most patients (93.5%) via the percutaneous cannulation (92.4%) approach for vascular access (Table \u200b(Table5).5). The mean duration under ECMO was 15.4 (1\u201352) days. ECMO was indicated mainly for COVID-19-related ARDS (95.6%). About 42.4% of the ECMO patients underwent positioning within 24\u00a0h of ECMO initiation. Packed red blood cells (81.5%), fresh frozen plasma (43.5%) and platelets (35.8%) were most common blood transfusion products given while patients were on ECMO. ECMO mode conversion was made in few cases (4.3%). ECMO-related mechanical complications occurred in 45 (48.9%) patients; thirty patients (32.6%) had major bleeding from cannulation site, in eight patients (8.7%) there was oxygenator failure requiring circuit change, and in seven patients (7.6%) ECMO circuit clotting occurred. Of the 92 ECMO patients with a final disposition of death, discharged home alive or transferred to another facility, 45 (48.9%) died. Forty-two (45.6%) patients were successfully decannulated, and 5 (5.4%) patients were discontinued from ECMO because of bad response.

lower COVID-19 virological cure; and longer hospitalization, ICU stay and mechanical ventilation use compared to non-ECMO group control offered the usual care. In addition, there was a high number of patients with septic shock and multiple organ failure; and more complications occurred at any time during hospitalization [pneumothorax, bleeding requiring blood transfusion, pulmonary embolism and gastrointestinal bleeding] in the ECMO group. However, PaO2 was significantly higher in the 72-h post-ECMO initiation group and PCO2 was significantly lower in the 72-h post-ECMO start group than those in the 12-h pre-ECMO group.Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used clinically in Saudi Arabia for nearly 8\u00a0years [12]. Since the role of ECMO in the management of COVID-19 is unclear during the pandemic surge, the national coordinating center for the Saudi ECMO Program (KFSH&RC, Riyadh) registered with the ELSO; adapted to facilitate the systematic collection of new data in order to address lack of evidence on the benefit of ECMO intervention in COVID-19 treatment. However, there are many centers that are still not ELSO-registered, which makes it challenging to assess the actual global ECMO capacity and capability. Real-time data collection and sharing, establishing global biobanks, and nurturing an international collaborative research culture is crucial to rapidly identify populations at risk, the patients that stand to benefit from therapies such as ECMO.ECMO use in respiratory failure for COVID-19 patients has been reported with variable survival rates [15, 19\u201323]. Reports from retrospective studies have suggested variable use, ranging from 1 to 52%, an observation that may reflect varying availability of ECMO equipment and experienced personnel [15, 19\u201323]. Patients included in the present study were among the first ones who have been treated with ECMO therapy for COVID-19-related ARDS in Saudi Arabia. At that time, use of ECMO as a rescue therapy in patients with COVID-19 was not supported [23]. Therefore, each health facility has adapted its own treatment policy based on a strict patient selection and the availability of this expensive therapy. The analysis of our data showed that ECMO was used in rather young patients [about 24% (n\u2009=\u2009360) were aged 51\u201360\u00a0years, 19% (n\u2009=\u2009294) were aged 61\u201370\u00a0years, and 16.7% (n\u2009=\u2009249) were aged 71\u00a0years and older] and without severe comorbidities [diabetes, hypertension, obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m2) and ischemic heart disease were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (52%, 45%, 41% and 12%, respectively)]. Therefore, these results should be viewed in light of a strict patient selection policy and may not be replicated in patients with advanced age or multiple comorbidities [24].In patients with respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection who required the use of ECMO, the mortality rate varied considerably between studies ranging from 31 to\u2009>\u200980% [25\u201329]. We report a higher mortality rate (48.9%) in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with ECMO due to ARDS; compared to the rates reported by three studies in Paris, France (31%) [25], Michigan, USA (<\u200940%) [26], and an international study conducted in the Middle East and India (41.7%) [29]. Nevertheless, we report a very similar and slightly lower survival rate (51.1%) compared to the previous study done in the USA (53.8%) [30], which was compatible to the data from the European branch of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization international survey [31]. Very high mortality rates (>\u200980%) were reported in the earliest studies which investigated ECMO benefit for ARDS due to COVID-19 in China [28] and Europe [27]; however, most subsequent studies shown more promising results [20, 23, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32\u201338]. In our study, regional variation in hospital mortality is likely multifactorial and might be related to the initial burden of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia, which was greatest in Riyadh and Jeddah. The lack of association between potential COVID-19 therapeutics and survival, in particular steroids, which have been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients [39] could be related to the extreme severity of illness in patients who underwent ECMO support; however, the efficacy of such regimens cannot be determined using our registry-based study design and with concurrent administration of multiple therapies. There was a large variation in mortality rates, which could be explained by differences in patients\u2019 baseline characteristics and severity of illness. Another important factor is the center experience and volume of cases; this could have contributed to the variability in mortality rates with ECMO use. ECMO is a resource-intensive therapy requiring a multidisciplinary team of experienced medical professionals with training and expertise in initiation, maintenance, and discontinuation of ECMO in severely ill patients [40\u201343]. Adequate planning, thoughtful resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all essential components of an ECMO action plan.ECMO cannot be blamed for the increased mortality; it is merely a tool and clinicians still need to understand when to use it for the greatest benefit [44]. Some studies have advocated the early initiation of ECMO therapy in intubated patients due to ARDS with severe SARS-CoV-2 for more efficacy [30, 32, 36, 37, 45]. Indeed, late ECMO initiation in patients with ARDS induced by SARS-CoV-2 who had been on ventilator for longer than 7\u00a0days demonstrated a 100% mortality in a small case-series study [30], therefore, prolonged pre-ECMO ventilation (\u2265\u20097\u00a0days) was considered a contraindication for ECMO therapy in some institutions [46]. Initiation of ECMO beyond 7\u00a0days of mechanical ventilation seems to be acceptable in exceptional cases or when lung transplant is a possibility if lung recovery does not occur [47]. Earlier ECMO initiation is assumed to improve patient outcome in appropriately selected COVID-19 cases with ARDS and should be further investigated. Addressing this will require comparisons between early initiation and late initiation groups.We noted a very high incidence of pneumothorax (29.3%) in the ECMO- group. Pneumothorax is frequent and fatal complication in severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with ARDS and; most likely associated with reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents use, recruitment maneuver, severe cough, changes of lung structure and function; despite the use of protective ventilation strategies [48]. Consistent with other studies [49, 50], a high rate of pulmonary embolism (15.2%) in SARS-CoV-2 patients receiving venovenous ECMO treatment was observed in the ECMO-patients despite an early increase of our anticoagulation targets for all the patients. High occurrence of thromboembolic events in SARS-CoV-2 patients receiving venovenous ECMO support suggests that other strategies, beyond systemic anticoagulation, are warranted to care for SARSCoV-2 induced lung endothelial injuries. In our study, septic shock was the primary cause of death in 18 (19.6%) of 92 patients but only three of them were converted to venoarterial or venoarterial\u2013venous ECMO for cardiovascular support. Although relatively rare, conversion of VV ECMO to VA ECMO may be appropriate in selected COVID-19 patients [15, 21]. Use of these types of ECMO is sproposed in patients with septic shock with severe myocardial dysfunction and decreased cardiac index [51, 52]. Adequacy of anticoagulation is even more critical during VA ECMO compared with VV ECMO therapy since arterial or intracardiac thromboembolic events have serious consequences [52, 53]. ECMO is also frequently complicated by hemorrhage, necessitating daily transfusion of 2\u20135 units of packed red blood cells and 3\u20139 units of platelet concentrate to maintain normal hemoglobin levels, although massive blood transfusion (defined as\u2009>\u200910 units of packed red blood cells per day) was suggested [54].It should be noted that many of our patients received favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and antibiotics. Extensive use of antibiotics, especially in the ECMO group, can be reflected by the longer use of mechanical ventilation, risk of nosocomial infections and bacteremia or SARS-CoV-2 induced immuno-paralysis. Lack of well-defined management plan for COVID-19 disease results in the use of various treatment and adjuvant therapies in patients during hospital stay. Nonetheless, considering the high number and severity of bacterial co-infections previously reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, initiation of antibiotic therapy for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is recommended [55, 56]. The approach of administering empiric antibiotic therapy solely to patients who were admitted for SARS-CoV-2 and who presented with a chest X-ray suggestive of bacterial infection, have a need for direct ICU admission, or are severely immunocompromised should be reconsidered [55, 56]. Limitation of the studyThis study has few limitations. First, it is possible that there was selection bias in this study, even though ECMO placement was determined by a multidisciplinary team of physicians. Second, the follow-up was limited through November 30th, 2020, hindering the possibility of including all outcomes as some patients still remained hospitalized. Consequently, there may have been some partiality regarding the prognosis of the patients. Finally, some follow-up data were unavailable. ConclusionECMO support might be an integral part of the critical care provided for COVID-19 patients in centers with advanced ECMO expertise, however, ECMO needs to be evaluated for benefits/risks on a case-by-case basis. We report a high mortality rate and unfavorable treatment outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients with ARDS who underwent ECMO, however, these findings need to be carefully interpreted, as most of our cohort patients were relatively old and had multiple severe comorbidities. Future randomized trials, although challenging to conduct, are highly needed to confirm or dispute reported observations.
