Thus, AFF2/FMR2 regulates the transcription and toxicity of expanded G4C2 repeats in human C9ORF72-ALS/FTD neurons.Subject terms: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurodegeneration IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are pathologically and genetically linked neurodegenerative diseases that share common dysregulated molecular pathways1,2. ALS causes progressive loss of motor neurons and muscle weakness3, whereas FTD causes focal atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, resulting in progressive cognitive and behavioral alterations and other deficits4. In most cases of ALS and FTD, the DNA/RNA-binding protein TDP-43 (transactive response (TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43) is the major constituent of pathological aggregates in patient neurons5. Moreover, the GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of both ALS and FTD6,7, further highlighting the shared pathogenic mechanisms in these disorders.In C9ORF72-ALS/FTD, three pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegeneration have been proposed: partial loss of C9ORF72 function, toxicity from bidirectionally transcribed repeat RNAs, and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins induced toxicity8. Five DPR proteins\u2014poly(GP), poly(GA), poly(PA), poly(GR), and poly(PR)\u2014are found in the brains of patients with C9ORF72-ALS/FTD9\u201311. Of these proteins, poly(GR) expression strongly correlates with neurodegeneration in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD12,13. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, poly(GR) expression per se can cause neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo14\u201321. In pull-down experiments, proteins that interact with arginine-containing DPR proteins include cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, as well as other RNA-binding proteins such as components of stress granules with low complexity domains, spliceosomes, and nucleoli19,22\u201327. Consistent with these findings, poly(GR) has been linked to defects in nuclear cytoplasmic transport, translation, stress granule dynamics, nucleolar function, splicing, mitochondrial function, DNA damage response, and other cellular processes1,2.Accumulating evidence that DPR proteins are toxic highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the toxicity and production of DPR proteins. To explore these issues, we established a Drosophila poly(GR) model in which 80 repeats of GR are expressed in all adult neurons in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. We did an unbiased genetic screen in Drosophila and also used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to carry out genetic manipulations in neurons derived from C9ORF72 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our findings uncover a role for AFF2/FMR2, a component of the super elongation complex (SEC)-like 2, in controlling the expression and toxicity of the C9ORF72 mutant allele containing expanded G4C2 repeats in ALS/FTD. ResultsPoly(GR) causes locomotor defects and death of adult fliesOverexpression of poly(GR) driven by the UAS-Gal4 system in the developing Drosophila eye is highly toxic15\u201317. To study age-dependent effects of poly(GR) expression in the adult brain, we expressed, in all postmitotic neurons of adult flies, a (GGXGCX)80 DNA construct (X being randomly any of the four nucleotides) that contains either the ATG start codon to encode flag-tagged (GR)80 or the TAG stop codon as the control17 (Fig.\u00a01a). We used the temporal and regional gene expression targeting (TARGET) system28, in which temperature-sensitive Gal80 (Gal80ts) inhibits Gal4-mediated transcription at low temperatures (e.g., 18\u2009\u00b0C) but not at higher temperatures (e.g., 25 or 29\u2009\u00b0C). Elav-Gal4, Gal80ts, and UAS-(GR)80 were recombined onto the second chromosome, and Elav-Gal4, Gal80ts, UAS-(GR)80/+ pupae were kept at 18\u2009\u00b0C to prevent poly(GR) expression. Newly eclosed adult flies were kept at 25 or 29\u2009\u00b0C to induce poly(GR) expression (Fig.\u00a01a).Open in a separate windowFig. 1Establishment of a Drosophila model of C9ORF72- ALS/FTD. a Schematic of the fly model in which Gal80ts inhibits Gal4-mediated transcription of (GR)80 at 18\u2009\u00b0C, thus poly(GR) is expressed in a spatially and temporally controlled manner.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Pan-neuronal expression of (GR)80 at 29\u2009\u00b0C led to the death of all adult flies within 2\u20133 weeks (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Therefore, subsequent experiments were done at 25\u2009\u00b0C to reduce relative (GR)80 expression. At 25\u2009\u00b0C, (GR)80 expression driven by ELAV-Gal4 became detectable in adult brain neurons at 3 days of age, and was mostly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a01b). This finding is consistent with the subcellular location of ectopically expressed (GR)80 we observed in Drosophila motor neurons17, human iPSC-derived motor neurons19, and mouse brain neurons21. Poly(GR) expression increased gradually in an age-dependent manner, peaking at 2\u20133 weeks of age as shown by immunostaining (Fig.\u00a01b) or quantification based on our recently established Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) immunoassay21 (Fig.\u00a01c). However, (GR)80 mRNA levels did not change significantly (Fig.\u00a01d), suggesting that (GR)80 protein accumulates with aging, likely reflecting inefficient clearance. A negative geotaxis assay of control and (GR)80 flies at 1, 2, and 3 weeks of age revealed that motor function of\u00a0(GR)80 flies began to deteriorate at 2 weeks of age and was significantly worse at 3 weeks of age (Fig.\u00a01e). Most of the (GR)80 flies died at 3\u20134 weeks of age (Fig.\u00a01f). The compromised survival was likely due to in a large part motor neuron defects, as motor neuron-specific expression of (GR)80 in adult flies also led to premature death (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).Poly(GR) causes axonal defects without TDP-43 pathologyTo examine poly(GR) toxicity at the ultrastructural level, we examined 3-week-old fly brains by electron microscopy (EM). The number of neurons with multilamellar bodies (MLBs) was significantly increased in both the central brain and ventral ganglion of (GR)80 flies\u00a0(Fig.\u00a02a, b). MLBs frequently accumulate in neurodegenerative disease, possibly reflecting defective clearance of autophagic vacuoles. Indeed, expression of FTD-associated mutant CHMP2B also results in the accumulation of MLBs that are positive for LC3II, a key protein in autophagosome formation29. Signs of axonal degeneration were also present, including loss of axonal integrity as shown by swollen axons with inclusions and damaged mitochondria and loss of axonal filaments in the neuropil of 3-week-old (GR)80 flies (Fig.\u00a02c, e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02).Open in a separate windowFig. 2Poly(GR) causes axonal defects without TBPH pathology. a (GR)80 expression leads to the accumulation of multilamellar bodies (MLBs) and axonal degeneration in Drosophila.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Despite the axonal degeneration, only 0.7% of (GR)80-expressing neurons in 21-day-old (GR)80 brains were apoptotic and no apoptotic cells were seen in control fly brains, as shown (Fig.\u00a02f) and quantified (Fig.\u00a02g) by positive immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3. At 25 days of age, only 1.3% of neurons\u00a0in (GR)80 brains were positive for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.\u00a02g). This low level of apoptotic neuronal cell death was probably not responsible for the reduced survival of (GR)80 flies, as coexpression of the viral antiapoptotic gene p35 did not extend the lifespan of (GR)80 flies (Fig.\u00a02h).Consistent with our findings in (GR)80-expressing cortical neurons in mice21, p62 inclusions and the p62 expression level were not increased in (GR)80 flies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03)\u2014further evidence that poly(GR) expression alone does not cause p62 pathology, although p62-positive aggregates are common in postmortem C9ORF72 patient brains30\u201332 and in cells expressing poly(GA)33,34. To examine whether fly neurons expressing poly(GR) show abnormal localization or aggregation of TBPH (TAR DNA-binding protein 43 homolog), the Drosophila ortholog of human TDP-43, we generated a new antibody that is specific for endogenous TBPH, as shown by western blot analysis of wild-type and TBPH mutant flies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Moreover, immunostaining of 3-week-old (GR)80 fly brains revealed no difference in TBPH aggregation in (GR)80 and control flies (Fig.\u00a02i). The lack of TBPH pathology, confirmed by western blot (Fig.\u00a02j, k), is consistent with recent reports that poly(GR) expression in mouse neurons does not cause TDP-43 pathology20,21. Furthermore, ribosomal RNA biogenesis was not altered in (GR)80 flies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Thus, poly(GR) is sufficient to induce locomotor defects, neurodegeneration, and premature death without causing several hallmarks of neuropathology found in postmortem C9ORF72 patient brains.Lilliputian (lilli) strongly suppresses poly(GR) toxicityTo further explore mechanisms of poly(GR) toxicity and discover potential therapeutic targets, we did an unbiased genetic screen with the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center deficiency kit covering the second chromosome (Fig.\u00a03a). Of 100 deficiency lines screened, 11 enhanced or decreased the survival of flies expressing (GR)80 in all postmitotic neurons. Three of the strongest modifier deficiency lines, Df(2L)C144, Df(2)ED4651, and Df(2)BSC180, have an overlapping deleted genomic region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06), and each extended the lifespan of (GR)80 flies (Fig.\u00a03b). Only eight genes in the genomic region are covered by all three deficiencies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). Using genetic mutants and RNAi lines for these genes, we identified lilliputian (lilli) as a strong suppressor of (GR)80 toxicity. For this experiment, three independent lilli mutant alleles were used; each resulted in loss of Lilli activity, shown by reduced expression levels of lilli mRNA or its target gene Hsp7035 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b, c). Interestingly, lilli was also one of the genes we identified as suppressors of poly(GR) toxicity in nonneuronal Drosophila cells36. Partial loss of Lilli activity induced by the three independent lilli mutant alleles did not affect the lifespan of control flies but extended the lifespan of poly(GR)-expressing flies by 10\u201320 days (Fig.\u00a03c, d). These alleles also rescued the (GR)80-induced climbing defect (Fig.\u00a03e). However, partial loss of Lilli activity did not suppress the toxicity of FTD3-associated mutant CHMP2B (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07), suggesting a certain degree of specificity. Overexpression of Lilli enhanced both the survival and climbing defects of poly(GR)-expressing flies (Fig.\u00a03c, f), further confirming that lilli is a strong genetic modifier of poly(GR) toxicity.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Identification of lilli as a strong genetic suppressor of poly(GR) toxicity. a The design of a genetic deficiency screen in Drosophila.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Lilli regulates transcription of long GC-rich sequencesLilli, the only Drosophila homolog of the human AF4/FMR2 family of transcription factors, is part of a SEC required for regulation of transcription elongation37. Therefore, we checked whether Lilli affects (GR)80 mRNA levels. In our model, poly(GR) is encoded by (GGXGCX)80, which is predicted to form G-quadruplex structures (by QGRS Mapper: http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/QGRS/analyze.php). Indeed, partial loss of Lilli activity, from crossing (GR)80 flies with lilli genetic mutants, reduced (GR)80 mRNA levels by 24\u201327% (Fig.\u00a04a), whereas overexpression of Lilli increased the levels by twofold (Fig.\u00a04b). Accordingly, poly(GR) protein levels in the brains of 2-week-old flies were reduced by partial loss of Lilli activity and increased by Lilli overexpression, as shown by immunostaining (Fig.\u00a04c).Open in a separate windowFig. 4Partial loss of Lilli suppresses poly(GR) toxicity. a, b QPCR analysis of (GR)80 mRNA level in 2-week-old fly heads. n\u2009=\u20093 independent crosses in a and n\u2009=\u20098 independent crosses in b.

The expression levels of Ku80 (e) and Hsp70 (f) mRNAs in 2-week-old fly heads were assayed by qPCR. Values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. n\u2009=\u20093 independent crosses. *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, ****p\u2009<\u20090.0001 (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett\u2019s test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To further confirm this finding, we also used a highly sensitive ELISA, as we reported previously21, to demonstrate the role of Lilli in regulating poly(GR) level (Fig.\u00a04d). To examine whether partial loss of Lilli also rescues some downstream effects of poly(GR) toxicity, we first confirmed that poly(GR) expression increased the level of Ku80, a key protein in repair of double-stranded DNA breaks38, in the heads of (GR)80 flies as young as 1-week old (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a). Expression of Hsp70 and other heat shock proteins was also elevated in 1-week-old adult fly brains expressing (GR)80 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b), consistent with a recent report39. These molecular changes occurred 2 weeks before the death of these flies, suggesting they were early events in disease pathogenesis. The increases in the mRNA levels of Ku80 and Hsp70 (Fig.\u00a04e, f) and of some other heat shock proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09) were attenuated by partial loss of Lilli activity, further indicating the beneficial effects of reduced Lilli activity in decreasing poly(GR) toxicity. (GR)80 expression, on the other hand, did not alter lilli mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010).To see whether Lilli specifically regulates the (GR)80 level, we expressed another transgene, UAS-GFP, with the ELAV-GAL4 driver and measured GFP mRNA levels by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Partial loss of Lilli did not alter GFP mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011a) but did decrease the mRNA level of CONT-(GR)80, which has the same (GGXGCX)80 DNA sequence as (GR)80 flies except that the start codon is replaced with a stop codon (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011b). These results demonstrate the specificity of Lilli function in flies.To ascertain whether Lilli also regulates the expression of G4C2 repeat RNA, we used a fly model we generated previously in which 5 or 160 copies of G4C2 repeats are flanked by human intronic and exonic sequences (Fig.\u00a05a)40. Partial loss of Lilli activity decreased the mRNA level of the C9ORF72 minigene containing 160 G4C2 repeats by 20\u201330% (Fig.\u00a05b), but did not affect the mRNA level of the C9ORF72 minigene containing only five G4C2 repeats (Fig.\u00a05c). Thus, Lilli seems to preferentially regulate the transcription of expanded G4C2 repeat sequences. Expression of intronic 160 copies of G4C2 repeats in Drosophila motor neurons resulted in numerous nuclear RNA foci (Fig.\u00a05d), as we reported previously40. Reducing Lilli function with either a lilli mutant allele or a lilli RNAi significantly decreased the number of RNA foci per cell (Fig.\u00a05e), consistent with decreased transcription of the C9ORF72 minigene containing 160 G4C2 repeats.Open in a separate windowFig. 5Lilli regulates expression of expanded G4C2 repeat RNA. a Schematic of the intronic G4C2 repeat model and locations of the primers used for qPCR (red and blue arrows). b qPCR analysis of (G4C2)160 repeat RNA levels in the Drosophila eye.

AFF1 and AFF4 are part of SEC required to release polymerase II (Pol-II) from pausing sites to start productive elongation of most genes. AFF2 and AFF3 are key subunits of the SEC-like complexes SEC-L2 and SEC-L3, respectively, which are required for transcription elongation of only a small subset of genes37. AFF2 is also known as FMR2 (fragile mental retardation 2); loss of its expression due to a CCG expansion in the 5\u2032UTR results in a mild to borderline intellectual disability, fragile XE syndrome41,42.Open in a separate windowFig. 6The effect of knockdown of\u00a0AFF family members\u00a0on C9ORF72 expression in human neurons. a Corresponding human homologues of Drosophila lilli. b Schematic representation of the neuron differentiation protocol used in this study. Human neurons derived from two C9ORF72 patient iPSC lines were transduced with lentiviruses containing AFF2-specific (c) or AFF3-specific (d) shRNAs, cultured for 10 days, and analyzed for expression of AFF2, AFF3, and C9ORF72-V3 mRNAs. Each data point represents one differentiation (n\u2009=\u20093 independent differentiations). Values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. ns, not significant. *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 (paired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.To identify the AFF family members required to produce expanded G4C2 repeat RNA in C9ORF72 patient neurons, we obtained 3\u20134 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs, Dharmacon) targeting each of the four family members and tested their knockdown efficiency in HEK293 cells. The two best-performing shRNAs for each AFF family protein were transduced into C9ORF72 cortical neurons differentiated from iPSC lines derived from two C9ORF72 patients. About 80% of neurons generated with this protocol are MAP2-positive43 (Fig.\u00a06b). Four-week-old neurons were transduced with lentiviruses expressing the shRNAs targeting each AFF family member and cultured for 10 days. AFF2 and AFF3 shRNAs reduced target gene expression by 60\u201370% (Fig.\u00a06c, d). Under these conditions, levels of C9ORF72 variant 3 (V3) mRNA, which encodes full-length C9ORF72 protein and whose precursor mRNA contains the expanded G4C2 repeats in the first intron, decreased by 15% after AFF2 knockdown (Fig.\u00a06c) but were unaffected by AFF3 knockdown (Fig.\u00a06d). Gene expression changes after AFF1 or AFF4 knockdown could not be measured, as all reference genes tested were also affected (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012). This observation is consistent with the participation of AFF1 and AFF4 in the transcriptional regulation of the expression of most genes44. Thus, AFF2 may have a unique function in the production of expanded G4C2 repeat RNA in patient neurons.Isoform- and allele-specific regulation of C9ORF72 by AFF2To further investigate how AFF2 regulates C9ORF72 expression in human neurons, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knockout AFF2 in iPSC lines from two C9ORF72 patients. The genomic editing experiments were designed to delete in exon 8 a region common to all eight reported AFF2 isoforms, thereby creating a frameshift and a premature stop codon (Fig.\u00a07a). Because AFF2 is located on chromosome X, cells with only 50% loss of AFF2 cannot be obtained due to X-inactivation in female cells or presence of only one X chromosome in male cells. To simplify clonal selection after CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of AFF2 in the first parental iPSC line (female karyotype), we selected lines that were homozygous for the deletion to avoid obtaining lines with a heterozygous deletion in the inactive X chromosome. A total of five lines were selected across the two patients; two of these lines, from parental iPSCs of one patient, had an 88 base-pair (bp) deletion as well as a 2-bp insertion in exon 8; three lines, from parental iPSCs of the second patient, had a 94- or 109-bp deletion in exon 8 (Fig.\u00a07b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). qPCR analysis of AFF2 mRNA levels in iPSCs confirmed the success of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout (Fig.\u00a07c). Then, we tested the effect of AFF2 knockout on the transcription of different C9ORF72 variants with or without repeats in sense or antisense directions. As a consequence of AFF2 knockout, C9ORF72-V3 mRNA levels were also significantly lower in iPSC lines than in the respective parental line, while C9ORF72-V2 (which encodes the full-length C9ORF72 protein but whose precursor mRNA does not contain the expanded G4C2 repeats) and first intron antisense levels were unchanged (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). After differentiation of the iPSCs into cortical neurons, AFF2 expression was still much lower in the knockout lines than in the parental line (Fig.\u00a07d). As in iPSCs, AFF2 knockout significantly reduced the level of C9ORF72-V3, but not of isoform V2 or antisense RNA\u00a0(Fig.\u00a07e\u2013g).Open in a separate windowFig. 7AFF2 regulates expression of expanded G4C2 repeats. a Schematic of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletions created in exon 8 of AFF2 to generate AFF2 knockout (KO) C9ORF72 iPSC lines. b PCR amplification of the genomic region containing exon 8, showing that all lines were homozygous for the deletion. c\nAFF2 mRNA levels in parental and AFF2-KO iPSC lines.

Each data point represents one differentiation (n\u2009=\u20093 independent differentiations). Values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001 (c, d, Welch\u2019s t test; e, i, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we analyzed allele-specific expression of the junction between exon 1b and exon 2 in C9ORF72-V3 using pyrosequencing, taking advantage of the presence of the rare single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs10757668) in exon 2 in the parental and respective AFF2 knockout iPSC lines. Because the expanded G4C2 repeats are associated with the G-allele6,45, we could determine how AFF2 knockout affects each allele (Fig.\u00a07h). Relative expression of the V3-specific G-allele was much lower in AFF2 knockout lines than in the respective parental lines (Fig.\u00a07i). Together, these results suggest that AFF2 preferentially regulates the transcription of the C9ORF72 allele containing expanded G4C2 repeats in patient neurons.AFF2 knockout reduces RNA foci and DPRs in human neuronsAccumulation of nuclear RNA foci and production of DPR proteins are consequences of the expression of expanded G4C2 repeats. Using in situ hybridization, we found that the percentage of iPSCs containing RNA foci, and the average number of foci per cell, were significantly lower in AFF2 knockout lines than in the respective parental lines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015). Consistently, AFF2 knockout also reduced the number of RNA foci in C9ORF72 iPSC-derived cortical neurons (Fig. 8a\u2013c). Poly(GR) and poly(GP) protein levels were also decreased in C9ORF72 iPSCs and C9ORF72 iPSC-derived cortical neurons after AFF2 knockout (Fig.\u00a08d, e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a016). AFF2 expression was similar in C9ORF72 patient brain tissues and control tissues (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017), suggesting that AFF2 is not upregulated in patient brains.Open in a separate windowFig. 8AFF2 knockout (KO) reduces RNA foci and DPR proteins. a Representative images of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of parental and respective AFF2-KO neurons with a Cy3-conjugated (G2C4)4 probe.

In the following set of experiments, in addition to the C9ORF72 parental and AFF2 knockout lines, we also used an isogenic no repeat line generated recently36. After 2\u20133 weeks without neurotrophic factors, a higher percentage of C9ORF72 neurons than the respective isogenic no repeats controls had cytoplasmic TDP-43 (Fig.\u00a09a\u2013c). This phenotype was relatively mild as most of the TDP-43 remained in the nucleus and cytoplasmic inclusions were only occasionally observed (Fig.\u00a09a). Interestingly, AFF2 knockout prevented translocation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm. When the neurons were kept in medium containing all the neurotrophic factors, there was no difference between the different groups of samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018).Open in a separate windowFig. 9AFF2 knockout rescues disease phenotypes. a Representative immunofluorescence image of the TDP-43 localization in cortical neurons.

Six to eight randomly selected fields were analyzed for each condition and each neuronal culture. Each independent data point represents one field. n\u2009=\u20093 independent differentiations. Values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001 (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's multiple comparisons test). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Since our (GR)80 flies showed signs of axonal degeneration, we looked for this phenotype in C9ORF72 patient-derived cortical neurons. Indeed, 2\u20133 weeks of neurotrophic factor withdrawal increased axonal degeneration in C9ORF72 neurons, and this phenotype was prevented by AFF2 knockout (Fig.\u00a09d\u2013f). Both the increases in TDP-43 cytoplasmic localization and the axonal degeneration were replicated in neurons derived from a second C9ORF72 patient and respective isogenic control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019). DiscussionIn this study, we established a Drosophila poly(GR) model in which expression of 80 repeats of GR in adult neurons causes axonal degeneration, shortened lifespan, and locomotion defects without significant cell death or TDP-43 pathology. In an unbiased deficiency screen in this model, the lilli gene, encoding a component of the SEC, was identified as a novel strong modifier of poly(GR) toxicity. Because in this model, poly(GR) was expressed in adult neurons and lifespan was used as the readout for the genetic screen, it is possible to identify novel modifier genes not seen in other screens. Downregulation of lilli reduced poly(GR) RNA and protein levels. Lilli also reduced the levels of RNA containing long G4C2 repeat sequences without affecting the expression of short repeat sequences. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss of AFF2/FMR2, one of four human homologs of Lilli, specifically decreased the levels of C9ORF72 RNA, RNA foci, and DPR proteins in neurons derived from iPSCs of patients with C9ORF72-ALS/FTD. These findings uncover a role for AFF2/FMR2 in controlling the expression and toxicity of C9ORF72 alleles containing expanded G4C2 repeats in ALS/FTD.A series of recent findings indicate that poly(GR) has pleiotropic effects and compromises several molecular pathways1,2. Our findings here suggest that axonal degeneration is another potential pathogenic mechanism in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD. During normal aging and in various neurodegenerative diseases, an altered stress response could lead to axonal defects46. Indeed, poly(GR) increases the levels of oxidative stress19 and heat shock response genes39 (Fig.\u00a04e, f). Moreover, poly(GR)-induced axonal degeneration precedes neuronal cell loss, which may account for neuronal functional deficits during disease progression, as in other models of neurodegenerative diseases46,47. This important observation in our fly model is supported by the finding of axonal degeneration in C9ORF72 patient-derived neurons. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined how poly(GR) causes axonal degeneration at the molecular level. On the other hand, the lack of TDP-43 pathology in this fly model is consistent with observations that poly(GR) expression in mice does not induce TDP-43 pathology20,21. Thus, this key pathological hallmark of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD may be caused by other DPR proteins or a combination of DPR proteins and/or toxic repeat RNA. Indeed, we found evidence for a mild form of TDP-43 pathology in C9ORF72 patient-derived neurons.In our unbiased genetic screen in Drosophila, a 50% reduction of Lilli function was sufficient to decrease poly(GR) levels and attenuate its toxicity. The effect of partial loss of Lilli activity seems to be relatively specific to the (GGXGCX)80 sequence, as the levels of other transgenes expressed with the same GAL4 driver were unaffected. Interestingly, loss of Lilli function also suppressed the toxicity of TDP-43 without affecting its level in Drosophila48. Moreover, partial loss of Lilli function affected the expression of (G4C2)160 but not (G4C2)5, suggesting that the transcription of expanded G4C2 repeats in Drosophila is more sensitive to Lilli function. Findings in Drosophila models of neurodegeneration often need to be confirmed in patient iPSC-derived neurons49. Indeed, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated AFF2 knockout in C9ORF72 iPSC-derived patient neurons suggests that AFF2 preferentially regulates the transcription of the C9ORF72 allele containing expanded G4C2 repeats. AFF2 is a subunit of the SEC-like complex SEC-L2, which is required for transcription elongation of only a small subset of genes44. Thus, transcription elongation can be a rate-limiting step for the transcription of the long GC-rich sequences, likely in part because the high GC content favors the formation of R-loops that contribute to Pol-II pausing50.Although complete loss of AFF2 function causes mild intellectual disability41,42, partial knockdown of AFF2 may still represent a potential therapeutic approach since AFF2 knockout in C9ORF72 iPSC-derived patient neurons largely rescued axonal degeneration and TDP-43 pathology. Moreover, our findings here highlight the need to further investigate other components of transcription elongation complexes as potential therapeutic targets. Several factors may be needed to facilitate RNA Pol-II processivity on long GC-rich sequences. For example, PAF1 complex, a positive regulator of RNA Pol-II transcription elongation, has recently been identified as a modifier of G4C2 repeat toxicity that regulates the transcription of expanded repeat sequence in Drosophila51. In addition, SUPT4H1 is also required for the transcription of expanded G4C2 repeats, and partial knockdown of SUPT4H1 in C9ORF72 iPSC-derived patient neurons decreases the levels of G4C2 repeat RNA and DPR proteins52. SUPT4H1 is a component of DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor) that associates with negative elongation factor (NELF) to promote promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol-II53. Transcription elongation resumes when a component of SEC, positive elongation factor b, releases the pause by phosphorylating RNA Pol-II, NELF, and DSIF37. Although lowering the level of SUPT4H1 by ~90% reduces global\u00a0RNA levels54, other factors in the transcription elongation regulatory complexes such as AFF2 may more specifically influence the expression of expanded G4C2 repeats, and therefore are potential therapeutic targets worthy of further investigation. MethodsDrosophila stocks and geneticsAll flies were raised on standard food at 25\u2009\u00b0C. UAS-(GR)80 and UAS-CONT-(GR)80 flies as well as UAS-(G4C2)160 and UAS-(G4C2)5 flies have been obtained from earlier studies40. A deficiency kit for the second chromosome and ELAV-GAL4, TubGAL80ts, UAS-p35, lillik05431, lilliA17-2, UAS-GFP, UAS-lacZ, OK371-GAL4, and GMR-GAL4 fly stocks were from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Lilli RNAi line (v106142) was from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC). lilli4U5 and UAS-lilli-HA fly stocks were a gift from Dr Ernst Hafen. The lilliA17-2 allele was created by ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. The nature of the mutation is unknown but is thought to be a loss of function allele55. The lillik05431 allele is a P-element insertion56. The lilli4U5 allele has a short deletion resulting in a frameshift and a functional null allele56.Lifespan assayAll fly crosses were kept at 18\u2009\u00b0C until eclosion. Male flies were collected 24 h after eclosion and maintained at 25\u2009\u00b0C. For survival analysis, 100\u2013200 flies of each genotype were used. Flies were transferred to fresh food every other day, and dead flies were scored.Climbing assayTwenty male flies were placed in a 10-cm-long plastic vial and tapped to the bottom of the vial, and the number of flies that climbed 5\u2009cm in 15\u2009s was counted. For consistency, all flies were tested at the same time of the day. For each genotype, 80\u2013100 flies were tested.Neuronal cultures and human brain samplesPublished iPSC lines from two C9ORF72 carriers (one with a female and the other with male karyotype) heterozygous for the A/G SNP (rs10757668) in exon 2 of C9ORF72 were differentiated into cortical neurons following a protocol established in the laboratory43. Briefly, iPSC colonies were lifted after incubation with 1:2 Accutase/PBS and grown as embryoid bodies (EBs) in suspension for 4 days in basic fibroblast growth factor-free iPSC medium containing dorsomorphin and A-83. EBs were cultured for 2 additional days in neuronal induction medium supplemented with cyclopamine and then allowed to attach and form neural tube-like rosettes. Fifteen-day-old rosettes were collected and grown in suspension as neurospheres. Neurospheres were dissociated after 3 weeks, and the cells were seeded on plates coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin. Neurons were cultured for 4 weeks, and transduced with the lentiviral particles (multiplicity of infection, 100) for 10 additional days. All experiments were done with neurons derived from 3\u20135 independent differentiations. Human brain cDNA samples were from a previous study40. The mean age at death was 78\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years in seven control subjects and 65\u2009\u00b1\u20097 years in six C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers.A shorter cortical differentiation protocol was used for the TDP-43 and axonal degeneration assays. Briefly, iPSC colonies were seeded on Matrigel-coated wells in mTeSR1 medium (StemCell Technologies); 24\u2009h later, the medium was changed to neuroepithelial progenitor (NEP) medium (1:1 DMEM/F12:neurobasal, 0.5\u00d7 N2, 0.5\u00d7 B27, 0.1\u2009mM ascorbic acid (Sigma), 1\u00d7 Glutamax, 3\u2009\u03bcM CHIR99021 (Tocris Bioscience), 2\u2009\u03bcM DMH1 (Tocris Bioscience), and 2\u2009\u03bcM SB431542 (Stemgent)) and replaced every other day for 6 days. Progenitor colonies were dissociated with Accutase, seeded at 1:6 on Matrigel-coated wells, and cultured in NEP medium containing 2\u2009\u03bcM cyclopamine (StemCell Technologies) for 6 days; the medium was replaced every other day. Cortical progenitors were lifted, cultured in suspension for 6 additional days in the absence of CHIR99021, DMH1, and SB431542, and dissociated to single cells with Accutase. Cells were seeded on poly-lysine/laminin-coated coverslips (Corning) in neurotrophic factor withdrawal medium (1:1 DMEM/F12:neurobasal, 0.5\u00d7 N2, 0.5\u00d7 B27, 0.1\u2009mM ascorbic acid (Sigma), 1\u00d7 Glutamax, 0.1\u2009\u03bcM compound E (Calbiochem), and 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml laminin (Sigma)) for 2\u20133 weeks. This protocol generated a culture with >90% TUJ1+ neurons. The work involving iPSCs was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester.Lentivirus productionshRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (clone IDs TRCN0000119090 and TRCN0000119091 for AFF2 and TRCN0000108066 and TRCN0000108068 for AFF3). High-titer lentiviral preparations were produced by the Viral Vector Core at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.Generation of AFF2-KO iPSC linesGenome editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create a deletion to knock out AFF2 was done by ALSTEM (Richmond, CA). Briefly, the Neon electroporation system was used to transfect iPSCs with two different guide RNAs: ATCTCTTTGTAGGATGCTTG and TCTAACCTGGTAGAGCTCAG for patient 1 iPSCs and ATCTCTTTGTAGGATGCTTG and AGCCCTAAGCTCTTCTAACC for patient 2 iPSCs. Single cells were placed in 96-well plates, cultured for 14 days, expanded, and cultured in 24-well plates. Genomic DNA from each clone was extracted with the Zymo genomic extraction kit. Clones with the desired homozygous deletion were identified with a PCR amplification assay, and the PCR products were sent for sequencing.After we received the frozen vials containing each clone from ALSTEM, iPSCs were recovered, expanded, and collected to isolate genomic DNA. The region of interest was amplified by PCR, and the products were sent for sequencing to confirm the identity of each clone.RNA extraction and quantitative PCRFor flies, total RNA was extracted from adult heads with the Qiagen miRNeasy kit (Cat. No. 217004) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and reverse transcribed with random hexamers and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 18064014). For iPSCs, neurons, and brain tissue, total RNA was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Cat. No. 74104) and treated with DNase I (Qiagen, Cat. No. 79254). RNA (500\u2013900\u2009ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers or C9ORF72 antisense-specific reverse primer and MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. N8080234) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. qPCR was done with an Applied Biosystems Quant Studio 3 system and SYBR Select Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 4472908). Ct values for each sample and gene were normalized to cyclophilin. The relative expression of each target gene was determined with 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method. Primers used for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. In the AFF1 and AFF4 knockdown experiments, the following reference genes were tested: ACTN, GAPDH, HPRT, and SUPT5H (as suggested by Genevestigator software: https://genevestigator.com/gv/).Quantification of C9ORF72 allele-specific expressionTotal RNA (1\u2009\u00b5g) from parental and respective knockout iPSCs was used to generate cDNA with the OneStep RT-PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Cat. No. 978801) and V3-specific primers (5\u2032-GAGCAGGTGTGGGTTTAGGAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCACTGCATTCCAACTGTCACAT-3\u2032). Pyrosequencing analysis was done on a PyroMark Q24 instrument with the sequencing primer (5\u2032-TTCCAACTGTCACATTATC-3\u2032) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed as the percentage of V3 mRNA containing the G-allele.ImmunocytochemistryAdult fly heads were placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS, transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS, and incubated overnight. The heads were frozen in Tissue-Tek Cryomold (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat. No. 62534-15), cut into 15-\u03bcm sections, and mounted on glass slides. Sections were permeabilized with 1% SDS for 5\u2009min, washed three times with PBS, and placed in PBS with 10% goat serum and 10% donkey serum to block nonspecific binding. After incubation in primary and secondary antibodies, sections were mounted in Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs, Cat. No. H-1200). Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 II laser-scanning confocal microscope.Neurons were fixed in 4% PFA for 10\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5\u2009min. After incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30\u2009min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h at room temperature and coverslips were mounted in Vectashield Hardset Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs, Cat. No. H-1500). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope coupled to an AxioCam 506 camera (Zeiss). On average 300 cells were analyzed per experimental condition, n\u2009=\u20093 independent cultures.The primary antibodies were rabbit-anti-poly(GR) (1:500; Millipore, Cat.

No. 89900) containing EDTA-free Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (100\u00d7) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 78441), incubated on ice for 15\u2009min, and centrifuged at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g to obtain the soluble fraction. The pellet was washed three times with RIPA buffer, incubated for 15\u2009min in 7\u2009M urea buffer, and centrifuged at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g to obtain the insoluble fraction. Proportional amounts of the insoluble and soluble fractions were loaded on the gel. Protein (10\u2009\u03bcg) in the soluble fraction was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-TBPH (1:1000), mouse anti-tubulin (1:200; Sigma, Cat.

The immunoblots were then washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) (1:5000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 31460) and goat anti-mouse IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat. No. 115-035-003), both conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. All blocking and antibody dilutions were done in 5% milk. Signals were developed with ECL Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 32132). Uncropped and unprocessed scans of the blots can be found in the Source Data file.RNA fluorescence in situ hybridizationThird instar fly larval brains were fixed in 4% PFA for 20\u2009min, washed three times for 5\u2009min each with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated in prehybridization buffer consisting of 2\u00d7 saline sodium citrate (SSC), 40% formamide, salmon sperm DNA (1\u2009mg/ml), and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1\u2009h at 56\u2009\u00b0C. Samples were then incubated in hybridization buffer containing 5\u2032-end Cy3-conjugated (G2C4)4 oligonucleotide probe for 3\u2009h at 56\u2009\u00b0C. Samples were then washed twice in wash buffer 1 (40% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 15\u2009min at 56\u2009\u00b0C and twice more in wash buffer 2 (2\u00d7 SSC and 0.1% Tween-20) for 15\u2009min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20, and mounted in Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs).iPSCs and neurons on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 20\u2009min, permeabilized in 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u2009\u00baC, incubated with 40% formamide/2\u00d7 SSC for 10\u2009min at room temperature, and hybridized for 2\u2009h at 56\u2009\u00b0C with the Cy3-conjugated probe in hybridization buffer consisting of 40% formamide, 2\u00d7 SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, yeast tRNA (1\u2009mg/ml), and salmon sperm DNA (1\u2009mg/ml). The cells were washed once with 40% formamide/1\u00d7 SSC for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C and twice with 1\u00d7 SSC at room temperature for 30\u2009min. Neurons were further incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30\u2009min and then immunostained for the neuronal marker MAP2 following the immunocytochemistry protocol as described above. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield Hardset Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs, Cat. No. H-1500). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope and an AxioCam 506 camera (Zeiss). On average 100 cells were analyzed per experimental condition, n\u2009=\u20093 independent cultures.Measurement of poly(GR) and poly(GP)Poly(GR) and poly(GP) were measured with a MSD immunoassay. Briefly, 2-week-old fly heads were homogenized with a pellet pestle motor in Tris lysis buffer (MSD; Cat. No. R60TX-3) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 78441), sonicated on ice at a 20% pulse rate for 20\u2009s, and centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 23225). iPSCs and neurons were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 89900) containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 78441), sonicated on ice at a 20% pulse rate for 15\u2009s, and centrifuged at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The protein content of supernatants was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad; Cat. No. 500\u20130006). Fly samples (0.9\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5l) and iPSCs and neurons (2\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5l) samples were loaded on a 96-well single-spot plate (MSD; Cat. No. L45XA) precoated with a custom-made polyclonal rabbit anti-(GR)8 or anti-(GP)8 antibodies (1\u2009\u00b5g/ml, Covance) and tested in duplicate wells. Serial dilutions of recombinant (GR)8 peptide in 1% BSA-TBST were used to prepare the standard curve. The detection antibodies were anti-(GR)8 or anti-(GP)8 antibodies previously tagged with GOLD SULFO (GOLD SULFO-TAG NHS-Ester Conjugation Pack, MSD; Cat. No. R31AA) at a concentration of 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/ml. Response signals from the assay plate were acquired with a QuickPlex SQ120 instrument (MSD). For background correction, values from control flies (CONT-(GR)80) or values from iPSCs/neurons from a control subject were subtracted from the corresponding test samples. For parental and respective knockout lines from patient 1, the poly(GP) levels were initially measured with an alternative anti-(GP)8 antibody as described before57.Axonal degeneration indexAxonal degeneration was analyzed by immunostaining for \u03b2\u0399\u0399\u0399-tubulin (TUJ1)58. Briefly, images of 6\u20138 random fields were acquired with a 20\u00d7 objective lens using a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope coupled to an AxioCam 506 camera and analyzed with the ImageJ software. To detect degenerated axons, we used the particle analyzer module of ImageJ on binarized images to calculate the area of the small fragments or particles (size 20\u201310,000 pixels). The axonal degeneration index was defined as the ratio of the area of degenerated axons to the total axon area (healthy plus degenerated axons). In the graph, each independent data point represents one field, 6\u20138 fields were collected per culture/differentiation, n\u2009=\u20093 independent cultures.Transmission EMThree-week-old fly brains were dissected in PBS and immediately immersion fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples were processed and analyzed by standard procedures at the Electron Microscopy Facility at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Briefly, fixed samples were incubated overnight in fresh 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\u2009M sodium cacodylate buffer at 4\u2009\u00b0C, rinsed twice in the same fixation buffer, and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Samples were then washed twice for 5\u2009min each with distilled water and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (20% increments), before two changes in 100% ethanol. Samples were infiltrated first with two changes of 100% propylene oxide and then with a 50:50 mixture of propylene oxide and SPI-Pon 812 resin. The next day, after five changes of fresh 100% SPI-Pon 812 resin, the samples were polymerized at 68\u2009\u00b0C in flat embedding molds. The samples were reoriented, cut into ~70-nm sections ~100\u2009\u03bcm from the tip of the ventral ganglion or central brain (frontal sections), placed on copper support grids, stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined with a FEI Tecnai 12 BT electron microscope at 100\u2009Kv accelerating voltage. Images were captured with a Gatan TEM CCD camera.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
