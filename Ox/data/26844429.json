With moderate biochemical and bioinformatic skills, mNET-seq can be completed in ~6 d, not including sequencing and data analysis. IntroductionThe RNA population (transcriptome) generated by Pol II transcription of mammalian genomes can be characterized by various next-generation sequencing technologies1,2. Very often total RNA-seq is used, which provides information predominantly about steady-state RNA, largely comprising mature isoforms. As a result, information on RNA processing events coupled to Pol II transcription\u2014such as pre-mRNA splicing and pre-miRNA processing3\u20135\u2014is lacking in total RNA-seq profiles. RNA processing is orchestrated by the extended CTD of the Pol II large subunit that comprises a heptad amino acid sequence (consensus YSPTSPS) repeated 52 times6. Although Pol II CTD is highly phosphorylated during transcription, the relationship between co-transcriptional RNA processing and CTD phosphorylation is poorly understood.Several different techniques have been described that generate profiles of extremely unstable nascent RNA in eukaryotes (Table 1). In particular, global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq), using modified nucleotides, have mapped transcriptionally engaged Pol II occupancy and revealed Pol II pausing7,8. Similarly, the 3\u2032 ends of nascent RNA isolated from insoluble chromatin have been sequenced at high resolution9,10. Finally, native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), achieved by immunoprecipitation (IP) of flag-tagged Pol II, generates genome-wide nascent RNA maps in yeast11 and bacteria12. However, these techniques have not so far provided nascent transcription profiles linked to either Pol II CTD modifications or to RNA processing. To enable us to generate such profiles, we recently developed and published an advanced NET-seq method for mammalian cells, termed mammalian NET-seq13 (mNET-seq, see Fig. 1); this protocol is based on those published methods.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Overview of the mNET-seq procedure.

In essence, this technique involves cryogenic breakage of the yeast cell wall to allow the preparation of a crude whole-cell extract. Pol II complexes are immunoprecipitated from this extract using anti-FLAG antibodies against endogenous FLAG-tagged Rpb3. To extend the NET-seq approach to mammalian cells, we first isolate native chromatin using 1 M urea and 300 mM NaCl, as this fraction is enriched for nascent RNA and phosphorylated Pol II (ref. 14). After solubilization of chromatin by extensive micrococcal nuclease digestion, we then immunoprecipitated specific Pol II complexes from this chromatin fraction. Independently, Churchman and colleagues have also developed a so-called NET-seq method for human cells10. However, their method does not use IP of Pol II complexes, but instead it detects the 3\u2032 end of chromatin-associated RNA, potentially including some degraded RNA. Consequently, our mNET-seq procedure is the only available method to profile Pol II CTD phosphorylation\u2013specific nascent RNA genome-wide.Consistent with previous nascent RNA-seq studies, mNET-seq detects both sense and antisense transcripts at transcription start sites (TSS), especially when using the 8WG16 Pol II antibody (specific for unphosphorylated CTD)13. Indeed, mNET-seq and GRO-seq give closely matching nascent RNA profiles(Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, a splicing intermediate is readily detected by IP with Ser5-P CTD-specific Pol II antibody. This suggests that 5\u2032 exons when cleaved by spliceosome are tethered to Pol II with Ser5-P\u2013modified CTD13. Thus, mNET-seq provides comprehensive data not only on the precise Pol II occupancy of nascent RNA but also on RNA processing intermediates across the genome.Overview of the procedureAn overview of the mNET-seq protocol is shown in Figure 1. Native chromatin fractions are isolated from purified nuclei using 1 M urea and 300 mM NaCl. Elongating Pol II complex is stably associated with this chromatin fraction, as judged by the abundance of unprocessed transcripts with retained introns and extended RNA 3\u2032 ends uncleaved at polyA sites14\u201317. This chromatin fraction is then extensively digested with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase). This efficient nuclease digests all exposed DNA and RNA, effectively releasing the Pol II elongation complex from chromatin into a soluble fraction. Only RNA protected by protein complexes such as Pol II or the spliceosome will be resistant to MNase digestion. Pol II complex\u2013associated nascent RNA fragments are purified from solubilized chromatin by Pol II IP using Pol II antibodies with different specificities. Consequently, Pol II modification\u2013specific nascent RNA profiles are obtained. The 5\u2032 hydroxyl (OH) generated by MNase digestion of RNA is converted to a 5\u2032 phosphate by T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) treatment to allow 5\u2032 linker ligation, whereas the 3\u2032 linker is ligated to the 3\u2032 OH end of the RNA present within the Pol II active site, thus enabling directional sequencing. Radioactive ATP (\u03b3-32P ATP) is also used in the PNK reaction to facilitate size selection on denaturing polyacrylamide gels of 35- to 100-nt RNA before subsequent adapter ligation, PCR-based preparation of the cDNA sequencing library and multiplexed Illumina sequencing. The sequence readout can be bioinformatically aligned to the human genome sequence to effectively map all RNA 3\u2032 ends. Note that co-transcriptional cleavage of 5\u2032 splice sites (SS) additionally results in RNA 3\u2032 OH ends that are protected by the spliceosome and are co-immunoprecipitated with Pol II, thus contributing to the mNET signal. It should also be emphasized that mNET-seq detects both protein-coding gene nascent transcripts and long noncoding RNA derived from intergenic regions.Bioinformatic analysis allows the genomic alignment of nascent RNA profiles at single-nucleotide resolution. This effectively defines both the exact positions of elongating Pol II across the genome and the precise RNA cleavage positions of some co-transcriptional RNA processing factors. Remarkably, we can directly detect the initial 5\u2032 SS cleavage step in pre-mRNA splicing and also observe active Drosha cleavage of pre-miRNA hairpin structures that are present in gene introns in a Pol II CTD phosphorylation-dependent manner13. Thus, the use of Pol II antibodies recognizing the full range of different CTD modifications will allow mNET-seq technology to uncover the highly complex CTD code of Pol II transcription.Advantages of mNET-seqmNET-seq is the only currently available method that allows examination of genome-wide nascent transcript profiles on the basis of Pol II CTD phosphorylation status and coupled RNA processing. The key features of this technique are as follows. No cross-linking. No cross-linking is used, as the elongating Pol II complex is stable in chromatin14,16,17. Other techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and in vivo cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments require prior cross-linking (formaldehyde treatment for ChIP and UV cross-linking for CLIP) to examine DNA-protein and RNA-protein interactions. However, such cross-linking procedures may introduce artifactual interactions.Chromatin digestion. MNase is a very efficient nuclease with little digestion bias on active chromatin regions, but it leaves the native Pol II complex intact. Furthermore, it is easy to inactivate by EGTA treatment. A short digestion time (90 s in our method) is used to minimize Pol II complex dissociation and consequent degradation of Pol II\u2013protected RNA.Pol II IP. Different Pol II\u2013specific antibodies (Table 2) can be used in mNET-seq to explore Pol II modification\u2013specific nascent RNA processing. For example, in our Ser5-P CTD-specific mNET-seq analysis, Pol II accumulation on co-transcriptionally spliced exons and a splicing intermediate tethered to the Pol II complex are detected. Furthermore, Ser2 and Ser5-P CTD-specific mNET-seq detects intermediates generated by co-transcriptional microprocessor-mediated cleavage13.Table 2Appropriate RNA Pol II antibodies.Pol II antibodyClonalitySupplierCatalog numberSpecificityBeads to Conjugate8WG16MonoclonalAbcamAb817Unphosphorylated CTD (low Ser2-P)Dynabeads protein GCMA601MonoclonalMBL Life scienceMABI0601Total CTDDynabeads M280 sheep anti-mouse IgGCMA602MonoclonalMBL Life scienceMABI0602Ser2-PDynabeads M280 sheep anti-mouse IgGCMA603MonoclonalMBL Life scienceMABI0603Ser5-PDynabeads M280 sheep anti-mouse IgGOpen in a separate windowTested Pol II antibodies are described. ELISA data and mNET-seq data are available13.Limitations of mNET-seqSome of the limitations of this technique are as follows: In mNET-seq, 35- to 100-nt RNA fragments are selected and sequenced. Consequently, nascent RNAs shorter than 35 nt (i.e., those within 35 bp of the TSS) cannot be profiled. In theory, smaller fragments could also be selected, sequenced and mapped by extending the lower limit to 20 nt. However, this may result in the loss of unique sequence alignment18. In addition, it has been estimated that only nascent RNA longer than 15\u201317 nt extrudes from Pol II, to become accessible to 5\u2032 capping enzymes19. This indicates that RNA shorter than 15\u201317 nt will not be accessible to 5\u2032 phosphorylation by PNK. A possible modification of mNET-seq to enable investigation of promoter-proximal RNA includes removal of proteins after Pol II IP\u2014e.g., by RNA extraction with TRIzol reagent or RNA phenol. Further, treatment of the purified RNA with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase before 5\u2032 phosphorylation by PNK might enable detection of any 5\u2032capped RNA present in this RNA fraction.During cell fractionation, Pol II could potentially inefficiently elongate because of the presence of magnesium in the cell lysis buffer (HLB+N, HLB+NS and NUN2; see Reagent Setup). However, we consider this highly unlikely without a run-on reaction (as in GRO-seq8). Nevertheless, we recommend that the handling time should be minimized before chromatin digestion, and it should be consistent between samples. For this reason, we always use the same number of cells as starting material; fewer than 12 cell culture plates (150 mm) are recommended for each experiment. Alternatively, detergents (such as sarkosyl) and transcription inhibitors (such as actinomycin D) might be helpful additions to the cell lysis buffer to prevent any in vitro Pol II elongation.The issue of RNA degradation is a potential concern, especially during Pol II IP. For the Pol II antibodies that we have used (Table 2), a 1-h incubation was identified as optimal for obtaining the maximum yield of Pol II complex under our IP conditions; this is a sufficiently short time period to avoid nonspecific IP products. However, some Pol II antibodies may be less efficient in Pol II IP, in which case longer incubations (>1 h) may be required. In this case, potent RNA inhibitors such as SUPERase-In (Thermo, cat. no. AM2696) should be added to the IP reaction buffer to prevent RNA degradation.mNET-seq provides the genomic position of nascent RNA 3\u2032 ends. Therefore, both elongating Pol II occupancy and RNA cleavage events, such as pre-mRNA splicing and pre-miRNA processing, can be determined. However, as Pol II\u2013associated complexes, such as the spliceosome and microprocessor, can also give rise to RNA cleavage peaks, we were unable to distinguish whether individual mNET-seq peaks reflected Pol II accumulation or co-transcriptional RNA cleavage. It is possible that more stringent washing of the IP sample may allow separation of RNA processing\u2013derived RNA 3\u2032-ends from elongating Pol II. RNA 3\u2032 ends in the Pol II active site could then be unambiguously determined in the mNET-seq profile.mNET-seq shows Pol II distribution over a gene, with higher peaks at a specific location suggesting Pol II pausing. However, peaks might also arise from PCR bias that could dominate the true profile during library amplification. The use of a low number of PCR cycles (<15 cycles) to amplify the cDNA library is crucial to minimizing this effect. Primer bands should be detected on 6% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels when gel purification is performed as an indication that the PCR reaction is unsaturated. Addition of random nucleotides (barcodes) to the 3\u2032 ends of RNA inserts before sequencing adapter ligation might help identify and remove PCR duplication problems10.We use gentle MNase digestion conditions on the chromatin pellet to avoid overdigestion of Pol II\u2013associated RNA. A possible limitation is that not all Pol II complexes are released under these conditions. However, a comparison between GRO-seq and mNET-seq suggests that mNET-seq detects virtually all engaged Pol II (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.93, P < 2.2e\u221216, See Supplementary Fig. 1). We predict that undigested chromatin reflects mostly heterochromatic regions of the genome that are untranscribed, or that have low levels of transcription. However, it is possible that more potent nuclease treatment may be required to allow fuller recovery of Pol II complexes from chromatin.\nApplication of mNET-seqWe have so far used a variety of Pol II antibodies for mNET-seq (Table 2), which has allowed us to reveal genome-wide nascent transcription, as well as coupled RNA processing. In theory, a range of biological questions could be addressed by using other antibodies for mNET-seq. Antibodies specific to transcription factors and RNA processing factors associated with elongating Pol II could be used to determine where these factors are involved in Pol II elongation and pausing. In addition, Pol I and III antibodies would reveal nascent transcription maps for these separate polymerases. Nascent RNA profiles specifically associated with Pol II mutants (such as the kinetically slow Pol II and various Pol II CTD mutants) could be obtained by ectopically expressing tagged-Pol II mutants in cells, and performing IPs with antibodies specific to the tag.Although we have analyzed nascent RNA in the elongating Pol II complex selected by specific Pol II antibodies, we have not analyzed other protein components of the complex. To understand which proteins are associated with particular co-transcriptional events using particular Pol II modifications, it will be important to examine all the proteins in the specific Pol II IP by mass spectrometry. It is also possible to compare mass spectrometry profiles using specific conditions, such as transcription elongation inhibition, to better understand which factor is important for the effect.Experimental designChromatin and nascent RNA digestion Before proceeding to a large-scale experiment, some of the mNET-seq cDNA library preparation stages should be carefully checked and optimized. First, digesting insoluble chromatin and nascent RNA is a crucial step. Even though MNase is a very efficient nuclease, its activity may sometimes vary. In particular, when using different cell lines, the optimal MNase concentration should be recalibrated by titrating MNase levels and by checking the efficiency of Pol II release from insoluble chromatin by western blotting. In addition, overly harsh MNase digestion could affect nascent RNA length. Determination of RNA length on denaturing gels after Pol II IP is recommended. To do this, radiolabel the mNET-seq RNA preparation using T4 PNK and \u03b3-32P ATP, and check that the MNase digestion gives the expected smear pattern on a denaturing 8% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2a).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Examples of gel purification steps in the mNET-seq method. (a) RNA size purification of Pol II IP products from an 8% (wt/vol) urea gel (Step 55). The 35- to 100-nt-sized RNA should be cut from the unlabeled sample. At least one empty lane should separate the unlabeled and radiolabeled samples. (b) Gel analysis of amplified cDNA library in the mNET-seq method (Step 91). The library size should be 150\u2013230 bp on the 6% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gel (red arrow). (c) Gel analysis of purified cDNA library (Step 95). Make sure that there is no primer-dimer contamination.Cell lines It is important to test cell lines or tissue before mNET-seq, as their behavior in the protocol may vary. Before starting an experiment, cell fractionation and Pol II immunoprecipitated RNA recovery should be tested. HeLa13 and A549 (T.N., T.G., M.C.-F. and N.J.P., unpublished data) cells have been successfully used for mNET-seq by our group. However, the nucleus and chromatin pellet of A549 cell are much smaller than those of HeLa cells. Consequently, a lower MNase concentration (which depends on chromatin pellet size) is required for A549 cells.Normally, 1.0 \u00d7 108 cells provides a good read coverage across the human genome in mNET-seq. Although the coverage level will be lower, 2.5 \u00d7 107 cells are sufficient for highly expressed genes. Transcription activity is different in each cell so that the minimum required cell number should be tested for each cell line.Controls The IP step is critical. IP efficiency and the specificity of the antibody should be checked by western blotting. An ideal IP efficiency is >50%. Immunoprecipitated RNA should be checked on a denaturing gel. Mock IPs (in which antibody is omitted from the IP reaction) or IPs using mouse IgG are useful negative controls; neither Pol II protein nor Pol II\u2013associated RNA should be detected by western blotting or on denaturing gels, respectively13, for these controls. For mNET-seq, a mouse monoclonal antibody is preferable to a rabbit polyclonal antibody, as the latter may display significant lot variation.

Cut only the 150- to 230-bp PCR product from the gel, and put the gel slice into the 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Take care to exclude 120- to 125-bp PCR products when excising the PCR product. These are primer-primer ligated DNA.? TROUBLESHOOTING92| Crush the gel by centrifugation at 15,000g for 1 min at room temperature. Remove the 0.5-ml tube.\u25a0 PAUSE POINT Crushed gel can be stored for several months at \u221220 \u00b0C.93| Elute the PCR product as described in Steps 56\u201366.94| Dissolve the pellets in 9 \u03bcl of fresh nuclease-free water, and combine the first- and second-round elution samples. Now the total volume is 18 \u03bcl.95| Measure the concentration of PCR libraries by Nanodrop or Qubit assay. Normally, 40\u201380 ng/\u03bcl PCR products will be detected.\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Check the purified PCR library on a TBE polyacrylamide gel to confirm the size of 150\u2013230 bp (Fig. 2c). Use 1\u20132 \u03bcl. Make sure that the PCR reaction is unsaturated; primers should be detected on the gel if the PCR reaction is in the linear range.? TROUBLESHOOTING\u25a0 PAUSE POINT PCR products can be stored for several months at \u221220 \u00b0C.High-throughput sequencing \u25cf TIMING 16 h96| Sequence the PCR libraries using Illumina Hiseq2500 rapid mode. Data for the paired-end reads are generated in FASTQ format.\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP Use Fastqc (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to assess the data quality. Successful mNET-seq experiments should have high read quality and low adapter contamination. A bias in k-mer and GC content might be present, which is usually a result of precipitation of co-transcriptional processing intermediates with similar sequences.Bioinformatic analysis \u25cf TIMING ~24 h for basic analysis\u25b2 CRITICAL Steps 97\u2013101 describe a suggested pipeline for mNET-seq data analysis. Introducing changes to the protocol or using different versions of the recommended tools, even if more recent, does not guarantee identical results. Analysis duration is dependent on the computational power available for processing.97| Trim the adapter sequences from the 3\u2032 end of each paired read using Cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.org/en/stable/) with an error rate of 0.05, and allow it to match \u2018N\u2019s in the reads to the adapter sequence; discard the reads that are shorter than 10 bases, and remove the adapter only once from each read.98| During the trimming step, some read pairs may lose one of their elements. From each FASTQ file, discard the reads that do not have a corresponding pair in the other file, while maintaining the read order in both files. This can be done either by following the instructions provided in cutadapt documentation or by applying a custom script.99| Align paired reads using TopHat v2.0.13 with library type set as second strand, a minimum anchor length of five bases and only one alignment to the reference genome for each read allowed (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml).? TROUBLESHOOTING100| Filter the resulting BAM file with the aligned read pairs using Samtools v0.1.19 (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) to obtain those in which both elements properly aligned with the genome. Use the command view and set the required flag parameter (-f) as 3.101| Identify the last base incorporated by the Pol II. According to the protocol, this will be the last base from read 2, but with the directionality of read 1. This can be done using the Python script hosted in https://github.com/tomasgomes/mNET_snr (Python v2.7, https://www.python.org/, requires pysam v0.8.3, https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam).\u25b2 CRITICAL STEP The BAM file resulting from Step 101 only contains information about the last base incorporated. Analysis requiring information about the whole read\u2014such as spliced read mapping\u2014must be performed on files resulting from the filtering step (Step 100).?

By using different Pol II antibodies, Pol II modification\u2013specific nascent RNA can be profiled at single-nucleotide resolution. mNET-seq with total Pol II\u2013specific antibody CMA601 should generate a fully engaged Pol II profile (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, a Ser5-P CTD\u2013specific antibody, such as CMA603, should detect peaks at the 3\u2032 end of exons, which are derived from splicing.Important quality control checkpoints in the mNET-seq protocol are described below.RNA recovery (Steps 50 and 68)For a typical mNET-seq experiment using eight 150-mm plates of near-confluent HeLa cells (~108 cells) and immunoprecipitated with Pol II\u2013specific antibody, the radiolabeled RNA should give a reading of >2,000 c.p.s. (Geiger reading). However, levels will depend on the number and type of cells, the type of antibody used and how fresh the \u03b3-32P ATP is. If signals are lower than 2,000 c.p.s., then check the Pol II IP efficiency and the working environment, which should be RNase-free. For details, see Troubleshooting Table.Typically, 0.5\u20132 \u03bcg of RNA can be recovered after gel purification; 150 ng of RNA is sufficient to generate mNET-seq cDNA library.mNET-seq cDNA library preparation (Steps 69\u201395)150\u2013400 ng of RNA is recommended as a starting point for cDNA library preparation. After cDNA amplification and gel purification of 150- to 230-bp PCR product, 0.5\u20132 \u03bcg of PCR library can be expected. For best results from high-throughput sequencing, submit 1\u20132 \u03bcg per library.Figure 3 shows representative profiles from a successful mNET-seq experiment. This example shows mNET-seq profiles of the salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) gene using four different Pol II\u2013specific antibodies that detect the Pol II active site RNA and RNA processing intermediates. The mNET-seq profiles are compared with a chromatin-bound RNA sequencing (ChrRNA-seq) profile that was used as an input for mNET-seq. Signals are observed across the gene. For 8WG16 unphosphorylated CTD (Unph), higher mNET-seq reads are detectable over the TSS, whereas for CMA603 Ser5-P CTD (S5P), specific peaks are detected at the 3\u2032 end of exons, which are known splicing intermediates. Note that strong signals are detected downstream of the transcription end site (TES, also referred to as the polyA site), which reflect Pol II pausing associated with termination13.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Example of a mNET-seq profile for the SIK1 gene. The mNET-seq minus strand reads are shown on the SIK1 gene. Four different Pol II CTD antibodies (Table 2), CMA601 (Total), 8WG16 unphosphorylated CTD (Unph), CMA602 Ser2-P CTD (S2P) and CMA603 Ser5-P CTD (S5P), were used for the mNET-seq. The RNA from the chromatin fraction was also sequenced (ChrRNA-seq, bottom). mNET-seq detects the 3\u2032 end of nascent RNA across the SIK1 gene and also downstream of the TES. CMA603 specifically immunoprecipitated 5\u2032SS cleaved splicing intermediates.Unsuccessful experiments caused by low read count or quality may result in insufficient mapping of reads to the genome or incorrect read pairing. This will generate gene profiles with low read counts, and the features described above will be absent or barely detectable.Background levels in mNET-seq analysisTo understand the ability of mNET-seq protocol to specifically target nascent Pol II transcripts, we compared the sense signal of a set of expressed protein-coding genes with that of rRNA- and tRNA-producing genes, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2). We show that the coverage of protein-coding genes is significantly higher when compared with the other two groups (two-sided Mann-Whitney U test: P < 2.2e\u201316 for both). In addition, we also compared the genome-wide coverage of total Pol II mNET-seq to GRO-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 1). By dividing the genome in 500-kb bins, the coverage of these samples shows a very high positive correlation (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient = 0.93, P < 2.2e\u201316). Together, these results attest to the low unspecific background levels generated by the mNET-seq protocol.
