Pol IV is thought to initiate the major RdDM pathway, transcribing DNA to generate relatively short RNA transcripts that are then copied into double-stranded RNAs by RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) [2-9]. Resulting double-stranded RNAs are diced by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) into 24\u00a0nt siRNAs that are loaded into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), or a related AGO protein [10-13]. In parallel, Pol V generates transcripts and recruits AGO4-siRNA complexes to RdDM loci via its C-terminal AGO4 hook motifs [14-16]. As Pol V elongates, AGO4-siRNA interaction with either complementary bases in lncRNA or DNA guides de novo cytosine methyltransferase, DRM2, to bring about repressive cytosine methylation (in CG, CHG or CHH contexts) [2,16-19]. There is evidence that Pol V has functions independent of RdDM, helping maintain repression of transposons and genomic repeats whose silencing depends on maintenance methylation by MET1 and the chromatin remodeling ATPase, DDM1 [20-22]. First, it has been reported that heterochromatin organization and silencing of pericentromeric transcription is affected in pol V mutant plants independently of the 24-nt siRNA biogenesis pathway [20]. Also, Pol V has been implicated in at least one alternative TE silencing pathway, the RDR6-dependent DNA methylation pathway (RDR6-RdDM) [12,21-24]. In this Pol IV- and 24-nt siRNA- independent pathway, Pol II-derived RNAs from TE regions are processed into 21- and 22-nt siRNAs in a RDR6, DCL2, and DCL4-dependent manner, loaded into AGO6 and targeted to Pol V scaffold transcripts [21,22,24]. Thus, Pol V can function as a downstream component in both 24-nt siRNA-dependent (canonical RdDM) and 21- and 22-nt siRNA-dependent (RDR6-RdDM) TE silencing pathways.Steady-state levels of mRNAs transcribed by Pol II in Arabidopsis thaliana are minimally affected in pol IV or pol V mutant plants [25]. However, several observations have suggested that Pol IV and V function in proximity to Pol II transcription units. At long retrotransposons, 24-nt siRNA biogenesis and RdDM occur primarily at the ends of the elements, where promoter sequences recognized by the Pol II transcription machinery are located[21,26]. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that approximately 30% of Pol V occupied positions are proximal to the promoters of Pol II \u2013 transcribed genes [17]. Likewise, 21\u201324\u00a0nt sRNAs are enriched within 1\u00a0kb of either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 ends of transcription units for approximately 20% of protein-coding genes, with studies suggesting that sRNA abundance correlates with mRNA abundance at these genes [27,28]. However, unlike Pol V ChIP peaks that correspond to transposons, Pol V peaks that overlap protein-coding genes typically do not correlate with 24-nt siRNAs or CHH DNA methylation [17]. which are hallmarks of RdDM, suggesting the possibility of an alternative function of Pol V in regulation of protein-coding genes.RNA Pol II transcription termination in eukaryotes is a complex process. Termination by Pol II occurs stochastically within a region of several hundred bases downstream of the polyA site and is functionally connected to the cleavage and polyadenylation of nascent transcript 3\u2032 ends [29-32]. Transcription pause sites, binding sites for protein termination factors, the presence of RNA-DNA hybrids, or chromatin modifications within the termination region can affect termination efficiency [33-35].We conducted nuclear run-on assays combined with high-throughput sequencing (NRO-Seq) [36], to identify genomic regions where nascent RNAs are synthesized, comparing wild-type plants to pol IV or pol V mutant plants, similar to an analogous study conducted in maize [37]. Interestingly, as in maize, we detect increased RNA Pol II abundance downstream from the cleavage and polyadenylation sites of protein coding genes in pol IV or pol V null mutants. By contrast, nascent transcript abundance in the region from the initiation site to the PolyA site is unaffected, as are steady-state mRNA levels. This suggests that 3\u2032 end processing of pre-mRNAs is not affected in pol IV or pol V mutants, but termination and Pol II release is impaired or delayed. Convergently-transcribed protein coding genes whose 3\u2032 regions overlap show the greatest increase in nascent RNA signals downstream of PolyA addition sites when Pol IV or Pol V are mutated. Those gene pairs also have a higher tendency to overlap with sites of Pol IV and Pol V occupancy, as measured by ChIP. However, these regions are not characterized by abundant 24-nt siRNAs or CHH methylation, suggesting that Pol II transcription termination does not require RdDM modification within termination zones for the majority of these genes. Collectively, our results suggest a methylation independent role for Pols IV and V in shaping the boundaries of Pol II transcription units. ResultsNascent transcript levels increase downstream of mRNA polyA addition sites in pol IV or pol V mutantsNascent RNA transcripts produced by template-engaged RNA polymerases in purified nuclei were generated by nuclear run-on (NRO) in the presence of biotin-UTP, allowing capture of the labeled RNAs using streptavidin beads. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, comparing reactions conducted using biotin-UTP versus unmodified UTP, were then used to calculate the fold enrichment achieved for biotinylated RNAs versus background for a set of highly-expressed Arabidopsis thaliana genes (Fig. S1). This analysis allowed us to estimate that nascent biotinylated RNA accounts for more than 99.7% of the RNA captured on the streptavidin beads, with background binding, attributable to unlabeled RNAs, accounting for the remaining 0.3%.\n\nWe performed nuclear run-on using nuclei of wild-type plants as well as pol IV and pol V mutant plants and constructed sequencing libraries for resulting RNAs (NRO-Seq library), as well as for purified total nuclear RNAs (RNA-Seq library), thus allowing comparisons between nascent and steady-state RNA levels (Fig. S2). To examine the distribution of RNA polymerase II activity we focused our analysis on 1\u00a0kb regions surrounding RefSeq transcription start sites (TSSs) or transcription end sites (TESs) for 27859 protein-coding genes (Fig.\u00a01). Both nascent RNA (Fig.\u00a01A) and steady-state RNA (Fig.\u00a01B) profiles show a sharp increase in RNA sequence reads starting at the TSS, followed by a plateau that begins \u223c200\u00a0bps downstream. This pattern contrasts with nascent RNA profiles reported for yeast and other eukaryotic organisms, in which peaks are often observed downstream of the TSS, reflecting promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II [36,38-42]. The absence of a promoter-proximal peak in the nascent RNA profile in Arabidopsis suggests that promoter-proximal pausing is not a general feature of Arabidopsis genes transcribed by Pol II. Similarly, no evidence of promoter-proximal pausing was observed in maize NRO data [37].\n\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 1.Loss of Pol IV or Pol V results in increased NRO-Seq read density downstream of protein-coding gene transcript end sites. (A,B) Average read densities are plotted relative to the transcription start sites (TSS) of 27,859 genes for nascent RNA (A) or steady-state RNA (B) isolated from Col-0, pol IV or pol V mutant plants. (C) Nascent RNA read-density plotted relative to transcript end sites (TES). (D) As in (C) but for steady-state RNA. Shadings represent 95% confidence intervals.Loss of Pol IV or V activity does not affect RNA Pol II read density profiles near TSSs for either nascent RNA (Fig.\u00a01A) or steady-state RNA (Fig.\u00a01B), suggesting that RNA polymerases IV and V exert no detectable influence on Pol II transcription initiation at protein-coding genes on a genome-wide scale.Analysis of the nascent RNA (NRO) read distribution in the 1\u00a0kb region surrounding the transcript end sites (TESs) revealed a gradual decrease in read abundance prior to the TES, followed by a small increase in reads \u223c100\u00a0bp post-TES (Fig.\u00a01C). This read density peak just downstream of TES in the nascent RNA population is not observed for steady-state RNA (Fig.\u00a01D), suggesting that post-TES RNA is removed by cleavage at the polyA addition site and thus absent from mature mRNAs. Interestingly, a further increase in nascent transcript abundance occurs downstream of TESs in pol IV or pol V mutant plants, suggesting increased in Pol II occupancy, possibly due to delayed termination or Pol II release (Fig.\u00a01C).To determine if specific genes have dramatically altered Pol II occupancy downstream of TESs in pol IV or pol V mutants, we calculated a transcript end site \u2013 associated termination index (TES-TI) for each gene as the number of total reads in the first 500\u00a0bp downstream of the TES (interval 2) divided by the number of total reads in the 500\u00a0bp preceding the TES (interval 1) (Fig.\u00a02A). Approximately 12% of the 18,419 protein coding genes analyzed exhibit a two fold or greater increase in their termination index in pol IV (nrpd1\u20133) or pol V (nrpe1\u201311) mutants, compared to wild-type (Fig.\u00a02B). Profiles for these genes, plotted as in Fig.\u00a01, are shown in Fig.\u00a02C. A strong concordance (\u223c80% overlap) is observed for genes affected in pol IV or pol V mutant plants (Fig.\u00a02B, Venn diagram). A set of 1312 genes, affected at least two fold by both pol IV and pol V, was chosen for all subsequent analyses. Loss of Pol IV or Pol V activities did not cause detectable lengthening of mature mRNAs for these genes, suggesting that RNA processing still occurs (Fig.\u00a02D). Examples of protein-coding genes with increased read density downstream of TES are shown in Fig.\u00a02E.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Genes with increased read density downstream of their transcript end sites (TES) in pol IV or pol V mutant plants.

Prior to circularization total RNA from Col-0, pol IV or pol V mutant plants was subjected to decapping by Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP) to provide 5\u2032-monophosphorylated terminus. Longer circularized transcripts were detected in pol IV and pol V mutant plants, compared to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig.\u00a03B, Fig. S3). Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed that the majority of clones support the annotated gene models, but for the At5g24670 transcript 14% of the cloned cDNAs in nrpd1 and 24% of the cDNA clones in nrpe1 include sequences downstream of the annotated TES (Fig.\u00a03C), suggesting that 3\u2032 end processing may be less efficient in pol IV or pol V mutants. However, we speculate that the impaired RNA processing might not be the major factor that causes increase in post-TES reads in pol IV or pol V mutant plants as loss of Pol IV or Pol V activities did not result in detectable lengthening of mature mRNAs for these genes in RNA-Seq experiment (Fig.\u00a02D), suggesting that RNA processing still occurs.\n\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 3.Transcripts with increased read density post-TES in pol IV or pol V mutant plants exhibit a longer termination zone.

Numbers on the right represent observed increase (in nt) in the length of the transcripts relatively to mature transcripts. Significance has been tested using one-tailed Chi-square test.Pol II occupancy correlates with nuclear run-on signal intensityUsing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of exonuclease-trimmed chromatin-protein complexes (ChIP-exo), we examined Pol II association with genes displaying increased (>2x) post-TES nascent RNA-seq read density in pol IV or pol V mutants (Fig.\u00a04). The ChIP-exo method allows high resolution mapping of DNA binding factors due to the exonuclease trimming of sequences not protected by the bound protein [43]. Consistent with NRO-seq results, the ChIP-exo sequence data revealed increased Pol II association with gene 3\u2032 ends in pol IV mutants (Fig.\u00a04A), compared to Col-0 wild-type, with a strong peak downstream of the TESs. In contrast, no differences in RNA Pol II occupancy was observed near the transcription start sites for the same set of genes (Fig.\u00a04B), suggesting an asymmetric affect at gene 3\u2032 ends.\n\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 4.Pol II accumulates near TESs in pol IV mutant plants.

(B) As in (A) but reads are plotted relative to TSSs. Shadings represent 95% confidence intervals.Genes with Pol IV and V \u2013 affected transcription termination associate with RdDM pathway componentsWe examined published Pol IV [44], Pol V [17], and AGO4 [45] ChIP-seq datasets to see if these proteins are enriched near the 3\u2032 ends of genes that show increased Pol II occupancy post-TES in pol IV or V mutant plants. Interestingly, 60% of 1312 genes with increased TES-proximal read density have the 1\u00a0kb region surrounding their TESs occupied by at least one of the above-mentioned proteins, with Pol V being present at 50% of these genes (Fig.\u00a05A). Analysis of Pol V ChIP-seq [17], read distribution in wild-type (Col-0) plants revealed Pol V association primarily upstream of TESs, with an additional peak, compared to background (nrpe1\u201311), downstream of the TES (Fig.\u00a05B). Analysis of Pol IV ChIP-seq [44], data did not reveal evidence for a similar pattern of enrichment (Fig. S4).\n\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 5.Correspondence between genes with increased read density post-TES and RdDM pathway proteins. (A) Venn diagram showing number of genes with TES-TI (mutant/Col-0) \u2265 2 that overlap sites enriched by at least 1.5 fold over the corresponding background signal for Pol IV, Pol V or AGO4 proteins (Pol IV [44], Pol V [17], and AGO4 [45] ChIP-seq datasets) within 2\u00a0kb regions centered at their TES. (B) Pol V ChIP-seq read density for Col-0 and pol V mutant plants (Wierzbicki et\u00a0al., 2012) (SRX156079 and SRX156080)) were plotted relative to TESs for the 1312 genes affected by both Pol IV and Pol V. Shadings represent 95% confidence intervals.Only 113 genes (8.6% of 1312 genes with increased post-TES read density in pol IV or pol V mutant plants) show enrichment of AGO4 near their TESs and only 54 (4%) of these genes also exhibit increased Pol V occupancy (Fig.\u00a05A). Thus, only a small percent of analyzed genes could potentially have a transcriptionally active Pol V that could recruit AGO4 protein to target loci either via AGO hook motifs (present in Pol V C-terminal domain) or by base-paring between siRNA of the AGO4-siRNA complex with Pol V transcripts [16,46] Alternatively (or in addition), physical interaction between Pol II and AGO4 could play a role in recruiting AGO4 to these loci [47].Fewer than 1% (12 out of 1312) of the analyzed genes were occupied by all three proteins, suggesting that loci with increased post-TES NRO signal are not likely subjects of RNA-directed DNA methylation. To further confirm this statement we examine whether 23\u201324\u00a0nt siRNAs map near TESs of genes affected by the loss of Pol IV or Pol V. Only 4.2% of affected genes overlap with 23\u201324\u00a0nt and 3.5% with 21\u201322\u00a0nt siRNA reads within a 1\u00a0kb region surrounding the TESs (Fig. S5A). To exclude these outliers, we sorted genes with TES-TI based on the sRNA read density within 1\u00a0kb region surrounding their TESs and removed 130 genes (top 10%). The remaining 1,182 genes were used in sRNA and DNA methylation metagene profiles (Figs. S6 & S7). 21\u00a0nt and 24\u00a0nt sRNA read distribution, as well as cytosine methylation (in CG, CHG, and CHH sequence contexts (H indicates non-G nucleotides)), near the TESs for genes with increased read density post-TES were comparable to profiles obtained for random set of genes (Figs. S6 & S7). This analysis detected some reduction in CHH methylation just downstream of the TES in pol V mutant plants suggesting that Pol V might function at least on some of these loci (Fig. S7G). Additional analysis of the 500\u00a0bp region immediately downstream of TES revealed that ratios of DNA methylated sites (Col-0/mt) for genes with TES-TI were similar (and with smaller median values) as compared to two random sets of genes (Fig. S7C, F, & I). Consistently, no significant overlap was observed between 1312 genes with increased read density post-TES and CHH or CHG hypo-methylated regions reported for pol IV [48], and pol V [49], mutants (Fig. S5C, D), as well as no correlation between post-TES read density and DNA methylation was detected in rdd (ros1\u20133 dml2\u20131 dml3\u20131) triple mutant [50], that lacks nearly all DNA demethylation activity (Figs. S5B & S8). This suggests that for the majority of genes the effect of Pol IV and Pol V on Pol II transcription termination is unlikely to be due to RNA-directed DNA methylation. Consistently, we found that TEs are not more prevalent among 1312 genes with increased post-TES reads as compared to random set of genes of the same size, suggesting that increased read density post-TES does not result from de-repression of transposable elements (TEs) that could be present within these regions (Fig. S9A).\n\n\nConsistent with previous report [46] lack of CHH methylation and siRNA accumulation at these sites suggests that Pol V is not transcriptionally engaged. Indeed, analysis of Pol V RIP-seq data [46] revealed that only 3.5% of genes with increased Pol II occupancy post TES in pol IV or V mutants overlap with Pol V-associated transcripts (Fig. S9B).Pol II accumulation near the TES region is increased for convergent gene pairsInterestingly, convergent gene pairs were significantly enriched among genes with increased post-TES read density in pol IV or pol V mutant plants (Fig.\u00a06A). Furthermore, these genes tend to have neighboring genes that initiate or end within 100\u00a0bps downstream or 100\u00a0bps upstream of their TESs (Fig.\u00a06B).Open in a separate windowFigure 6.post-TES read accumulation is more prevalent among convergent gene pairs. (A) Histogram showing the percent of convergent genes among all protein-coding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana versus genes displaying increased post-TES read density in pol IV or pol V mutant plants. P-value was calculated using Fisher's exact test. (B) Histogram showing the percent of genes with increased post-TES read density in pol IV or pol V mutant plants that have the nearest neighbor gene initiating or ending at various distances (x-axes) from their transcript end sites (TES).Regulation of transcription termination of convergent gene pairs might be an important mechanism to modulate levels of natural anti-sense transcripts (NATs) in cells as the base-pairing between sense and antisense transcripts can form dsRNAs, which can be then processed into cis-NAT-derived siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) via unique Pol IV-dependent pathway and lead to down-regulation of transcript levels though mRNA cleavage [51,52]. Analysis of antisense and sense reads revealed that both were increased within 1\u00a0kb region surrounding TESs for genes with increased Pol II occupancy post-TES in pol IV or V mutant plants (Fig. S10A). This increase of sense and antisense reads near TESs likely reflects Pol II activity as it coincides with increase in Pol II occupancy within this region (Fig.\u00a04). However, we did not detect the expected increase in numbers of neither 21\u201322\u00a0nt nor 23\u201324\u00a0nt sRNA clusters (Fig. S10B) nor did we detect statistically significant changes in transcript abundance for either gene in the convergent gene pairs (Fig. S10C), although it is possible that a specific abiotic or biotic stress condition might be required. Indeed, gene ontology analysis revealed that genes with increased post-TES read density are enriched for transcripts involved in response to abiotic stress (P\u00a0 = 8.0 \u00d7 10\u22126) (Fig S11). DiscussionNuclear run-on combined with high-throughput sequencing (NRO-Seq)[36] and RNA-Seq [53] revealed that Pol IV and Pol V affect Pol II occupancy downstream of polyA addition sites (TESs) for approximately 12% of protein-coding genes. Consistently, Pol IV or Pol V interaction sites include the TES regions for genes that display increased NRO signals downstream of TESs in pol IV or pol V mutant plants.A similar study in Zea mays (maize) examined nascent RNA transcripts in wild-type and pol IV mutant plants and found a similar effect of Pol IV on RNA Pol II transcription termination [37]. RDR2-dependent 24-nt siRNAs were enriched at maize 3\u2032 gene ends immediately downstream of TESs, suggesting a presence of transcriptionally active Pol IV near TESs of Pol II-transcribed genes in maize. In that study the authors speculated that Pol IV might play a role in the proper termination of Pol II transcription and in the prevention of inappropriate read-through transcription into downstream neighboring genes or TE. We found that in Arabidopsis 24-nt siRNAs and CHH methylation were enriched on a small subset of genes that exhibit longer termination zone in pol IV or pol V mutant plants. However, for the majority of these genes there was no enrichment for 24-nt siRNAs and/or changes in CHH methylation, a hallmark of Pol IV and Pol V \u2013 dependent RdDM. Thus, for the majority of genes any influence of Pol IV or Pol V on Pol II transcription termination is likely independent of RNA-directed DNA methylation.Pol II elongation rates can affect co-transcriptional processes such as transcription termination resulting in many RNA polymerase molecules continue transcribing post-TES [54]. Interestingly, genes with high post-TES NRO signals in pol IV or pol V mutant plants exhibit not only higher Pol II occupancy near TES (Fig.\u00a04), but also significantly higher rates of transcription, compared to all protein-coding genes (Fig S12 & Fig.\u00a02E). Elongation rate could be influenced by various factors that can modulate Pol II transcription efficiency directly (e.g. elongation factors) or indirectly, by changing chromatin organization (chromatin remodelers). Pol V transcription can recruit the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, such that a loss of Pol V transcripts correlates with changes in nucleosome positioning [55]. Whether or not Pol IV can similarly affect chromatin states has not yet been determined. However, CLASSY1, a putative ATP-dependent DNA translocase, has been implicated in Pol IV function and speculated to affect nucleosome repositioning, similar to SWI/SNF [56,57]. Thus, Pol IV or Pol V \u2013 mediated chromatin organization near Pol II TESs may influence Pol II elongation rates and its subsequent termination or release from the template (Fig.\u00a07). Interestingly, a recent study by Rowley et\u00a0al., (2017) [58] discovered a role of Pol V and AGO4 in long range chromosomal interactions. Thus, it is possible that effect of Pol IV or Pol V on Pol II elongation rate and/or termination efficiency is influenced by their role in 3D chromatin organization.Open in a separate windowFigure 7.Model for RNA Pol IV or Pol V involvement in RNA Pol II transcription termination. Pol IV or Pol V may impede Pol II to promote transcript cleavage and release at Pol II convergent genes. In the absence of Pol IV or Pol V, Pol II undergoes head-to-head collision and pausing.Interestingly, convergent gene pairs tend to show the highest post-TES NRO signals in pol IV or pol V mutant plants. Convergent transcription can result in head-to-head collisions of transcribing Pol II enzymes [59]. Though such events are expected to be rare, Pol II collision doesn't result in polymerase dissociation from the template but leads to transcriptional arrest and gene blockage [59]. To date, not much is known about how cells deal with collision-induced transcription blocks. However, Pol II ubiquitination-mediated degradation has been shown to be involved in clearing Pol II from the region between convergent genes, such that lack of the yeast RNA Pol II ubiquitination/degradation protein ELC1 results in a peak of RNA Pol II density between convergent genes [59]. A possibility is that, similar to transcription factor for ribosomal protein coding genes, Reb1,[60] Pol IV or Pol V occupancy at intergenic DNA may reduce RNA polymerase II collisions by slowing or dissociating Pol II, thus allowing more efficient transcription termination. Analysis of non-convergent gene models with increased read density post-TES revealed that Pol V association is predominantly upstream of TESs (Fig. S13). Consistently, we observed lower Pol II occupancy just upstream of TES (Fig.\u00a02C) in pol IV or pol V mutant plants.Alternatively, or in addition, Pol IV or Pol V can recruit factors that ensure proper processing of 3\u2032 ends of RNA or degradation of the read-through post-TES fragments of the original transcripts (Fig.\u00a07). Indeed, Pol V has been shown to interact with putative 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease, RRP6L1 [57]. In yeast, deletion of RRP6 results in improperly processed 3\u2032 RNA ends and faulty transcript termination at specific target genes [60,61].Pausing or slowing down of Pol II near the TESs during transcription termination is thought to facilitate co-transcriptional splicing [54,62,63]. Interestingly, splicing was much less efficient in pol IV or pol V mutant plants, compared to wild-type (Fig. S14), suggesting that Pol IV or Pol V affect pre-mRNA processing at the level of transcription. Alternatively, or in addition, Pol IV or Pol V might facilitate recruitment of splicing factors [64]. For example, a U4/U6 snRNP-associated protein, RDM16, is enriched at Pol V target loci, suggesting that RDM16 might be recruited by Pol V and/or by the nascent Pol V transcripts [65]. Materials and methodsPlant materialA. thaliana Col-0 and nrpd1\u20133 and nrpe1\u201311 have been described previously [2,15]. Plants were cultivated at 22\u00b0C under long-day conditions (16\u00a0h day/8\u00a0h night).Nuclei isolationNuclei were isolated from 3\u00a0week old Col-0, nrpd1\u20133 and nrpe1\u201311 plant seedlings as described previously [66] with a few modifications. Briefly, 3\u00a0week-old plants were harvested and washed in ice-cold water. Then plants were submerged in cold diethyl ether for 5\u00a0min and washed twice in ice-cold water. Homogenization of plant material was performed in 100\u00a0mL of nuclei isolation buffer (1M sucrose, 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 5\u00a0mM MgCl, 5\u00a0mM KCl, 10\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethnol, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF) with a motorized homogenizer (Fisher Scientific Powergen 700). Homogenate was filtered through 1 layer of Miracloth and 1 layer of 50\u00a0um of nylon mesh. After centrifugation at 14,000\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C the pellet was resuspended in 10\u00a0min of nuclei isolation buffer and prepared for loading into discontinuous Percoll gradient (15%, 30%, 45%, and 60%) by adding one volume of \u201c100% Percoll solution\u201d (34.23\u00a0g sucrose, 5\u00a0mL 1\u00a0M Tris-HCl [pH 7.2], 0.5\u00a0mL 1\u00a0M MgCl2, 0.5\u00a0mL 1\u00a0M KCl, 34 uL 2-mercaptoethnol, 100\u00a0uL 2\u00a0mM PMSF and Percoll to 100\u00a0mL) to 19 volumes of nuclei. Gradients were centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min, then 7,500\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min. Nuclei were harvested from 30%/45% and 45%/60% boundaries and pooled. Nuclei were diluted with 5 volumes of nuclei isolation buffer, mixed by inversion and collected by centrifugation at 1,500\u00a0g, 10\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C. Second wash of nuclei was performed with 25 volumes of nuclei isolation buffer. Final resuspension of nuclei was in 1\u00a0mL of nuclei storage buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.2], 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM KCl, 2\u00a0mM DTT, 0.2\u00a0mM PMSF, 50% glycerol). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.Nuclear run-on (NRO)NRO reactions were performed as described previously [36]with a few modifications. Briefly, 10 in vitro transcription reactions (each containing 190\u00a0uL of nuclei, 60\u00a0uL 5x Txn buffer (100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, [pH 7.7], 6\u00a0uL 0.1\u00a0M DTT, 5\u00a0uL RiboLock, 12\u00a0uL Biotin-16-UTP (10\u00a0mM), 16\u00a0uL AGC (10\u00a0mM each)) were set up in parallel for each plant line examined and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol method, treated with Turbo DNase I. An aliquot of total RNA was used for total RNA library contruction (see Materials and Methods). Biotinylated RNA was precipitated from total RNA with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen, Calsbad, CA). Binding was performed in 5\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.7], 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA and 1\u00a0M NaCl for 20\u00a0min at 42\u00b0C and 2\u00a0hours at room temperature with rotation. After washes, RNA was eluted from beads by adding 50\u00a0uL of 10\u00a0uM EDTA/95% formamide and incubation at 65\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.RNA library constructionLibraries from total and eluted biotinylated RNA were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit. No rRNA depletion steps were performed. Libraries were subjected to 50\u00a0bp paired-end sequencing.exoChIP library constructionChromatin cross-linking, isolation and shearing were carried out as previously described with slight modifications [15]. Briefly, three grams of three-week old leaf tissue was suspended in 35\u00a0ml SH Buffer (100\u00a0mM sucrose, 20\u00a0mM HEPES-NaOH) containing 1% formaldehyde and placed under vacuum for 55\u00a0minutes. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 1.25\u00a0ml 2\u00a0M Glycine. Leaf tissue was washed three times with water. Tissue was ground in mortar with pestle and suspended in 15\u00a0ml Honda buffer (0.44\u00a0M Sucrose, 1.25% Ficoll, 2.5% Dextran T40, 20\u00a0mM HEPES-NaOH pH7.4, 10\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5\u00a0mM DTT, 1\u00a0mM PMSF, 1% Plant Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). Slurry was passed through Miracloth and centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 15\u00a0minutes at 4\u00a0C. The pellet was resuspended in 1\u00a0ml Honda buffer and centrifuged as above. Again, the pellet was resuspended in Honda buffer, centrifuged as above and the pellet was resuspended in 575 microliters of Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH8, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1\u00a0mM PMSF, 1% Plant Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). Chromatin was sheared using a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode) to generate fragment sizes between 200 and 600\u00a0bp. Sheared chromatin was centrifuged for 10\u00a0minutes at 4\u00a0C at 12,000 x g. The supernatant was removed and diluted ten fold with ChIP Dilution Buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 16.7\u00a0mM NaCl, 16.7\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH8). Aliquots containing approximately 6\u00a0mg of chromatin were shipped to Peconic, LLC for ChIP-exo sequencing. ChIP-exo was carried out as described in [67]. Five microliters of the 4H8 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), which recognizes the Pol II CTD with a preference towards the phosphoS5 form, was used for immunoprecipitation.Circular RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. 10\u00a0ug of RNA was decapped by treatment with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP) (Epicentre) to provide 5\u2032-monophosphorylated terminus that was ligated to a 3\u2032-hydrohylated terminus by T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB, 10,000\u00a0U/uL) according to manufacture instructions. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hour, enzymes were heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min and reactions were cleaned up and concentrated with Zymogen RNA Clean and Concentrator kit. The resulted RNA was treated with Turbo DNase I, reverse-transcribed with gene-specific reverse primer. Two rounds of PCR amplification was followed by PCR clean up (Qiagen PCR clean up kit) and DNA cloning into pGEMT easy vector according to manufacturer's instructions. Individual colonies were grown and used for DNA extraction and sequencing.PrimersAT5G36700_F1ccaaaagaagcggaaacagaAT5G36700_RccgccacagaaagaagaagaAT5G36700_F2atttgcagtgcctttgtgtgAT5G24670_F1tcatcattgttgtttccttctcaAT5G24670_RatgagcggagcagctactgtAT5G24670_F2gcgcttgtgcatcaaagaatOpen in a separate windowSequence processingReads were adapter trimmed and quality filtered (q20) using trimmomatic and then mapped to TAIR10 genome reference using tophat. All transposable elements, tRNAs, and ribosomal RNAs, as well as genes in the mitochondria and chloroplast genomes were excluded from analysis. The reads were further filtered to remove low complexity reads (with the entropy of 2 or less) using custom Perl scripts. Only read alignments mapped concordantly (e.g. with correct orientation and separated by less than 7,000\u00a0bps from each other) were selected for subsequent analysis. The 7,000\u00a0bp distance cut off was based on the 99.9% intron length in the TAIR10 annotation. Read data was converted into coverage information in the form of strand specific bed files. Cumulative coverage data was determined in a strand-specific way from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of genes as defined in the TAIR10 gene file. The read counts between samples were normalized based on the total number of reads mapped for each sample. AT2G16586 was excluded from analysis due to it having an extremely high and variable coverage between samples.Read-through analysisTES-termination index (TES-TI) was determined in the NRO and total RNA libraries by calculating ratios of read density 500\u00a0bp downstream of the TES to read density in the body of the gene 500\u00a0bp upstream of TES. For each gene, TES-TI was calculated in Col-0, nrpd1\u20133 and nrpe1\u201311 backgrounds.ChIP data processingAmong the annotated TAIR10 nuclear protein coding genes, pairs of consecutive genes with their 3\u2032 ends facing each other and separated by at least 1\u00a0kb were identified as convergent genes. Among these, any gene pairs overlapping with miRNA or tRNA or snRNA or snoRNA or rRNA or other non-coding RNA were excluded, resulting in 1,453 gene pairs (2,906 genes) that were used in the analysis.\u00a0For each of these 2,906 genes, coverage information at each base position starting from 1000\u00a0nt upstream of the 3\u2032 end into the gene body to 1000\u00a0nt downstream of the 3\u2032 end was obtained and total coverage contributed by all 2,906 genes at base position was computed and plotted.Bisulfite sequencing analysesBisulfite sequencing reads were quality processed (q >/ = 25) and adapter trimmed using Cutadapt version 1.9.1 [68]. Cleaned reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 genome using Bismark version 0.16.1 default settings [69]. PCR duplicates were removed and methylation information for cytosines in the CHH context with a minimum 5 read coverage were used for further analyses. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that showed a minimum 10% increase in methylation levels in rdd relative to Col-0 were identified using the R package methylKit version 0.9.5 [70]. Regions were defined using a 300 base pair sliding windows with a step size of 200 base pairs. The minimum coverage requirement for each window was 10 cytosines with at least 5 read coverage each and significance was defined as a q value less than 0.01. Overlapping DMRs were merged into a single region and genomic coordinates of rdd hyper-methylated regions (relative to Col-0) were used to assess overlap with regions flanking the 3\u2032 end of genes of interest 500 basepairs upstream and 500 basepairs downstream. Accession numbers for Col-0 and rdd bisulfite sequencing data are {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM276809\",\"term_id\":\"276809\"}}GSM276809 and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM276812\",\"term_id\":\"276812\"}}GSM276812, respectively [71].sRNA sequencing analysesRaw reads were adapter and quality trimmed and size selected using Cutadapt version 1.9.1. Reads were further filtered of all structural RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs) and mapped to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 genome using ShortStack version 3.4 default settings [72]. sRNA counts for regions of interest were extracted from bam files using the ShortStack \u2013locifile file function and 21\u201324nt siRNA clusters were defined using a minimum read coverage of 25 reads. The accession number for Col-0, nrpd1\u20133, and nrpe1\u201311 sRNA sequencing data are SRR2075819, SRR2505369, and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2451982\",\"term_id\":\"2451982\"}}GSM2451982, respectively [6].Data availabilityRaw Illumina reads are deposited to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE101543\",\"term_id\":\"101543\"}}GSE101543) and are available through http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.
