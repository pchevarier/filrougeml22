{"title": "In vitro analysis of a transcription termination site for RNA polymerase II", "pubDate": "1990", "PMCID": "PMC361356", "DOI": "10.1128/mcb.10.11.5782-5795.1990", "PMID": "2233718", "abstract": "Transcription from the adenovirus major late (ML) promoter has previously been shown to pause or terminate prematurely in vivo and in vitro at a site within the first intron of the major late transcription unit. We are studying the mechanism of elongation arrest at this site in vitro to define the DNA sequences and proteins that determine the elongation behavior of RNA polymerase II. Our assay system consists of a nuclear extract prepared from cultured human cells. With standard reaction conditions, termination is not observed downstream of the ML promoter. However, in the presence of Sarkosyl, up to 80% of the transcripts terminate 186 nucleotides downstream of the start site. Using this assay, we showed that the DNA sequences required to promote maximal levels of termination downstream of the ML promoter reside within a 65-base-pair region and function in an orientation-dependent manner. To test whether elongation complexes from the ML promoter were functionally homogeneous, we determined the termination efficiency at each of two termination sites placed in tandem. We found that the behavior of the elongation complexes was different at these sites, with termination being greater at the downstream site over a wide range of Sarkosyl concentrations. This result ruled out a model in which the polymerases that read through the first site were stably modified to antiterminate. We also demonstrated that the ability of the elongation complexes to respond to the ML termination site was promoter specific, as the site did not function efficiently downstream of a heterologous promoter. Taken together, the results presented here are not consistent with the simplest class of models that have been proposed previously for the mechanism of Sarkosyl-induced termination.", "author": [{"author": "D K Wiest", "affiliation": ["Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene 97403."], "href": "/?term=Wiest+DK&cauthor_id=2233718"}, {"author": "D K Hawley", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Hawley+DK&cauthor_id=2233718"}], "refPMID": ["3768956", "3457470", "2432061", "3818644", "2434502", "3558392", "3615200", "3498214", "2960589", "2825027", "2449431", "2834065", "3380090", "3136931", "3416355", "2846852", "2911563", "2784203", "2854091", "2708335", "2722877", "2542336", "2471707", "2474547", "2677669", "2479649", "2307371", "2157481", "2193290", "4472294", "271968", "423992", "6985606", "7440580", "7020755", "6286139", "7142220", "6828386", "6888276", "6200476", "6206069", "6091120", "6209554", "2409080", "2409288", "3925456", "2410138", "3860504", "2411548", "2996833", "3021336"], "citedInPMID": ["2233718", "28365028", "15047857", "11564888", "11278887", "11250906", "9869639", "8871561", "8636112", "8474437", "8423795", "8400453", "8381534", "8341675", "7971997", "7744757", "7529406", "7520569", "2062639", "2034691", "1717827", "1715021", "1569941", "1501301", "1373806"], "body": ""}
