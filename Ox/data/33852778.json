Mouse EpiSCs maintain their self\u2010renewal capacity via signaling through the Activin/Nodal and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/ERK pathways; furthermore, Wnt signaling pathway inhibition can favor EpiSC growth and pluripotency.\n4\n EpiSCs also possess the potential to differentiate into cells of the three germ\u2010layers, can form teratomas, and undergo random X\u2010chromosome inactivation like the postimplantation epiblast.\n3\n Overall, EpiSCs represent a valuable tool for the understanding of critical developmental mechanisms. In the first of our Featured Articles published this month in STEM CELLS Translational Medicine, Gao et al employ a massive mutagenesis protocol in their newly developed mouse haploid EpiSCs to identify candidate genes that modulate the reprogramming of EpiSCs to na\u00efve pluripotency.\n5\n In a Related Article published recently in STEM CELLS, Sudheer et al highlighted the important role of FGF signaling in the differentiation of mouse ESCs through an EpiSC\u2010like state into distinct presomitic mesodermal cell types in a study that may permit a deeper understanding of musculoskeletal disorders that arise during early development.\n6\n\nBacterial and viral pneumonia and sepsis represent the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which remains a leading cause of disability and death in critically ill patients.\n7\n Excessive pulmonary inflammation mediated by the reaction of resident macrophages to infection represents the main characteristic of ARDS pathophysiology.\n8\n Although the search for effective treatments for ARDS has been ongoing for many years, this area has recently come under sharp focus due to the worldwide impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), a pneumonia\u2010like disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102).\n9\n, \n10\n Severe COVID\u201019 patients present with hyper\u2010inflammation, an overactive immune response that triggers a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d and a prothrombotic state that can progress to ARDS development, with reported patient mortality reaching over 50%.\n11\n Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy represents a potentially effective treatment option for ARDS, with ongoing trials now evaluating this approach in severe COVID\u201019 patients and related research attempting to delineate the molecular mechanisms behind the therapeutic effect of MSCs in the bacterially\u2010induced form of the disease. In the second of our Featured Articles published this month in STEM CELLS Translational Medicine, Lanzoni et al report on the encouraging findings of a double\u2010blind, randomized, controlled, early phase clinical trial of umbilical cord\u2010derived MSC treatment in patients with COVID\u201019\u2010related ARDS.\n12\n In a Related Article published recently in STEM CELLS, Jackson et al demonstrated that mitochondrial transfer to macrophages represents a crucial mechanism by which MSCs mediate their therapeutic capacity in bacterially\u2010induced ARDS.\n13\n\n FEATURED ARTICLESHaploid Epiblast Stem Cell\u2010Based Screen Highlights Modulators of Na\u00efve ReprogrammingHaploid EpiSCs, which contain just one set of chromosomes, could provide a powerful platform to study a variety of biological processes through genetic screening; however, attempts to derive such cells from postimplantation embryos have failed, mainly due to the severe diploidization observed during differentiation.\n14\n, \n15\n In the hope of solving this vexing problem, researchers led by Luyuan Li, Yan Liu, and Ling Shuai (Nankai University, Tianjin, China) recently sought to generate haploid EpiSCs with the help of a p53 knockout\n16\n and then apply them to genetic screening to delineate the mechanisms involved in mammalian reprogramming. As reported in STEM CELLS Translational Medicine,\n5\n Gao et al generated haploid EpiSCs from postimplantation chimeric mouse embryos at embryonic day 6.5, discovering that they shared molecular characteristics with wild\u2010type diploid EpiSCs and possessed the expected primed\u2010state morphology. Importantly, these EpiSCs also maintained their haploid nature, expressed EpiSC\u2010specific genes, possessed a stable genome, and exhibited the potential to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers, which encouraged the authors to explore their utility in genetic screening approaches. Employing a massive mutagenesis protocol, they screened for candidates that inhibit reprogramming of EpiSCs to the na\u00efve state (like mouse ESCs) and validated Hst3st3b1, a gene that encodes heparan sulfate glucosamine 3\u2010O\u2010sulfotransferase 3B1 (a key component in generating heparan sulfate fine structures involved in diverse biologic activities), as a prime candidate. Overall, this exciting study provides evidence for the utility of haploid EpiSCs in research into fundamental biological processes.\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0468\nTrialing Umbilical Cord\u2010MSCs as a Treatment for COVID\u201019\u2010Related ARDS\nPatients who develop severe cases of COVID\u201019, a pneumonia\u2010like disease caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus infection, can often progress to ARDS. A reported mortality in patients with COVID\u201019 and ARDS of over 50%\n11\n highlights the dire need for novel therapies that can attenuate the excessive inflammatory response, accelerate the recovery of functional lung tissue, and reduce mortality rates. Researchers led by Camillo Ricordi (University of Miami, Florida) recently reported the results at one month of follow\u2010up of a double\u2010blind, phase I/IIa, randomized, controlled trial to establish safety and explore the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord\u2010derived (UC\u2010) MSC infusions\n17\n, \n18\n in hospitalized patients with ARDS secondary to COVID\u201019. As reported in STEM CELLS Translational Medicine,\n12\n Lanzoni et al evaluated 24 patients randomized to a UC\u2010MSC group, who received two intravenous infusions of 100 million UC\u2010MSCs 72\u2009hours apart, or a control vehicle\u2010treated group. The trial failed to observe any adverse events or serious adverse events associated with UC\u2010MSC infusions, suggesting the safety of this approach. Furthermore, exploratory efficacy analyses suggested that UC\u2010MSC infusions associated with a decrease in pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines linked to COVID\u201019\u2010related \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and a significant improvement in patient survival, serious adverse effect\u2010free survival, and time to recovery. Overall, these highly encouraging findings support larger trials to estimate and establish the efficacy of UC\u2010MSC\u2010based therapy for severe COVID\u201019 patients suffering from ARDS.\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0472\n RELATED ARTICLESExploring the Influence of FGF on ESC Differentiation into Presomitic MesodermThe presomitic mesoderm (PSM) of the developing embryo represents the precursor of the segmental somites that eventually give rise to the axial skeleton and skeletal muscles, tendons, dorsal dermis, and adipose tissue.\n19\n, \n20\n A recent STEM CELLS article by researchers led by Smita Sudheer and Bernhard G. Herrmann (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany) reported a protocol for the efficient induction of PSM from mouse ESCs after passing through an EpiSC\u2010like state that was developed with the help of mesodermal/presomitic mesoderm marker gene reporters.\n6\n The activation of Wnt signaling by glycogen synthase kinase\u20103 inhibition (via CHIR99021 or \u201cCH\u201d treatment) prompted the formation of EpiSC\u2010like cells (primed pluripotency) from ground state ESCs (na\u00efve pluripotency), with FGF signaling then promoting the high\u2010efficiency induction of PSM; however, the authors discovered that altering FGF concentrations altered the state of the PSM cells. While high FGF concentrations supported posterior (nascent) PSM formation, low FGF concentrations generated anterior (maturing/differentiating) PSM, in agreement with previous in vivo findings. Furthermore, the study discovered that Activin/Nodal inhibition enhanced Wnt/FGF signaling to promote the induction of PSM. Overall, the team behind this exciting research hoped that their findings would support further research employing the directed differentiation of ESCs into the gene regulatory networks that control PSM formation and differentiation, which may ultimately foster a deeper understanding of musculoskeletal disorders that arise during early development.\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/stem.2371\nDefining the Mechanisms Involved in MSC Therapy for ARDS\nResearchers led by Anna Krasnodembskaya (Queen's University of Belfast, UK) previously demonstrated how the secretion of antimicrobial factors\n21\n and the modulation of phagocytic capacity of host monocytes\n22\n and alveolar macrophages\n23\n mediated the antimicrobial effect of MSCs in ARDS models. Due to the increasing body of evidence suggesting the overall importance of direct cell contact between MSCs and target cells to therapeutic outcomes, the Krasnodembskaya lab recently explored the influence of mitochondrial transfer via tunneling nanotubes on bacterial clearance by innate immune cells following MSC therapy. As reported in their recent STEM CELLS article,\n13\n Jackson et al first employed an in vivo model of Escherichia coli\u2010induced pneumonia to demonstrate how MSC therapy failed in the absence of alveolar macrophages (induced by intranasal liposomal clodronate administration), and that mouse macrophages and human monocyte\u2010derived macrophages displayed enhanced bioenergetic and phagocytic activity in the presence of MSCs. Excitingly, fluorescent imaging and flow cytometry then highlighted the importance of cell\u2010to\u2010cell contact by linking the tunneling nanotube\u2010mediated transfer of mitochondria from MSCs to macrophages to these significantly improved activities. The authors underscored the overall importance of tunneling nanotubes by demonstrating how the inhibition of mitochondrial transfer from MSCs to macrophages by blocking tunneling nanotube formation (via Cytochalasin B or \u201cCytoB\u201d treatment) completely inhibited phagocytosis by macrophages and antimicrobial effect of administered MSCs. Overall, this fascinating study described a novel mechanism mediating the therapeutic effects of MSC administration in bacterially\u2010induced ARDS.\n\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/stem.2372\n Notes\n\nAtkinson SP.
