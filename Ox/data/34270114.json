Thus, integrating the PNI into the overall therapeutic strategy is of utmost importance given that effective management of patients with COVID\u201019 necessitates an accurate risk assessment.Owing to the findings of previous efforts, early risk stratification with an accurate and easily calculated parameter is crucial to prevent the progression of COVID\u201019.16, 17 However, it seems difficult to arrive at the best evidence\u2010based decision with respect to the current literature, as no prior study had been conducted systematically regarding the impact of the PNI on outcomes and prognosis among COVID\u201019 patients. In this study, first, we report the results of our patients to investigate the indicators of in\u2010hospital mortality and severity in patients with COVID\u201019. In addition, a supporting analysis consisting of a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of studies was performed to ascertain the prognostic effect of the PNI as a predictor of adverse outcomes in COVID\u201019 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODSEthical considerationsThe research complied with the principles of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants or their legal guardians gave written informed consent before inclusion in the study. The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (IR.TUMS.VCR.REC.1399.005).Study design and participantsIn this cross\u2010sectional study, we enrolled patients with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID\u201019 who were admitted to our hospital from February 16 to November 1, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of 504 patients above 18 years of age with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID\u201019 who fulfilled one of the following criteria: (1) participants with a real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of endotracheal or oropharyngeal swab that was positive for specimens for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) or (2) patients who were highly suspected to have COVID\u201019 based on the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance, encompassing those who had a history compatible with COVID\u201019 and had ground\u2010glass opacity accompanied by consolidation in chest computed tomography or ground\u2010glass opacity alone, not perfectly elucidated by nodules, lobar collapse, or volume overload.18\nTo ascertain the risk indicators of in\u2010hospital outcomes, patients were accurately divided into two groups for both the severity and in\u2010hospital mortality of COVID\u201019. It is noteworthy to mention that all patients were treated based on the WHO interim guidance.18 The demographics and clinical data of patients enrolled in this study were derived from patients' electronic medical records. Patients were appraised regarding demographics, past medical history, admission vital signs, laboratory data, and in\u2010hospital outcomes. Patients\u2019 laboratory measurements were examined accurately in the laboratory of our hospital.DefinitionsWe measured body mass index (BMI) as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure \u2265140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg or a history of antihypertensive treatment.19 Diabetes mellitus (DM) was determined as one of the following: (1) fasting blood glucose \u2265126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) on two occasions, (2) 2\u2010h plasma glucose \u2265200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) during the oral glucose tolerance test on two occasions, (3) glycated hemoglobin A1c \u22656.5% (47.5 mmol/mol), (4) a random test of plasma glucose \u2265200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, or (5) positive history of antidiabetic medication use, according to the latest American Diabetic Association guidelines.20 We designated cardiovascular disease as a history of coronary artery disease (stenosis of coronary artery \u226550%), heart failure, or receiving treatment for any of these conditions.A history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or interstitial lung disease was characterized as chronic respiratory disease. We characterized chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a renal replacement requirement or a glomerular filtration rate below 30 ml/h. Rheumatologic disease was diagnosed according to the Nomenclature and Classification Committee of the American Rheumatism Association.21 Malignancy was described as a history of treated neoplasm. Cerebrovascular disease (CVA) was specified as a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Current smoking was defined according to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) criteria.22\nWe ascertained acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on the Berlin definition criteria.23 Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as patients who met one of the following features (except for those with end\u2010stage renal disease): (1) urine volume <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h, (2) an increase in serum creatinine to \u22651.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days, or (3) an increase in serum creatinine by \u22650.3 mg/dl (>26.5 \u03bcmol/L) within 48 h.24 We denoted acute liver injury (ALI) as an increase in serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, as total bilirubin more than two units above the upper limit of normal (ULN), or as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at least three times the ULN.25 Acute cardiac injury (ACI) was determined if the serum level of highly sensitive (hs) cardiac troponin I was above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (11 pg/ml for women and 26 pg/ml for men).26\nMultiple organ dysfunction was diagnosed as patients with at least two complications, encompassing ACI, AKI, ALI, and ARDS. Severe disease was ascertained as patients with one of the following criteria: dyspnea, septic shock, respiratory failure, oxygen saturation \u226493% or >50% lung involvement on imaging, or multiple organ dysfunction/failure. The remaining patients were considered to have nonsevere COVID\u201019. The aforementioned criteria were determined similar to those in the study by Wu et\u00a0al and were modified to compare patients with severe vs nonsevere COVID\u201019.26 The PNI was calculated according to the following formula: PNI = 10 \u00d7 serum albumin level (g/dl) + 0.005 \u00d7 peripheral lymphocyte count (109/L).7\nSystematic review and meta\u2010analysisThe review was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses (PRISMA) guideline.27 The literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from the date of inception until February 2, 2021, without language or study type restriction, using the keywords [\u201cCOVID\u201019\u201d OR \u201cSARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u201d] AND [\u201cPrognostic Nutritional Index\u201d]. The detailed search strategy in each electronic database is described in the supplementary material. Secondary source investigations were identified by screening the bibliography of eligible studies, as well as a manual search in Google Scholar.After removing the duplicate records and irrelevant studies based on title and abstract review, full texts of all the remaining studies were assessed against the eligibility criteria, defined as studies (regardless of language or publication status) in hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients that assessed the prognostic significance of PNI on at least one of the two main outcomes under the study: (1) in\u2010hospital mortality or (2) disease severity. The severity of COVID\u201019 was assumed as the definition mentioned earlier or any similar definition.The following data were extracted from the included studies: study design (retrospective vs prospective), number of centers involved (single\u2010center vs multicenter), number of participants and their demographic features (age, sex, and BMI), PNI categories, and the results regarding the impact of PNI on the in\u2010hospital mortality and severity of COVID\u201019. The quality of the included studies was evaluated by using the Newcastle\u2010Ottawa scale (NOS).28 The process of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment was independently performed by two investigators, and discrepancies were solved by a meeting/discussion.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (version 14.2; Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA), and P\u00a0< .05 was considered significant. Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and compared using the independent\u2010samples t\u2010test. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages and compared by using the chi\u2010squared test. Baseline characteristics, including demographic features, comorbidities, and laboratory variables, alongside PNI were included in the univariate logistic regression to evaluate their association with the mortality and severity of COVID\u201019. The variables that were significantly correlated with the mortality or severity of COVID\u201019 were then analyzed in multivariate logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Ultimately, two prediction models for mortality and severity of COVID\u201019 were derived based on the parameters independently linked with the predefined outcomes in multivariate analyses. The prediction performance of the derived models, as well as the PNI, was investigated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The optimal cutoff values of the PNI for predicting mortality and severity of COVID\u201019 were determined based on the largest Youden index. Based on these cutoff values, the unadjusted and adjusted (for all the covariates previously included in the multivariate analyses) PNI prediction models regarding in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity were also proposed.Concerning the meta\u2010analysis, the pooled ORs of the PNI, as a continuous variable adjusted for the main confounding parameters, regarding the in\u2010hospital mortality and severity of COVID\u201019 were calculated using the random\u2010effects models. The statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by two tests: (1) the Cochran Q test, with a P\u2010value of <.05 signaling heterogeneity29 and (2) the Higgins I\n2 test (results interpreted as follows: 0%\u201340%, not important heterogeneity; 30%\u201360%, moderate heterogeneity; 50%\u201390%, moderate heterogeneity; 75%\u2013100%, substantial heterogeneity).30 Publication bias was explored with visual assessment of funnel plots and statistical calculation of Begg test, with a P\u2010value of <.05 signifying the presence of publication bias.31\n RESULTSPatient characteristicsA total of 504 hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients were included in this study, among which 101 (20.04%) patients died during the hospitalization, and 372 (73.81%) patients were categorized as severe cases. The diagnosis of COVID\u201019 was confirmed by PCR test in 339 (67.26%) patients.

These patients had higher serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), AST, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hs\u2010troponin I, and D\u2010dimer and lower levels of lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, and serum albumin. The PNI was significantly lower in the deceased patients (33.99 vs 40.11; P < .001). As expected, adverse clinical outcomes (for example, ARDS, AKI, ACI, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, and mechanical ventilation) occurred more frequently in the mortality group, and the length of stay was significantly higher in this group (10.23 vs 7.22 days; P < .001) (Table\u00a01).Regarding disease severity, patients with severe cases had a higher BMI (27.74 vs 26.57 kg/m2; P = .042), and a higher percentage had diabetes (33.87% vs 23.48%; P\u00a0= .027). These patients included fewer males (58.87% vs 68.94%; P = .041) and were more likely to develop ARDS, AKI, and ACI. Moreover, these patients required more ICU admissions, more mechanical ventilation, and a longer duration of hospital stay. Higher levels of LDH, CRP, and AST and lower serum albumin levels were detected in patients with the severe course of the disease. The PNI was significantly lower in the severe cases (38.09 vs 41.13; P < .001).Prediction modelsTwelve variables were significantly associated with in\u2010hospital mortality in univariate analysis: PNI (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.887, P < .001), age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.041, P < .001), hypertension (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.013, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), cardiovascular disease (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.645, P\u00a0=\u00a0.039), CVA (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.061, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005), hemoglobin (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.901, P\u00a0=\u00a0.023), LDH (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.001, P < .001), CRP (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.009, P < .001), AST (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.008, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), BUN (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.021, P < .001), hs\u2010troponin I (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.002, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), and D\u2010dimer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.0002, P < .001). Among these variables, three parameters remained significant in multivariate analysis and were included in the final prediction model: PNI (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.891; 95% CI, 0.822\u20130.967; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006), LDH (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.0017; 95% CI, 1.0003\u20131.0031; P\u00a0=\u00a0.017), and D\u2010dimer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.0002; 95% CI, 1.0001\u20131.0004; P\u00a0=\u00a0.044) (Table\u00a02).

Ultimately, the prediction model for COVID\u201019 severity consisted of four independent predictors in multivariate analysis: PNI (OR\u00a0= 0.938; 95% CI, 0.902\u20130.975; P\u00a0= .001), male sex (OR\u00a0= 0.530; 95% CI, 0.291\u20130.964; P\u00a0= .038), DM (OR\u00a0= 1.984; 95% CI, 1.067\u20133.689; P\u00a0= .030), and LDH (OR\u00a0= 1.0021; 95% CI, 1.0008\u20131.0035; P\u00a0= .002) (Table\u00a02). The AUC of this prediction model was 0.688 (Figure\u00a01B).Based on the ROC curve analyses, optimal PNI cutoff values for in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity were determined as 36.85 and 41.61, respectively. The prediction performance of PNI regarding these two end points is described in Table\u00a03. After adjusting for all the covariates in multivariate analyses, PNI below these cutoff values was significantly correlated with in\u2010hospital mortality (OR\u00a0= 5.16; 95% CI, 1.69\u201315.73; P\u00a0= .004) and disease severity (OR\u00a0= 2.72; 95% CI, 1.54\u20134.81; P\u00a0= .001).TABLE 3Prediction performance and logistic regression models for in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity based on PNI cutoff values\nPNI cutoff\n\nAUC\n\nSensitivity\n\nSpecificity\n\nPatients with PNI below the cutoff\n\nPNI prediction models\nIn\u2010hospital mortality36.850.73170.29%69.23%195 (38.69%)OR* = 5.32 (95% CI, 3.30\u20138.57); P < .001OR** = 5.16 (95% CI, 1.69\u201315.73); P = .004Disease severity41.610.63372.31%53.03%331 (65.67%)OR* = 2.94 (95% CI, 1.95\u20134.44); P < .001OR** = 2.72 (95% CI, 1.54\u20134.81); P = .001Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: AUC, area under the curve; CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; PNI, prognostic nutrition index.*Unadjusted.**Adjusted for all the covariates included in the multivariate analyses.Systematic review and meta\u2010analysisThe search strategy in electronic databases yielded 18 records, and two studies were identified by manual search. After removing the duplicate records and irrelevant studies, nine full\u2010text studies were assessed for eligibility. One study did not provide any data regarding mortality or severity of COVID\u201019 and therefore was excluded.32 Finally, eight observational studies, with a total of 2002 patients, were included.8, 16, 17, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 However, one study did not report the adjusted OR of PNI as a continuous variable33 and thus was not included in the meta\u2010analysis (Figure S1).All of the included studies had a retrospective design, and except for one study,35 all were conducted as single\u2010center investigations. Males accounted for 49.30% (987 of 2002) of the patients. Table S1 presents the characteristics of these studies. Regarding the quality of included studies, the NOS scores were in the range of 6\u20139 (out of a total of 9 points) (Figure S2).Alongside our study, four other studies determined the PNI as an independent predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality in COVID\u201019 patients (n = 1772; pooled OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72\u20130.89; P < .001), with moderate heterogeneity (I\n2 = 69.0%, P = .012) (Figure\u00a02A).8, 17, 35, 36 Similar to our results, three other studies detected significant association between PNI and severity of COVID\u201019 after adjusting for major confounding variables (n = 831; pooled OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.94; P = .009), with considerable heterogeneity (I\n2 = 86.0%, P < .001) (Figure\u00a02B).16, 34, 37 No significant publication bias was detected regarding in\u2010hospital mortality (P = .462) or disease severity (P = .308) according to the Begg test (Figure S3).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Forest plots for pooled odds ratios (ORs) for the prognostic nutrition index (PNI) in the multivariate analysis regarding (A) in\u2010hospital mortality and (B) disease severity DISCUSSIONTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that ascertains risk indicators of in\u2010hospital mortality and severity, as well as providing a comprehensive systematic review and meta\u2010analysis, to investigate the prognostic effect of the PNI as a predictor of adverse outcomes in COVID\u201019 patients. As we hypothesized, patient groups with higher percentages of comorbidities were at increased risk of mortality and developed more severe COVID\u201019. After adjusting for possible confounders, lower PNI, higher LDH, and higher D\u2010dimer levels were independent risk indicators of in\u2010hospital mortality. In addition, patients with a history of DM, lower PNI, and higher LDH levels had a higher tendency to develop severe disease. Interpretation of the ROC analysis revealed that the PNI had valuable screening power to determine the prognosis of COVID\u201019 patients. Moreover, the results of the performed meta\u2010analysis confirmed our findings, representing the PNI as an independent predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality and severity in COVID\u201019 patients.Given the significant burden of COVID\u201019 on healthcare systems, developing efficient strategies for equitably allocating the resources is of utmost importance.5 In this regard, several clinical models have been designed to stratify the prognosis of patients with COVID\u201019.4, 5 Knight and colleagues4 developed the 4C mortality risk score to determine the risk of in\u2010hospital prognosis in patients with COVID\u201019. Similarly, by applying detailed clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters, Liang et al5 created a clinical risk prediction score to stratify the prognosis of critically ill patients with COVID\u201019. Furthermore, in a recent study on 492 COVID\u201019 patients, Mei et al38 designed a validated prognostic model based on age advancing and laboratory biomarkers to determine the clinical prognosis of the disease. Dissecting the described models by previous investigations indicates that most of the included components are based on radiological information or complex laboratory biomarkers, which could limit their applicability. By contrast, the PNI highly relies on two easily measurable parameters without the need for complex parameters.36 Therefore, it seems that the PNI could serve as a valuable clinical prediction tool, which could facilitate guiding high\u2010risk patients with COVID\u201019 more effectively.The first component of the PNI, serum albumin level, is a well\u2010known indicator of protein status in noninflamed patients, but it is not nutritionally informative in an ICU setting, because of its status as a negative acute\u2010phase protein.12 Although there exists a legitimate debate regarding the accurate function of circulating albumin in critically ill patients, several studies have indicated the essential role of low serum albumin levels in predicting poor outcomes.39, 40 A previous study by Yin et al39 on patients in the ICU of a tertiary hospital indicated that low serum albumin level was an independent predictor of mortality. Another study by Villota and colleagues40 on 214 ICU\u2010admitted patients illustrated that lower serum albumin levels were associated with increased risk of mortality (P < .05). Of note, studies have represented that correcting hypoalbuminemia could not improve the outcome of those with critical illness.12, 41 Therefore, these findings indicate that hypoalbuminemia can act as a prognostic rather than a therapeutic factor in critically ill patients.In parallel with other infectious diseases, the propagation of cytokine storm has been blamed as the essential culprit for the disease progression in COVID\u201019 patients.3 In this respect, hypoalbuminemia is a indicator of detrimental inflammation status and unfavorable outcomes in these patients.13 In our study, the serum albumin level was significantly lower in deceased patients as well as in those with severe disease. Our observation agrees with a previous meta\u2010analysis study that indicated an increased risk of severe COVID\u201019 in patients with hypoalbuminemia (OR = 12.6; P < .001).13 Similarly, according to a study conducted by Wong et al,42 the pooled risk of hypoalbuminemia was higher in patients with severe and critical COVID\u201019 compared with others. The pathophysiology of low serum albumin levels in patients with COVID\u201019 could be justified as follows. First, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 gains entry to human cells by binding its spike to the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, leading to a subsequent response of the immune system. With the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL\u20106), the virus inhibits the transcription rate of albumin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the synthesis ability of hepatocytes, leading to a decrease in serum albumin level.12, 15 In addition, the albumin distribution between extravascular and intravascular compartments is changed during the acute phase of critical diseases.12 Investigating the essential contributors to the altered distribution pattern reveals that releasing a large amount of cytokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, complement components, chemokines, and other vasoactive peptides could cause an increase in capillary leakage, leading to a decrease in circulating serum albumin concentrations.12 Consequently, lower serum albumin levels are linked with the development of ARDS and pulmonary edema, indicating a necessity for more precise care toward the serum albumin levels among patients with COVID\u201019.36\nAs another essential component of PNI, we found a remarkably lower lymphocyte count in the deceased group compared with surviving patients. In support of this concept, in a meta\u2010analysis on 22 studies, severe lymphopenia was associated with 12\u2010fold increased odds of in\u2010hospital mortality in COVID\u201019 patients.14 Likewise, Zhao et al43 indicated that patients with lymphopenia tended to have higher risks of severe COVID\u201019 (OR = 2.99; 95% CI, 1.31\u20136.82). It has been postulated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 mediates its effects on the immune system through multiple pathways. First, the direct invasion of the virus to lymphocytes, along with the excessive release of cytokines, could induce apoptosis of lymphocytes.44 Second, the induced pyroptosis of hematological stem cells could result in a decrease in lymphocyte count.44 In addition, by triggering autophagy\u2010 and antibody\u2010mediated death of infected lymphocytes, COVID\u201019 could lower the peripheral lymphocyte count.44 Hence, these findings suggest that decreased lymphocyte count might have an essential prognostic value in patients with COVID\u201019. Taken together, as a combination of both serum albumin levels and peripheral lymphocyte count, the PNI illustrates the immune\u2010inflammatory status of COVID\u201019 patients more comprehensively.To more accurately ascertain the impact of the PNI per se on the prognosis of COVID\u201019, the effects of confounder factors were eliminated, representing that the PNI was an independent indicator of in\u2010hospital mortality and severity in COVID\u201019 patients. Consistent with this concept, Doganci and colleagues33 divided COVID\u201019 patients into two groups regarding the median of the PNI, indicating that patients in the low\u2010risk group were at increased risk of in\u2010hospital mortality (unadjusted OR = 18.57; P < .05). Identically, in the study by Wang et al,36 the PNI was an independent risk factor for in\u2010hospital mortality in patients with COVID\u201019 (OR = 0.79; P = .029). In light of COVID\u201019 severity, a recent study on 101 COVID\u201019 patients demonstrated the PNI as an independent risk factor for critical disease (OR = 0.81; P = .002).16 Likewise, Hu and colleagues34 indicated that the PNI was inversely associated with the severity of COVID\u201019 (OR = 0.797; P = .030). Of note, the most challenging part of these findings could be the diversity that exists among different studies with respect to the definition of COVID\u201019 severity, although these results still provide comprehensive evidence that the PNI exerts a pivotal role in the prognosis of COVID\u201019.As a key insight from this study, the ROC analysis revealed that the PNI could serve as an insightful predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity in COVID\u201019 patients. Additionally, we found that the PNI below these cutoff values was remarkably associated with in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity. Similar to our findings, C\u0131nar and colleagues17 divided COVID\u201019 patients into three groups regarding the PNI tertiles and indicated 11.2 times higher rates of in\u2010hospital mortality in the lowest tertile compared with the highest tertile. In addition, they reported notably higher screening power of PNI in predicting in\u2010hospital survival compared with serum albumin level and lymphocyte counts alone. Overall, even though this is an observational study with its inherent biases, it supports the statement that the PNI measurement could be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy to more accurately guide COVID\u201019 management.Most notably, a distinctive feature of this study is that we conducted a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of studies to substantiate our analysis. Our findings provide robust evidence that the PNI serves as an independent predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity in patients with COVID\u201019. Indeed, the interpretation of the meta\u2010analysis revealed that a per\u2010point increase in the PNI was associated with a 22% and 20% decrease in the risk of in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity, respectively. Accordingly, these results indicate that the PNI should be applied promptly by clinicians to achieve the aspirational goals in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019.Drawing from the results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that LDH, D\u2010dimer, and DM were other significant indicators of in\u2010hospital mortality and severity. The increased level of LDH is a reflection of tissue injury, which in turn contributes to human immunosuppression.45 We found that higher levels of LDH were independently associated with both in\u2010hospital mortality and severity, which is in line with a recent pooled analysis indicating that an elevated level of LDH is associated with 6\u2010 and 16\u2010fold increased odds of disease severity and mortality of COVID\u201019.45 In terms of D\u2010dimer levels, our results are in agreement with those of Gungor et al,46 who found that elevated D\u2010dimer level was associated with higher risks of mortality and severity. Possible explanations for the hypercoagulable state in COVID\u201019 could be the excess production of inflammatory cytokines, stimulation of cell\u2010death mechanisms, and vascular endothelial damages.46 So far, several studies have narrowed the path, linking DM with COVID\u201019 progression.47, 48 The significant association of DM with COVID\u201019 severity in our study is similar to the results of a pooled analysis, which demonstrated that patients with DM had significantly higher risks of disease severity and mortality.47 Across sex disparity, Galbadage and colleagues49 indicated male sex as an essential risk factor for COVID\u201019 progression. By contrast, we found that the male group had notably lower severe disease compared with the female group. The finding of our study could be due to the higher rates of CKD in the female group compared with the male group (8.25% vs 4.19%, P = .057), although other characteristics and comorbidities were almost similar between the females and males in our cohort of patients. Taken together, our prognostic model regarding the susceptibility for developing severe disease and in\u2010hospital mortality could objectively reflect the inflammatory status of patients with COVID\u201019. Strikingly, our model is nearly consistent with the findings of Violi et al,50 who found an association between hypoalbuminemia and hypercoagulability in patients with COVID\u201019. Given that fostering an effective strategy to mitigate the burden of COVID\u201019 necessitates a suitable adjustment of effective strategies, our findings could have an important clinical impact on the management of patients with COVID\u201019.Strengths and limitationsWe would like to emphasize the essential strengths of our study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a comprehensive systematic review and meta\u2010analysis to investigate the prognostic effect of the PNI in patients with COVID\u201019. In addition, compared with previous studies that have evaluated the impact of PNI on the prognosis of COVID\u201019 patients, we included a higher number of patients, providing a robust metric for applying the PNI as a risk stratification index. Furthermore, our prognostic model regarding the susceptibility for developing severe disease and in\u2010hospital mortality could comprehensively reflect the inflammatory status of patients with COVID\u201019. The present study was subject to a number of potential limitations. First, we could not accurately assess the causal association between the PNI and COVID\u201019 progression, because of the cross\u2010sectional design of the study, although a supporting meta\u2010analysis could provide some additional information in this regard. Second, it is a single\u2010center observational study; thus, further longitudinal multicenter studies should be performed to confirm these results more accurately. Third, as serum albumin level might be affected by other pathological conditions rather than COVID\u201019, serum albumin level as a prognostic indicator should be used with caution. Also, the meta\u2010analysis might have some limitations. Because of the diversity in the nutrition assessment methods, we were able to include a limited number of investigations focusing on this topic. Therefore, interpretation of the meta\u2010analysis findings should be considered carefully in light of possible bias. CONCLUSIONSAll in all, owing to the huge burden of COVID\u201019 on healthcare systems, it seems crucial to endorse an early pragmatic strategy for stratifying the prognosis of COVID\u201019 patients. We revealed that lower PNI, higher LDH, and higher D\u2010dimer levels were independent risk indicators of in\u2010hospital mortality. Furthermore, patients with a history of diabetes, lower PNI, and higher LDH levels had a higher tendency to develop severe disease. Noticeably, results of the meta\u2010analysis illustrated that the PNI was an independent predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality and disease severity. Without the need to employ complex parameters, our analysis, along with the result of the meta\u2010analysis, emphasized the predictive value of the PNI in the prognosis of patients with COVID\u201019. Hence, we urge clinicians to implement a risk stratification index based on PNI values to appraise prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019. CONFLICT OF INTERESTNone declared.
