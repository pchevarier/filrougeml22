Despite advances in the care of critically ill patients, the mortality rate of ARDS remains high.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n\nHigh\u2010resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is not routinely performed to diagnose or manage patients with ARDS.\n4\n However, the Berlin definition recognizes the use of CT instead of chest radiography for the detection of lung opacities.\n1\n Several studies have also demonstrated that HRCT can assess the pathophysiological condition and mortality of ARDS patients.\n5\n, \n6\n Ichikado et al, using a validated HRCT scoring system, reported that fibroproliferative changes in the lung were associated with increased mortality.\n5\n Similarly, Chung et al indicated that more extensive lung involvement and traction bronchiectasis on CT were associated with a higher risk of death.\n6\n\nWhile most patients with clinical ARDS have histological evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), ARDS can present with other histological patterns, including organizing pneumonia and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Moreover, HRCT radiological patterns vary according to histological patterns.\n7\n, \n8\n HRCT in patients with DAD shows a diffuse crazy\u2010paving pattern or dorsal pattern with a gravitationally dependent gradient.\n8\n In contrast, sparing of the subpleural area of the lungs can be seen with organizing pneumonia.\n9\n\nHowever, limited data are available on the prevalence, clinical implications, and association of the HRCT radiological patterns with the prognosis of ARDS. Furthermore, the HRCT radiological patterns that reflect active fibroproliferative changes most accurately are unknown.The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between HRCT radiological patterns and ARDS prognosis. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. SubjectsThis was a retrospective cohort study conducted at St. Luke's International Hospital in Japan. Patients diagnosed with ARDS according to American\u2010European Consensus Conference Criteria from 1 April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2016, at our hospital were included. Eligible patients were adults (\u226516\u2009years of age) who underwent HRCT at diagnosis. We excluded patients with chronic interstitial lung disease and congestive heart failure, patients recovering from cardiopulmonary arrest, and those with life expectancy less than two months due to advanced neoplasms. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St. Luke's International Hospital (institutional review board no. 17\u2010R039).2.2. Data collectionMedical records were reviewed retrospectively for demographic information (age, sex), underlying illness, presumed cause of ARDS, APACHE II score, PaO2/FiO2, ventilator settings at diagnosis, laboratory and radiological data, medical treatment, corticosteroid use, and clinical outcomes.2.3. \nHRCT assessmentIn our facility, all patients suspected of ARDS underwent whole lung volumetric HRCT scanning of the chest at diagnosis using a multidetector\u2010row CT scan to rule out pleural effusion or lung collapse. The HRCT scans were evaluated by two independent observers blinded to the patients' clinical characteristics and study outcomes. Disagreements between the observers were resolved by consensus. We categorized HRCT findings into three distribution patterns: diffuse, subpleural sparing, and dorsal (Figure\u00a01). The diffuse pattern was defined as an area with more than 50% of infiltrates spreading into the pleura in a certain slide from the CT. The subpleural sparing pattern was defined as an area with more than 50% of the sparing area adjacent to the pleura in the presence of infiltrates in the lung field, and the dorsal pattern as an area with infiltrates occupying less than 50% of the dorsal part of the lung. When multiple patterns were exhibited, we gave priority to a diffuse pattern. The presence of traction bronchiectasis was also assessed. All findings were assessed in six HRCT slices at three levels of the lungs. The upper level was the area of the lung 1\u00a0cm above the superior margin of the aortic arch, the middle level was the area 1\u00a0cm below the level of the carina, and the lower level was the area 1\u00a0cm above the top of the right diaphragm. The total number of slices and the number of slices with the three distribution patterns were estimated.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1High\u2010resolution computed tomography (HRCT) distribution patterns.

Statistical analysesData are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and frequencies (percentage) for categorical variables. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the Student's t\u2010test. To identify independent risk factors for in\u2010hospital mortality, prognostic factors, such as APACHE II score, all significant variables of univariate analyses were included in the multivariable logistic regression model. All statistical tests were two\u2010tailed, and significance was accepted at P\u00a0\u2264\u20090.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 22.0. 3.\u2003RESULTSOne hundred and forty\u2010four patients (mean age\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, 72\u2009\u00b1\u200916\u2009years, 112 [78%] men) met the inclusion criteria (Figure\u00a02). Their in\u2010hospital mortality rate was 42%. Fifty\u2010five patients (38%) had sepsis resulting in ARDS, 34 patients (24%) had pneumonia, 18 patients (13%) had aspiration, and 11 patients (8%) had drug\u2010induced pneumonitis. Patient characteristics, laboratory data, presence of mosaic appearance, and traction bronchiectasis were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors (Table\u00a01). Nonsurvivors were significantly older (mean 70\u2009\u00b1\u200916 vs 76\u2009\u00b1\u200913, P\u00a0=\u20090.01) and had lower serum albumin levels (mean 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u20090.7 vs 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u20090.6\u00a0g/dL, P\u00a0=\u20090.01) compared to survivors. No significant differences were seen in other clinical conditions.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Outline of the study. *All patients with respiratory failure suspected of ARDS underwent chest CT, and those suspected of infectious pneumonia on CT were excluded.

The first model included age, serum albumin, APACHE II, traction bronchiectasis, and number of involved lung slices. In the second model, the number of involved lung slices was replaced by the number of slices with diffuse pattern. The number of slices with diffuse pattern was an independent adverse prognostic factor (odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI, 1.08\u20101.61, P\u00a0=\u20090.007). In contrast, there was no correlation between the number of involved lung slices and mortality (odds ratio 1.11, 95% CI, 0.75\u20101.64, P\u00a0=\u20090.61) (Table\u00a03). Figure\u00a03 shows the relationship between the number of slices with diffuse pattern and in\u2010hospital mortality.

Diffuse patterns were an independent prognostic factor for in\u2010hospital mortality. Previous studies have examined the prognostic factors for ARDS using HRCT. Chung et al suggested that more extensive lung involvement and bronchiectasis predicted mortality in ARDS.\n6\n Ichikado et al reported that the extent of fibrosis determined using a validated scoring system for HRCT predicted ARDS mortality.\n5\n To our knowledge, the relationship between distribution patterns on HRCT and ARDS prognosis has not been reported. Distribution patterns may aid in identifying patients who can recover quickly and completely with adequate treatment.\n4\n\nARDS is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits different patterns on HRCT. Several studies have demonstrated that DAD, including hyaline membranes and the presence of fibrosis, are pathological hallmarks of ARDS.\n7\n, \n10\n ARDS can also present with other histological patterns including organizing pneumonia and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Moreover, HRCT radiological patterns vary according to histological patterns.\n7\n, \n8\n\nPrevious studies have reported that in the acute stage of DAD, alveolar edema with exudation of the plasma into the alveolar spaces develops due to inflammatory injury, followed by organization and fibrosis in the late phase of DAD.\n4\n On HRCT, the acute phase of DAD manifests as diffuse patchy ground\u2010glass opacities with areas of consolidation and septal thickening, and focal areas of spared, normal attenuation, creating a geographic appearance. Microscopically, evidence of lung injury is present even in this subpleural sparing area.\n9\n In the late phase of DAD, consolidation spreads into the pleura since DAD progresses from the exudative phase to the proliferative phase in the normally aerated subpleural lung area.\n9\n Some studies have reported that other typical HRCT presentations of DAD include an increasing parenchymal density gradient from the ventral to the dorsal lung.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n The dorsal pattern may have a large and normally aerated lung area, or the exudative phase of DAD may manifest as a small fibroproliferative lung area. Organizing pneumonia is also known as one of the histologic findings of ARDS and presents with various patterns of diffuse parenchymal abnormalities on HRCT. Bilateral consolidation is predominantly peribronchial, with sparing of the subpleural area of the lung along with thickened septa.\n9\n\nOur study suggests that ARDS patients with a diffuse pattern in which the infiltrates spread to the pleura have a higher mortality. In the acute phase of DAD, the anterior or subpleural lung area with a microscopically exudative phase of DAD appears to be spared as normal attenuation. On the contrary, in the late stage, DAD progresses to the fibroproliferative phase, and consolidation extends to the pleura. In other words, the diffuse pattern may represent the fibroproliferative phase of DAD, which is a more advanced phase with more organization or fibrosis.Another possibility could be that subpleural sparing is observed if congestion or edema is significant. Edema in the subpleural lung area is likely to be drained because the peripheral vessels are small in caliber and easily adapted for vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, which alters the peripheral resistance to flow from the larger arteries. Furthermore, there are numerous precapillary anastomoses between the pulmonary arteries and veins in which shunting may occur.\n15\n Therefore, a subpleural sparing pattern may be associated with a better prognosis than a diffuse pattern because it is more affected by congestion or edema.Our study demonstrated that patients with a greater diffuse pattern tended to have higher KL\u20106 levels and more traction bronchiectasis than those with subpleural sparing and dorsal patterns. KL\u20106 is classified as a human MUC1 mucin protein. The regenerating type II pneumocytes are the primary cellular source of KL\u20106/MUC1. KL\u20106/MUC1 is one of the key molecules involved in the intra\u2010alveolar fibrotic process and pulmonary fibrosis.\n16\n, \n17\n These findings are indicative of a more advanced fibroproliferative response in patients with a diffuse pattern.The present study has limitations. First, the distribution patterns from HRCT were obtained at the undefined stages of ARDS progression. These patterns may change over the clinical course of the disease and therefore may not predict ultimate mortality. However, in most cases, HRCT was performed at the time of ARDS diagnosis. Hence, the HRCT scan reviewed in this study can be regarded as the image at the time of treatment initiation. Appropriate therapeutic intervention initiated at an earlier phase of DAD is likely to lead to a better prognosis. Second, our patients did not receive consistent treatment. Corticosteroids were not administered to any patient. The effects of corticosteroids on survival in ARDS remain controversial, and there are no data to support that corticosteroids improve mortality.\n18\n Furthermore, positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) was not used in all patients. Thus, we were unable to evaluate the effect of PEEP on the distribution patterns.\n14\n A prospective study with uniform settings and treatment is needed to confirm our findings.In conclusion, we demonstrated that in patients with ARDS, HRCT distribution patterns may predict mortality, disease activity, and the phase of fibroproliferative changes in the lungs.
