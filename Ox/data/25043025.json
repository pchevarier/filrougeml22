general transcriptional machinery to sustain the oncogenic state1, but direct pharmacological inhibition of transcription factors has thus far proven difficult2. However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic co-factors that can be targeted for development of new therapeutic candidates3, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)4. Here we present the discovery and characterization of the first covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented ability to target a remote cysteine residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of achieving selectivity for CDK7. Cancer cell line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell lines, including T-ALL, exhibit exceptional sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat T-ALL shows that THZ1 disproportionally affects transcription of RUNX1 and suggests that sensitivity to THZ1 may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and this transcription factor\u2019s key role in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these tumor cells. Pharmacological modulation of CDK7 kinase activity may thus provide an approach to identify and treat tumor types exhibiting extreme dependencies on transcription for maintenance of the oncogenic state. In an effort to discover new inhibitors of kinases that regulate gene transcription, we performed cell-based screening and kinase selectivity profiling of a library of known and novel ATP-site directed kinase inhibitors (See Supplementary Table 1 for known CDK7 inhibitors). We identified THZ1 (Fig. 1a), a phenylaminopyrimidine bearing a potentially cysteine-reactive acrylamide moiety, as a low nanomolar inhibitor of cell proliferation and biochemical CDK7 activity (Fig. 1b, c). To investigate the functional relevance of the acrylamide moiety we prepared a non-cysteine reactive analog THZ1-R, which displayed diminished activity for CDK7andreduced anti proliferative potency (Fig. 1b, c). KiNativ\u2122 profiling5, which measures the ability of a compound to block nucleotide-dependent enzymes from biotinylation with a reactive desthiobiotin-ATP probe, established CDK7 as the primary intracellular target of THZ1, but not of THZ1-R (Supplementary Table 2). Kinome-wide profiling identified additional kinase targets of THZ1; however, we confirmed CDK7 as the only target displaying time-dependent inhibition, which is suggestive of covalent binding (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c and Supplementary Table 3).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Cell-based screening and kinome profiling identifies phenylamino-pyrimidines as a potential CDK7 scaffolda, Compound structures of THZ1, THZ1-R, and bio-THZ1. b, THZ1 potently inhibits proliferation of Jurkat and Loucy T-ALL cell lines. Cell lines were treated with THZ1 or THZ1-R for 72 hrs. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates and error bars are +/\u2212 SD. c, THZ1 and THZ1-R have different binding affinities for CDK7. LanthaScreen\u00ae Eu Kinase Binding assay was conducted at Life Technologies in a time-dependent manner. Here KD values are shown following 180-minute incubation with compounds. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates and error bars are +/\u2212 SD.As no covalent inhibitors of CDKs have been reported, we next focused our studies on the mechanism by which THZ1 could achieve covalent inhibition of CDK7. We first incubated recombinant CDK7/cyclin H/MAT1 trimeric complex with a biotinylated version of THZ1 (bio-THZ1, Fig. 1a) and demonstrated that it indeed covalently modifies CDK7 (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 1d\u2013g). Mass spectrometry identified the site of covalent modification as C312, a residue located outside the kinase domain (Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013d). Inspection of the crystal structure reveals that a C-terminal extension of CDK7 bearing C312 traverses the ATP cleft in the kinase domain and would be predicted to position Cys312 directly adjacent to the reactive acrylamide moiety of THZ1 (Fig. 2b). Mutation to serine (C312S), a less nucleophilic amino acid, prevented THZ1 from covalently binding to CDK7 and from inhibiting CDK7 activity in an irreversible fashion (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 2e). Sequence alignment of the 20-member CDK family suggests that Cys312 is unique to CDK7, however CDK12 and CDK13 also possess accessible cysteines within 4 amino acids of Cys312 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Indeed, we found that THZ1 can inhibit CDK12 kinase activity at slightly higher concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 3b\u2013f). THZ1 is the first inhibitor demonstrated to target a cysteine located outside of the kinase domain, which provides an unanticipated means of achieving covalent selectivity.Open in a separate windowFigure 2THZ1 irreversibly inhibits RNAPII CTD phosphorylation by covalently targeting a unique cysteine located outside the kinase domain of CDK7a, bio-THZ1 binds irreversibly to CDK7. Recombinant CAK complex was incubated with bio-THZ1 +/\u2212 THZ1 at 37\u00b0C for 4 hrs and biotinylated proteins were resolved by SDS-page. b, Docking model of THZ1 in the ATP-binding pocket of CDK7 (PDB code 1UA2).

C312 has been modeled into the crystal structure. c, Mutation of C312 to serine (C312S) rescues wild-type kinase activity in the presence of THZ1. HCT116 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged CDK7 proteins were treated with THZ1 or THZ1-R for 4 hrs. Exogenous CDK7 proteins were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. CS = coomassie stain. d, THZ1 inhibits RNAPII CTD phosphorylation. Jurkat cells were treated with THZ1 or THZ1-R for 4 hrs. and proteins of interest resolved by SDS page. e, THZ1, but not THZ1-R, shows irreversible inactivation of CDK7. Jurkat cells were treated with THZ1 or THZ1-R for 4 hrs followed by washout of inhibitor-containing medium. Cells were then allowed to grow in medium without inhibitor for 0 to 6 hrs. \u2018N\u2019 signifies cells where medium was never washed out (ie \u2013 10 hr incubation with compounds). f, Anti proliferative effects of THZ1 are impervious to inhibitor washout. Jurkat cells were treated with THZ1 or THZ1-R in dose response format for 72 hrs. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates and error bars are +/\u2212 SD.CDK7 kinase activity has been implicated in the regulation of both transcription, where it phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP polymerase II (RNAPII)6\u20138 and CDK99, and the cell cycle, where it functions as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for CDKs1/2/4/610\u201314. THZ1, but not THZ1-R, completely inhibits the phosphorylation of the established intracellular CDK7 substrate RNAPII CTD at Ser-5 and Ser-76,8, with concurrent loss of Ser-2 phosphorylation at 250 nM in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2d). Cellular washout experiments demonstrate that THZ1 indeed acts in an irreversible fashion (Fig. 2e, f; Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013e). We observed a loss of CAK activity, as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of the activation loops of CDK1,2 and 9, indicating disruption of both recognized CDK7 signaling pathways in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 4f, g) and Loucy cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 4). Ectopic expression of dox-inducible FLAG-CDK7 C312S, but not FLAG-CDK7 WT, in Hela S3 cells restored RNAPII CTD p-Ser 5/7 to near WT levels at concentrations of THZ1 up to 2.5 \u00b5M, establishing C312 as a critical determinant of the cellular pharmacology of the inhibitor (Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013b). Additionally, FLAG-CDK7 C312S expression restored CDK1/2 T-loop phosphorylation, reduced early induction of cleaved PARP and restored the expression of a subset of genes, including the highly \u2013expressed transcription factors MYC, KLF4, ID1, and GATA2 (Extended Data Fig. 5c\u2013e). The partial rescues of the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAPII (RNAPII0) and RNAPII p-Ser2 CTD phosphorylation combined with the incomplete restoration of gene expression may result, in part, from lower affinity cross-reactivity of THZ1 with CDK12/13, which are bona fide Ser2 kinases15.Our evidence that CDK7 inhibition leads to reduction in RNAPII CTD phosphorylation status appears in conflict with evidence that inhibition of CDK7 alone is insufficient to reduce RNAPII CTD phosphorylation in HCT116 cells9. It is possible that covalent inhibition and reversible inhibition can engender different effects on kinase structure; we did not find evidence that THZ1 impacts TFIIH or CAK complex stability (Extended Data Fig. 4h). It is also possible that inhibition of CDK12/13 (or another undetected kinase) contributes to reduced RNAPII CTD phosphorylation, although our evidence that RNAPII CTD phosphorylation levels are restored following expression of CDK7 C312S suggests otherwise.To better understand the breadth of antiproliferative activity of THZ1, we screened it against a diverse panel of over 1,000 cancer cell lines16. THZ1 displayed broad-based activity with IC50s less than 200 nM against 53% of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4). Elastic net regression analysis incorporating gene expression, copy number, and sequence variation genomics data16 across 527 of the cell lines tested were used to identify genomic features common to sensitive cell lines. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis17 indicated a strong enrichment of (proto-) oncogenic transcription factors commonly overexpressed in cancer and factors involved in RNAPII-driven transcriptional regulation, suggesting the dominant activity of THZ1 was through modulation of transcription (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 5).Open in a separate windowFigure 3THZ1 strongly reduces the proliferation and cell viability of T-ALL cell linesa, THZ1 exhibits strong anti proliferative effect across a broad range of cancer cell lines from various cancer types. Cells were treated with THZ1 or DMSO vehicle for 72 hrs and assessed for anti proliferative effect using resazurin. b, Overexpression of transcriptional regulators, including (proto) oncogenic transcription factors, is a strong predictor of cell line sensitivity to THZ1.

BJ fibroblasts and RPE-1 cells are shown as normal cell lines. Cells were treated with THZ1 or DMSO vehicle for 72 hrs. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates and error bars are +/\u2212 SD. d, THZ1 reduces the proliferation of KOPTK1 T-ALL cells in a human xenograft mouse model. Bioluminescent images of two representative mice treated with either vehicle control, 10 mg/kg THZ1 qD (once daily), or 10 mg/kg/day THZ1 BID (twice daily) for 29 days. e, Relative bioluminescence (BLI) of mice treated with vehicle, 10 mg/kg THZ1 qD (once daily), or 10 mg/kg/day THZ1 BID (twice daily) during the 29 days of treatment. n=10 for all groups. Bioluminescence is shown relative to day 0 and is plotted as average \u00b1 SEM. Analysis of the BLI data by repeated measures (RM) two-way ANOVA reveals the anti-proliferative effect of treatment with THZ1 BID is highly statistically significantly different (p<0.0001) as compared to the other treatments.In agreement with the net elastic regression analysis, T-ALL cell lines that display characteristic misregulation of T-cell lineage-specific transcription factors, were broadly sensitive to THZ1, but not THZ1-R (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 4). Treatment of T-ALL cell lines with THZ1 caused decreased cellular proliferation and an increase in apoptotic index with concomitant reduction in anti-apoptotic proteins, most notably MCL-1 and XIAP (Extended Data Fig. 6, \u200b,7).7). These strong anti proliferative responses induced at sub-effective doses of THZ1 suggest that these cells may be particularly sensitive to small perturbations in transcription and CDK7 kinase function. Indeed, THZ1 demonstrated efficacy against primary leukemia cells and in a bioluminescent xenografted model using the human T-ALL cell line, KOPTK1, when dosed twice daily (BID) at 10 mg/kg (Fig. 3d, e; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 6). Importantly, THZ1 was well tolerated at these doses with no observable body weight loss or behavioral changes (Extended Data Fig. 8f), suggesting no overt toxicity to the animals. These results were mirrored in cell culture with non-transformed BJ fibroblast and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells responding to relatively high doses of THZ1 by undergoing cell cycle arrest rather than initiating apoptosis or cell death, further suggesting that normal cells might tolerate transcriptional disruption (Extended Data Fig. 9).CDK7 is a component of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex18\u201320, so we next investigated how THZ1 treatment affects genome-wide gene expression. We chose Jurkat T-ALL for these studies because it a well-studied T-ALL cell line model with a defined core transcriptional regulatory circuitry, consisting of key transcription factors, which is also found in human T-ALL primagrafts21. Treatment with 250 nM THZ1, but not THZ1-R, led to progressive reduction in global steady-state mRNA levels over time, with 75% and 96% of mRNAs showing greater than 2-fold reduction by 6 and 12 hrs, respectively (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 7). Consistent with global downregulation of mRNA transcripts, 250 nM THZ1 reduced RNAPII occupancy genome-wide at both promoters and gene bodies (Fig. 4b). By comparison, Flavopiridol reduced RNAPII density across only gene bodies (Fig. 4b). This is consistent with the model that CDK7 regulates RNAPII initiation and pausing while CDK9 regulates pause release leading to processive elongation8,9,18\u201320,22\u201324.Open in a separate windowFigure 4THZ1 preferentially downregulates Jurkat core transcriptional circuitrya, THZ1 treatment globally downregulates steady-state mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner.

Genes are represented by rectangles, and proteins are represented by ovals21. f, Transcripts down-regulated by low dose THZ1 are enriched for transcripts downregulated following RUNX1 knockdown. Gene set enrichment analysis of top 500 transcripts downregulated following a 4-hour treatment with THZ1 (50 nM) in comparison to transcripts following a RUNX1 knockdown21. GSEA-supplied p-value < 0.001.Although 250 nM THZ1 inhibits global transcription, we found that some cancer cell lines, particularly T-ALL, are sensitive to considerably lower concentrations of THZ1. We postulated that the expression of certain genes might be especially sensitive to low doses of THZ1 and therefore have a key role in driving the cellular response. Indeed, we found that transcripts for only a subset of genes were substantially affected by treatment with 50 nM THZ1, with that for RUNX1 among the most profoundly affected (Fig. 4c). There are at least two reasons that low dose THZ1 treatment might cause a preferential loss of RUNX1 expression. Tumor cell oncogenes can acquire super-enhancers, which drive high-level expression yet can be especially sensitive to perturbation25\u201328. Super-enhancer analysis in Jurkat cells revealed that RUNX1 contains an exceptionally large super-enhancer domain containing a previously described hematopoietic cell \u2013specific enhancer (Fig. 4d; Extended Data Fig. 10b\u2013d and Supplementary Table 8)29. In addition, RUNX1 forms a core regulatory circuitry with two additional transcription factors that play prominent roles in leukemia biology, TAL1 and GATA3 (Fig. 4e)21. These factors auto regulate their own gene expression while simultaneously regulating many other genes that comprise the active gene expression program of Jurkat cells. Treatment with 50 nM THZ 1l ed to significant reduction in both the transcript and protein levels of RUNX1, TAL1, and GATA3 (Extended Data Fig. 10e and f). Loss of the RUNX1 driven transcriptional program is likely key to the response to low dose THZ1 treatment, as gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the Jurkat transcripts downregulated by 50 nM THZ1 were enriched in transcripts similarly downregulated following RUNX1 depletion using shRNA (Fig. 4f).Here we have reported the discovery and characterization of the first covalent inhibitor of CDK7, THZ1. THZ1 employs a unique mechanism, combining ATP-site and allosteric covalent binding, as means of attaining potency and selectivity for CDK7. This mechanistic insight should be useful for designing next generation inhibitors of CDKs, where high sequence and shape homology in the ATP pocket has posed a formidable challenge to achieving selectivity with conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. THZ1 displayed exquisite anti proliferative activity for T-ALL cell lines and other blood cancers, where oncogenic transcription factors feature prominently in the disease state.In Jurkat cells, low dose THZ1 had a profound effect on a small subset of genes, including the key regulator RUNX1, thus contributing to subsequent loss of the greater gene expression program and cell death. Identification of additional cancer cell lines whose gene expression programs display vulnerability to THZ1 or other transcriptional inhibitors should delineate additional cancers that are exquisitely susceptible to perturbation of transcription. Methods SummaryT-ALL culture conditionsJurkat, Loucy, KOPTK1, and DND-41 cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. All cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber in the presence of 5% CO2, unless otherwise noted.Inhibitor treatment experimentsTime-course experiments such as those described in Extended Data Fig. 5a were conducted to determine the minimal time required for full inactivation of CDK7. Cells were treated with THZ1, THZ1-R, or DMSO for 0\u20136 hrs to assess the effect of time on the THZ1 \u2013mediated inhibition of RNAPII CTD phosphorylation. For subsequent experiments cells were treated with compounds for 4 hrs as determined by time-course experiment described above, unless otherwise noted. For inhibitor washout experiments (Fig. 2e, f; Extended Data Fig. 5) cells were treated with THZ1, THZ1-R, or DMSO for 4 hrs.

Results shown are normalized to these paired DMSO controls and numbers represent the percentage (compared to DMSO control) of MS signal lost for sequences of an indicated kinase, eg \u2013 numbers approaching 100% indicate that test compound effectively out-competed the desthiobiotin ATP probe for binding to the kinase, resulting in decreased labeling and enrichment for peptides representing this kinase.Click here to view.(34K, xlsx)data set 3Supplementary Table 3 | THZ1 displays time-dependent inactivation of recombinant CDK7: CDK7 is inhibited in a time-dependent manner. KD values were determined at three different time points (20, 60, and 180 minutes) for THZ1 and THZ1-R using the LanthaScreen\u00ae Eu Kinase Binding Assay for each individual kinase according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. The ratio of the KD values generated at 20 and 180 minutes was used to assess whether kinases displayed time-dependent inactivation.Click here to view.(51K, xlsx)data set 4Supplementary Table 4 | THZ1 displays broad-based antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines: THZ1 exhibits strong antiproliferative effects across a broad range of cancer cell lines from various cancer types including blood cancers.
