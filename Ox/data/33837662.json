This is a quick, simple, and easily available test which offers valuable information about the patient's condition along with severity of signs and symptoms. Previously, the CBC has served as a useful marker in dengue virus infections, with presence of plasmacytoid lymphocytes and thrombocytopenia serving as indicators of diagnosis and severity of dengue infection.\n9\n Now, a variety of hematological manifestations of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 ranging from cytopenias to coagulopathy are also being discovered, which can be also used for disease prognostication in patients with COVID\u201019.\n10\n\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to document the hematological parameters of patients with COVID\u201019 during the initial stage of diagnosis. We hope to identify the early hematological indicators of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and their association with adverse outcomes in this population of South Asian patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODSThis retrospective study was conducted at Shifa International Hospital (SIH), a 550 bed tertiary care hospital in Pakistan which is accredited by the Joint Commission International. The medical records of patients who were hospitalized with COVID\u201019 during the study period of April to November 2020 were assessed. We included those hospitalized patients in whom SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was detected by RT\u2010PCR, whereas patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019 on radiological imaging alone were excluded. COVID\u201019 patients managed on an out\u2010patient basis were also excluded from the study population.A standardized data collection form was developed to retrospectively retrieve relevant information from the medical records. Data were collected regarding patient demographics and laboratory parameters within 48\u00a0hours of PCR diagnosis of COVID\u201019. The outcome variables indicating disease severity were occurrence of all\u2010cause in hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. We also identified those patients who developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), defined according to Berlin criteria.\n11\n\nHematological parameters were reported according to standardized reference ranges (quoted in the results section). The following definitions were used during interpretation of CBC:\nNLR: The neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio was determined by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. Normal NLR in healthy adults is up to 3.5, with higher values associated with infection and inflammation.\n12\n\n\nLymphopenia: Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 1000/\u00b5L.\n13\n\n\nNeutrophilic leucocytosis: Diagnosed as an absolute neutrophil count greater than 8000/\u00b5L.\n14\n\n\nThrombocytopenia: Defined as platelet count of less than 150\u00a0000/\u00b5L.Data were analyzed using IBM\u00ae SPSS Statistics Version 21. Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation were calculated for normally distributed quantitative variables, median, and interquartile range were determined for skewed quantitative variables and frequencies and percentages were reported for qualitative data.\n15\n Independent samples t test, Chi\u2010square test and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves were used to identify the hematological indicators associated with severe COVID\u201019 disease. P value of <.05 was considered significant for all data analysis.This study was commenced after receiving ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of SIH. No funding was required for this study and none of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare. 3.\u2003RESULTSA total of 425 patients who were hospitalized with COVID\u201019 and had a CBC done within 48\u00a0hours of diagnosis were included in this study. 272 (64%) of the study participants were males, whereas 153 (36%) were females. The mean age was 55.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.84\u00a0years (range 10\u00a0months to 99\u00a0years). Average hemoglobin levels of the study population were 12.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.61\u00a0g/dL, total leucocyte count was 11\u00a0701.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07826.55/\u00b5L and mean platelet count was 231\u00a0291.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0124\u00a0929.54/\u00b5L.Overall, only 95 out of 425 patients (22.4%) had a normal CBC within 48\u00a0hours of being diagnosed with COVID\u201019 in which hemoglobin, total leucocyte count and platelet count were within the normal reference range according to age. The remaining 77.6% patients had an abnormal CBC in which counts of at least one cell line were either low or high. Cytopenias were seen in 193 (45.4%) of our patients. Pancytopenia was seen in 15 (3.5%) patients. The mean absolute lymphocyte count was 1447.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0957/\u00b5L, with lymphopenia detected in 160 (37.6%) patients. Mean absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was 9676.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07272.42/\u00b5L (ANC range: 89\u201048\u00a0062/\u00b5L), with neutrophilic leucocytosis found in 197 (46.4%) patients. The median neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was 6.0 (range 0.06\u201098).

Serum ferritin (available for 277 out of 425 patients) showed a median of 779\u00a0ng/mL (range 4.8\u201067\u00a019.8\u00a0ng/mL). Median D\u2010dimer levels (available for 288 out of 425 patients) were 1.24\u00a0mg/dL (range 0.15\u201050.35\u00a0mg/dL).Among the outcome variables, the median length of hospital stay was 5\u00a0days (range 1\u201052\u00a0days). There were 75 (17.6%) mortalities during the study period. 52 (12.2%) of the patients were put on ventilator. Twenty\u2010eight patients developed ARDS, comprising 53.8% of patients who required ventilatory support.Chi\u2010square test showed that thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and neutrophilic leucocytosis were significantly associated with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation. Independent samples t test showed that the mean age of COVID\u201019 patients who expired during hospital stay was significantly greater than the mean age of those who survived (64.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.77 vs 53.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.55\u00a0years, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). However, mean age of patients who required ventilator support was not significantly different from those who did not need mechanical ventilation (58.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.04 vs 55.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.17\u00a0years, P\u00a0=\u00a0.168). Gender was not significantly associated with any adverse outcome.

NLR yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693 and 0.660 for the outcomes mortality and need for ventilator, respectively. For the subset of patients who had D\u2010dimer levels checked within 48\u00a0hours of hospital admission with COVID\u201019, the AUC for mortality was 0.708, whereas AUC for ventilator requirement was 0.671.

Our study reports the spectrum of hematological manifestations during the initial stages of diagnosis of COVID\u201019 among a South Asian population, as well as their association with adverse outcomes including mortality.Hematological and biochemical markers are crucial elements in the investigation of suspected COVID\u201019 cases as their abnormalities can guide clinicians regarding risk stratification and prognosis.\n16\n CBC is an inexpensive, easy to access and commonly used test, which is recommended at the initial stages of almost all pathologies.In our study, only 95 (22.4%) patients had a normal CBC within 48\u00a0hours of COVID\u201019 diagnosis. Cytopenias were seen in almost half of the study participants. Another study conducted in China showed that patients of COVID\u201019 had leukopenia, lymphopenia, and eosinophil cytopenia compared with peripheral film findings of patients who had viral pneumonia due to causes other than COVID\u201019.\n17\n It is postulated that the cytopenias occurring in severe COVID\u201019 could be a consequence of increased inflammatory response and cytokine storm resulting in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\n18\n Regarding thrombocytopenia, it is hypothesized that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection results in increased platelet destruction due to circulating autoantibodies and immune complexes.\n19\n Lung injury also leads to endothelial damage, platelet activation, and consumption which further worsens thrombocytopenia in COVID\u201019.\n20\n\nThrombocytopenia, Lymphopenia, and Neutrophilic leucocytosis were the factors significantly associated with adverse outcomes in our study population. The cutoff value to define lymphopenia has varied in different studies in COVID\u201019 patients, ranging from <800/\u00b5L to <1500/\u00b5L.\n21\n Absolute lymphocyte count of <1000/\u00b5L used in our population was significantly associated with both mortality and ventilator need. While we assessed lymphopenia occurring within 48\u00a0hours of COVID\u201019 diagnosis, another study utilizing a time\u2010lymphocyte percentage model found that patients with a lymphocyte percentage of less than 5% detected 17\u201019\u00a0days after COVID\u201019 diagnosis were also expected to have poor outcomes in terms of mortality and intensive care requirement.\n22\n\nROC curve analysis was performed in which NLR and D\u2010dimer levels were found to be significant predictors of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID\u201019. A study by Zhang et al\n23\n showed that D\u2010dimer levels on admission greater than 2.0\u00a0\u00b5g/mL\u2014that is, a fourfold increase from the normal levels\u2014serve as a significant predictor of in\u2010hospital mortality. Another study found that dynamic assessment of D\u2010dimer and NLR throughout hospital stay were indicative of disease prognosis in COVID\u201019.\n24\n\nOur study is retrospective in nature from a single center in which patients had different hematological presentations such as lymphopenia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, reactive plasmacytoid lymphocytes, and pancytopenia. Hematology laboratory plays an important role in providing the clinical team with a number of useful diagnostic and prognostic markers.\n25\n\n 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONHematological indices including platelet count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, NLR, and D\u2010dimer play a valuable role in diagnosis, risk stratification, and prognosis of patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019 during early stages of infection.
