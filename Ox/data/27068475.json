Increasing evidence suggests that persistent AR signaling plays an essential role in development of hormone therapy resistance. A number of AR-centered mechanisms have been identified, including AR gene amplification, mutations in the AR ligand binding domain, modulation of AR functions by upstream signaling pathways and expression of AR splice variants (Feldman and Feldman, 2001; van der Steen et al., 2013). The discovery of CRPC dependence on the AR signaling has led to the development of second-generation endocrine therapeutics such as abiraterone and enzalutamide (de Bono et al., 2011; Scher et al., 2012). Enzalutamide acts to affect AR nuclear translocation and impairs AR transcriptional activation (Tran et al., 2009). Abiraterone is a cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) inhibitor that blocks intratumoral androgen synthesis (Attard et al., 2008). Despite the increased benefit of the new regimens in overall survival, most patients develop resistance after initial responses (Scher et al., 2010), and thus a cure for CRPC remains elusive.Developmental or tissue-specific gene expression is established primarily by transcription regulatory machineries at enhancers (Ong and Corces, 2011). Seminal works show that a class of non-coding RNAs, so-called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), is widely transcribed from cell lineage-specific enhancers (De Santa et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Orom et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011). Further studies reveal that eRNAs are expressed in a large spectrum of cell types (Hah et al., 2015; Lam et al., 2013; Melo et al., 2013; Mousavi et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2014). In mouse cortical neurons, the abundance of eRNA at neuronal gene enhancers strongly correlates with mRNA expression of nearby genes (Kim et al., 2010). Mechanistic studies show that in a locus-specific manner, eRNAs act in cis to stabilize enhancer-promoter looping, establish chromatin accessibility or facilitate release of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex (Hsieh et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Mousavi et al., 2013; Schaukowitch et al., 2014). Estrogen receptor (ER)- or AR-regulated eRNAs also act in trans to regulate gene expression in hormone-responsive cells, but the effects appear to be relatively infrequent in the cell types examined (Hsieh et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013).A major step in regulation of gene transcription is the assembly of the preinitiation complex that brings Pol II to gene promoters. Intriguingly, Pol II is often paused around 20-60 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Pol II release is achieved primarily by the activation of the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), which promotes phosphorylation of at least three targets, including NELF, DRB sensitive inducing factor (DSIF) and serine 2 in heptad repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of Pol II (Pol II-Ser2) (Peterlin and Price, 2006; Zhou et al., 2012). P-TEFb is a heterodimer composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and one of the C-type cyclins including T1, T2a and T2b, of which CYCLIN T1 is the most abundant partner (Peng et al., 1998). Approximately 50% of the total P-TEFb is present in an inactive form due to the binding of the inhibitory ribonucleoprotein complex composed of 7SK small nuclear RNA (7SK snRNA) and HEXIM1/2 (Nguyen et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2001). The trans-activating responsive (TAR) RNA at the 5\u2032 end of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transcript and the 3\u2032 hairpin of 7SK share a similar secondary structure (Egloff et al., 2006). TAR interacts with the HIV-1 transcription activator Tat to form a protein complex that activates P-TEFb by competing away the inhibitory subunit 7SK-HEXIM1/2 (Egloff et al., 2006; Roy et al., 1990). BRD4 is another important activator of P-TEFb (Jang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005). BRD4 activates P-TEFb by recruiting JMJD6 that mediates decapping/demethylation of 7SK and dismissal of the 7SK/HEXIM1/2 inhibitory complex (Liu et al., 2013).Significant progress has been made in elucidation of cellular functions of eRNAs in various tissue types. However, current knowledge about the mechanisms of action of eRNAs in gene transcription regulation and their roles in human diseases such as cancer is very limited. In the present study, we demonstrated that a group of AR-regulated enhancer RNAs (AR-eRNAs) such as PSA (or called KLK3) eRNA are upregulated in CRPC cells in culture and patient specimens. We further showed that PSA eRNA binds to CYCLIN T1, activates P-TEFb and increases Pol II-Ser2p. We found that this effect is mainly mediated through a TAR-L motif. ResultsAR-eRNAs Are Upregulated in Human CRPC Cells and Patient TissuesGiven the pivotal role of AR function in CRPC progression, we sought to assess genome-wide AR activity by profiling AR-eRNA expression in CRPC cells. We employed androgen-dependent LNCaP and its castration-resistant derivative C4-2 (Dehm and Tindall, 2006) as model systems. We performed strand-specific, ribosome-minus RNA-seq in these cell lines. The hypersensitivity and large dynamic range of RNA-seq allowed us to identify and quantify the expression of both eRNAs and mRNAs. We performed in parallel AR chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to define the AR binding sites in the genome. By assigning eRNAs to the nearest genes, we found a total of 6,193 AR-eRNAs were expressed at AR-bound enhancers in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Figure 1A). Meta-analysis of published ChIP-seq data from LNCaP cells (Wang et al., 2011) indicates that these are authentic enhancers as evident by the enrichment of AR coregulators (FOXA1, MED12 and P300), Pol II, H2AZ and enhancer histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K27ac (Figure 1A). Similar to a bimodal pattern of H3K4me2 at AR-bound enhancers (He et al., 2010), very low or no eRNA signals were detected in the center of the AR binding sites but increased bilaterally, reminiscent of eRNA expression revealed by the global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) data (Wang et al., 2011) (Figure 1A). In agreement with the previous report (Pekowska et al., 2011), H3K4me3 was also detectable at these transcriptionally active enhancers, but its level was much lower than that of the canonical enhancer histone marks (Figure 1A). The averaged RNA-seq signal intensities of 6,193 AR-eRNAs were globally higher in C4-2 cells compared to LNCaP cells when cultured under androgen deprivation conditions (Figure 1B). Unsupervised clustering analyses revealed that among these AR-eRNAs, 1,865 (30%) were upregulated in C4-2 compared to LNCaP cells (Figures 1C and 1D), 923 (15%) were downregulated in C4-2 and 3,405 (55%) exhibited no statistically significant differences between these two cell lines. Upregulation of AR-eRNAs in C4-2 cells is exemplified by the well-studied AR target gene PSA (the third most highly expressed eRNA identified in C4-2 cells, see Table S1) and another AR target gene ARHGEF26 (the most highly expressed eRNA, see Table S1) (Figure 1E). We conclude that expression of a large set of AR-eRNAs is aberrantly upregulated in C4-2 CRPC cells in culture.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Upregulation of AR-bound enhancer RNAs (AR-eRNAs) in CRPC cells(A) Aggregate plots showing the distribution of average tags (Signal Per Million mapped Reads) of AR ChIP-seq and RNA-seq around AR binding sites in LNCaP and C4-2 cells.

The eRNA and mRNA regions are highlighted inyellow. PSA (left); ARHGEF26 (right).To further interrogate AR-eRNA expression in CRPC cells, we focused on the top 5 highly expressed cancer-relevant genes ARHGEF26, KLK15, HTR3A, TLE1 and SLC16A7 (Table S1). RNA-seq data revealed that eRNA peaks at these loci were intergenic (Figures 1E and S1A). Upregulation of these genes at the mRNA and protein levels in C4-2 CRPC cells and androgen regulation of their expression in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells were confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot (Figures 2A and S1B). Substantial interactions between the promoters and the putative enhancers at these loci were validated by chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays in C4-2 and androgen-stimulated LNCaP cells (Figure 2B).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Identification of five new AR target genes whose expression is upregulated in CRPC tissues(A) eRNA and mRNA expression of five new AR target genes (ARHGEF26, KLK15, HTR3A, TLE1 and SLC16A7) were measured by RT-qPCR.

PSA eRNAs were also upregulated in CRPC patient samples (Figures 2D and 2E). Analysis of a previously reported dataset (Grasso et al., 2012) indicated that expression of HTR3A and TLE1 was particularly upregulated in metastatic CRPC patient samples compared to primary tumors (Figure S1D). We also analyzed mRNA expression of these five genes in two additional CRPC datasets in the public domain (Glinsky et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2004). We demonstrated that differential expression of these genes stratified prostate cancer patients into two subgroups in which higher expression of these genes associated with lower biochemical recurrence-free survival, and the discriminating power was consistent in these two independent cohorts of patients (Figures S1E). Thus, through eRNA profiling analyses we identified a subset of AR-regulated genes whose expression is associated with CRPC progression in patients.PSA eRNA Regulates Pol II Ser2 Phosphorylation in the Cis LocusWe found that AR was required for AR-eRNA expression in C4-2 cells (Figure S1F). However, upregulation of AR-eRNAs in C4-2 cells was unlikely caused by increased expression of AR protein, because little or no difference in AR protein level was detected in C4-2 and LNCaP cells regardless of androgen treatment (Figure S1G), which is consistent with the previous report (Dehm and Tindall, 2006). No significant correlation was observed between expression of AR-eRNAs (or corresponding mRNAs) and AR binding at the 1,865 enhancers where AR-eRNAs were upregulated in C4-2 cells (Figure S1H). ChIP assays demonstrated that active histone modifications such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were upregulated, but the repressive histone modification H3K9me2 was downregulated in the AR-eRNA expressing enhancers examined in C4-2 compared to LNCaP cells (Figure S1I). Thus, it appears that the active histone modifications, but not AR protein level are responsible for increased expression of AR-eRNAs in C4-2 CRPC cells.Similar to the previous findings in cortical neurons (Kim et al., 2010), our RNA-seq data revealed a global correlation between eRNA and mRNA expression in both LNCaP (r = 0.59) and C4-2 (r = 0.56) cells (Figure S2A). We therefore sought to determine the functional importance of AR-eRNAs in regulation of AR target gene mRNA expression in CRPC cells. Knockdown of PSA eRNA by sequence-specific siRNAs significantly decreased PSA mRNA expression in C4-2 cells (Figure S2B). To avoid the potential off-target effect of siRNAs, highly optimized generation-2.5 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (Burel et al., 2013), which induce RNase H-dependent degradation of the complementary target RNA without involving the cellular RNA interference machinery, were employed as an independent approach to knock down PSA eRNA. The levels of PSA eRNAs, unlike the other AR-eRNAs examined, were effectively reduced by two independent ASOs of PSA eRNAs (Figure 3A and S2C). Similar to siRNAs, treatment of C4-2 cells with ASOs also significantly reduced PSA mRNA expression (Figure 3A). The consistent results obtained from two independent knockdown methods suggest a cis function of PSA eRNA in regulating PSA mRNA expression in CRPC cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 3PSA eRNA regulates Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation at both cis and trans targets(A) Effectiveness of PSA eRNA knockdown mediated by sequence-specific ASOs and its effect on PSA mRNA expression.

VEGFA (left); SLC45A3 (right).Pol II-Ser2p is required for productive transcription elongation and gene expression (Zhou et al., 2012). Therefore, we examined whether PSA eRNA expression affects Pol II-Ser2p at the PSA locus. Knockdown of PSA eRNA by siRNAs decreased the Pol II-Ser2p level in the PSA promoter in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Figure S2D). Similarly, knockdown of PSA eRNAs by ASOs resulted in a decrease in Pol II-Ser2p at the PSA promoter in C4-2 cells, which was accompanied by an increase in total Pol II, although no overt change in unphosphorylated Pol II was detected (Figures 3B and S2E). While Pol II promoter proximal pause release and Pol II-Ser2p are achieved mainly through the action of P-TEFb composed of CYCLIN T and CDK9, we found that PSA eRNA knockdown had little or no effect on CYCLIN T1 binding in the PSA promoter (Figure S2F). Moreover, AR ChIP-seq analyses showed that PSA eRNA knockdown in C4-2 cells slightly decreased AR binding at the PSA promoter, but the decrease was not statistically significant (Figure S2G). This result was further confirmed by AR ChIP-qPCR (Figure S2G). Reduction in PSA eRNA also decreased Pol II-Ser2p occupancy levels at genomic areas corresponding to the coding sequence (CDS) and 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) (Figure 3B). These data suggest that PSA eRNA plays a critical cis role in regulating Pol II-Ser2p levels at the PSA gene locus.PSA eRNA Regulates Pol II Ser2 Phosphorylation at Trans Target LociMost ER-eRNAs examined are expressed at very low levels (5-15 copies per cell) in breast cancer cells and the trans effects of ER-eRNAs are relatively infrequent (Li et al., 2013). Given that the trans effects of PSA eRNA were observed in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells (Hsieh et al., 2014), we measured the copy numbers of PSA eRNA in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. PSA eRNA levels were low (52 \u00b1 11 copies per nucleus) in LNCaP cells, but were > 15-fold higher (831 \u00b1 86 copies per nucleus) in C4-2 cells (Figure S2H). These results prompted us to determine the global trans effect of PSA eRNA knockdown on Pol II-Ser2p levels. We performed Pol II-Ser2p, total and unphosphorylated Pol II ChIP-seq in mock and PSA eRNA siRNA-treated C4-2 cells. Given that P-TEFb (CYLIN T1 and CDK9) is the major factor responsible for Pol II-Ser2p, we also performed CYCLIN T1 ChIP-seq. PSA eRNA knockdown significantly decreased Pol II-Ser2p levels at loci of a subset of genes (674 targets, FDR < 0.001), which include the cis target PSA and the known (FKBP5 and NKX3.1 (Hsieh et al., 2014)) and new trans targets with functions in regulation of cell cycle, growth, survival, migration and invasion such as VEGFA, NCAPD3 (Liu et al., 2010), ADAMTS1 (Carver et al., 2009) and IGF1R (Figures 3C, 3D, S2I and Table S2). PSA eRNA knockdown had little or no effect on occupancy of unphosphorylated Pol II and AR at the 674 targets (Figure S2J and S2K). While Pol II-Ser2-p was apparently reduced by PSA eRNA knockdown at these loci, overall changes in total Pol II (including increase in the promoter and decreased occupancy in the gene body as measured by traveling ratio) were relatively small (Figure S2K-S2M), making the explanation likely to be the changes in both transcription and processing. Indeed, consistent with the previous finding in Drosophila that decreased Pol II-Ser2p decreases mRNA levels by affecting mRNA 3\u2032 processing (Ni et al., 2004), we found that the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved RNA in the control knockdown cells was much greater than that in PSA eRNA knockdown cells at three out of five loci examined (Figure S2N). These data suggest that the effect of PSA eRNA knockdown on gene expression can be attributed to a combination of reduced transcription and defective 3\u2032 processing.Little or no change in CYCLIN T1 binding in the majority (498 of 674, approximately 74%) of these loci was detected consistently among the replicates (Table S3). Notably, 586 out of 674 loci (87%) had AR binding within 50 kb around TSS (Table S2), and among the top 25 hits were known AR-regulated genes (e.g. NDRG1, FKBP5, SLC45A3 and TMPRSS2) (Figure 3C and Table S2), suggesting the importance of PSA eRNA in regulating AR signaling. ChIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR assays further confirmed that knockdown of PSA eRNA by two independent ASOs invariably decreased Pol II-Ser2p levels at the promoters of the trans targets examined as well as mRNA expression of these genes in C4-2, but not in the non-prostatic cell lines examined (Figures S3A-S3C). Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assays showed that PSA eRNA was present in the promoters of these genes (Figure S3D). The effects of PSA eRNA on total, unphosphorylated and Ser5p Pol II, CYCLIN T1 and AR binding at the promoters of these trans target loci were validated by ChIP-qPCR (Figures S3E). PSA eRNA knockdown mitigated enhancer-promoter looping in cis (PSA), but not in trans loci (TMPRSS2 and NKX3.1) (Figure S3F). These data indicate that PSA eRNA regulates Pol II-Ser2p levels at a number of trans target loci.PSA eRNA Binds to CYCLIN T1 of the P-TEFb ComplexIn agreement with the high expression of PSA eRNA in C4-2 cells (Figure 1E) and the role of PSA eRNA in regulation of Pol II-Ser2p (Figures 3B-3D), CDK9-mediated Pol II-Ser2 phosphorylation was much higher in C4-2 than that in LNCaP cells (Figure S4A). Besides P-TEFb, other factors such as CDK12 and the phosphatase FCP1 are also involved in regulation of Pol II-Ser2p (Cho et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2012). While dissociation of NELF from the paused Pol II cannot affect Pol II-Ser2p, it plays an essential role in promoting transcription elongation (Yamaguchi et al., 1999). Given that eRNA induces transcription elongation by binding to and causing the release of the E subunit of NELF (NELF-E) from the paused Pol II (Schaukowitch et al., 2014), we examined whether PSA eRNA binds to these factors. Biotin-labeled RNA pulldown assay demonstrated that only CDK9 and CYCLIN T1 were associated with PSA eRNA and these results were confirmed by reciprocal RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays (Figures 4A and 4B). In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that PSA eRNA enhanced P-TEFb complex-mediated phosphorylation of Pol II CTD (Figure 4C). Accordingly, concomitant PSA eRNA and CDK9 knockdown failed to further decrease expression of the cis and trans targets of PSA eRNA compared with CDK9 knockdown alone (Figure S4B), suggesting that the function of PSA eRNA is mainly mediated through P-TEFb. Consistent with the GRO-seq results (Wang et al., 2011), our RNA-seq data showed that high-level eRNA signals were mainly detected in a 350-nucleotide peak region (Figures 1E and S4C). In vitro RNA binding assays demonstrated that GST-CYCLIN T1, but not GST-CDK9 or GST alone, preferentially bound to RNAs that were in vitro transcribed from the eRNA peak region in comparison to those synthesized from a control region (Figures S4C and S4D). A similar specific interaction between the PSA eRNA peak region and endogenous CYCLIN T1 was detected in C4-2 cells using sonication RIP assay (Figure 4D). ChIRP and ChIP assays demonstrated that PSA eRNA and CYCLIN T1 bound to the same region of the PSA promoter (Figure 4E).Open in a separate windowFigure 4PSA eRNA binds to P-TEFb(A) C4-2 cell lysate was incubated with in vitro transcribed biotin-labeled RNAs followed by western blots.

While CDK7 knockdown decreased T186p in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Figure S4E), little or no difference in the levels of CDK9 T186p was detected in these two cell lines (Figure S4F). Knockdown of PSA eRNA had no effect on T186p in C4-2 cells (Figure S4G). Notably, previous findings show that while T186p is essential for CDK9 activation, T186-phosphorylated CDK9 can be functionally inactive due to its binding by 7SK and HEXIM1/2, the inhibitory subunit of P-TEFb (Zhou et al., 2012). Thus, PSA eRNA may regulate Pol II Ser-2 phosphorylation and the P-TEFb activity through mechanisms dependent on CYCLIN T1 binding, but independent of CDK9 T-loop phosphorylation.Identification of a TAR-L Motif in PSA eRNA that Promotes P-TEFb ActivationWe demonstrated that deletion of a 50-bp region (-3,904 to -3,854 relative to TSS) within the PSA eRNA peak region largely diminished PSA eRNA binding to the recombinant CYCLIN T1 protein in vitro and the CYCLIN T1-CDK9 protein complex in cells (Figures 5A and S5A). Deletion of the same region also significantly abolished the transcriptional activity of the PSA reporter gene (Figure 5B). It is worth noting that while deletion of the -3,904/-3,854 region abrogated PSA eRNA binding with the CYCLIN T1/CDK9 complex in vitro, it did not completely abolished PSA reporter gene activity in cells (Figures 5A and 5B). A plausible reason is that the intact endogenous PSA eRNA may act in trans to activate the reporter gene in the presence of endogenous CYLIN T1/CDK9 complex. This concept was further supported by the finding that the transcriptional activity of a promoter-alone reporter gene, which lacks any potential cis elements from the enhancer region, was also diminished by PSA eRNA knockdown (Figure S5B).Open in a separate windowFigure 5Identification of a TAR-L motif in PSA eRNA important for P-TEFb binding and gene transactivation(A) Left, the broken lines represent the deletion regions in PSA eRNA.

Data shown as means\u00b1SD (n=3). * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01.Within the CYCLIN T1-binding region (-3,904 \u223c -3,854) of PSA eRNA, we identified a TAR RNA-like (TAR-L) motif that shares a similar secondary structure with TAR RNA and the 3\u2032 end of 7SK snRNA (Figures 5C, S5C and S5D). Deletion of the TAR-L motif largely diminished PSA eRNA binding with CYCLIN T1 in vitro (Figure 5D), suggesting that TAR-L is important for CYCLIN T1 binding. We further showed that the in vitro and in vivo interactions of these molecules were both largely diminished by adding or expression of 7SK, respectively (Figures 5E and S4D). No association of PSA eRNA with HEXIM1 was detected by RIP assay in C4-2 cells (Figure 5E). ChIP assays demonstrated that knockdown of PSA eRNA by ASOs increased HEXIM1 binding in the promoters of both cis and trans targets of PSA eRNA (Figure S5E and S5F). These data suggest that PSA eRNA promotes P-TEFb activation by functioning as a competitor of 7SK.To further characterize the function of the TAR-L motif, we generated a unique PSA reporter gene construct, PSA-5\u2032Insert-Luc, by inserting a 15-bp non-specific sequence in the region 5\u2032 to the enhancer androgen responsive element (ARE). This insertion did not affect the transcriptional activity of the reporter, but makes the reporter construct suitable for ChIP assessment of AR binding (Figure S5G). Deletion of TAR-L impaired the transcriptional activity of this reporter gene and the effect was reversed by replacing TAR-L with TAR RNA (nucleotides 20-42) or the 3\u2032 end (nucleotides 302-324) of 7SK (Figure 5F). However, reversing the orientation of the TAR-L motif inhibited the reporter gene activity (Figure 5F).Similarly, replacement of TAR-L with TAR or 7SK 3\u2032 end in a reversed orientation failed to restore the reporter gene activity (Figure 5G), which is consistent with the previous report that the orientation of 7SK and TAR is functionally important (Dingwall et al., 1990). These data argue that the effect of TAR-L deletion was unlikely caused by loss of any potential cis regulatory element within this region. These genetic manipulations did not affect AR binding to the PSA enhancer and promoter of the reporter gene (Figure S5H). Disruption of the hairpin structure by introducing mutations in the complementary base pairs in the TAR-L motif impaired PSA promoter transcriptional activity in both C4-2 and LNCaP cells (Figure S5I). Putative TAR-L sequences were also identified in other highly expressed AR-eRNAs (Figure S5J). Similar to the PSA eRNA, the TAR-L motif in TMPRSS2 and SLC16A7 eRNAs was important for CYCLIN T1 binding in vitro (Figure S5K). They also bound to CYCLIN T1 in cultured cells and their binding was largely diminished by 7SK expression (Figure S5L). Thus, we have identified a TAR-L module in AR-eRNAs that is critical for eRNA binding to CYCLIN T1, P-TEFb activation and eRNA-mediated AR target gene transcription.Importance of the Endogenous TAR-L Element in P-TEFb Activation in CellsTo further our understanding of the function of the TAR-L motif in PSA eRNA, we employed TALEN-based DNA editing (Bedell et al., 2012) to specifically delete the TAR-L motif or an adjacent region (negative control) in the genome of C4-2 cells (Figure S6A). Similar to LNCaP, C4-2 cells are tetraploid (4n) with 4 copies of chromosome 19 where the PSA gene is located (Murillo et al., 2006). We acquired three independent TAR-L partial (50%) deletion subclones in which this motif was completely removed and replaced by non-specific sequences (Figures S6B-S6D and S6G). We also obtained two control subclones where the target sequence was partially (50% or 75%) deleted and both deletions had no significant effect on PSA eRNA and mRNA expression in C4-2 cells (Figures S6E-S6H). While TAR-L deletion had little or no effect on PSA eRNA expression (Figure 6A), it significantly downregulated PSA mRNA expression, decreased Pol II-Ser2p levels at the PSA locus, increased total Pol II and HEXIM1 binding to the PSA promoter, but did not affect AR and CYCLIN T1 binding, unphosphorylated Pol II levels and enhancer/promoter looping (Figures 6A-6C and S6I-S6L). Similar results were obtained for the PSA eRNA trans targets examined (Figures 6D, S6L and S7A-S7F). Moreover, PSA eRNA expression was correlated with mRNA expression of these trans target genes in CRPC patient samples (Figure S7G). We conclude that the TAR-L motif is required for PSA eRNA-mediated regulation of Pol II-Ser2p levels at both cis and trans target loci and their mRNA expression in CRPC cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 6The TAR-L motif in the endogenous PSA eRNA is important for its target gene expression, Pol II-Ser2p levels and CRPC cell growth(A) Left, schematic diagram showing C4-2 cell clones expressing PSA eRNA in which the TAR-L motif or a control region was deleted by TALENs.

Deletion of the TAR-L motif by TALEN also significantly diminished the viability of C4-2 cells (Figure 6F), and this result was consistent with the finding that TAR-L deletion significantly decreased expression of the trans targets that are important for cell cycle progression, proliferation and survival (Figure S7A). DiscussionActivation of the P-TEFb complex is important for Pol II Ser-2 phosphorylation, release of paused Pol II and gene transcription, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. An essential step in P-TEFb activation is its dissociation from the inhibitory subunit composed of 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1/2 (Liu et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2001). HIV-1 Tat (via interaction with TAR RNA) and BRD4 (via interaction with JMJD6) are capable of extracting P-TEFb out from the inhibitory 7SK/HEXIM1/2 complex by competing away and mediating decapping/demethylation of 7SK, respectively (Egloff et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2013; Roy et al., 1990). We identified a TAR-L sequence in PSA eRNA and other AR-eRNAs that share a similar secondary structure with the 3\u2032 end of 7SK snRNA and HIV-1 TAR RNA. We provided evidence that PSA eRNA binds to CYCLIN T1, but not HEXIM1 and the binding is mediated by the TAR-L motif. Accordingly, we showed that PSA eRNA promotes P-TEFb activation as a competitor of 7SK. Through reporter gene and TALEN-based gene editing assays, we provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that the TAR-L motif in PSA eRNA is important for P-TEFb activation and Pol II Ser-2 phosphorylation. Thus, our findings reveal a previously undefined mechanism of P-TEFb activation and a function of eRNA in regulating P-TEFb activation, Pol II-Ser2 phosphorylation and gene transcription in cis and in trans (Figure 6G). It is worth noting that HIV-1 Tat forms a complex with TAR RNA to activate P-TEFb by competing away the inhibitory subunit 7SK and HEXIM1/2 (Zhou et al., 2012). At present, however, whether or not PSA eRNA also requires a similar partner activator to activate the P-TEFb complex is unclear, and further investigation is warranted in the future.Reactivation of AR is a central mechanism for CRPC progression. Targeting the androgen-AR axis by the second-generation endocrine therapies (e.g. abiraterone and enzalutamide) has been effective for CRPC treatment in clinic. However, drug resistance ultimately develops in some patients presumably due to expression of AR splice variants and/or other undefined mechanisms (Antonarakis et al., 2014). Enhancer functions are important for tissue-specific gene expression and cell lineage development (Maston et al., 2006; Orom and Shiekhattar, 2013; Xie and Ren, 2013). A recent seminal finding is that enhancers make eRNAs. In the current study, eRNA profiling analysis has allowed us to define a signature set of AR-regulated genes whose expression associates with CRPC progression in patients. These findings imply that aberrant eRNA expression represents a new gauge of abnormal AR activity in CRPC. We further revealed that through both the cis and trans mechanisms of action, PSA eRNA plays a key role in increasing aberrant AR activity and CRPC cell viability. These results highlight a possibility that effective targeting of PSA eRNA alone or in combination with other anticancer agents such as antiandrogens bicalutamide or enzalutamide could serve as a therapeutic option for CRPC treatment in clinic. It is worth noting that in the present study we mainly focused on the investigation of the functional importance of PSA eRNA. With the unfolding of the function of other AR-eRNAs, it is conceivable that combined knockdown of a set of AR-eRNAs may result in greater inhibition or elimination of CRPC growth. We envision that although the mechanisms underlying aberrant AR activity in CRPC has not been fully understood, blockage of the activities of key enhancers by targeting functional AR-eRNAs may open up a new avenue for CRPC therapy.Despite being extensively utilized as a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis as well as a model gene to study androgen action, the significance of PSA gene in prostate cancer growth and survival has not been well established. We demonstrated that knockdown of PSA eRNA by ASOs largely decreased the viability of C4-2 CRPC cells, implying the significance of PSA eRNA in CRPC cell growth and survival. Deletion of the TAR-L motif by TALEN also significantly diminished the viability of C4-2 cells, and this result was consistent with the finding that TAR-L deletion significantly decreased expression of the trans targets of PSA eRNA that are important for cell cycle progression, proliferation and survival. Thus, in addition to the cis function in regulation of PSA mRNA expression, we found that PSA eRNA can trans regulate expression of a subset of genes involved in androgen action, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, survival and growth as well as migration and invasion. Our data reveal that as one of the genes most strongly transactivated by AR signaling, the PSA gene produces eRNAs from its enhancer to \u201cmagnify\u201d AR action by trans regulating a large number of downstream target genes. Our findings also suggest that besides being as a biomarker, the PSA gene can produce eRNAs from its enhancer that are functionally important. PSA thus represents an unconventional class of genes whose tumor biological significance is not solely reflected by their protein function, but also by other functional components such as eRNA.In summary, we identified a TAR-L motif in AR-eRNAs and demonstrated that this motif in PSA eRNA is important for CYCLIN T1 binding, P-TEFb activation, Pol II Ser2 phosphorylation, cis and trans regulation of transcription of target genes and CRPC cell growth (Figure 6G). Therefore, our findings not only reveal a previously undefined mechanism of action for enhancer RNAs in both cis and trans regulation of gene transcription, but also uncover a new mode of P-TEFb activation. These results suggest that targeting AR-eRNAs using new methods such as ASOs represent an alternative arsenal of AR-directed therapies for CRPC.
