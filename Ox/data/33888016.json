However, it is still a high-risk procedure that is associated with many complications.1,2 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the pulmonary complications, which has an incidence of 15.6% after allogeneic HSCT.3 Recent studies3\u20135 indicate that despite advances in mechanical ventilation and other life-supporting methods, the prognosis of HSCT patients with ARDS is rather poor, with intensive care unit (ICU) mortality up to 76.0%.Corticosteroids have long been applied in the treatment of ARDS patients. Their theoretical mechanisms are based on suppression of systemic inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis,6 which both were drivers in the pathogenesis of ARDS.7,8 Some randomized controlled trials9,10 showed a decrease in hospital mortality or increase of ventilator free days with corticosteroids, while others11,12 failed to validate these effects. Even though many HSCT patients with acute respiratory failure were frequently treated with corticosteroids,13\u201315 there were no relative studies focused on corticosteroid therapy in ARDS for this population. Hence, in this bicenter retrospective study, we aim to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on hospital mortality and other outcomes of patients with HSCT and ARDS. MethodsThis bicenter retrospective study was approved by the ethics and research board of Peking University International Hospital and Peking University People\u2019s Hospital.PatientsData of patients (in Peking University International Hospital: from August 2015 to August 2019; in Peking University People\u2019s Hospital: from August 2009 to August 2019) who were admitted into ICUs were retrieved from the medical record system. We included adult patients with an admission diagnosis of HSCT and ARDS. The diagnosis of ARDS was based on the Berlin definition.16The exclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Application of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents within 30\u2009days prior to ARDS onset. (2) Initiation of corticosteroid therapy later than 7\u2009days of ARDS onset. (3) Patients with comorbidities that may be influenced by corticosteroids: asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, organizing pneumonia, et cetera.Data collection and patient groupingThe baseline characteristics of included patients were recorded on the day of ARDS onset, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) in arterial blood gas analysis, the origin of ARDS, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, granulocyte count, hemoglobin level and C-reactive protein level. All blood samples mentioned above were collected from arterial catheter. Variables that related to HSCT were also recorded at the same time point, including type of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allogeneic or autologous), post transplantation days, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, graft versus host disease (GvHD) within 3\u2009months, disease relapse after HSCT and the diagnosis of the malignancy.Patients would be screened for suspicious infections with pathogen analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests or pathogen culture, with samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or blood; PCR tests for viremia were performed weekly during hospital stay for HSCT patients.The following variables were recorded or analyzed at the time of discharge (from hospital) or death, including adjunctive therapies for ARDS, details of corticosteroid therapy (time of corticosteroid initiation relative to mechanical ventilation, type of drug administered, dosage and duration of the therapy) and outcomes of patients (hospital mortality, hospital days in survivors, ICU days in survivors, ventilator free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, new onset of bacteremia or viremia). Among the outcomes, hospital mortality is the primary outcome; others are secondary outcomes.We performed a multivariate regression to test the effect of different accumulated doses (on various days after ARDS onset) of corticosteroids on hospital mortality (Figure 1), and not one combination indicated a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. However, through multivariate logistic regression, if a patient received \u2a7e480\u2009mg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent within the first 3\u2009days after ARDS onset, they had a significantly higher risk of new onset bacteremia or viremia, and a higher number of ventilator free days (see Supplemental Material Tables S2, S3, S4 of the Additional File 1 online). Thus, we made the definition of \u201cearly high dose steroids\u201d as receiving an accumulated dose \u2a7e480\u2009mg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent within the first 3\u2009days after ARDS onset. Patients were divided into early high dose steroids group and no early high dose steroids group. Patients in this cohort have a bodyweight ranging from 30 kg to 83\u2009kg, thus the daily doses in the early high dose steroids group are higher than 1\u20132\u2009mg/kg of methylprednisolone in previous randomized controlled trails.9,11Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Adjusted odds ratios of hospital mortality for various cumulated corticosteroid doses on different days after acute respiratory distress syndrome onset.1At day 5, 10 patients had cumulative doses above the upper limit.2At day 7, 69 patients had cumulative doses above the upper limit.Odds ratios adjusted for risk factors of hospital mortality including granulocyte count, lymphocyte count, graft versus host disease within 3\u2009months, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; see Table S1 in Supplemental File 1.Statistical analysisThe normality of data was tested using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Normal distributed continuous variables were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (normal distributed). Non-normal distributed variables were presented as median (interquartile range), categorical variables were presented as number (percentage). Comparison of two groups of continuous variables was performed with Student\u2019s t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test as appropriate. Comparison of categorical variables was achieved using \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic models were used to investigate potential risk factors of hospital mortality, variables with a p\u2009<\u20090.1 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate analysis, variables were selected with the backward stepwise elimination method. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the effects of variables on mortality. All tests were two-sided and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.To account for the confounding effect from the indication of corticosteroid therapy and baseline imbalances between study groups, propensity score matching was performed on the complete cohort. Propensity scores were produced by a logistic regression model which included variables that may be associated with the indication of corticosteroid therapy (SOFA score, PaO2/FiO2 in arterial blood gas analysis, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, GvHD within 3\u2009months) and baseline variables (age, sex, BMI). Matching was performed on a nearest neighbor basis, with 1:1 ratio without a replacement algorithm. The caliper was set at 0.02, post matching balance was evaluated with the standardized mean difference, the optimal balance was considered as <0.1. All previously mentioned analyses were re-performed in the matched cohort to validate the original conclusions.All statistical analyses were performed on SPSS (Version 25, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA), Some figures were illustrated with GraphPad Prism (Version 8.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). ResultsPatientsThree hundred and ninety-eight patients with the diagnosis of HSCT and ARDS were admitted into the two study center in the study period; 134 patients were excluded (123 patients with previous application of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive agents within 30\u2009days prior to ARDS onset, five patients with corticosteroid therapy later than 7\u2009days of ARDS onset, six patients with comorbidities that may be influenced by corticosteroid therapy). A total of 264 patients were included in the original study cohort; 89 (33.71%) patients received early high dose steroids, while 175 (66.29%) patients were without early high dose steroids. The baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between these two groups except for the sex ratio (Table 1).Table 1.Baseline characteristics of patients with or without early high dose steroids before and after propensity score matching.Original study cohortMatched cohortNo early high dose steroidsn\u2009=\u2009175\u201366.29%Early high dose steroidsn\u2009=\u200989\u201333.71%\np\nSMDNo early high dose steroidsn\u2009=\u200965\u201350%Early high dose steroidsn\u2009=\u200965\u201350%\np\nSMDAge, yearsa39\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9841\u2009\u00b1\u200915.620.270.14439.83\u2009\u00b1\u20099.3439.11\u2009\u00b1\u20097.060.620.087Sexa0.0491.050.860.031Female (%)74 (42.28)49 (55.06)32 (49.23)33 (50.77)Male (%)101 (57.71)40 (44.94)33 (50.77)32 (49.23)BMIa, kg/m221.74\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3320.66\u2009\u00b1\u20096.270.0690.23821.17\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3821.08\u2009\u00b1\u20092.940.8720.028SOFA scorea6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.477.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.660.0690.2156.83\u2009\u00b1\u20092.766.70\u2009\u00b1\u20092.350.7730.051PaO2/FiO2a, mmHg147.25\u2009\u00b1\u200937.21154.3\u2009\u00b1\u200967.760.2760.129154.66\u2009\u00b1\u200971.53153.22\u2009\u00b1\u200952.330.8960.023Origin of ARDS0.8050.0670.8420.075Pneumonia156 (89.14)77 (86.52)57 (87.70)58 (89.23)Sepsis12 (6.86)8 (8.99)6 (9.23)6 (9.23)Others7 (4.00)4 (4.49)2 (3.07)1 (1.54)Laboratory dataWBC counta, \u00d7109/L3.88\u2009\u00b1\u20093.213.35\u2009\u00b1\u20092.540.1760.1770.1423.52\u2009\u00b1\u20093.163.35\u2009\u00b1\u20092.010.7150.064Lymphocyte count, \u00d7109/L0.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.650.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.330.2760.4030.110.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.530.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.420.2350.209Granulocyte count, \u00d7109/L3.47\u2009\u00b1\u20092.523.73\u2009\u00b1\u20092.090.3390.1253.49\u2009\u00b1\u20092.823.73\u2009\u00b1\u20092.170.8560.095Hemoglobin, g/dL84.82\u2009\u00b1\u200919.3582.55\u2009\u00b1\u200915.660.1210.20384.33\u2009\u00b1\u200919.0581.54\u2009\u00b1\u200918.660.4010.148C-reactive proteina, mg/L19.58\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3321.24\u2009\u00b1\u20099.6720.52\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1321.24\u2009\u00b1\u200910.160.6560.078Type of HSCTAllogenic175 (100)89 (100)1N/A65651N/AAutologous0000Post-transplantation days170 (64\u2013346)165 (76\u2013259)0.3120.026167 (69\u2013225)165 (68\u2013220)0.6240.086HLA matching0.6410.0680.7160.073Identical (%)95 (54.29)51 (57.31)40 (61.54)42 (64.62)Haploidentical (%)80 (45.71)38 (42.69)25 (38.46)23 (35.38)GvHD within 3\u2009monthsa0.1050.2590.7040.079Affected (%)136 (77.71)61 (68.54)44 (67.69)46 (70.77)Not affected (%)39 (22.29)28 (31.46)21 (32.31)19 (29.23)Disease relapse after HSCT0.2060.4570.4030.399Affected (%)10 (7.4)3 (3.4)4 (6.56)2 (3.08)Not affected (%)125 (92.6)86 (96.6)61 (93.85)63 (96.92)Type of malignancy0.2680.0670.6740.234Acute myelogenous leukemia59352830Acute lymphocytic leukemia47381626Chronic myelocytic leukemia12392Myelodysplastic syndrome10594Lymphoma3321Multiple myeloma2402Other malignancy2110Adjunctive therapiesProne positioning11 (6.29)5 (5.62)0.830.0283 (4.62)2 (3.08)0.6480.081Neuromuscular blockade7 (4.00)9 (10.1)0.0890.2583 (4.62)5 (7.70)0.4650.115ECMO2 (1.14)3 (3.37)0.2090.1640 (0)1 (1.54)0.3230.177Open in a separate windowValues are given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standardized deviation, median (interquartile range) or number (%).aThis variable was matched by propensity score matching.ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BMI, body mass index; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; GvHD, graft versus host disease; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; N/A, not applicable; PaO2, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; SMD, standardized mean difference; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; WBC, white blood cell.Corticosteroid therapyThe details of corticosteroid therapy are presented in Table 2. In the original study cohort, 208 (78.79%) patients were treated with corticosteroid, among them 89 (33.71%) patients received \u2a7e480\u2009mg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent within the first 3\u2009days after ARDS onset. The most frequently prescribed corticosteroid was methylprednisolone (85.23%), followed by dexamethasone (11.74%), prednisone (2.27%) and hydrocortisone (0.76%). Patients received a median dose of 88 (38\u2013332) mg or 1.5\u2009mg/kg methylprednisolone (or its equivalent) per day, the length of corticosteroid therapy was 15 (12\u201321) days. The median time from ARDS onset to corticosteroid therapy was 0 (0\u20132) days. PaO2/FiO2 on ARDS diagnosis before corticosteroid therapy was significantly lower than those without corticosteroid therapy (144.79\u2009\u00b1\u200925.38 versus 225.36\u2009\u00b1\u200915.21, p\u2009<\u20090.001).Table 2.Details of corticosteroid therapy in included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients with ARDS.Number (%), median (interquartile range) or mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standardized deviationCorticosteroid therapy208 (78.79)Early high dose steroidsa89 (33.71)Types of corticosteroid\u2009Methylprednisolone225 (85.23)\u2009Dexamethasone31 (11.74)\u2009Prednisone6 (2.27)\u2009Hydrocortisone2 (0.76)Length of corticosteroid therapy, days15 (12\u201321)Methylprednisolone equivalent doses per day, mg88 (38\u2013332)Methylprednisolone equivalent doses per day, mg/kg1.50 (0.62\u20135.85)Duration between ARDS onset and corticosteroid therapy, days0 (0\u20132)PaO2/FiO2 on ARDS diagnosis before corticosteroid therapy, cmH2Ob144.79\u2009\u00b1\u200925.38Open in a separate windowaReceived \u2a7e480\u2009mg of methylprednisolone or its equivalent within the first 3\u2009days after ARDS onset.bSignificant when compared with PaO2/FiO2 on ARDS diagnosis for patients without corticosteroid therapy, which was 211.36\u2009\u00b1\u200915.21\u2009cmH2O (p\u2009<\u20090.001).ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO2, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood.Outcomes of patients with or without early high dose steroidsTable 3 records the outcomes of patients. There were no significant differences in hospital mortality between patients with early high dose steroids and patients without early high dose steroids (64.04% versus 53.14%, p\u2009=\u20090.091). Patients with early high dose steroids had a higher number of ventilator free days (7.65\u2009\u00b1\u20094.32 versus 6.48\u2009\u00b1\u20094.76, p\u2009=\u20090.046) and higher incidence of new onset bacteremia (17.98% versus 4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and new onset viremia (13.48% versus 3.43%, p\u2009=\u20090.002) than patients in the other group. Results of the blood culture and PCR tests are reported in Table S7 of the Supplemental File 1.

Not a single combination of dose and days was an indicating factor of hospital mortality, even though odds ratios were higher for quartiles of 241\u2013480\u2009mg, 481\u20131000\u2009mg, 1001\u20133000\u2009mg.Survival analysisFigure 2 depicts the survival curve of patients with or without early high dose steroids through Cox regression, which was adjusted by risk factors of hospital mortality (granulocyte count, lymphocyte count, GvHD within 3\u2009months, SOFA score) and baseline difference between the two study groups (sex). There was no difference of survival time between the two groups (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.172).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Survival curve of patients with or without early high dose steroids after acute respiratory distress syndrome onset. Adjusted by risk factors of hospital mortality (granulocyte count, lymphocyte count, graft versus host disease within 3\u2009months, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) and baseline difference between the two study groups (sex). No difference in survival time between the two groups (log rank p\u2009=\u20090.172).Propensity score matching and validation of results in the matched cohortA propensity score matched cohort was built to further validate the study results in the original study cohort. The baseline characteristics of the matched cohort were presented in Table 1. As evaluated by standardized mean difference, most variables were well balanced between the two groups. In the matched cohort, 65 patients received early high dose steroids while the other 65 patients did not.Outcomes of patients in the matched cohort are recorded in Table S5 in Supplemental File 1. There was no difference of hospital mortality, hospital days (in survivors), ICU days (in survivors), and duration of mechanical ventilation between the two groups. The higher number of ventilator free days in the early high dose steroids group that was observed in the original study cohort did not exist in the matched cohort (6.02\u2009\u00b1\u20095.51 versus 5.57\u2009\u00b1\u20095.54, p\u2009=\u20090.643). Higher incidences of new onset bacteremia (18.46% versus 3.08%, p\u2009=\u20090.005) and viremia (15.38% versus 4.62%, p\u2009=\u20090.041) were validated in the matched cohort.As presented in Supplemental Table S6, through univariate and multivariate regression, early high dose steroids was not an indicating factor for hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.763\u20131.964, p\u2009=\u20090.117). In Cox regression (Supplemental Figure S1), after adjusting for risk factors of hospital mortality in the matched cohort (granulocyte count, lymphocyte count, SOFA score) there was no difference of survival time between the two study groups (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.253). DiscussionThe use of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS is still controversial. In patients after HSCT, no study had previously focused on this issue. In the present cohort of HSCT patients with ARDS, early high dose steroids was not related to hospital mortality in either the original study cohort or the propensity score matched cohort. In addition, the incidence of new onset bacteremia and viremia increased significantly after early high dose steroids.In our cohort, a substantial proportion (78.79%) of patients were treated with corticosteroids, higher than previous studies17,18 on different populations (57.6\u201371.5%). The propensity for corticosteroid use in these patients might be due to the experience of physicians in using corticosteroids for acute respiratory failure of various causes in HSCT patients, as reported in previous studies.13\u201315 On the other hand, there were only 56 patients without corticosteroid therapy, whose severity of ARDS was much lower than those treated with corticosteroids (Table 2), and the small sample size had limited the process of propensity score matching, which made the direct comparison of treatments with or without corticosteroids ineffective. Therefore, we focused mainly on evaluating unconventional high dose treatments, as previously defined as \u201cearly high dose steroids\u201d.Studies9,10,19 with varying levels of evidence have reported improvement in survival or prolongation of ventilator free days10,11 with corticosteroid in ARDS patients, while some studies11,12 failed to validate this benefit. In the 2017 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine guideline,20,21 corticosteroids were recommended for patients with community acquired pneumonia, septic shock and ARDS. In a recent randomized controlled trial, Villar et al.10 found a survival benefit from early use of dexamethasone in a group of patients in whom approximately 75% of ARDS was caused by sepsis or pneumonia, suggesting that patients with certain comorbidities may benefit more from corticosteroids and their anti-inflammatory effects.22 In contrast, patients in our cohort rarely had a diagnosis of sepsis, and rarely had high markers of inflammation \u2013 high leukocyte counts or C-reactive protein levels (Table 1). Moreover, etiologic analysis of patients who received bronchoalveolar lavage and pathogen PCR testing showed that (in patients with positive PCR) more than half of the cases of ARDS were from viral pneumonia (Supplemental File 1, Table S8), a similar finding was reported in a previous study.23 No studies were focusing on corticosteroids in non-influenza viral pneumonia, but no corticosteroid associated improvement of survival was observed in influenza pneumonia,24,25 all of which may explain why the patients in our study did not benefit from early use of corticosteroids.Even though the general role of corticosteroid therapy is still not clear in patients with ARDS, many studies18,26,27 have reported a possible worsening of prognosis with high doses of corticosteroids. In their 1987 randomized controlled trail, Bernard et al.26 set criteria of high dose as 30\u2009mg/kg of methylprednisolone every 6\u2009h for 24\u2009h; no survival benefit was found in the high dose group as compared with the control group. Tataki et al.27 found that an initial dose of 1000\u2009mg methylprednisolone per day (for 3\u2009days then tapered) was significantly associated with increased 60-day mortality and low ventilator free days. A recent study18 using the Japanese nationwide database suggested a higher mortality rate within 3\u2009months in patients who received more than 500\u2009mg of methylprednisolone for at least 1\u2009day. In our study, patients with unconventional cumulative methylprednisolone doses on different days after ARDS onset had high adjusted odds ratios for hospital mortality (Figure 1), although none was significant \u2013 which may result from the limited sample size on each dosing level.Another phenomenon we observed in the study cohort was an increased incidence of new-onset bacteremia or viremia in patients on early high dose steroids; even after propensity score matching, the difference was still significant. Corticosteroid, as a commonly used agent immune suppression after HSCT, has been identified as a risk factor for various viremias and bacteremias.28\u201330 As reported by a recent study,31 a higher cumulative corticosteroid dose within 30\u2009days after HSCT (>7\u2009mg/kg of prednisolone or its equivalents) was a predictive factor for future bacteremia or cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia. In the present study, corticosteroids were used in patients with a long post-HSCT day length (Table 1, median 150\u2009days), but high cumulative doses were also associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia and viremia, indicating that the influence of corticosteroids may not be relevant to post transplantation days. CMV viremia after HSCT was associated with an increased 1-year mortality of up to 25.5%,32 and the 1-year mortality of patients with bacteremia was approximately 50% in one study.33The result of this study must be comprehended in the context of several limitations. (1) Due to the observational nature of our study, not all potential confounding factors can be adjusted for in the analysis. Although propensity score matching may yield a well-matched study cohort, some undetected confounding factors may still exist. However, this is the first study focusing on the effect of corticosteroid in HSCT patients with ARDS. Our findings may provide clinicians with a better reference in the treatment of this specified patient group, and support the design of studies with a more reasonable methodology. (2) We have used multiple analyses to generate a cutoff value (480\u2009mg) of steroid dose; this will cause a minor bias that exaggerates the test performance.34 However, there are no previous study that focused on steroids for ARDS in patients after HSCT; the cutoff value derived from the general population may not fit well in HSCT patients. It is necessary to test this cutoff value in further studies. (3) Limited by our data resources, not all related parameters can be retrieved in this study. For example, we do not have complete data on blood glucose level to evaluate the incidence of hyperglycemia, which is another adverse effect of corticosteroid. In addition, we have not performed a complete follow-up in all patients, so the long-term survival cannot be evaluated either. (4) Adjunctive treatments for severe ARDS, especially extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, were rarely used in our cohort, which may be related to the poor coagulation function and high risk of catheter-related infections in most HSCT patients, so the impact of these therapies cannot be fully assessed in our study. ConclusionIn this cohort of HSCT patients with ARDS, early high dose corticosteroids had no effect on hospital mortality. In addition, the incidences of new onset bacteremia and viremia were increased after early high dose steroids.
