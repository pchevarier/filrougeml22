IntroductionAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to the recent Berlin definition, is defined as impaired oxygenation caused by acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury [1]. Though inflammatory in nature, ARDS is often triggered by aspiration and traumatic lung injury in the context of patients with severe brain injuries and impaired consciousness. Thus, it is not uncommon in neurocritically ill patients, and it is a predictor of in-hospital mortality [2]. The management of ARDS comprises mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume (VT), a plateau pressure (Pplat) <30\u00a0cm/H2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) adjusted to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) [3]. This lung-protective ventilation (LPV) concept may cause hypercapnia, which is tolerated as long as oxygenation is adequate and pH remains >7.1 [4, 5]. However, hypercapnia impairs cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow per se. In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), the latter can aggravate a preexisting alteration of cerebral autoregulation [6\u20139]. This may result in an increase of intracranial pressure (ICP), with potentially deleterious effects for the injured brain. The treatment of patients with concomitant TBI and ARDS is challenging because the management of ICP requires avoiding permissive hypercapnia. Therefore, alternative interventions are required to treat both pathologies appropriately. Pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) devices can improve decarboxylation, thus enabling LPV while stabilizing carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2) at tolerable levels for patients requiring rigorous ICP management [10\u201312].In this retrospective patient cohort, we endeavored to evaluate the use of a pECLA device (iLA Membrane Ventilator; Novalung, Heilbronn, Germany) in patients with severe brain injury and concomitant ARDS in a neurointensive care unit (NICU). MethodsPatient selectionWe retrospectively analyzed the medical records of ten patients (eight male, two female) treated in our NICU between 2011 and 2014. The data collection and analysis and publication of the results were approved by the local ethics committee (ethics committee of Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf, Chairman Prof. Kr\u00f6ncke, study 4516). No consent from the patients for inclusion of their data in this analysis was necessary, so it was not obtained. Individual details potentially jeopardizing patients\u2019 anonymity are omitted.The decision regarding pECLA treatment for patients with TBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale score >3) was based on the clinical constellation of mild to moderate ARDS refractory to conservative measures according to the Berlin definition with insufficient oxygenation despite LPV and poor or unapparent decarboxylation (pCO2\u2009>\u200945\u00a0mmHg) with concomitant elevated ICP >20\u00a0mmHg measured continuously with an external ventricular catheter (EVD) [1, 13, 14]. Conservative interventions used to control elevated ICP included deep sedation without myorelaxation, prone positioning with 30-degree elevated head rest, and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the EVD.Ventilator therapy focused on achieving a low VT of 6\u00a0ml/kg of predicted body weight and avoiding excessive ventilation pressure >30\u00a0cm/H2O. We aimed at normalizing pCO2 levels between 35\u00a0mmHg and 45\u00a0mmHg. Clinical interventions comprised an increase in respiratory rate to enable adequate ventilation as long as individual expiratory time remained sufficient. When this yielded no satisfactory effect on pCO2, we increased the driving pressure (\u0394P) by increasing the Pplat.Application of extracorporeal carbon dioxide eliminationThe use of extracorporeal lung assist is an established supportive therapeutic strategy in ARDS [15]. We used the iLA Membrane Ventilator [11]. Under ultrasonographic control, a 15-French, 90-mm arterial cannula was inserted into a femoral artery and a second cannula (17 French, 140\u00a0mm) was placed in the opposite femoral vein using the Seldinger technique. Driving force for the perfusion of the membrane system is the patients\u2019 arteriovenous pressure difference. Thus, systemic blood pressure must be sufficient to enable blood to flow through the pECLA system at 1.3\u20131.7\u00a0L/min. Through an oxygen supply line connected to the inflow site of the membrane oxygenator, a continuous oxygen flow of 6\u201310\u00a0L/min is established to achieve carbon dioxide extraction from the blood.Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) >50\u00a0s is recommended to prevent blood clotting in the system; however, all surfaces in contact with circulating blood are heparin-coated to reduce the risk of coagulation. All patients received continuous intravenous heparin infusions with a target PTT ranging from 50 to 60\u00a0s. The effect of anticoagulation was controlled every 12\u00a0h, and the heparin infusion was adjusted accordingly.pECLA device was discontinued when decarboxylation improved and ICP was stable enough to allow the reduction of sedation and spontaneous breathing. Subsequently, the continuous oxygen flow of the membrane oxygenator was diminished to reduce carbon dioxide extraction, and the pECLA device was removed when pCO2 remained stable.Statistical analysisVentilation parameters [\u0394P, Pplat, mean ventilation pressure (Pmean), PEEP, VT, pCO2, pH] from 3\u00a0days preceding pECLA device implant until 3\u00a0days afterward were compared. All ventilation-related variables, such as VT in milliliters, Pplat in cm/H2O, Pmean in cm/H2O, PEEP in cm/H2O, blood pH level, and \u0394P in cm/H2O (defined as Pplat minus PEEP) were recorded half-hourly [16]. Additionally, the ratio of oxygen pressure (pO2) to FiO2 (pO2/FiO2) was calculated every 4\u20136\u00a0h based on arterial blood gas analysis and the ventilator setting. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded continuously for each patient. To calculate mean values, a single reading every 30\u00a0min was taken. Last, the fluid balance of each patient was recorded daily for a 24-h period.To quantify the effects of ICP management, the volume of daily CSF drainage was compared before and after the pECLA device was implanted. The amount of drained CSF necessary to maintain the set ICP threshold of 20\u00a0mmHg was recorded every 24\u00a0h.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 15.1.1 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). To identify differences between relevant parameters before and after the pECLA device was implanted, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for related samples was applied. Significance was accepted at a level of p\u2009<\u20090.05. Depending on the variable, means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) are given. ResultsThe mean patient age was 40.2\u2009\u00b1\u200916.5\u00a0years, and all patients developed ARDS between 2 and 7\u00a0days after admission (median 4.5\u00a0days; IQR 3.3\u20135.8\u00a0days). The pECLA device was implanted a median of 1.5 (IQR 1\u20132) days after ARDS was diagnosed and was removed after a median of 8\u00a0days (IQR 7\u20139 days). The relevant patient characteristics and data are shown in Table\u00a01.Table 1Patient characteristicsPatientAge (yr)ARDS diagnosis (days after admission)pECLA device implant after ARDS diagnosis (days)pECLA device treatment (days)13972122a\n616273404154a\n352275135112653314 (6)b\n7535288506189534281050319Open in a separate window\naPatient died within 30\u00a0days after admission\nbPatient was treated after day 4 with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of acute decreasing oxygenationImplant of the pECLA device facilitated a significant decrease of pCO2 from 46.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9\u00a0mmHg to 39.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u00a0mmHg (p\u2009=\u20090.005), and pH rose from 7.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 to 7.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 (p\u2009=\u20090.021) (Fig.\u00a01a, b).

MAP was kept stable over the treatment period (Fig.\u00a01d), and fluid was kept at a positive balance of 1500\u20132000\u00a0ml daily to stabilize patients\u2019 hemodynamics.

After implant of the pECLA device (arrow), Pplat was significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas PEEP was increased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Pmean remained unchangedIn our cohort, one patient developed right heart failure 4\u00a0days after implant of the pECLA device. The pECLA device was immediately discontinued, and the patient was treated with a venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system. She recovered without sequelae and was discharged from the intensive care unit after 20\u00a0days. DiscussionIn this report of a patient cohort with ARDS and TBI treated with implant of a pECLA device, we describe several important findings. First, pECLA is a safe and effective tool to enable LPV in patients with ARDS in the presence of severe brain injury. Second, in the critical situation of elevated ICP and concomitant demand for adjusted ventilation, the use of pECLA enables better ICP control under optimized ventilator settings. Third, the better control of ICP, as reflected in the reduced necessity to drain CSF, results from optimized pCO2 levels and reduced \u0394P and occurs regardless of Pmean.Though most patients with TBI die as a result of the underlying pathology or secondary complications rather than because of respiratory failure per se, ARDS contributes significantly to poor outcome and increased risk of death in these patients [2, 17]. The fundamental treatment approach in ARDS is to achieve adequate oxygenation and decarboxylation by optimizing mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation can induce lung injury and thus exacerbate the pathology itself, and it can also contribute to dysfunction of other organs [18, 19]. In order to reduce alveolar overdistension, which is the most frequent ventilator-induced lung injury, the use of low VT ventilation (i.e., LPV) is the preferred approach [3, 20]. LPV can cause hypercapnia, which is usually well-tolerated and thus referred to as permissive hypercapnia [21]. In addition to avoiding high peak inspiratory pressures, the concept of LPV is to use high PEEP to improve oxygenation and reduce or prevent atelectasis [22, 23].In neurosurgical patients with TBI, permissive hypercapnia cannot be tolerated easily. Hypercapnia increases cerebral blood flow by cerebral vasodilation. More specifically, with increasing pCO2, the autoregulatory pressure range is decreased and, depending on the pCO2 level, cerebral autoregulation is significantly impaired [3, 8, 9]. In severe hypercapnia with pCO2\u2009>\u200970\u00a0mmHg, the pressure\u2013flow relationship can approximate a linear relationship, as demonstrated in animal experiments [24]. Thus, hypercapnia in these vulnerable patients can aggravate blood flow dysregulation and cause detrimental increases in ICP. Extracorporal carbon dioxide removal using pECLA is effective in patients in a tenuous situation of severe lung and brain injury [10, 25]. pCO2 is effectively reduced to normal levels and can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen sweep flow to avoid unwanted hypocapnia. Normalization of pCO2 is accompanied by increased pH and avoidance of respiratory acidosis. This yields a significant reduction in drained CSF as a surrogate for improved ICP control. Interestingly, mean airway pressure does not contribute to this effect. After pECLA device implant, inspiratory pressure is decreased, but PEEP is increased, to improve oxygenation. As a consequence, mean airway pressure does not change significantly. Therefore, improved ICP control can be attributed predominantly to the normalization of pCO2. In ARDS, the combination of low VT and higher PEEP is superior to low VT with lower PEEP [26]. Though application of PEEP in patients with brain injury remains controversial, a judicious adaption of PEEP to the demand in patients with lung injury is feasible [27]. High peak pressures do have a deleterious effect on cerebral hemodynamics, however, and can be avoided in this setting [7].An important limitation of our analysis is its retrospective nature; thus, residual confounding parameters might have been missed. In addition, the number of patients is too small to allow generalizability of the results or to provide any meaningful outcome data. However, the main aim of this study was to provide data on the safety and efficacy of this intervention.In this context, it is important to recognize that, for pECLA treatment, systemic anticoagulation to avoid clotting of the filter membrane is recommended. In patients with brain injury, this may increase the risk of decompensating intracerebral hematomas. However, in our series, no complications (cerebral or extracerebral) attributable to anticoagulation were seen. Besides, owing to heparin-coating of the extracorporeal circuit, low-dose systemic anticoagulation is sufficient to avoid clotting of the extracorporeal circuit, thereby minimizing the risk of bleeding complications. In patients with extraordinarily high risk of bleeding, even a complete abdication of anticoagulation in venovenous ECMO was shown to be safe and feasible [28]. Also, elevated ICP and CSF production are multifactorial processes, and in the small, retrospective setting of the present study, confounding hemodynamic or metabolic effects contributing to the reduction in CSF drainage with the use of pECLA may have been missed.Owing to the relevant shunt volume of approximately 1500\u00a0ml of blood per minute over the extracorporeal circuit, a relevant increase in right heart preload occurs. This may have contributed to the right heart failure in one of our patients. This patient had no known preexisting cardiac disease; however, the patient was obese (body mass index 33\u00a0kg/m2), which might have contributed to reduced right ventricular capacity. ConclusionsFor selected patients with concomitant severe brain and lung injury, the application of pECLA is effective to avoid hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, thus enabling application of LPV guidelines as well as effective ICP control. Large prospective trials are necessary to further elucidate the application of pECLA devices and the influence of different ventilation pressures on ICP and outcome in NICU patients. Key messagespECLA is a safe and effective tool to enable LPV in patients with ARDS and TBI.pECLA effectively reduces pCO2 and normalizes pH in patients vulnerable to hypercapnia.pECLA enables better ICP control under optimized ventilator settings than without extracorporeal decarboxylation.
