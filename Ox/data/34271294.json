The Berlin definition for ARDS can be used for risk classification based on the partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio [4]. In patients with ARDS due to a cause other than COVID\u201319, ARDS severity has been shown to change over the first days of ventilation, associated with alterations in outcomes [[5], [6], [7]]. Whether this also applies to COVID\u201319 patients with ARDS can be expected, but is uncertain.COVID\u201319 patients with ARDS could embody a heterogeneous group with diverse evolutions, which could be due to different ARDS phenotypes, but also disparate responses to typical aspects of care, including invasive ventilation strategies [8]. We hypothesized that ARDS severity in COVID\u201319 patients may change over the first 2 calendar days of invasive ventilation, and that these changes could be associated with different outcomes.To test these hypotheses, we performed a secondary analysis of the \u2018PRactice of VENTilation in COVID\u201319\u2019 (PRoVENT\u2013COVID) study, to determine and compare outcomes in patients classified as having mild, moderate and severe ARDS at calendar day 1 of invasive ventilation, and after reclassification at calendar day 2 and at calendar day 4. We also wished to identify which ventilatory parameters have an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at day 2 and 4. 2.\u2003Methods2.1. Design, settings and participantsThe PRoVENT\u2013COVID study is an investigator\u2013initiated, multicenter, observational cohort study undertaken at 22 intensive care units (ICU) in the first 3 months of the pandemic in the Netherlands [9]. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all centers, need for individual patient informed consent was waived. Study details can be found in the Supplementary Data 1 [10]. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (study identifier {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04346342\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04346342\"}}NCT04346342). A finalized statistical analysis plan for the current analysis was published online [11].Consecutive patients \u226518 years of age were eligible for participation if admitted to one of the participating ICUs and had received invasive ventilation for COVID\u201319. A COVID\u201319 diagnosis had to be definite by a positive reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and the diagnosis and severity of ARDS was confirmed by using the Berlin definition [4]. The PRoVENT\u2013COVID study had no exclusion criteria. For the current analysis we excluded patients if transferred after the first 2 days of ventilation from a non\u2013participating center, or within the first 2 days of ventilation to a non\u2013participating center, as it was impossible to collect complete sets of ventilation variables and parameters in the non\u2013participating centers. We also excluded patients with incomplete datasets (missing data in PaO2/FiO2 ratio), patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the first 2 calendar days of ventilation, and patients that died in the first 2 calendar days of ventilation.2.2. Data collection and analysesDemographics and data regarding premorbid diseases and home medication were collected at baseline. In the first hour of invasive ventilation and every 8 h thereafter, at fixed time points, during the first 4 calendar days, ventilator settings, ventilation variables and parameters were collected.For severity classification at calendar day 1, and for reclassification at calendar day 2, we used the cutoffs used in the Berlin definition [4]. Accordingly, we classified ARDS as (1) \u2018mild\u2019 (300 > PaO2/FiO2 \u2265 200 mmHg); (2) \u2018moderate\u2019 (200 > PaO2/FiO2 \u2265 100 mmHg); or (3) \u2018severe\u2019 (PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg) in each patient at the first two consecutive days. Patients were always classified using the worst PaO2/FiO2 of the applicable calendar day.The dynamic driving pressure (\u0394P) and mechanical power of ventilation (MP) were calculated using standard formulas [12,13], i.e., \u0394P (in cm H2O) = peak pressure (Ppeak) \u2013 positive end\u2013expiratory pressure (PEEP); and MP (in J/min) = 0.098 * tidal volume (VT) * respiratory rate (RR) * (Ppeak \u2013 0.5 * \u0394P).The primary outcome was 28\u2013day mortality. Secondary outcomes were death in ICU, in hospital and at day 90; the number of ventilator\u2013free days and alive at day 28 (VFD\u201328), and duration of ventilation in survivors. VFD\u201328 was defined as the number of days that a patient was alive and free from invasive ventilation, calculated from the moment of start of invasive ventilation, if the period of unassisted breathing lasted longer than 24 consecutive hours and considering the last date of successful extubation\u2013\u2013patients who died within 28 days were classified as having \u20180\u2019 VFD\u201328 s, even if extubated in the period.2.3. Statistical analysisThe sample size was based on the number of available patients. Continuous variables are presented as medians (quartile 25% \u2013 quartile 75%) and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. The groups were compared using Kruskal\u2013Wallis test for continuous variables, and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables. The primary outcome was shown in Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and groups were compared through a Log\u2013Rank test. Cumulative incidence plots were used to report time until extubation or ICU discharge, with death before the event treated as competing risk, and with the comparison of the groups done with a Gray test.Factors associated with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2 were assessed in a multivariable model considering the following variables based on clinical relevance: 1) ventilator variables and parameters at calendar day 1, aggregated as the median from a maximum of four assessment, and including tidal volume adjusted by predicted body weight (PBW), RR, PEEP, Ppeak, dynamic \u0394P, MP, and respiratory system compliance (CRS); 2) laboratory tests and vital signs at calendar day 1, aggregated as the median from a maximum of four assessments, and including arterial pH, plasma lactate, plasma creatinine, heart rate and mean arterial pressure; 3) organ support at calendar day 1, including use of vasopressor and cumulative fluid balance; 4) rescue therapies at calendar day 1, including prone positioning and use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA); and 5) demographic characteristics, including age, gender, body mass index, and a history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or use of angiotensin II receptor blockers. FiO2 was excluded due to association with PaO2/FiO2, used to define the outcome. Variables with a p < 0.10 in the univariable model were selected and included in the multivariable model.In all models, the participating center was included as random effect to account for clustering. When predictors considered in the models were missing in less than 5% of the patients, these values were imputed by the median. In addition, multicollinearity in the final models was assessed using variance\u2013inflation factors. The linearity assumption of continuous variables was assessed through the Box\u2013Tidwell transformation considering the full model, testing the log\u2013odds and the predictor variable. Variables not satisfying this criterion were entered as restricted cubic splines in the final model. All continuous variables were entered after standardization to improve convergence of the model, and all effect estimates represent the increase in one standard deviation of the variable.To account for the prolonged ventilation in COVID\u201319 patients, one pre\u2013planned sensitivity analysis considered reclassification of ARDS severity as described above but at calendar day 4 instead of calendar day 2.All models were repeated after multiple imputation of missing data. All analyses were conducted in R v.4.0.2 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and significance level was set at 0.05. 3.\u2003ResultsOf 1111 patients included in the PRoVENT\u2013COVID study, 895 were included in the current analysis (eFigure 1 in Supplementary Data 2). Main reasons for exclusion were that patients did not have ARDS, did not receive invasive ventilation, or had an alternative diagnosis. Having had received ventilation for longer than 2 calendar days in a non\u2013participating center before arrival in a participating center was another important reason for exclusion.3.1. Early course of ARDS severityAt calendar day 1, 76 (8.5%) patients had ARDS classified as mild, and 538 (60.1%) and 281 (31.4%) as moderate or severe. Body mass index and the incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased with ARDS severity (Table 1\n). \u0394P and Ppeak increased, and CRS decreased with ARDS severity. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and lactate increased with ARDS severity. Prone positioning, recruitment maneuvers and NMBA were most often used in patients with ARDS classified as severe at calendar day 1.Table 1Baseline characteristics of the included patients according

Outcomes28\u2013day mortality was 25.3% in patients with ARDS classified at calendar day 1 as mild, and 31.3% and 32.0% in patients with ARDS classified at that day as moderate and severe (Fig. 2\nand eTable 1 in Supplementary Data 2). 28\u2013day mortality was 28.6% and 29.2% in patients with ARDS classified at calendar day 2 as mild and moderate, and increased to 44.3% in patients with ARDS classified as severe (eTable 2 in Supplementary Data 2). Likewise, mortality in ICU, hospital, and at day 90 changed after reclassification (eTable 1, eTable 2 and eFigure 2 in Supplementary Data 2), but the number of VFD\u201328 and duration of ventilation in survivors was not affected by reclassification at calendar day 2.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for 28\u2013day mortality for ARDS severity at calendar day 1 and 2.The left diagram (a) shows the probability of 28\u2013day mortality by ARDS severity class at calendar day 1.

Kaplan\u2013Meier curves comparing the probability of survival in mild (blue), moderate (orange), and severe ARDS (red) groups. Log-rank tests show an overall difference between groups and a lower probability of 28\u2013day mortality survival in the severe ARDS group as compared to the mild and moderate ARDS group at calendar day 2. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)3.3. Factors associated with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2In univariable analysis, ARDS severity at calendar day 1, heart rate, RR, \u0394P and use of prone positioning were associated with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2 (Table 3\n). In multivariable analysis, no single ventilator setting had an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2. Only presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 1 was independently associated with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2.Table 3Factors associated with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2.Univariable AnalysisMultivariable AnalysisOdds Ratio (95% CI)p valueOdds Ratio (95% CI)p valueDemographic characteristics\u00a0Age1.01 (0.82 to 1.24)0.920\u2013\u2013\u00a0Male gender0.83 (0.54 to 1.28)0.395\u2013\u2013\u00a0Body mass index1.11 (0.93 to 1.32)0.232\u2013\u2013Co-existing disorders\u00a0Hypertension1.17 (0.77 to 1.77)0.458\u2013\u2013\u00a0Heart failure0.43 (0.13 to 1.46)0.176\u2013\u2013\u00a0Diabetes0.97 (0.60 to 1.56)0.901\u2013\u2013\u00a0Chronic kidney disease0.54 (0.18 to 1.60)0.266\u2013\u2013\u00a0Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease1.86 (0.99 to 3.48)0.0541.61 (0.84 to 3.08)0.154\u00a0Active hematological neoplasia1.32 (0.27 to 6.49)0.734\u2013\u2013\u00a0Active solid neoplasia0.61 (0.14 to 2.66)0.509\u2013\u2013Category of ARDS at day 01\u00a0Mild1 (Reference)1 (Reference)\u00a0Moderate6.93 (0.95 to 50.30)0.0556.45 (0.88 to 47.06)0.066\u00a0Severe23.83 (3.28 to 173.07)0.00118.19 (2.48 to 133.55)0.004Previous medication\u00a0Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor1.10 (0.66 to 1.82)0.722\u2013\u2013\u00a0Angiotensin II receptor blocker0.98 (0.51 to 1.86)0.943\u2013\u2013Vital signs at day 01\u00a0Heart rate1.34 (1.10 to 1.62)0.0031.22 (0.99 to 1.52)0.063\u00a0Mean arterial pressure1.17 (0.96 to 1.42)0.118\u2013\u2013Laboratory tests at day 01\u00a0Creatinine0.92 (0.69 to 1.23)0.585\u2013\u2013\u00a0pH0.87 (0.72 to 1.05)0.157\u2013\u2013Ventilation support at day 01\u00a0Tidal volume per PBW1.06 (0.87 to 1.29)0.543\u2013\u2013\u00a0PEEP0.93 (0.75 to 1.15)0.501\u2013\u2013\u00a0Peak pressure1.11 (0.92 to 1.35)0.287\u2013\u2013\u00a0Total respiratory rate1.29 (1.07 to 1.57)0.0091.17 (0.94 to 1.45)0.152\u00a0Driving pressure1.24 (1.03 to 1.50)0.0251.03 (0.83 to 1.28)0.799\u00a0Mechanical power1.14 (0.94 to 1.38)0.186\u2013\u2013\u00a0Compliance0.86 (0.68 to 1.07)0.174\u2013\u2013Organ support at day 01\u00a0Fluid balance1.16 (0.95 to 1.41)0.142\u2013\u2013\u00a0Use of vasopressor0.73 (0.46 to 1.16)0.181\u2013\u2013Rescue therapy at day 01\u00a0Prone positioning1.99 (1.29 to 3.06)0.0021.30 (0.82 to 2.05)0.262\u00a0Use of NMBA1.31 (0.83 to 2.07)0.247\u2013\u2013Open in a separate windowContinuous variables were included after standardization and the hazard ratio represents the increase in one standard deviation of the variable.c-statistic for the multivariable model is 0.790 (0.746 to 0.835).

Reclassification at calendar day 4The sensitivity analysis for reclassification of ARDS severity did not change the findings (eTable 3, eTable 4, eFigure 3 and eFigure 4 in Supplementary Data 2), though chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as co\u2013existing disorder, fluid balance and CRS at calendar day 1 had an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 4 (eTable 5 in Supplementary Data 2). 4.\u2003DiscussionThe finding of this analysis of a large cohort of COVID\u201319 patients receiving invasive ventilation for ARDS can be summarized as follows: (1) ARDS severity changes over the first 2 calendar days of ventilation; and (2) reclassification of severity at calendar day 2 results in groups with more contrast in outcome than classification of severity at calendar day 1. Indeed, (3) patients with severe ARDS at calendar day 2, which could have been caused by persistence or worsening of the oxygenation problems, have much higher mortality rates than patients with mild or moderate ARDS. (4) There was no single ventilator setting that had an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2.ARDS severity in our study was similar to that in two other studies originating from France [14] and the United Kingdom [15]. In one study conducted in France, Belgium and Switzerland, named the COVID\u2013ICU study, changes in ARDS severity from day 1 through day 7 and their association with mortality were reported, but that analysis was restricted to patients with worsening severity [14]. That study found 12% of patients with ARDS classified as mild, and 16% of patients with ARDS classified as moderate to progress to severe ARDS, which is in line with the finding of our study. Our results are also in line with those from one study in Spain that showed an increase in the proportion of patients with moderate ARDS within the first 2 days of ventilation [16].The findings of our study in patients with COVID\u201319 ARDS iterate the prognostic value of reclassification of ARDS severity as found in patients with ARDS due to a cause other than COVID\u201319 [[5], [6], [7]]. Increased contrast in 90\u2013day mortality between ARDS severity groups was seen with reclassification of ARDS severity in the LUNG SAFE study [6]. In that study, severe ARDS at the second day of ventilation was associated with a 90\u2013day mortality of 57%, similar to the current findings. Comparable findings came from another analysis of LUNG SAFE, that focused on improving, persisting and worsening severity in patients with ARDS classified as mild at the first day of ventilation [5], and a study that assessed the prognostic value of PaO2/FiO2 the day after ARDS was diagnosed [7]. In contrast to our study, the latter study included only patients presenting with moderate and severe ARDS, and PaO2/FiO2 were collected at standard ventilator settings.In our study, we did not observe any difference in outcomes in ARDS classes at baseline, whereas one study did show a difference in 90\u2013day mortality in ARDS classes at baseline [14]. It could be that our cohort was too small to show a difference. One noticeable finding in our study was that the proportion of patients that no longer had ARDS at calendar day 2 was low, less than 1%, and quite different from one study in patients with ARDS due to another cause than COVID\u201319 that showed almost 25% to have resolved ARDS after 24 h [6]. This might be explained by a difference in the pathophysiology, as ARDS caused by COVID\u201319 shows more pulmonary thrombosis and angiogenesis than ARDS caused by an equally severe influenza virus infection [17,18].In our study, there were no ventilatory variables that had an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2. This is, at least in part in contrast with findings of a secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study, that showed tidal volume size to have an association with persistence of ARDS after 24 h [6]. It should be noticed, though, that in our cohort tidal volumes were low, median 6.4 (5.9\u20137.0) ml/kg PBW [9] and even lower than that reported in the LUNG SAFE study, mean 7.6 \u00b1 1.9 ml/kg PBW [6]. Probably, tidal volume size was already sufficiently low to protect against additional lung injury caused by the ventilator. Furthermore, the use of prone positioning has shown to improve patient outcomes when used in the early phase of ARDS [19]. Our study did not show an association between the use of prone positioning and presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2. As prone positioning decreases ventilator-induced lung injury by balancing the pulmonary stress and strain of invasive ventilation, the effect of prone positioning on ARDS severity could be delayed and therefore unnoticed in our study. Besides, our study did not find an association between the use of NMBA and presence of severe ARDS at calendar day 2. The value of the use of NMBA is not undisputed, as two studies have shown varying results of the use NMBA on mortality in ARDS patients [20,21].For daily practice, we would advise healthcare providers to reclassify ARDS severity after calendar day 1 in order to raise awareness for a patient's mortality risk. This could help consider alternative approaches for these high\u2013risk patients, such as ECMO, which could improve outcomes. Besides, our study has implications for clinical trial design and patient enrolment. The use of baseline classification for enrolment may cause bias, as a treatment might benefit a more defined subgroup of patients with according risk of mortality. Furthermore, improving stratification of enrolled patients can reduce the necessary sample size, since it makes treatment effects easier to detect, which is an acknowledged problem in ventilator studies conducted in the critically ill. If a specific intervention allows, we recommend randomizing patients with ARDS after the first calendar day.Our study has several strengths. First, it is one of the largest multicenter studies that collected granular data regarding ventilator settings, and ventilation variables and parameters. We used strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, to prevent bias that could have been caused by patients who received invasive ventilation in non\u2013participating centers; we also strictly followed the statistical analysis plan, updated and finalized before assessing the database. Follow\u2013up was up to day 90, allowing us to report several important endpoints in COVID\u201319 ARDS patients. The cohort included patients admitted in academic and non\u2013academic centers, increasing the generalizability of the findings. Collection of data took place within a relative short timeframe, preventing against changes in care over time.Our study also has limitations. Our patient cohort may not be representative of actual clinical practice in ICUs worldwide, due to its national character. Furthermore, patient management was based on the insights at the time of the early months of the pandemic\u2013\u2013there was for instance no standard use of dexamethasone and clinician's awareness for thromboembolic complications was less refined, which could influence the course of ARDS, and patients' outcomes. Also, D\u2013dimer levels were not measured routinely and could thus not be used in the models, while it has been recently reported as strongly associated with mortality [22]. Given the size of our database, small differences between groups may achieve statistical significance but be of uncertain clinical significance. Finally, by design, observational studies cannot adjust for unmeasured confounders and rely on the data collected by the investigators. 5.\u2003ConclusionIn this national multicenter observational study, ARDS severity changes substantially over the first calendar days of ventilation and reclassification of ARDS severity at calendar day 2 results in more contrast in mortality rates between ARDS severity classes. We found no single ventilation parameter that had an independent association with presence of severe ARDS at day 2. Reclassification at successive days of invasive ventilation could help identify target patients that may benefit from alternative approaches.
