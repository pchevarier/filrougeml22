{"title": "The phylogenetically invariant ACAGAGA and AGC sequences of U6 small nuclear RNA are more tolerant of mutation in human cells than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "pubDate": "1993", "PMCID": "PMC360241", "DOI": "10.1128/mcb.13.9.5377-5382.1993", "PMID": "8355689", "abstract": "U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is the most highly conserved of the five spliceosomal snRNAs that participate in nuclear mRNA splicing. The proposal that U6 snRNA plays a key catalytic role in splicing [D. Brow and C. Guthrie, Nature (London) 337:14-15, 1989] is supported by the phylogenetic conservation of U6, the sensitivity of U6 to mutation, cross-linking of U6 to the vicinity of the 5' splice site, and genetic evidence for extensive base pairing between U2 and U6 snRNAs. We chose to mutate the phylogenetically invariant 41-ACAGAGA-47 and 53-AGC-55 sequences of human U6 because certain point mutations within the homologous regions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae U6 selectively block the first or second step of mRNA splicing. We found that both sequences are more tolerant to mutation in human cells (assayed by transient expression in vivo) than in S. cerevisiae (assayed by effects on growth or in vitro splicing). These differences may reflect different rate-limiting steps in the particular assays used or differential reliance on redundant RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. The ability of mutations in U6 nucleotides A-45 and A-53 to selectively block step 2 of splicing in S. cerevisiae had previously been construed as evidence that these residues might participate directly in the second chemical step of splicing; an indirect, structural role seems more likely because the equivalent mutations have no obvious phenotype in the human transient expression assay.", "author": [{"author": "B Datta", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510."], "href": "/?term=Datta+B&cauthor_id=8355689"}, {"author": "A M Weiner", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Weiner+AM&cauthor_id=8355689"}], "refPMID": ["1740113", "6201826", "6204860", "2410138", "2411416", "2411548", "2932555", "2417724", "3757028", "3537805", "2880558", "2950324", "3552247", "2953438", "2440583", "2959470", "2961458", "2962902", "2963332", "2963698", "2837425", "1531875", "1839712", "1617727", "1620594", "1641331", "1386941", "1508718", "1411506", "1423631", "1448079", "8425215", "8500172", "1340469", "3041282", "2973660", "2909888", "3065622", "2977088", "2704744", "2552294", "2529976", "2812024", "2612904", "2558966", "2628164", "2185425", "2401404", "2145630", "2238045", "2147394", "2176635", "2149118", "2010089", "2013092", "2031287", "2044950", "1711123", "1853200", "1831878", "1831879", "1655571", "1833635", "1739979", "1740112"], "citedInPMID": ["8355689", "33535503", "20826700", "19029305", "18854356", "17940139", "15987817", "15146076", "12212854", "11214178", "10199569", "9628919", "9570323", "9570316", "9570315", "9049307", "8622683", "8302864", "8007960"], "body": ""}
