Termination remains the least understood stage of transcription. Here we discuss the role of RNAP II occupancy downstream of the 3\u2032ends of genes and its links with termination and mRNA 3\u2032 processing.Keywords:  End of Annotated Gene, R-loops, RNA Polymerase II pause, core histone genes, genome-wide mapping, polyadenylation, transcription termination IntroductionRNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated action of numerous transcription factors. It can be divided into initiation, promoter escape, elongation and termination phases.Several studies analyzed RNAP II binding at promoters genome-wide (GW) by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). These reports revealed that thousands of transcribed genes in many different metazoans display accumulation of RNAP II just downstream of their promoters.1-8 Many of these GW experiments demonstrated that these high and narrow RNAP II occupancy peaks, probably reflecting a static RNAP II binding at promoters, were centered on regions 50 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the genes. It is now accepted that these high RNAP II occupancy signals reflect RNAP II pausing at promoter-proximal sites of virtually all transcribed genes in various organisms and, thus, may be considered a general feature of RNAP II behavior in preinitiation complexes formed at the 5\u2032 end of transcribed genes. Moreover, it seems that maintaining a static RNAP II in the scaffold of general transcription factors associated with the promoter is important to establish an open chromatin conformation that facilitates RNA synthesis.8In most of the GW analyses, a higher RNAP II occupancy profile has also been observed at the 3\u2032end of the genes; however, none of the studies analyzed and characterized RNAP II binding downstream of the 3\u2032end of annotated genes (EAGs) in detail. Here, we will discuss advances in our understanding of RNAP II occupancy downstream of EAGs and its possible link with 3\u2032 processing mechanisms and with transcription termination. RNAP II occupancy increases downstream of transcribed genes genome-wideTo better understand RNAP II behavior at the 3\u2032ends of transcription units and in transcription termination, in our recent study we analyzed different GW data sets representing RNAP II binding downstream of EAGs in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells and differentiated mammalian cells.9 Our analyses in both cell types demonstrated that, in general, RNAP II detectability by ChIP-seq increases downstream of the EAGs. According to the definition, the 3\u2032end of a gene (EAG) terminates at the 3\u2032end of its 3\u2032untranslated region. Interestingly, our analyses showed that downstream of genes producing polyadenylated transcripts [poly(A)+ genes], RNAP II occupancy is often quite extensive and can be detected up to 4\u20136 kb downstream from the EAGs (Fig.\u00a01A and \u200band1C1C).9 A possibility is that RNAP II slows down once it reaches the 3\u2032end of a poly(A)+ gene and therefore may be more likely to cross-link to its given genomic position during the ChIP procedure (Fig.\u00a02A). Consequently, several RNAP II molecules may accumulate in these regions (Fig.\u00a02A). Nevertheless, it is not clear what the broad RNAP II enrichment represents in the regions between the EAG and the termination site of a transcribed poly(A)+ gene. Is it the sum of arrested RNAP II molecules at various locations in different cells of the population used for the ChIP or the RNAP II population that is transcribing with a reduced speed, compared with RNAP IIs in the gene body, in every cell? However, neither scenario accounts exactly for the observed distribution of RNAP II downstream of the EAGs often showing such broad occupancy peaks. Further experiments will be necessary to measure RNAP II transcription speed in these 4\u20136 kb regions downstream of EAGs to better understand RNAP II behavior in the termination phase. Thus, at present it is probably not accurate to call the increased RNAP II occupancy 3\u2032 of the genes \u201cRNAP II pausing.\u201dOpen in a separate windowFigure\u00a01.

Arrows show the direction of the transcription of each transcription unit. Gene names are represented in capital letters. Gene structures are shown. Thick boxes represent exons, medium thick boxes untranslated regions, thin lines introns. (C) and (D) Extrapolation of RNAP II occupancy at the TSS, gene body and downstream of EAG under normal and polyadenylation inhibition conditions based on our ChIP-PCR results.9 (C) RNAP II occupancy profile on average poly(A)+ genes: in the wild type conditions, RNAP II occupancy shows a high narrow peak at transcription start sites (TSSs), often low occupancy throughout the gene body, and a broad enrichment 3\u2032 of the end of annotated genes (EAGs), which can extend up to 4\u20136 kb from the EAG (black line). According to the used definition 3\u2032end of a gene (EAG) finishes at the 3\u2032end of its 3\u2032untranslated region. Upon inhibition of polyadenylation by cordycepin there is an increase in the RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs and a parallel decrease at the TSSs (red line). (D) RNAP II occupancy profile on core histone genes: high RNAP II occupancy can be seen at the TSS and throughout the gene body and RNAP II occupancy declines rapidly 3\u2032 from the EAG. In wild type and cordycepin treated conditions there is no change in the RNAP II occupancy. Wild type and cordycepin treated conditions are represented in black and red lines, respectively.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02.

Transcription start sites (TSSs, are represented by an arrow head), average gene bodies, and 3\u2032 of the end of annotated genes (EAGs) are shown. Strings with a red balloon represent 5\u2032 capped nascent mRNAs synthesized by the polymerases. mRNAs transcribed from poly(A)+ genes get either polyadenylated (AAA) [shown in (A)] or when transcribed from core histone genes form a 3\u2032 hairpin [shown in (B)]. Transcription termination sites are represented with a stop sign. For core histone genes the TSSs of a second histone gene are also represented depicting that core histone genes are often found in clusters. The main factors involved in cotranscriptional 3\u2032-end formation of mammalian polyadenylated mRNA vs. non-polyadenylated core histone mRNA are reviewed in.17 Short black sticks in the hands of the traffic men represent short non-coding transcripts mapped by Gro-seq either to the TTSs of the genes or to the regions downstream of the EAGs. The dotted arrows represent the hypothetic (question mark) recycling of the terminating RNAP II to the TSSs of the genes (in good agreement with our experiments and with Mapendano et al., 2010).9,32A comparison of the RNAP II ChIP-seq and Gro-seq data demonstrated that RNAP II is transcriptionally engaged downstream of the EAGs.9,10 Interestingly, in these regions all the transcripts identified by Gro-seq10 map in the sense orientation 3\u2032 from the EAGs, suggesting that they are produced by RNAP II molecules that have transcribed the pre-mRNAs previously. Moreover, no significant antisense transcription 3\u2032 from the EAGs was detected.These observations further suggest that in most cases after synthesis and cleavage of the pre-mRNA the transcriptionally engaged RNAP II remains on the DNA template for a long distance (4\u20136 kb), as if it has difficulties in leaving or being released from the DNA template (Fig.\u00a01A, \u200b,1C1C and \u200band2A).2A). The increased occupancy of RNAP II in these long non-coding regions downstream of the EAG of poly(A)+ genes suggests that RNAP II might be waiting for a signal that would help to close the transcription bubble and result in RNAP II dissociation from the DNA template. In this respect, it is interesting to note that we were able to separate two clusters of RNAP II patterns (broad and very broad) probably representing two differential modes of RNAP II termination and release. Moreover, our analyses did not reveal any correlation between the number of alternative polyA sites present in a given gene and the broadness of RNAP II occupancy (our unpublished data). In conclusion, from our analyses, it seems that the accumulation of RNAP II downstream of the EAGs of transcribed poly(A)+ genes is rather a genome-wide feature of RNAP II transcription, independent of the cell type.9Another recent study using different bioinformatics tools employing a combination of three peak calling methods concluded that accumulation of RNAP II at the 3\u2032 ends of genes is not a global characteristic of RNAP II transcription, but rather occurs on a subset of actively transcribed genes.11 However, using peak calling algorithms (such as MACS, QuEST and SISSR) may not be the most accurate method to detect very broad and diffuse enrichment peaks (4\u20136 kb, Figure\u00a01A and C). Nevertheless, Grosso et al.11 suggest that the formation of 3\u2032 peaks is dependent on the transcription rate of the given gene, with highly expressed genes having 3\u2032 peaks more often, and that dynamic transitions exist in the relative enrichment of RNAP II at the 3\u2032ends of the genes. Note, however, that this study did not analyze the highly expressed core histone genes, producing non-polyadenylated transcripts, separately (see below). RNAP II occupancy downstream from the EAGs of core histone genes is different from those producing polyadenylated transcriptsReplication-dependent core histone genes differ from poly(A)+ genes in terms of gene structure and the 3\u2032 processing mechanism. Core histone genes lack introns and their transcripts are not polyadenylated. Instead the 3\u2032 end formations of core histone gene mRNAs involves stem-loop formation, and includes the U7 snRNP, hairpin-binding protein and specific components of the cleavage/poly(A) complex.12-16 During our GW data analyses, based upon RNAP II occupancy profiles downstream of the EAGs, we identified distinct patterns of RNAP II binding profiles. One of these clusters showed a rapid drop in RNAP II occupancy after the EAGs (Fig.\u00a01B and \u200band1D).1D). Interestingly, gene ontology analyses indicated that this cluster contains almost exclusively core histone genes. As core histone genes are often found in clusters, we tested RNAP II occupancy -/+ 1 kb downstream of histone genes and observed that all core histone genes showed high RNAP II enrichment throughout the gene body and a relatively sharp drop in RNAP II occupancy 3\u2032 of the EAGs (Fig.\u00a01B).9 These rapidly diminishing RNAP II occupancy signals are in contrast to the broad RNAP II peaks seen in the majority of expressed poly(A)+ genes (Fig.\u00a01). Taken together, our results show that RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs of core histone genes is different from those transcription units producing polyadenylated transcripts (Fig.\u00a0One and 2).At EAGs of core histone genes quickly dropping RNAP II occupancy signals may be of significance since core histone genes are often found in clusters, separated by only short distances (i.e., 0.8\u20131 kb) (Fig.\u00a01B and \u200band2B);2B); thus, RNAP II occupancy may have to decline rapidly to prevent RNAP II from running into the neighboring gene in the cluster. In agreement with the fact that core histone mRNAs have a different 3\u2032 processing mechanism than polyadenylated mRNAs, our observations suggest that the two distinct mRNA 3\u2032end-processing machineries differentially influence RNAP II termination on the two types of templates. Thus, it is conceivable that the differential RNAP II occupancy profiles observed on core histone genes vs. poly(A)+ genes is a result of differential interactions between RNAP II and the two 3\u2032 processing machineries. In addition, it is possible that the efficiency of RNA processing of the core histone genes also plays an important role in regulating RNAP II occupancy once it has transcribed the processing site. Inhibition of polyadenylation increases RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs on poly(A)+ genes, but not on core histone genesIt has long been established that intricate connections exist between pre-mRNA 3\u2032 end processing and transcription termination (reviewed in Richard and Manley).17 According to the current views, at least two distinct mechanisms seem to contribute to transcription termination.18-20 The first involves conformational changes in the RNAP II complex caused by dissociation of elongation factors and/or association of termination factors as the polymerase transcribes through the poly(A) site. The second, called the \u201ctorpedo\u201d model, involves rapid exonuclease-mediated degradation of the 5\u2032 uncapped RNA produced by RNAP II after cleavage at the poly(A) site. A hybrid of the two models has also been suggested for efficient transcription termination.21Based on these models, we tested whether inhibition of polyadenylation by cordycepin would affect RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs.9 Cordycepin (3\u2032deoxyadenosine) is an analog of adenosine lacking the 3\u2032-OH, thus preventing further elongation when incorporated into a growing RNA polyA tail, and producing a prematurely-terminated RNA molecule. Interestingly, inhibition of polyadenylation increased RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs of poly(A)+ genes (Fig.\u00a01C). In contrast, on the tested core histone genes, inhibition of polyadenylation had no significant effect on the RNAP II signal at the 3\u2032end of the EAG (Fig.\u00a01D). These experiments show that for poly(A)+ genes there is a link between polyadenylation and the broad RNAP II occupancy downstream of the EAGs. Thus, our observations further substantiate the link between polyadenylation and RNAP II transcription termination and suggest that transcription termination by RNAP II may undergo different types of regulation depending on the 3\u2032end processing mechanisms of the transcripts.These observations establish a new type of communication between the polyadenylation machinery and the terminating RNAP II that remains associated with the DNA template downstream of the EAGs. Following inhibition of polyadenylation, the increased RNAP II occupancy downstream of EAGs on poly(A)+ genes suggests that defective polyadenylation can signal to the terminating RNAP II to slow down or to make it pause more often. Such signaling may be necessary to delay termination on poly(A)+ genes, where polyadenylation would be defective. Under normal conditions, RNAP II occupancy 3\u2032 of poly(A)+ genes may be necessary to receive the green light from the polyadenylation machinery indicating that the 3\u2032end processing of the nascent transcript is correct (Fig.\u00a0One and 2). Thus, RNAP II deceleration downstream of the EAGs may be implicated in the feedback regulation of 3\u2032 processing of the nascent transcripts, where RNAP II 3\u2032 occupancy is controlled by the completeness of the polyadenylation reaction and thus, may act as a regulator of RNAP II termination.9,11,20,22,23 In agreement with this hypothesis, poly(A) signal-dependent pausing as a checkpoint for coupling 3\u2032 processing and termination has previously been suggested.35 Thus, sustained communication of the poly(A) signal to the polymerase over long distances downstream may be required to trigger and/or control polymerase release.36, Additional features influencing RNAP II accumulation 3\u2032 of EAGspoly(A) signals, terminator sequences and R-loopsEfficient RNAP II termination is supposed to be dependent on both a functional poly(A) signal and a terminator sequence situated downstream of EAGs. Moreover, two terminator-type sequences, which aid in the termination process, have been described: co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC) sequences, and transcription pause sites and G-rich MAZ termination elements.17,23-25 While analyzing the significance of the poly(A) signal in the 3\u2032end peak formation of RNAP II, Grosso et al.11 found that for genes with similar expression levels, the presence of the canonical poly(A) signal appears to promote RNAP II accumulation, whereas the presence of variant hexamers is more frequently associated with the lack of accumulation. This suggests that DNA sequences can also contribute to the process of RNAP II enrichment 3\u2032 of the EAGs. Recently, it was also suggested that R-loops formed by DNA/RNA hybrids near G-rich pause sites, downstream of poly(A) signals, may be involved in transcription termination.26 Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate whether R-loop formation participates GW in RNAP II termination and/or whether R-loops are involved in the formation of RNAP II peaks 3\u2032 of the EAGs.Gene loops and transcription \u201cfactories\u201dSeveral general transcription factors have been described linking transcription initiation and RNAP II termination27-29 and gene looping and communication between the TSS and the 3\u2032end of transcribed genes has also been described.11,30-33 Thus, it is plausible that for poly(A)+ genes the longer time RNAP II molecules spend downstream of the genes to go from the EAGs to the termination sites, the lesser amount of RNAP II is released from each gene to enter a new transcription reinitiation cycle on the same gene. This hypothesis is in good agreement with our findings that inhibition of polyadenylation not only results in increased RNAP II occupancy 3\u2032 of poly(A)+ genes, but also has reduced RNAP II occupancy at the TSSs of the tested genes (Fig.\u00a02). Consequently, longer RNAP II pausing in regions downstream of the EAGs may play a role in the establishment of nuclear pools of RNAP II that can be engaged in new rounds of transcription. In line with this hypothesis, the finding that for a subset of expressed poly(A)+ genes, no increase of RNAP II occupancy downstream of EAGs can be detected,9,11 suggest that rapid RNAP II recycling may be required for this subset of genes.Recently, it has been described that active genes are linked to different specialized transcription \u201cfactories,\u201d or foci, in the cell nucleus and the size of a \u201cfactory\u201d depends on the level of expression of the genes transcribed in a given \u201cfactory.\u201d34 Thus, it is possible that different transcription \u201cfactories\u201d might be linked with the different RNAP II pause patterns observed downstream of the EAGs.9ChromatinTo determine whether nucleosomes interfere with RNAP II occupancy downstream of the 3\u2032ends of genes, nucleosome organization in genes with and without 3\u2032 peaks were compared.11 The results show that nucleosome occupancy in the region downstream from the poly(A) site is significantly higher in genes with 3\u2032 RNAP II peaks than in genes devoid of RNAP II occupancy. Furthermore, in genes with 3\u2032 RNAP II peaks, nucleosomes align at regular intervals from the poly(A) site, whereas nucleosome alignment is much less obvious in genes devoid of detectable RNAP II downstream of the EAGs. Thus, the presence of nucleosomes after the poly(A) site might contribute to RNAP II deceleration, leading to its higher occupancy in these regions. Conversely, it is conceivable that RNAP II moving slowly downstream from the EAGs does not disturb nucleosome occupancy, while quickly moving RNAP II on 3\u2032 peaks lacking poly(A) sites does disrupt nucleosome occupancy.The complex network of interactions between mRNA 3\u2032 processing factors, elongation factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, histone chaperones, termination factors, DNA elements and possibly still uncharacterized factors provide numerous nodes for the regulation of RNAP II transcription termination. Many connections have already been established between RNAP II and the 3\u2032 processing and termination machineries, but there are still many open questions about transcription termination. As more systems are developed to study these fascinating processes, we expect and look forward to the discovery of additional interactions and/or activities participating in RNAP II termination.
