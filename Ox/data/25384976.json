These effects impaired 3\u2032 end processing of c-FOS transcripts. Mutant CDK12 proteins lacking their Arg-Ser-rich (RS) domain or just the RS domain alone acted as dominant negative proteins. Thus, CDK12 plays an important role in cotranscriptional processing of c-FOS transcripts. INTRODUCTIONRNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes protein-coding genes. It is regulated at multiple stages during transcription, including recruitment to promoters, initiation, pausing, release, and termination. In the process, RNAPII also orchestrates cotranscriptional capping, RNA splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation (CPA) of nascent transcripts (1,\u20135). Though originally considered to be divided into distinct phases, there is increasing evidence that many steps in mRNA transcription and processing are concurrent (6, 7).Transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are important regulators of various phases of RNAPII transcription. With their respective cyclin subunits, they regulate transcription by phosphorylating various effectors as well as the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII itself (8, 9). CDK7 and CDK8 are components of the general transcription factor TFIIH and Mediator, respectively. They regulate early steps of transcription by phosphorylating Mediator subunits and the CTD (10,\u201313). CDK7 phosphorylates serines at position 5 in the CTD (Ser5P). This action recruits the capping complex, which adds the 5\u2032 methyl cap to nascent transcripts (14, 15). A role for CDK7 in the release of paused RNAPII has been attributed to its activation of CDK9 (16). CDK9 phosphorylates negative elongation factors NELF (17) and DSIF (18), thereby promoting the release of the paused RNAPII into elongation (19,\u201321). Phosphorylation of serines at position 2 (Ser2P) in the CTD is involved in recruitment of 3\u2032 RNA-processing factors, which play a major role in the termination process (12, 22, 23).Recently, CDK12 joined the ranks of known transcriptional CDKs. Knocking down this kinase reduced overall levels of Ser2P in fly, human, and Caenorhabditis elegans germ line cells (24,\u201326). It also decreased the expression of a subset of cellular genes, e.g., those involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) (27), and the activation of luciferase reporter genes with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and simian virus 40 (SV40) promoters (26). CDK12 is also required for 3\u2032 cleavage of c-Myc transcripts (28). This attenuated cleavage could be correlated to decreased levels of Ser2P and cleavage stimulation factor 77 (CstF77) (29) at the c-Myc gene. CDK12's cyclin partner is cyclin K (CycK, or CCNK), which also binds to CDK13 (27). Interestingly, depleting CDK13 does not decrease levels of Ser2P (24).In this report, we provide evidence that CDK12 is required for the optimal induction of the c-FOS proto-oncogene (30, 31) by epidermal growth factor (EGF). In this context, depletion of CDK12 led to decreased levels of Ser2P, cleavage stimulation factor 64 (CstF64) (32), and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 (CPSF73) (33) at this gene and attenuated 3\u2032 end formation of c-FOS transcripts. Proteomic and functional analyses revealed that CDK12 associates with the exon junction complex (EJC) and SR splicing factors (SRSFs), which recruit it to the RNAPII elongation complex. MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and reagents. Mammalian expression vectors encoding CDK12 domain deletion mutants were produced from the parental pcdna.CDK12-Flag, described previously (27), by PCR-mediated deletion and BamHI religation. The following primers were used: for \u0394RS, F_ATAGGATCCCATCACGCTAGCCAGCTTGG and R_ATAGGATCCATGGATGGAAAGGAGTCCAAG; for \u0394KD, F_ATAGGATCCCCAGTCGCTTTCTGTTTGTC and R_ATAGGATCCAAAGATGTCGAACTCAGCAAAATG; for \u0394CT, F_ATAGGATCCTCGTAGACGCCTTCGATATTGC and R_ATAGGATCCAGAGGAGTTCCTTACGAGCTT. RS only was produced using primers \u0394CT F and R_ATAGGATCCGGGAAACGCTGTGTGGACAAG. Expression plasmids for SRSF4 to SRSF6 were a kind gift from Stefan Schwartz (Uppsala University, Sweden). Anti-CDK12 antibody (87011; Novus Biologicals) was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and two anti-CDK12 antibodies (87012 [Novus Biologicals] and ab57311 [Abcam]) were used for Western blotting and RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP). Antitubulin (ab6046; Abcam), anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 42/44 (anti-P-ERK42/44) (4370; Cell Signaling Technology [CST]), and anti-total ERK (4695; CST) were used for Western blotting. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Sigma (E9644). Anti-RNAPII (sc899; Santa Cruz Biotechnology [SCBT]), anti-Ser2P RNAPII (61084; Active Motif), and anti-Ser5P (61085; Active Motif) were used for ChIP. Antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) (H3663; Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-Flag (F1804; Sigma-Aldrich) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Anti-CPSF73 (sc101923; SCBT) and anti-CstF64 (sc166647; SCBT) were used for Western blotting. Anti-SRp55 (MABE152; Millipore), anti-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (anti-eIF4A3) (sc-365549; SCBT), and anti-CDK12 (ab57311; Abcam) were used for native immunoprecipitation.Cell culture and transfection. HEK293 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Transfection of plasmid DNA was performed using X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (06366546001; Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected for 72 or 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (13778030; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA targeting CDK12 or a nontargeting siRNA was purchased from SCBT (sc-44343 or sc-37007, respectively). siRNA targeting eIF4A3 (antisense_GACAACAUGCUGUCCGUAA and sense_GCUGGAUUACGGACAGCAU) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (15596-026; Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was treated for 30 min with Turbo DNase (AM2238; Ambion) and subsequently reverse transcribed and quantified using a SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (18080-051; Life Technologies) with random hexamers or gene-specific primers on a Stratagene Mx3005P platform. Control reaction mixtures lacking reverse transcriptase (RT-minus) were routinely incorporated and indicated at least 10-fold lower signal in all experiments. The following primers were used: for c-FOS exon 4 (total c-FOS), F_GAGAGCTGGTAGTTAGTAGCATGTTG and R_CTATCTACCAGAAAATAAAGTCGTATC; c-FOS exon poly(A) (pA), F_GCATTGTTTGCTTATTGTTCCAAGAC and R_CCAGCAGCTACCCTTCTTGACAAA; F1, F_GGAGACCAGTTTGTCAAGAAGGGTAG and R_GACGGGGTTTCTCCATGTTGG; F2, F_AGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCG and R_TCTCCTTTCCCTGTGGTTTG. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the primers were F_CTGGCGTCTTCACCACCATGG and R_CATCACGCCACAGTTTCCCGG. Primers used to determine splicing of the c-FOS RNA were described by Gu et al. (34).ChIP and RNA-IP. ChIP was performed as described previously (35). Sonicated lysate of 3 to 5 million cells was immunoprecipitated using 3 \u03bcg of the appropriate antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was detected by qPCR using a Bioline SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX kit (BIO-94002; Bioline, Cincinnati, OH) with annealing at 57\u00b0C and 15-s elongation steps. The following primers were used: for c-FOS promoter (Pro), F_TGAGCCCGTGACGTTTAC and R_TGCAGATGCGGTTGGAG; exon 2 (Ex2), F_CTGGCGTTGTGAAGACCATGAC and R_TCTGTACTGGGCTCCTGCATC; exon 3 (Ex3), F_AAGGGAAAGGAATAAGATGGCTG and R_CGCTTGGAGTGTATCAGTCA; pA, F_GCATTGTTTGCTTATTGTTCCAAGAC and R_CCAGCAGCTACCCTTCTTGACAAA; 3\u2032 flanking region 1 (F1), F_GGAGACCAGTTTGTCAAGAAGGGTAG and R_GACGGGGTTTCTCCATGTTGG. For detection of RNA associated with immunoprecipitated proteins, sonicated lysate of cross-linked cells was treated the same as for ChIP, eluted from the beads, and reverse transcribed as described previously (36).Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described before (37). HEK293 or HEK293T cells (\u223c5 \u00d7 106) were lysed on ice (10 min) in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 0.5% Triton X-100). The cell lysates were centrifuged (10,000 \u00d7 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants were collected. Supernatants were then precleared with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Precleared lysates were incubated with 3 \u03bcg of the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. The lysates were then centrifuged (10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C), and supernatants were incubated with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed five times with 800 \u03bcl of lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated complexes were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Native immunoprecipitations were performed as follows. HEK239T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 15-cm culture dishes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Once confluent, the cells were washed with cold (4\u00b0C) Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and lysed in 1.2 ml of cold immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1.0% Triton X-100). Cells were then scraped from the dish and sonicated on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged (10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C), and the supernatants were collected. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Precleared lysates were incubated with 4 \u03bcg of anti-CDK12 antibody (NB100-87011; Novus Biologicals), anti-CDK12 (ab57311; Abcam), anti-eIF4A3 (sc-365549; SCBT), anti-SRp55 antibody (A303-669A; Bethyl Laboratories), or anti-SRp55 (MABE152; Millipore) overnight with rotation at 4\u00b0C. RNase treatment was performed by incubating the lysates in RNase A (200 ng/\u03bcl) for 30 min. The lysates were then centrifuged (14,000 rpm at 10 min for 4\u00b0C); the supernatants were recovered and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated complexes were boiled in sample buffer (Laemmli sample buffer with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) at 95\u00b0C and analyzed via Western blotting.MS. Immunopurification and mass spectrometry (MS) were carried out as previously described (38). HEK293T cells (5 \u00d7 106) were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40) on ice for 45 h posttransfection. Insoluble material was pelleted for 20 min at 2,800 \u00d7 g. Supernatants were incubated with 20 \u03bcl of Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. After washing, beads were eluted in 30 \u03bcl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 \u03bcg/ml 3\u00d7Flag peptide [ELIM Biopharmaceuticals], 0.05% RapiGest SF). Immunopurified samples were denatured and reduced in 2 M urea, 10 mM NH4HCO3, and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 60\u00b0C and then alkylated with 2 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature. Trypsin (Promega) was added at a 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio, and peptide mixtures were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C. Following digestion, samples were concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Digested peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a Thermo Scientific Velos Pro ion trap mass spectrometry system equipped with a Proxeon Easy nLC high-pressure liquid chromatography and autosampler system. Samples were injected onto a precolumn (length, 2 cm; inside diameter [i.d.], 100 \u03bcm; packed with ReproSil Pur C18 AQ 5-\u03bcm particles) in 0.1% formic acid and then separated with a 2-h gradient from 5% to 30% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% formic acid on an analytical column (length, 10 cm; i.d., 75 \u03bcm; packed with ReproSil Pur C18 AQ 3-\u03bcm particles). The mass spectrometer collected data in a data-dependent fashion, collecting one full scan followed by 20 collision-induced dissociation MS/MS scans of the 20 most intense peaks from the full scan. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30 s with a repeat count of 1. The resulting raw data were matched to protein sequences by the Protein Prospector algorithm (39). Data were searched against a database containing Swiss-Prot human protein sequences (downloaded 6 March 6 2012) and concatenated to a decoy database where each sequence was randomized in order to estimate the false-positive rate. The searches considered a precursor mass tolerance of 1 Da and fragment ion tolerances of 0.8 Da and considered variable modifications for protein N-terminal acetylation, protein N-terminal acetylation and oxidation, glutamine-to-pyroglutamate conversion for peptide N-terminal glutamine residues, protein N-terminal methionine loss, protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine loss, methionine oxidation, and constant modification for carbamidomethyl cysteine. Prospector data were filtered using a maximum protein expectation value of 0.01 and a maximum peptide expectation value of 0.05. RESULTSCDK12 binds to the EJC and SRSFs. CDK12 exists as a CycK:CDK12 heterodimer in vivo (24, 26, 27). To gain mechanistic insight into the role of CDK12 in transcription, we identified its proteome. Flag epitope-tagged CDK12 protein was expressed with or without CycK (CCNK) in HEK293T cells. After immunoprecipitation, CDK12-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). We found an almost exclusive enrichment of RNA-binding proteins, which included components of the EJC (e.g., MAGOH, eIF4A3, RBM8, and RNPS1), SRSFs, the CDC5L/PRPF19 complex (CDC5L, PRPF19, and BCAS2), and other nonspecific proteins (Fig. 1A; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). Apart from CycK, the eIF4A3 subunit of the EJC was the highest-scoring candidate-binding partner.Open in a separate windowFIG 1CDK12 associates with the exon junction complex (EJC) and SR splicing factors (SRSFs). (A) Visual representation of the CDK12 proteome. Proteins coimmunoprecipitated with the Flag epitope-tagged CDK12 protein from HEK293T cells. They were identified using mass spectrometry. Nodes represent CDK12-binding partners. Distances between nodes and CDK12 are inversely proportional to the number of peptides identified for each protein. Nodes in a darker color also mark proteins with greater number of peptides within known complexes, such as the EJC and SRSFs. Other nodes contain proteins that could not be validated further (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material): teal, PRP19-CDC5L proteins; red, PRPF40A; yellow, miscellaneous RNA-associated proteins. (B) CDK12 interacts with EJC proteins in cells. Anti-Flag antibodies immunoprecipitated Flag epitope-tagged MAGOH or eIF4A3 (f:MAGOH or f:eIF4A3) proteins from HEK293T cells (lower panels). Anti-CDK12 antibodies revealed CDK12 in these immunoprecipitations in the absence (lanes 3 and 6) or presence (lanes 4 and 7) of RNase A by Western blotting (upper panels). Input (5% lysate) (lanes 1 and 5) and anti-IgG (lane 2) control lanes are also presented. (C) CDK12 interacts with SRSFs in cells. Anti-HA antibodies immunoprecipitated HA epitope-tagged SRSF4 (lanes 4 and 8), SRSF5 (lanes 2 and 6), and SRSF6 (lanes 3 and 7) (h:SRSF) proteins from HEK293T cells (lower panels). Anti-CDK12 antibodies revealed CDK12 in these immunoprecipitations by Western blotting (upper panels). Left panels show input (5% lysate), and right panels show immunoprecipitations. Lanes C, input lysates (lane 1) and immunoprecipitations from HEK293T cells (lane 5) expressing only the empty plasmid vector. (D) Endogenous CDK12, eIF4A3, and SRSF6 proteins interact in cells. Anti-CDK12 (upper panels) and anti-SRSF6 (lower panels) antibodies immunoprecipitated native proteins from untransfected HEK293T cells. Next, anti-eIF4A3 and anti-SRSF6 antibodies revealed these proteins in anti-CDK12 immunoprecipitations by Western blotting (upper panels). Anti-CDK12 and anti-eIF4A3 antibodies revealed CDK12 in anti-SRSF6 immunoprecipitations by Western blotting (lower panels). Inputs and IgG lanes (1 and 2) are as described for panel B. Lysates were incubated in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of RNase A. \u03b1, anti.EJC and SRSFs are found in the same complexes (40,\u201343). MAGOH, eIF4A3, Y14, and MLN51 form the core of the EJC that binds to sequences 20 to 24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon boundaries (43, 44). The EJC is recruited to transcripts by the intron-binding protein IBP160 (45) and deposited on the RNA via eIF4A3 prior to exon ligation during splicing (46, 47). The EJC has been implicated in transcription, nuclear mRNA export, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and enhanced translation (48,\u201351). It also acts as a general scaffold for a variety of factors implicated in cotranscriptional mRNA processing, especially 3\u2032 end formation (e.g., UPF2, UPF3, and RNPS1) (44). SRSFs are characterized by a common domain organization: one or two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal Arg-Ser-rich domain (RS domain). SRSFs have been implicated in transcription elongation, splice site selection, and 3\u2032 end processing as well as mRNA stabilization, export, and translation (52). RS domains of SRSFs serve as protein interaction domains (53). Given the presence of an RS domain in the N-terminal region of CDK12, the high score of eIF4A3 in the proteomic analysis, and established association between the EJC and splicing factors, which contain multiple SRSFs (5), we proceeded to characterize interactions between CDK12, the EJC, and SRSFs.Endogenous CDK12 protein coimmunoprecipitated with ectopically expressed Flag epitope-tagged eIF4A3 and MAGOH proteins in the presence and absence of RNase A (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 6 and 7). Representative HA epitope-tagged SRSFs (SRSF4/SRp75, SRSF5/SRp40, and SRSF6/SRp55) also coimmunoprecipitated with CDK12 (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 to 8). Importantly, endogenous eIF4A3 and SRSF6 proteins also interacted with CDK12 in an RNA-independent fashion (Fig. 1D). In contrast, other representative proteins of our proteome failed to coimmunoprecipitate with CDK12 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We conclude that CDK12 is a component of EJC:SRSF complexes in cells.CDK12 and eIF4A3 are required for optimal c-FOS activation by EGF. CDKs play critical roles in inducible gene expression by targeting transcriptional regulators and RNAPII. For instance, rapid activation of the c-FOS gene by EGF mediated via CTD phosphorylation has been used as a model system for inducible gene expression (54,\u201356). Furthermore, cotranscriptional recruitment of SRSFs, which are known to associate with the EJC (43), is integral to RNA processing (52, 57). Multiple SRSFs were identified as candidate CDK12-binding partners (Fig. 1A; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). To evaluate possible interactions between CDK12 and the EJC:SRSF complexes in growth factor-stimulated activation of c-FOS, HEK293T cells were depleted of CDK12, eIF4A3 (58,\u201360), or both proteins by siRNA for 48 h and subsequently stimulated with EGF for 30 min. Levels of c-FOS RNA were quantified by RT-qPCR. Induction of c-FOS transcripts in CDK12-, eIF4A3-, and CDK12/eIF4A3-depleted cells was 5-fold lower than levels in control cells (Fig. 2A, compare black, striped, and hatched bars to the white bar). Thus, CDK12 and the EJC appear to be required for optimal c-FOS gene activation by EGF. Interestingly, simultaneous depletion of eIF4A3 and CDK12 did not lower c-FOS levels below those observed in knockdowns of eIF4A3 or CDK12 alone (Fig. 2A, compare hatched bar to black and striped bars). Small differences in the levels of c-FOS activation can be attributed to the incomplete knockdown of CDK12 compared to that of eIF4A3 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2) was not affected, demonstrating that CDK12 depletion did not reduce signaling via the canonical EGF receptor (EGFR)-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). This finding suggests that CDK12 and EJC:SRSF complexes act through a common pathway for optimal c-FOS induction by EGF.Open in a separate windowFIG 2Depletions of CDK12 and eIF4A3 inhibit c-FOS activation by EGF. (A) Depletion of CDK12, eIF4A3, or both proteins decreases levels of EGF-induced c-FOS transcripts. HEK293T cells were treated with scrambled siRNA (siScr), siRNAs targeting CDK12 (siCDK12), eIF4A3 (sieIF4A3), or both siRNAs (siCDK12 + sieIF4A3) for 48 h and then lysed (group 1 bars) or incubated first with EGF for 30 min prior to lysis (group 2 bars). Levels of c-FOS transcripts were determined by RT-qPCR and normalized to those of GAPDH RNA. Values represent the averages \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3).

The schematic is as follows: ball, the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap; black ovals, exons; zigzag line, poly(A) tail. (B) Confirmation of eIF4A3 and CDK12 knockdowns. Levels of CDK12 and eIF4A3 in HEK293T cells treated with scrambled siRNA and siRNAs targeting CDK12, eIF4A3, or both, as indicated (see above), were determined using specific antibodies by Western blotting. \u03b1-Tubulin levels were used as the loading control (lower panel).CDK12 depletion decreases levels of Ser2P, CstF64, and CPSF73 at the EGF-stimulated c-FOS gene. CDK12 depletion decreases overall levels of Ser2P in flies, humans, and C. elegans (24,\u201326). To determine whether this inhibition also occurs on the EGF-induced c-FOS gene in HEK293 cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) (Fig. 3). A schematic diagram of the c-FOS gene and interrogated sequences is provided in Fig. 3A. We found that CDK12 knockdown had minimal effects on levels of RNAPII and Ser5P throughout the c-FOS gene and its 3\u2032 flanking region (Fig. 3B and \u200bandC).C). In contrast, it reduced Ser2P levels 2-fold in the body of the gene (Fig. 3D). These findings are in agreement with those published with the c-Myc gene in CDK12-depleted HeLa cells (28). Thus, CDK12 also promotes Ser2P in the CTD of RNAPII on the c-FOS gene.Open in a separate windowFIG 3CDK12 depletion decreases levels of Ser2P, CstF64, and CPSF73 at the c-FOS gene following EGF stimulation.

Pro, promoter; Ex2, exon 2/intron 2; pA, polyadenylation site; F1, 3\u2032 flanking region 1. (B) Depletion of CDK12 has little effect on levels of RNAPII at the c-FOS gene. ChIPs were performed using CDK12-depleted or control HEK293 cells with EGF stimulation (30 min). Levels of RNAPII in control (siScr) and CDK12-depleted (siCDK12) cells are presented as relative fold enrichment following EGF stimulation, which was normalized to the input. Values presented for N20 (total RNAPII)-specific antibodies represent the averages \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 2). (C) Depletion of CDK12 has little effect on levels of Ser5P at the c-FOS gene. ChIPs were performed as described for panel B. Levels and values of H14 (anti-Ser5P) antibodies in control (siScr) and CDK12-depleted (siCDK12) cells are presented as described for panel B. (D) Depletion of CDK12 reduces levels of Ser2P at the c-FOS gene. ChIPs were performed as described for panel B. Levels and values of H5 (anti-Ser2P) antibodies in control (siScr) and CDK12-depleted (siCDK12) cells are presented as described for panel B. (E) Depletion of CDK12 reduces levels of CstF64 at the c-FOS gene. ChIPs were performed as described for panel B. Levels and values of anti-CstF64 antibodies in control (siScr) and CDK12 knockdown (siCDK12) cells are presented as described for panel B. (F) Depletion of CDK12 reduces levels of CPSF73 at the c-FOS gene. ChIPs were performed as described for panel B. Levels and values of anti-CPSF73 antibodies in control (siScr) and CDK12 knockdown (siCDK12) cells are presented as described for panel B. (G) Knockdown of CDK12 does not affect levels of CstF64 and CPSF73 in cells. Anti-CstF64, anti-CPSF73, anti-CDK12, and anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibodies revealed their cognate proteins in control (1) and siCDK12-treated (2) HEK293 cells (see above) by Western blotting.Since Ser2P levels have been correlated with recruitment of CPA factors to RNAPII, which decreased at the c-Myc gene in the absence of CDK12 (28), we also examined whether recruitment of CPA factors to c-FOS is affected by CDK12 depletion in c-FOS. Polyadenylation site selection and cleavage of the nascent RNA are mediated by components of the heterotrimeric CstF complex (61, 62). The RNA-binding component of CstF, CstF64 (32), is also a determining factor in alternative polyadenylation (APA) (63). In addition, CPSF plays a critical role in 3\u2032 cleavage of nascent transcripts. Indeed, CPSF73 is the endonuclease that cleaves the transcript 18 to 20 nucleotides 3\u2032 to the poly(A) site (33). We found that levels of CstF64 and CPSF73 were reduced at the poly(A) site and 3\u2032 flanking sequences of the c-FOS gene in CDK12-depleted cells (Fig. 3E and \u200bandF,F, pA and F1 regions). This finding was not due to decreased levels of CstF64 and CPSF73 in these cells, which were not affected by the absence of CDK12 (Fig. 3G). Since CDK12 regulates only a small subset of cellular genes, this finding is not surprising. It also confirmed that CDK12 promotes not only Ser2P but also the recruitment of CPA factors to RNAPII at affected genes (28).CDK12 affects 3\u2032 end processing of the activated c-FOS gene. Decreased levels of c-FOS transcripts in CDK12-depleted cells (Fig. 2A) cannot be explained by the slightly reduced enrichment of RNAPII at the c-FOS gene (Fig. 3B). Rather, they reflect rates of transcription, cotranscriptional processing, and stability of the mature RNA. Indeed, the proper splicing and CPA of newly transcribed RNA also influence its overall stability (64,\u201366). By acting as a recruiting platform for splicing and CPA factors, the phosphorylated CTD affects the cotranscriptional processing of nascent RNA (67). Reduced phosphorylation of the CTD attenuates these processes (34).To evaluate consequences of CDK12 depletion on c-FOS transcripts, we examined c-FOS splicing and 3\u2032 end processing following EGF stimulation. First, we compared levels of mature and read-through transcripts by RT-qPCR. Mature and read-through transcripts as well as primers used in this study are depicted in Fig. 4A. Note that RT-qPCRs were normalized to total c-FOS RNA, which was determined with primers to exon 4 (total in Fig. 4A). As presented in Fig. 4B, we found no significant changes in splicing patterns in CDK12-depleted cells using primers that span exon-exon junctions (introns 1, 2, and 3). Next, we determined the 3\u2032 end processing efficiency of transcripts downstream of the major poly(A) site (Fig. 4C). RT-qPCR with the indicated primers (pA, F1, and F2) demonstrated that total cellular c-FOS RNA included 3- to 4-fold more downstream sequences in CDK12-depleted cells (Fig. 4C, black bars). A similar increase of c-FOS read-through transcripts was observed in eIF4A3-depleted cells (Fig. 4C, striped bars). Again, depletion of CDK12 and eIF4A3 did not significantly change levels of these read-through transcripts (Fig. 4C, hatched bars), further indicating that they regulate c-FOS RNA 3\u2032 end processing via a common pathway. Thus, knockdown of these factors reduced total c-FOS RNA levels (Fig. 2) and increased c-FOS transcripts with extended 3\u2032 ends, which is characteristic of mRNAs featuring extended 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (68).Open in a separate windowFIG 4CDK12 and eIF4A3 depletions reduce 3\u2032 end processing of c-FOS transcripts. (A) Schematic representations of mature (upper) and read-through (lower) c-FOS transcripts. Ball, 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap; zigzag line, poly(A) tail. Horizontal lines below transcripts represent regions amplified by RT-qPCR. Primers span exon-exon junctions, as follows: exons 1 to 2 (1), exons 2 to 3 (2), and exons 3 to 4 (3). Primers for 3\u2032 end formation amplify as follows: total, exon 4; pA, polyadenylation site; F1 and F2, 3\u2032 flanking regions 1 and 2, respectively. (B) CDK12 depletion does not affect c-FOS RNA splicing. CDK12-depleted or control cells were treated with EGF for 30 min, and total RNA was isolated. Total RNA was converted to cDNA via random-primed RT and quantified by qPCR using exon-exon junction-spanning primers presented in panel A. Levels of spliced RNA were normalized to the total c-FOS RNA determined with primers to exon 4 (total). Levels of spliced RNA after CDK12 depletion (siCDK12) are presented relative to those in nondepleted control cells (siScr). Values represent the averages \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). (C) Depletion of CDK12 and eIF4A3 inhibit 3\u2032 end processing of c-FOS transcripts. HEK293T cells were treated with scrambled siRNA (siScr), siRNA targeting CDK12 (siCDK12), eIF4A3 (sieIF4A3), or both siRNAs (siCDK12 + sieIF4A3) for 48 h, followed by incubation with EGF for 30 min (total RNA was isolated from the same cultures used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2). Total RNA was converted to cDNA via random-primed RT and quantified by qPCR using 3\u2032 end primers presented in panel A. Transcripts spanning the polyadenylation site and read-through regions were normalized to total c-FOS RNA determined with primers to exon 4 (total). Levels of read-through RNA after depletion are presented relative to those in nondepleted control cells (siScr). Values represent the averages \u00b1 standard errors (n = 4).CDK12 does not associate with nascent and mature c-FOS transcripts after eIF4A3 depletion. CDK12 is recruited to the c-Myc gene and comigrates with RNAPII during transcription (28). Given our proteomic data (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that depletion of eIF4A3 should reduce CDK12 enrichment at the EGF-induced c-FOS gene. To this end, we performed ChIPs on control (using scrambled siRNA [siScr]) and eIF4A3-depleted (siRNA targeting eIF4A3 [sieIF4A3]) HEK293T cells using anti-CDK12 and anti-N20 (RNAPII) antibodies, normalizing levels of CDK12 to those of RNAPII (Fig. 5A). We used the same primers as shown in Fig. 3. Indeed, we observed 2- and 5-fold decreased levels of CDK12 at the body (exon 2/intron 2) and poly(A) site (pA) of the c-FOS gene, respectively, in eIF4A3-depleted cells (Fig. 5A). Thus, the EJC is involved in the recruitment of CDK12 to the c-FOS gene.Open in a separate windowFIG 5Depletion of eIF4A3 impairs CDK12 recruitment to the c-FOS gene. (A) Knockdown of eIF4A3 reduces CDK12 enrichment at the c-FOS exon 2/intron 2 region and the polyadenylation site. ChIPs were performed using anti-CDK12 antibodies on HEK293T cells treated with scrambled siRNA (siScr) or siRNA targeting eIF4A3 (sieIF4A3). Amplified regions are as described in the legend of Fig. 3. Levels of CDK12 across the c-FOS promoter (Pro), exon 2/intron 2 (Ex2), polyadenylation site (pA), and 3\u2032 read-through region (F1) were normalized to RNAPII and are presented as relative enrichment over the siScr control value. Values represent the averages \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). (B) CDK12 recruitment to c-FOS transcripts is reduced in eIF4A3-depleted cells. RNA-IP was performed using HEK293T cells treated with scrambled siRNA (siScr,) or siRNA targeting eIF4A3 (sieIF4A3). After immunoprecipitation with CDK12-specific antibodies, RNA was converted to cDNA via random-primed RT and quantified by qPCR using primers spanning the boundary between exon 2 and intron 2 (Ex2, unprocessed transcript) or exon 3 (Ex3, total transcript) in c-FOS transcripts. Bars are presented as relative RNA enrichment normalized to input and IgG control levels set to 1. Values represent the averages \u00b1 standard errors (n = 3).Given that the EJC and SRSFs associate extensively with mRNA (43, 53, 59, 69), we also performed RNA immunoprecipitations to determine the relative enrichment of CDK12 on c-FOS transcripts (Fig. 5B). The schematic representation of c-FOS exons, introns, and primers is presented above the bar graphs in Fig. 5. Ex2 primers correspond to exon 2 and intron 2 sequences and represent unspliced transcripts while Ex3 primers amplify exon 3 and therefore reflect total c-FOS RNA. As presented in the bar graph (Fig. 5B), the association between CDK12 and unprocessed and total c-FOS RNA was decreased 5- and 20-fold, respectively, in eIF4A3-depleted cells. Of interest, CDK12 dissociation was more severe with total c-FOS RNA. This finding could indicate that there are additional interactions between nascent transcripts, CDK12, and RNAPII on genes or that CDK12 and the EJC remain associated with mature transcripts after splicing. These interactions further support a role for CDK12, the EJC, and SRSFs in transcription and cotranscriptional processing of target genes.Mapping interactions between CDK12 and RNA-binding complexes. The EJC and SRSFs interact in an RNA-independent fashion (43). Furthermore, SRSFs are found together with the EJC during cotranscriptional processing on nascent transcripts and interact with CDK12 equivalently (Fig. 1C and \u200bandD).D). We hypothesized that mutant CDK12 proteins that no longer interact with these complexes could also function as dominant negative proteins. They could be used to analyze further the role(s) of CDK12 in transcription. Thus, we performed additional binding studies using mutant CDK12 and wild-type (WT) SRSF proteins.Flag epitope-tagged deletion mutant CDK12 proteins (Fig. 6A) were coexpressed with HA epitope-tagged SRSF6, followed by anti-Flag immunoprecipitations in HEK293 cells. Detection of SRSF6 indicated that the kinase domain and the C-terminal region of CDK12 were dispensable for this binding (Fig. 6B, lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, the deletion of the N-terminal RS domain seemed to abolish interactions with SRSF6 (Fig. 6B, lane 8). However, removal of the RS domain destabilized CDK12 and reduced its levels of expression (Fig. 6B, lane 2). To stabilize this mutant protein, we added enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to its N terminus (\u0394RS.GFP CDK12) (Fig. 6C, lane 3). In this context, removing the RS domain also disrupted interactions between CDK12 and SRSF6 (Fig. 6C, lane 6). Conversely, the N-terminal CDK12 RS domain was sufficient for binding to SRSF6 (Fig. 6B, lane 11). We also determined that the RS domain of CDK12 was sufficient for interactions with all three SRSFs (Fig. 6D, lanes 5 to 7). Thus, the RS domain of CDK12 interacts with the EJC and SRSFs.Open in a separate windowFIG 6N-terminal RS domain in CDK12 interacts with SRSFs. (A) A graphical representation of wild-type (WT) and mutant CDK12 proteins. Predicted domains of the protein are as follows: RS, arginine- and serine-rich domain; PRM, proline-rich motif; KD, kinase domain; P, prolines.

(B) The N-terminal RS domain of CDK12 interacts with SRSFs. Flag epitope-tagged mutant CDK12 proteins were coexpressed with the HA epitope-tagged SRSF6 protein in HEK293 cells. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitations were performed. Lower panels depict total lysates (lanes 1 to 6) and immunoprecipitated (lanes 7 to 12) WT and mutant CDK12 proteins.

Flag epitope-tagged WT (f:WT) or GFP-stabilized mutant \u0394RS CDK12 (f:\u0394RS.GFP) proteins were coexpressed with the HA epitope-tagged SRSF6 proteins in HEK293T cells. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitations were performed. Lower panels depict results with total lysates (lanes 1 to 3) and immunoprecipitated (lanes 4 to 6) WT and mutant CDK12 proteins.

HA epitope-tagged SRSF proteins (h:SRSF) were coexpressed with the Flag epitope-tagged CDK12 RS domain (f:RS), and anti-HA immunoprecipitations were performed. Lower panels show results with total lysates (lanes 1 to 4) and immunoprecipitated (lanes 5 to 8) HA epitope-tagged SRSFs. Upper panels show results with input (lanes 1 to 4) and coimmunoprecipitated (lanes 5 to 8) Flag epitope-tagged RS protein.RS domain of CDK12 is important for its effects on transcription. To determine if these interactions between CDK12 and RNA processing factors are necessary for activation of the c-FOS gene, we expressed \u0394RS.GFP CDK12 in HEK293T cells. Whereas expression of the WT CDK12 protein did not affect activation of the c-FOS gene, that of the mutant \u0394RS.GFP CDK12 protein decreased it 3-fold (Fig. 7A, bars 2 and 3). Furthermore, the exogenous expression of the CDK12 RS domain led to a 4-fold decrease in the activation of the c-FOS gene by EGF (Fig. 7A, bars 2 and 4). Similar to depletion of CDK12 or eIF4A3, expression of the CDK12 RS domain also increased read-through transcription of the c-FOS gene (Fig. 7B). These data support and extend the role for CDK12 in the cotranscriptional processing of a target gene, particularly at its 3\u2032 end.Open in a separate windowFIG 7Dominant negative CDK12 proteins. (A) CDK12 lacking the RS domain and ectopic expression of the CDK12 RS domain inhibit c-FOS gene activation by EGF. HEK293T cells coexpressing CycK and control empty plasmid vector (lane 1), Flag epitope-tagged WT CDK12 (f:WT CDK12) (lane 2) protein, Flag epitope-tagged \u0394RS CDK12 protein stabilized with GFP (f:\u0394RS.GFP CDK12) (lane 3), or the Flag epitope-tagged RS (f:RS) domain (lane 4) were grown for 48 h and then treated with EGF for 30 min. Levels of total c-FOS RNA were determined using primers to exon 4 by RT-qPCR. Values were normalized to those of actin and are presented relative to the control empty plasmid vector. Values represent the means \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). (B) The RS domain of CDK12 interferes with 3\u2032 end formation of the c-FOS gene. In the same samples (see above), read-through of the c-FOS gene was determined using F1 primers as described in the legend of Fig. 4A. Values were normalized to those of actin and are presented relative to the control empty plasmid vector. Values represent the means \u00b1 standard deviations (n = 3). DISCUSSIONIn this study, we extended our previous observations on the importance of CDK12 on the expression of long genes, such as those involved in the DDR, to those that are induced rapidly in cells (27). CDK12 was found to associate with the EJC and several SRSFs. We determined that EGF-mediated induction of c-FOS was diminished in cells depleted of CDK12 and eIF4A3. This finding correlated with reduced levels of Ser2P and CPA factors on the c-FOS gene. In these cells, RNAPII read-through past the c-FOS poly(A) site was observed. Levels of read-through transcription correlated with those of diminished c-FOS transcripts. Additional mapping of these interactions pointed to a critical role of the EJC in the recruitment CDK12 to the c-FOS gene. Mapping and analyses of dominant negative CDK12 proteins also pointed to a role of the RS domain in CDK12 for these interactions and effects. Thus, CDK12 is recruited to elongating RNAPII by RNA-processing factors, where it phosphorylates Ser2P in the CTD, thus increasing the recruitment of CPA factors for optimal 3\u2032 end processing of target genes.Although knockdown of CDK12 and/or eIF4A3 resulted in a modest reduction (5-fold) of EGF-induced c-FOS RNA levels (Fig. 2A), a similar reduction was observed with dominant negative CDK12 proteins, which indicates that these effects were specific. Most likely, other CDKs, e.g., CDK9 in positive transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb), also contribute to increased levels of c-FOS transcripts and Ser2P in EGF-induced cells (70, 71). This scenario is likely as P-TEFb affects early steps in transcription. Thus, stress induced by CDK12 depletion could have released free P-TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP (20). Consequently, increased levels of active P-TEFb would have been recruited to the c-FOS promoter via the super elongation complex (SEC) (72). Another possibility is that with a rapidly induced short gene, the EJC and SRSFs are not fully associated with its nascent transcripts during transcription and thus less CDK12 is recruited. On long genes with many introns and exons, such as those involved in DNA damage repair (27), these RNA-bound complexes would be more stably associated, which could result in greater effects of CDK12 depletion. Finally, although CDK12 depletion reduced CPA of c-Myc transcripts in cells (28), we found no differences in c-Myc RNA levels (data not presented), suggesting that not all transcripts are destabilized by increased read-through transcription.CDK12 is the closest homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctk1 (24). Interestingly, knockout of Ctk1 in yeast cells also leads to read-through transcription of select genes (73, 74). This finding suggests some degree of functional conservation between Ctk1 and CDK12. Indeed, CDK12 depletion impacted the recruitment of CstF64 and CPSF73 to the c-FOS gene. CDK12 also increased levels of CPA factors and CPSF-mediated cleavage of nascent c-Myc transcripts (28). In our study, these effects depended on interactions between CDK12, the EJC, and SRSFs. Further positioning of the 3\u2032 end processing machinery on the nascent RNA is determined by specific interactions between CPA factors with the (AAUAAA) polyadenylation signal and U- or G/U-rich element downstream of the cleavage site (75). Thus, Ser2P in the CTD facilitates their cotranscriptional recruitment to the nascent RNA. In agreement with this finding, replacing all serines at position 2 in the CTD with alanines resulted in increased read-through transcription of the c-FOS gene (34).The EJC also promotes NMD and translation of mRNA (58, 76). However, we found no effect of CDK12 depletion on these processes (data not presented). Rather CDK12 elucidates a previously less appreciated role of the EJC in cotranscriptional processing of target genes (43, 49). This role appears to be specific for a subset of genes\u2014those that are rapidly induced, such as c-FOS, and those that are long and contain many exons and introns (27). It is also possible that in cells where CDK12 is expressed at higher levels, e.g., stem and cancer cells (77), it plays a greater role in overall transcription of genes.CycK binds to CDK12 and is highly expressed in developing germ cells (78). CycK promotes spermatogenesis and is highly expressed in testicular cancer (79). Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2, CDK12 depletion also sensitizes tumor cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2) inhibition, which targets an important component of the DDR (80). Taken together with the kinase's predilection for DDR genes and our data on c-FOS gene expression, this finding suggests that CDK12 is an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in CDK12 may result in, or at least contribute to, carcinogenesis via pleiotropic effects. Deregulation of the function of different CDKs has been linked to disease phenotypes such as growth defects and cancer etiology (16, 81, 82). Given recent advances in whole-genome sequencing, a correlation between CDK12 gene amplification and tumor formation is becoming more evident. The CDK12 gene is located in the q12-q21 region of chromosome 17 (17q12-q21). This locus is amplified in a large number of cancers, including ovarian and prostate cancer and up to 30% of breast cancers (83, 84).
