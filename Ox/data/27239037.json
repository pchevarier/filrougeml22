By systematically isolating phosphorylation states of the CTD heptapeptide repeat (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7), we identify hundreds of protein factors that are differentially enriched, revealing unappreciated connections between the Pol II CTD and co-transcriptional processes. These data uncover a role for threonine-4 in 3\u2032 end processing through controlling the transition between cleavage and termination. Furthermore, serine-5 phosphorylation seeds spliceosomal assembly immediately downstream of 3\u2032 splice sites through a direct interaction with spliceosomal subcomplex, U1. Strikingly, threonine-4 phosphorylation also impacts splicing through serving as a mark of co-transcriptional spliceosome release and ensuring efficient post-transcriptional splicing genome-wide. Thus, comprehensive Pol II interactomes identify the complex and functional connections between transcription machinery and other gene regulatory complexes. IntroductionTranscription regulation controls both RNA transcript levels and the final sequence of the RNA transcript through regulated coordination with co-transcriptional RNA processing. Capping, splicing and termination are coupled to transcription through phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit. The CTD extends from the Pol II body and consists of a conserved heptapeptide, Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7, repeated 26 times in yeast and 52 times in humans. Five of the seven residues are dynamically phosphorylated during the transcription cycle in a characteristic pattern across gene bodies. (Fuchs et al., 2009; Hintermair et al., 2012; Jeronimo et al., 2013; Komarnitsky et al., 2000; Mayer et al., 2010, 2012;). Phosphorylation of particular CTD residues contributes to the recruitment of key regulatory factors at the right place and time, facilitating connections to co-transcriptional processes. Yet, the extent of connections between CTD phosphorylation marks and RNA processing machinery are not clear. A focus on identifying direct phospho-CTD binding proteins has slowed experimental throughput and overlooked mechanisms that occur through phosphorylation marks blocking regulatory interactions or indirectly connecting transcription to other processes.The best-characterized CTD residues are Ser2 and Ser5. Pol II complexes containing high levels of phospho-Ser2 (Ser2P) are thought to be involved in the latter stages of transcription as Ser2P rises slowly across gene bodies and peaks at the 3\u2032 ends of genes (Barill\u00e0 et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2004). A termination factor, Rtt103, directly binds Ser2P, yet is only recruited after the polyadenylation (polyA) site. This specificity is controlled in part by phospho-Tyr1 (Tyr1P), presumably through blocking Rtt103 binding before the polyA site (Mayer et al., 2012). It is unclear whether additional residues contribute to the precise recruitment of Rtt103 and, more generally, how multiple residues might work together in the coupling of other RNA processing events to transcription.Pol II complexes containing high levels of phospho-Ser5 (Ser5P) are enriched near the transcription start site (TSS) of genes, consistent with the essential role of Ser5P in the earliest mRNA processing event, capping of the nascent RNA (Cho et al., 1997; Komarnitsky et al., 2000; McCracken et al., 1997; Schroeder et al., 2000; Schwer and Shuman, 2011). Recently, a connection between Ser5P and splicing has been suggested. In yeast, Ser5P increases transiently during a splicing-related transcription checkpoint at the 3\u2032 splice site, where Pol II pauses and does not resume transcription until splicing-related events occur (Alexander et al., 2010; Chathoth et al., 2014). However it remains unclear whether there are direct connections between splicing and Ser5P or the CTD in general (Licatalosi et al., 2001). Initial studies indicated a component of the spliceosome (Prp40) could directly bind the CTD (Morris and Greenleaf, 2000). However, other work showed no defect on the co-transcriptional recruitment of the spliceosome in strains where the CTD-binding domain of Prp40 was removed (G\u00f6rnemann et al., 2011). Thus despite the observation of co-transcriptional splicing and spliceosomal assembly, (Kotovic et al., 2003; Lacadie and Rosbash, 2005; Lacadie et al., 2006; Moore et al., 2006; Tardiff et al., 2006) the degree of coupling between the transcription and splicing machineries, and what role Ser5P may play, remains unclear.Not all CTD residues are as well characterized as Ser2 and Ser5. For example, Thr4 regulates elongation in human cells but phospho-Thr4 (Thr4P) levels peak after polyA sites (Hintermair et al., 2012). Substitution of valine for each CTD threonine yielded a defect only in 3\u2032 end processing of histone mRNAs in chicken DT40 cells (Hsin et al., 2011) and had minimal impact on the transcriptome in yeast (Rosonina et al., 2014). Yet recent mass spectrometry analysis of the Pol II CTD showed that Thr4P is possibly as abundant as Ser2P, suggesting that key roles for this residue remain to be discovered (Schuller et al., 2016).To determine unappreciated connections between CTD phosphorylation and RNA processing, we performed an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of phospho-specific Pol II complexes. We developed a sequential purification strategy to purify Pol II complexes enriched for each CTD phosphoisoform and used quantitative label-free mass spectrometry to identify factors that interact with phospho-specifc Pol II complexes compared to all Pol II complexes. Application of this approach to Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified unique phospho-specific Pol II interactomes for the five phosphorylatable CTD residues. The factors enriched in each phospho-CTD interactome allow prediction and discovery of new roles for individual factors and phospho-CTD residues. By combining the interactome data with multiple high-resolution genomic techniques, we describe a previously uncharacterized role for Thr4 in transcription termination in yeast, through the recruitment of termination factors and regulation of Pol II dynamics.Our proteomic analysis reveals a striking differential enrichment of the spliceosome as a function of CTD phosphorylation. The Ser5P interactome is strongly enriched with U1 spliceosomal components and we demonstrate that Ser5P contributes directly to the co-transcriptional recruitment of the spliceosome. The Thr4P interactome has a complete lack of enriched spliceosome subunits and we observe that this mark peaks in the terminal exon after dissociation of splicing machinery. Thr4 is required in the post-transcriptional completion of splicing, demonstrating that CTD modifications impact both co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional splicing through separate residues. Together, these data comprehensively define the protein factors that associate with Pol II and uncover novel roles for CTD modifications in splicing and termination regulation. ResultsProteomic Analysis of Phospho-specific Pol II ComplexesTo determine the compendium of factors that associate to actively transcribing Pol II, we first analyzed purifications of total Pol II by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. We adapted the immunoprecipitation approach developed for native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), whereby engaged Pol II complexes are solubilized from chromatin and immunoprecipitated (Churchman and Weissman, 2011). Analysis of enriched factors was consistent with previous Pol II proteomics studies and in identifying many known transcription and RNA processing factors (Figure S1A) (Mosley et al., 2011, 2013; Tardiff et al., 2007).In order to investigate direct and indirect Pol II interactors specific to each CTD phosphoisoform, we developed a native sequential immunoprecipitation (IP) strategy to purify Pol II complexes enriched for different phosphorylated CTD residues (Figure 1A). Our strategy is designed to purify the host of proteins that interact both directly and indirectly with Pol II when a particular residue is phosphorylated. Thus we obtain a comprehensive picture of the co-occurring processes marked by each phosphorylated residue. To this end, all Pol II complexes are first purified via a 3xFLAG epitope tag to isolate the full complement of Pol II phosphoisoforms (5 phosphorylatable residues across 26 repeats). From this pool, highly efficient IPs enrich for sets of phosphoisoforms with well-characterized and specific antisera targeting each phosphorylatable residue (Tyr1P, Ser2P, Ser5P, Thr4P and Ser7P) or with a mock antisera (mCherry) (Figure S1B) (Hintermair et al., 2012; Mayer et al., 2012). Native IP conditions were chosen instead of crosslinking in order to reduce the possibility for false positives. Importantly, the repetitive nature of the CTD permits the purification of factors that directly bind the targeted phospho-CTD residue even in the case that their association is displaced by the antibody interaction. Nevertheless, for direct interactors, our purification strategy has the potential to be less quantitative and may yield false negatives. Each phospho-specific IP purifies a subset of Pol II complexes that are highly enriched for the selected phosphorylated residue, yet are also phosphorylated on other residues across the 26 repeats, thus allowing for the enrichment of indirectly associating factors recruited by frequently co-occurring patterns of Pol II modifications (Figure S1C). Furthermore, our strategy will isolate any proteins that are bound to the nascent RNA. In sum, this approach comprehensively purifies proteins that interact directly and indirectly with Pol II coincident with each phosphorylation mark.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Purification and Analysis of Native Pol II Complexes(A) Diagram of native Pol II purification followed by phospho-specific immunoprecipitations (IPs) and quantitative label-free mass spectrometry analysis for each CTD phospho-modification; m7Gppp, RNA cap.(B, C) Volcano plots comparing Ser5P (B) and Ser2P (C) IPs to mock IPs.

PC, principal component.See also Figure S1.To identify enriched factors in a quantitative manner, samples from the Pol II IP, each phospho-specific IP, and the mock IP were analyzed by mass spectrometry in biological triplicate. Significantly enriched factors in each phospho-specific IP were determined using quantitative label-free proteomic analysis (Hubner and Mann, 2011; Hubner et al., 2010). Specifically, the phospho-specific:mock IP fold increase of spectral intensities are compared to p-values determined by t-tests, generating a volcano plot (Figures 1B and C; S1A, D\u2013F). Only factors present in all three replicates are analyzed and are identified as significantly enriched using a false discovery rate of 0.05. As the mock IP is done after the first IP, factors enriched with each phosphoisoform represent proteins that are enriched over a background of all Pol II interactors. The stringent nature of this strategy identifies the most highly enriched factors associated with each phosphoisoform. Together, the five Pol II phospho-CTD interactomes contain nearly two hundred enriched factors, including Pol II subunits, RNA processing factors, transcription factors and chromatin-related factors. Our analysis successfully identified factors previously shown to directly associate with different phospho-CTD isoforms, such as enrichment of the mRNA capping complex (Cet1 and Ceg1) and the Ser5 kinase TFIIH in the Ser5P inteactome (Figure 1B) (Komarnitsky et al., 2000; Schroeder et al., 2000) and enrichment of Pcf11 and other cleavage, polyadenylation and export factors (Clp1, Rna14 and Tex1) in the Ser2P interactome (Figure 1C) (Barill\u00e0 et al., 2001; Buratowski, 2005). Although our focus is not entirely on identifying direct phospho-CTD binders, these results demonstrate that our approach robustly purifies direct Pol II CTD interactors, presumably facilitated by the repetitive nature of the CTD.Pol II Phospho-specific Interactomes Are DistinctUtilizing the stringent nature of the interactome data we asked whether the proteins that are highly enriched in each Pol II CTD interactome constitute distinct groups of factors, which would suggest that each Pol II phospho-CTD residue connects to different Pol II regulation modalities and/or co-transcriptional processes. Principal component analysis of all five phospho-CTD interactomes demonstrates that each interactome contains a unique set of factors that are reproducibly identified (Figure 1D) (Tables S1 and S2). Consistently, we observe minimal overlap of factors across all interactomes (Figure 2A). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of all co-purifying factors displays enrichment of many transcription-related GO terms as well as RNA processing and chromatin organization (Figure 2B). Additionally, the phospho-CTD interactomes show enrichment for protein domains involved in chromatin regulation, RNA processing and in promoting protein-protein interactions (Figure 2C). Together these data indicate our approach isolates factors with functions in multiple transcriptional and co-transcriptional processes.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Pol II phospho-CTD interactomes contain unique sets of factors(A) Venn diagram of enriched factors from the interactome of each CTD phosphoisoform.(B) Gene ontology terms enriched in the phospho-CTD interactome data are plotted for each phosphoisoform.(C) Protein domains enriched in the phospho-CTD interactomes.

GO terms enriched in separate clusters, p-values for the significance of enrichment of each GO term, and representative factors in each cluster are indicated.We reasoned that proteins with similar phospho-CTD interaction profiles should have related roles in transcription. Pairwise correlation analysis between the phospho-CTD interaction profiles of all enriched factors followed by hierarchical clustering identifies distinct groups of factors (Figure 2D). We find that factors regulating transcription initiation and early transcriptional processes, such as mRNA capping, are highly correlated and are anti-correlated with factors enriched for 3\u2032 end processing of nascent RNA. Also, a majority of transcription elongation factors cluster together, revealing that proteins associated with the three major stages of transcription interact with Pol II in distinct modes with specific phospho-CTD states. These data demonstrate that the interactome of a phospho-CTD residue can be used to predict its function in transcription.CTD Thr4 and Rtt103 Transition Pol II to TerminationAs many functions have been attributed to the well-characterized CTD phosphoisoforms, Ser5P and Ser2P, we utilized the phospho-CTD interactome dataset to explore the lesser-studied Thr4P phosphoisoform. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis of the Pol II CTD demonstrated that Thr4P is a prevalent modification, possibly as abundant as Ser2P (Schuller et al., 2016; Suh et al., 2016). Purification of Pol II CTD Thr4P complexes was reproducibly efficient (95% average IP efficiency, Figure S1B) and mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant associations between Thr4P and a number of canonical transcription elongation factors (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the transcription termination factor Rtt103 was also enriched with Thr4P. Rtt103 is a CTD binding protein that functions with the exonuclease complex Rat1/Rai1 for termination of polyadenylated transcripts (Buratowski, 2005; Kim et al., 2004) and was recently demonstrated to interact with a CTD containing phosphorylated Thr4 (Suh et al, 2016). To decipher whether interaction of Rtt103 with Pol II complexes is a direct result of Thr4 phosphorylation we tested the ability of the Thr4P antisera to compete with Rtt103 for CTD binding. After purifying Pol II complexes using a FLAG epitope tag on the Rpb3 subunit, antisera directed against Thr4P, Ser2P, Ser5P, no antisera or FLAG peptide (as a positive elution control) was incubated in vast excess (>13 fold higher concentration compared to the IP reactions) with the purified complexes on beads. Supernatant and bead fractions were assayed by Western blot (Figure 3B). As expected, the Ser2P antisera were able to compete with Rtt103 for CTD binding (Kim et al., 2004), and the Ser5P antisera were not effective competition. Consistent with the mass spectrometry data, Thr4P antisera were also able to compete with Rtt103 binding, indicating both residues likely regulate the interaction between Rtt103 and the Pol II CTD.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Thr4P regulates Pol II dynamics during transcription termination(A) Volcano plot comparing Thr4P IPs to mock IPs.

A.U., arbitrary units.See also Figures S2 and S3.Surprisingly, the Rat1/Rai1 exonuclease complex was not enriched in the Thr4P interactome, leading us to postulate that Rtt103 and Rat1/Rai1 may regulate separate steps in the termination process. To test this hypothesis we used NET-seq, which maps actively transcribing Pol II complexes at nucleotide resolution genome-wide (Churchman and Weissman, 2011) and analyzed changes in Pol II density in rtt103\u0394 and rai1\u0394 deletion mutants after polyA sites. Aggregate analysis of wild-type NET-seq data around polyA sites reveals an increase in Pol II density just after polyA sites where 3\u2032 end cleavage occurs co-transcriptionally (Figure 3C, black line). Subsequent termination leads to a decrease in Pol II density before neighboring genes increase the signal again. Individual deletion of RAI1 and RTT103 caused widespread termination defects, albeit in very different ways (Figure 3C; Figure S2A). Loss of RAI1 (Figure 3C, green line) leads to a steady rise in Pol II density after polyA sites, indicating that transcription proceeds for much longer. In contrast, loss of RTT103 (Figure 3C and D, blue line) results in a pronounced peak of Pol II density directly after polyA sites precisely where Rtt103 occupancy peaks (Figure S2B) (Mayer et al., 2012). Furthermore, termination is not affected as Pol II density decreases normally thereafter, suggesting that instead Rtt103 binding regulates the onset of termination.As Rtt103 is enriched in the Thr4P interactome, we postulated that Thr4 aids Rtt103 in regulating Pol II. We mapped Thr4P genome-wide at near nucleotide resolution using exo-nuclease based ChIP-nexus (He et al., 2015), which revealed a peak of threonine-4 phosphorylation downstream of the polyA site, where the peak in Pol II density is observed in the rtt103\u0394 strain (Figure 3D purple line, and Figure S2B, D, E, F and G). Consistent with our detection of Rtt103 in the Thr4P interactome, the peak in Thr4P density overlaps with Rtt103 density (Figure S2B). To determine whether Thr4 controls 3\u2032 end cleavage and transcription termination, we replaced each Thr4 residue in the endogenous 26 CTD heptapeptide repeats with a valine residue (T4V1\u201326), representing a non-phosphorylatable state, and with a glutamic acid residue (T4E1\u201326), mimicking the constitutively phosphorylated state. The T4E1\u201326 mutant is lethal (Figure S3A), but the T4V1\u201326 mutant is viable, as observed previously (Rosonina et al., 2014), with a modest growth defect (15% increase in doubling time). NET-seq analysis at the 3\u2032 ends of genes demonstrates that the T4V1\u201326 strain has a similar post-polyA transcription defect as the rtt103\u0394 strain with a strong increase in Pol II density after polyA sites, at exactly the location where Thr4P peaks in occupancy (Figure 3D and S2A, red line). A less stringent and inducible T4V mutant was created by generating an allele of RPB1 that encodes a CTD where Thr4 of the first 8 repeats proximal to the Pol II core are mutated to valine (T4V1\u20138). By placing the endogenous RPB1 under control of a Tet-off promoter, introduction of doxycycline induces incorporation of the mutant CTD into the Pol II complex (Malagon et al., 2006; Morrill et al., 2016.). NET-seq analysis in this T4V1\u20138 mutant shows defects similar to the T4V1\u201326 mutant in post-polyA transcription (Figure S3B). RNA-seq analysis of the T4V1\u201326 strain shows a global downstream shift in the locations of polyA sites, consistent with a possibility of altered cleavage in this strain (Figure S3 C\u2013E). Importantly, no down-regulation of transcription elongation or RNA processing related gene classes was detected in either the T4V1\u201326 or rtt103\u0394 mutants (Table S3, Figures S2C, S6E). Together these data lead to a model by which both Ser2P and Thr4P recruit Rtt103 after polyA sites and indicate the presence of a post-polyA checkpoint controlled by Thr4 that ensures robust 3\u2032 end cleavage followed by an efficient transition to transcription termination. Moreover, these data illustrate how analysis of Pol II CTD interactomes reveals distinct roles for CTD modifications and their interacting factors.CTD Ser5P is Enriched for Spliceosomal Components While Thr4P is DepletedTo search for additional connections between Thr4P and RNA processing events, we compared the interactomes by complete-linkage hierarchical clustering. Interestingly, CTD phosphorylation marks with similar ChIP occupancy (Ser5P/Ser7P and Tyr1P/Ser2P) have interactomes that cluster together (Figure 4A), and the Thr4P interactome does not cluster with any other phospho-CTD interactome. A major feature separating the Thr4P interactome is the absence of enriched spliceosomal subunits (Figure 4B) while other phospho-CTD interactomes enrich for 8\u201318 spliceosomal subunits across five subcomplexes. In contrast, the Ser5P interactome is highly enriched for many components of the U1 spliceosomal complex, purifying nearly 70% of U1 associated proteins. To determine if U1 is associating through a protein-protein interaction with Ser5P we tested the ability of Ser5P antisera to displace U1 from purified Pol II complexes. Ser5P antisera were able to elute nearly half of the associated U1 from the CTD, while Thr4P antisera were unable to significantly compete with U1 binding (Figure 4C). These data suggest that U1 directly associates with Pol II in a Ser5P dependent manner. The difference in enrichment and interaction with the spliceosome between Ser5P and Thr4P suggest each phospho-modification may regulate different stages of splicing.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Phospho-CTD Interactomes Reveal Connection Between Pol II CTD Ser5P, Thr4P and Splicing(A) Complete linkage clustering of each Pol II phospho-CTD interactome.(B) Heatmap of splicing factors specifically enriched in each phospho-CTD Pol II interactome.(C) Western blot (top) and quantification (bottom) of the amount of Mud1 (U1) or Rpb3 eluted from purified Pol II complexes by phospho-CTD antisera (no Ab, Ser5P, Thr4P) or FLAG peptide.

Analysis of U1 and U2 occupancy by ChIP-nexus displays enrichment for spliced genes and matches lower-resolution profiles around the 3\u2032 splice site from U1 and U2 ChIP-chip data (Tardiff et al., 2006) (Figure S4A\u2013E). We observe high levels of U1 and U2 enrichment over spliced genes, and consistent with other studies, we observe low signal over unspliced genes (Figure S4D) (Kotovic et., 2003; Moore et al., 2006; Tardiff et al., 2006). Hierarchical clustering of the data based on U1 occupancy breaks spliceosome occupancy into two clear categories of high and low occupancy genes, which had been observed previously (Figure 5A and Table S4) (Tardiff et al., 2006). The high occupancy genes tend to be highly co-transcriptionally spliced and well expressed, to have longer introns and shorter terminal exons, and to encode ribosomal proteins (Figure S4F) (Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010). We focused our analysis on the high occupancy genes. The ChIP-nexus data resolves a rapid and sharp increase in U1 occupancy 10\u201330 base pairs (bps) downstream of the 3\u2032 splice site that remains high for 200 bps before decreasing (Figure 5B and C). Extending for almost 400 bps, U2 occupancy also increases sharply at the 3\u2032 splice site, albeit more slowly than U1, consistent with ordered spliceosomal assembly (Figure 5C, S4G) (Hoskins et al., 2011).Open in a separate windowFigure 5Pol II CTD Ser5P and Thr4P regulate spliceosome occupancy and splicing dynamics(A) Heatmap of normalized U1 (Mud1) and U2 (Lea1) ChIP occupancies around the 3\u2032 splice site (300 bps upstream and 1000 bps downstream) of non-overlapping intron-containing genes (See Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

R, Pearson correlation coefficient. (A\u2013C) ChIP-nexus reads for each gene are normalized by total reads for each gene in the analyzed region.See also Figures S4 and S5From our Pol II CTD interactomes, we postulated that Ser5P occupancy would mirror U1. ChIP-nexus analysis of Ser5P occupancy revealed a characteristic peak of enrichment near transcription start sites of coding genes (Figure S5A\u2013C). Interestingly, analysis around 3\u2032 splice sites of high U1 occupancy genes displays a sharp increase in Ser5P 10\u201330 bps downstream of the 3\u2032 splice site that persists for 200 bps, overlaying precisely with the U1 peak (Figure 5B and C). In contrast, Thr4P peaks late into the terminal exon, concomitant with low levels of Ser5P, U1 and U2 (Figure 5B and C). Interestingly, the peak of Thr4P in the terminal exon occurs just prior to polyA sites and is distinct from the peak of Thr4P after polyA sites (Figure 5B, C and S5D). The bimodal Thr4P profile around the polyA sites is not observed at unspliced genes where only a single peak occurs after polyA sites (Figure S2G). These trends can be observed through comparison of raw ChIP-nexus signal between U1 and Ser5P (Pearson correlation, r = 0.61) or Thr4P (Pearson correlation, r = \u22120.02) across terminal exons (Figure 5D, S5F). These data suggest that Ser5P recruits the spliceosome at the 3\u2032 splice site and that when the spliceosome dissociates, high levels of Thr4P are present. Importantly, U1 and U2 occupancy profiles are not altered in the T4V1\u201326 mutant (Figure S5E) suggesting that Thr4 does not cause the dissociation of the spliceosome, and that instead high levels of Thr4P act as a mark of spliceosome release.The increase in Ser5P and rapid recruitment of U1 at the 3\u2032 splice site are coincident with a previously proposed splicing checkpoint involving Ser5P and Pol II pausing around the 3\u2032 splice site (Alexander et al., 2010; Chathoth et al., 2014). Furthermore, pausing has been observed elsewhere at spliced genes in yeast (Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010). However, these studies have been limited by low resolution or indirect methods to detect transcriptional pausing. We analyzed NET-seq profiles of high-occupancy genes around the 3\u2032 splice site (3\u2032 SS) in an effort to resolve putative splicing checkpoints at nucleotide resolution. Analysis by NET-seq revealed highly reproducible patterns of Pol II pausing at intron-exon junctions as well as increased Pol II density over exons similar to earlier observations in yeast and in human cells (Figures 6A, B and S5G) (Alexander et al., 2010; Jonkers et al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2015; Veloso et al., 2014). Splicing intermediates, such as lariats, are known contaminants in NET-seq data, so the precise nucleotide position where their 3\u2032 ends align are removed from analysis, resulting in a single nucleotide gap. In order to determine whether the remaining signal upstream and downstream of the 3\u2032 SS are due to lariats from missplicing events, we sequenced total nascent RNA in order to analyze the abundance of alternative splicing junctions. Greater than 99% of transcripts are correctly spliced (Figure S5H), strongly indicating that the NET-seq signal around the 3\u2032 SS is due to Pol II pausing. Moreover, pausing at the 3\u2032 SS is observed uniformly across spliced genes with high U1 recruitment (Figure 6A). Together these data suggest coordination between Pol II dynamics, Ser5 phosphorylation and recruitment of the spliceosome during a splicing checkpoint at the 3\u2032 splice site.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Pol II CTD Thr4 regulates post-transcriptional splicing(A) Heatmap of normalized NET-seq reads around the 3\u2032 splice site of high U1 occupancy genes.(B) Normalized average NET-seq reads of around the 3\u2032 splice site of high U1 occupancy genes. NET-seq reads for each gene are normalized by total reads for each gene in the analyzed region. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. Splicing intermediates are contaminants in NET-seq data, so the precise 1 bp positions where they align are removed from analysis and lead to a gap in the Pol II density profiles.

Two metrics were used to determine co-transcriptionally spliced reads: Fraction spliced, which calculates the fraction of spliced reads by dividing the number of spliced reads by the total number of reads (spliced + unspliced) spanning the 3\u2032 splice site and 3\u2032 splice site coverage which uses the ratio of intron to exon coverage in a region spanning 25 bp up or downstream of the 3\u2032 splice site and subtracting this value from 1. Top: diagrams depicting the fraction spliced and 3\u2032 splice site metrics. Error bars represent standard deviation.(E) Distribution of the increase in intron retention in the T4V1\u201326 CTD mutant vs WT cells for two biological replicates (n= 107 and 108 genes). Genes included in the analysis contained reliably quantifiable intron coverage as determined by RNA standards in both samples (Figure S6B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures).See also Figures S5 and S6.We reasoned that if Ser5P is responsible for the rapid and precise recruitment of U1 directly following 3\u2032 splice sites, then a loss of Ser5 would disrupt splicing. As complete loss of Ser5 is lethal, we created an allele of the RPB1 gene that encodes the CTD where Ser5 of the first 8 repeats proximal to the Pol II core are mutated to alanine (S5A1\u20138), similar to the T4V1\u20138 strain. We also constructed similar alleles for Ser2 (S2A1\u20138) and for Ser7 (S7A1\u20138). Here the endogenous RPB1 is again controlled by a Tet-off promoter, and we investigated the splicing phenotype in total RNA of these strains as well as the T4V1\u20138 strain after exposing the cells to doxycycline. RT-qPCR analysis of splice junctions revealed that in contrast to S2A1\u20138 and S7A1\u20138, both S5A1\u20138 and T4V1\u20138 lead to intron retention at the RPL34B gene (Figure S6A), demonstrating the functional importance of Ser5P for efficient splicing, presumably through the recruitment of U1.Thr4 is Responsible for Efficient Post-transcriptional Splicing Genome-wideThe pre-polyA peak of Thr4P specifically at spliced genes, a lack of enriched spliceosomal subunits in the Thr4P interactome and the splicing defect observed in the T4V1\u20138 strain lead us to postulate that Thr4 has a role in splicing. The splicing defect caused by the T4V1\u20138 mutation is likely to be a modest phenotype as there are still 18 wild type repeats. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis of the T4V1\u201326 strain revealed a much stronger splicing defect at 5 genes (Figure 6C). To ask whether the splicing defect arises co-transcriptionally, we generated nascent RNA-seq data for WT and T4V1\u201326 cells. Using two different metrics, we show that 73% of transcripts are co-transcriptionally spliced, consistent with previous reports, with no difference between WT and T4V1\u201326 cells (Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010) (Figure 6D). Consistently, we observe no defect in the co-transcriptional recruitment of U1 or U2 in the T4V1\u201326 strain (Figure S5E). We next considered whether post-transcriptional splicing is globally impacted by a replacement of Thr4 with valine by performing total RNA-seq. The inclusion of RNA standards allowed for an accurate and quantitative measure of intron retention genome-wide (Figure S6B\u2013E). Comparison of T4V1\u201326 and wild type strains reveal 90% of spliced genes have increased intron retention in the T4V1\u201326 strain and that 38% display a greater than two-fold increase (Figure 6E, and S6F\u2013H). Importantly, no down-regulation of transcription elongation, splicing, RNA processing or RNA turnover related gene classes was detected (Table S3). Furthermore, a re-analysis of RNA-seq data from a T4V mutant reported in Rosonina et al also reveals a splicing defect (Rosonina et al., 2014) (Figure S6I). Thus Thr4 does not impact co-transcriptional splicing, and is instead a critical residue for ensuring efficient splicing post-transcriptionally. DiscussionTranscription elongation proceeds through multiple stages, marked by distinct CTD phosphorylation patterns and by the set of factors regulating Pol II to coordinate co-transcriptional processes. Here we combined phospho-specific CTD Pol II purification with quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the interactomes of each phospho-CTD residue. Importantly, we observe minimal overlap of factors across phospho-CTD interactomes, emphasizing the unique roles of each phosphorylation mark. The interactomes reveal the complement of factors interacting with Pol II throughout transcription elongation, and will serve as a resource for future studies on the regulation of transcription and co-transcriptional processes.The Ser5P and Ser2P modifications have been studied extensively, but recent studies have demonstrated that all the phospho-modifications of the CTD can regulate the transcription process (Descostes et al., 2014; Egloff et al., 2007; Hintermair et al., 2012; Hsin et al., 2011, 2014a, 2014b; Mayer et al., 2012; Rosonina et al., 2014). Furthermore, our work and that of others suggest that factors interact with Pol II in a highly regulated manner requiring multiple inputs (presence or absence of particular CTD phosphorylation marks, cis-acting elements in the nascent RNA, etc.) (Kim et al., 2004; Komarnitsky et al., 2000; Lacadie et al., 2005, 2006; Licatalosi et al., 2001; McCracken et al., 1997; Mayer et al., 2010, 2012; Moore et al., 2006; Schwer and Shuman 2011; Suh et al., 2016). For example, Ser2P and the lack of Tyr1P are proposed to facilitate the localization of Rtt103 to Pol II (Mayer et al., 2012). Here we describe Thr4P as an additional input to this process. Our data are consistent with a model whereby Thr4 phosphorylation aids the recruitment of Rtt103 to the transcription elongation complex, followed by a Rtt103/Thr4 regulated release of Pol II from a region of pausing after polyA sites (Figure 7). These results raise the possibility that Pol II slows transcription until the arrival of Rtt103 and the onset of termination. Thus Thr4 joins Tyr1 and Ser2 in facilitating the precise and timely association of Rtt103 with the transcription elongation complex, indicating that the \u201cCTD code\u201d includes intricate CTD phosphorylation combinations to orchestrate the connections between transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Interestingly, the recruitment of Rtt103 may be even more complicated as we also observe a strong enrichment for Rtt103 with Pol II CTD Ser7P (Table S1).Open in a separate windowFigure 7Coupling of transcription to RNA processing by Ser5P and Thr4PModel displaying how Ser5 and Thr4 phosphorylation coordinates the pausing of Pol II the at the 3\u2032 splice site (1), recruitment of the splicing machinery (2), completion of splicing and release of the splicoesome (3), pausing for 3\u2032 end processing and recruitment of Rtt103 (4) and the transition from 3\u2032 end processing to termination (5).Our data reveal that the coupling of transcription to splicing is also controlled by multiple inputs, revealing CTD Ser5 and Thr4 as being critical links between transcription and splicing. Our analyses suggest a model in which after Pol II releases from a 3\u2032 splice site pause, the U1 spliceosomal subcomplex is rapidly recruited to Pol II through physical interaction with Ser5P. U2 subsequently associates, which presumably leads to co-transcriptional splicing (Figure 7). Interestingly, Mud1 (U1) does not co-localize with the canonical Ser5P peak at the 5\u2032 end of all genes, indicating that Ser5P is not sufficient for U1 recruitment. Certainly known interactions between U1 and the nascent RNA likely serve as additional inputs to ensure proper localization (Lacadie et al., 2005). After 3\u2032 splice sites, Thr4P levels increase steadily and peak after U1 and U2. These occupancy data and the lack of spliceosomal subunits in the Thr4P interactome suggest that high levels of Thr4P is a mark of spliceosomal release. Interestingly, we observe that Thr4 is strongly connected to post-transcriptional splicing, but how is this mediated? A modest peak of spliceosome recruitment occurs after polyA sites where both U1 and U2 are simultaneously re-recruited (Figure S5D). As links between splicing, 3\u2032 end processing and termination have been described (Albulescu et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2011) an intriguing possibility is that Thr4 coordinates the commitment to post-transcriptional splicing during 3\u2032 end processing and termination. In sum, the phospho-specific Pol II interactomes transform our understanding of critical co-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms through disentangling the complex interactions of CTD phosphorylation and regulatory factors. Experimental ProceduresCTD ImmunoprecipitationYeast cultures grown to mid-log phase in YPD were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized by a ball-bearing mixer mill (Retsch MM400). 1 gm of grindate was resuspended in 5 mL of 1X lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mM KOAc, 0.5 Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mM MnCl2, 8 U mL\u22121 RNasin (Promega), 1X cOmplete EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1X PhosSTOP (Roche)). 660 U of RQ1 DNase (Promega) was added and lysate was incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 xg for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was added to 500 \u03bcL of ANTI-FLAG M2 affnity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr. IPs were washed 3X for 5 min at 4\u00b0C with 10 mL of 1X wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mM KOAc, 0.5 Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 8 U mL\u22121 RNasin, 1 mM EDTA), and eluted (2x) in 300 \u03bcL of 2 mg/mL 3X FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich). Elutions were combined, 100 \u03bcL of eluet was used for mass spectrometry analysis. For phospho-CTD IPs, 250 \u03bcL of the combined elution was added to magnetic beads covalently coupled to 33 \u03bcg of phospho-specific CTD antibodies (Active Motif; Ser5P, 3E8 (61085); Ser7P, 4E12 (61087); Ser2P, 3E10 (61083); Tyr1P, 3D12 (61383); Thr4P, 6D7 (61361)), or 33 \u03bcg of mCherry rat monoclonal antibody (Life Technologies, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"M11217\",\"term_id\":\"333925\"}}M11217) for mock IPs and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Samples were then washed 3X by pipetting and one time by rotating for 5 min in 1 mL of wash buffer at 4\u00b0C. and eluted using 0.1M Gly pH 2.NET-seq and nascent RNA-seqNET-seq growth conditions, IPs, and isolation of nascent RNA and library construction were carried out as described in (Churchman and Weissman, 2012). NET-seq linker ligation was done directly to the 3\u2032 end of isolated nascent RNA. For nascent RNA-seq the RNA was fragmented followed by dephosphorylation and linker ligation. Libraries were then subjected to 3\u2032 end sequencing.RNA-seqTotal RNA from mid-log yeast cultures was harvested using standard hot phenol-chloroform extraction technique. ERCC RNA standard mix 1 (Life Technologies) was added and rRNA was depleted using the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA removal kit for yeast (Illumina). Library generation was carried out according to the procedure in (Churchman and Weissman, 2012) followed by 3\u2032 end sequencing.ChIP-nexusMethods to adapt ChIP-nexus to yeast were obtained through personal communication from Stephen Doris and Fred Winston and will be published elsewhere. Library generation was carried out as described in He et al., 2015.Mass Spectrometry AnalysisTCA precipitated samples were separated on 12% acrylamide gels, extracted and submitted to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School for analysis. All mass spectrometry data analysis was done using the Perseus software (Hubner and Mann, 2011; Hubner et al., 2010). Summed MS1 intensities for the triplicate IPs was loaded into Perseus along with the respective mock control dataset. Datasets were log2 transformed and filtered for proteins present in all three specific or mock IPs. Missing values were imputed and data were normalized by median subtraction. Enriched proteins were defined using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05.Processing and Alignment of Sequencing DataNET-seq and RNA-seq Reads were trimmed and aligned using TopHat2 and library generation artifacts removed. For NET-seq the 5\u2032 end of the sequencing, which corresponds to the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA fragment, is recorded with a custom python script using HTSeq package. For RNA-seq and nascent RNA-seq the same script was used, this time recording the entire read. NET-seq and nascent RNA-seq data are normalized by million mapped reads. Positions of splicing intermediates in NET-seq data are removed from analysis. ChIP-nexus reads are selected for the fixed barcode, trimmed and aligned using Bowtie. Plus and minus strand coverage are combined and the 5\u2032 end of the sequencing read is recorded and normalized by the spike-in, corresponding to the number of mapped S. pombe reads.Gene Expression and Intron Retention AnalysisAll RNA-seq reads were normalized using ERCC RNA standards mix 1 (Life Technologies) by the number of 104 uniquely mapping ERCC reads. For gene expression analysis the reads per gene were calculated for genes that were expressed in at least one replicate in either the WT or T4V strains. For intron retention analysis the normalized reads per length, in Kb (RPK), was calculated for each intron and exon in non-overlapping spliced genes as well as spliced genes where overlap did not occur on the same strand. To determine which RPK values could be reliably quantified the concentration of ERCC standards was plotted against the RPK scores for the ERCC standards in each library (Figure S5A). For intron retention analysis only those genes with intron and exon RPK values greater than 75 in both WT and T4V samples were analyzed.Metagene AnalysisNET-seq and ChIP-nexus reads from wild type or mutant strains were scored around the TSS, polyA and the 3\u2032 splice sites of non-overlapping genes in 1bp bins using the deepTools program. The TSS and polyA average profiles were calculated using a sliding window of 25 bp for non-overlapping protein coding genes with an RPKM > 10 in the WT NET-seq data and are at least 500 bp long. For average profiles around the 3\u2032 splice site high occupancy non-overlapping spliced genes as well as spliced genes where overlap did not occur on the same strand were analyzed.RT-qPCRYeast was cultured and RNA extracted as described in RNA-seq methods. For CTD1\u20138 mutants cells were grown in SC-leu media containing 2% glucose and 50 \u03bcg/mL doxycycline (Clontech). Total RNA was harvested using standard hot phenol-chloroform extraction methods, ethanol precipitated, and DNase treated using RQ1 DNase (Promega). cDNA was then generated from gene specific RT primers using SuperScript III (Life Sciences). qPCR was done using SSoFast Supermix from Biorad and carried out on a Biorad CFX384 Real-Time System with a C1000 Theromycylcer.Antibody Competition AssayPol II was immunopurified as described above. Samples were split into 5 aliquots of 200 \u03bcL each. To each sample 100 \u03bcL of wash buffer containing 0 or 20ug of phospho-CTD antibody or 100 \u03bcL of 2 mg/mL FLAG peptide was added. Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by centrifugation to collect the beads. The beads (B) and supernatant (S) fractions were then analyzed by Western blot.Statistical MethodsP-values for mass spectrometry analysis, antibody competition assays and qPCR data were calculated using two-sample, two-tailed t-tests. FDRs in volcano plot analysis were calculated using a permutation based FDR for each dataset. P-value in Figure S3E was calculated using a paired two-sample t-test. P-values for GO term enrichment were obtained from GO term finder at the Saccharomyces Genome Database website. P-values comparing protein domain enrichment were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test.
