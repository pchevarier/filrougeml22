In any given cell type, while PcG proteins maintain stable silencing at a certain subset of genes, other PcG target genes are capable of being activated in the presence of the appropriate stimulus. Thus, by conferring both stability and plasticity upon the transcriptome, PcG proteins bestow competence upon the cells to respond to varied stimuli over their lifetime, in order to maintain cellular homoeostasis [2]. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable PcG-regulated loci to dynamically switch between ON and OFF states remain elusive.In Drosophila, the targeting of PcG proteins to chromatin occurs mainly through the recognition of cis-regulatory elements, known as Polycomb group response elements (PREs), by Pleiohomeotic (Pho) and other DNA-binding proteins [3, 4]. Pho interacts with dSfmbt to form the Pho repressive complex (PhoRC), which acts as a recruitment platform for the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) [5, 6]. Subsequently, PRC1 and PRC2 generate a chromatin structure that is incompatible with gene expression, through their enzymatic and chromatin compaction activities [7, 8]. The transcriptionally silent state is then faithfully inherited through cell division, which involves PRE-dependent mechanisms [9, 10]. Although the mechanisms by which PcG proteins establish and maintain stable silencing at their targets have been subject to intense investigation, little is known about PcG-mediated regulation of target genes with dynamic expression patterns.In this study, we employed the heat shock-responsive hsp70 gene in Drosophila as a model to study dynamic gene regulation by PcG proteins (Additional file 1: Figure S1a). The hsp70 locus is an attractive inducible gene model as it is targeted by PRC1 [11]. It is regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation by promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II pausing [12]. At normal growth temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C), RNA polymerase II is maintained in the paused state by the DSIF complex (composed of Spt4\u2013Spt5) and the NELF complex [13, 14]. The heat shock stimulus leads to the recruitment of the transcription factor, HSF, to chromatin [15]. This is followed by the recruitment of P-TEFb, which phosphorylates Spt5 and converts it to function as a positive elongation factor [16, 17]. This leads to rapid up-regulation of the hsp70 locus in response to the heat stress [18].While the transcriptional response and the chromatin dynamics at the hsp70 locus have been well characterised in the acute phase of the heat shock response, the effect of the withdrawal of the activating stimulus on the transcription and chromatin dynamics remains poorly understood [18]. By following the chromatin dynamics of PRC1 and Pho during the recovery phase of the heat shock, we sought to dissect the role of these two factors in the re-establishment of silencing at the hsp70 locus. Pho was previously found to co-localise with RNA polymerase II upon heat shock [19]. Furthermore, Pho interacts with Spt5 [20], and Spt5 is involved in both, promoter-proximal pausing and transcriptional elongation [21]. We thus asked whether the conversion of Spt5 from a pausing factor into an elongation factor upon gene activation and its interaction with Pho could mechanistically explain the spreading of Pho in the body of active genes. Genetic analyses revealed the necessity of Pho gene function in the re-establishment of silencing at the hsp70 locus in the absence of the activating stimulus [19]. We tested the hypothesis whether Pho could dynamically interact with repressors (PRC1 via dSfmbt) and activators (Spt5) during the heat shock response and the significance of its dynamic protein\u2013protein interactions on transcriptional regulation of the hsp70 locus.By combining multiple read-outs, we identified a role for the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction between Pho and Spt5 in the transcriptional regulation of the hsp70 locus. Our results highlight how a dynamic interaction switch between PcG proteins and an elongation factor could facilitate PcG-regulated genes, which are responsive to inductive signals, to efficiently switch between ON/OFF states. ResultsAntagonistic binding patterns of HSF and PRC1 at the hsp70 locusTo characterise the transcriptional and chromatin dynamics of the heat shock response, we focused on the binding kinetics of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), HSF and Polyhomeotic (Ph, a component of PRC1) at the hsp70 locus using Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells. Our analysis revealed a rapid increase in hsp70 transcripts immediately upon heat shock, followed by a steady decrease in mRNA levels as the locus is re-repressed, during the recovery phase in the absence of the heat shock stimulus (Fig.\u00a01b). We investigated the binding dynamics of two forms of Pol II, the unphosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) form and the hyperphosphorylated (S2P) form of Pol II, at the promoter-proximal region and within the gene body of the hsp70 locus, respectively. We detected a rapid increase in both forms of Pol II at the promoter-proximal region and within the gene body of the hsp70 locus upon heat shock (Fig.\u00a01c, d). This was accompanied by a decrease in Pol II binding levels at the Act42A gene (Additional file 2: Figure S2a, b), which is in accordance with the previously described phenomenon of the global decrease in Pol II levels genome-wide in Drosophila upon heat shock [22]. However, levels of bound Pol II at the hsp70 locus steadily decreased as the cells recovered from the heat shock, with the locus returning to the paused state 90\u00a0min into the recovery phase (Fig.\u00a01c, d). In contrast, Pol II binding at the Act42A gene increased over the recovery phase, indicating that the cells resumed a normal transcriptional programme within 90\u00a0min of the heat shock stimulus (Additional file 2: Figure S2a, b).\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a01Antagonistic binding patterns of HSF and PRC1 at the hsp70 locus. a Experimental scheme used throughout the study to measure the dynamics of mRNA/nascent RNA production, chromatin binding patterns of proteins and protein\u2013protein interactions during the heat shock response. S2 DRSC cells were heat shocked at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min and thereafter allowed to recover from the heat shock at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for up to 90\u00a0min. At time points indicated in the scheme, cells were harvested and used for the following experimental procedures: mRNA quantification, ChIP-qPCR, co-IP and nascent RNA quantification. b Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection of hsp70 transcript levels during the heat shock response detailed in a.

Statistical significance was determined by performing a paired two-tailed t test, **P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01, *P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05 and ns\u00a0=\u00a0non-significantHSF binding is critical to release paused Pol II into productive elongation at the hsp70 locus [23]. In agreement, we detected a rapid increase in HSF binding upon heat shock followed by steady decrease as the cells recovered from the heat shock (Fig.\u00a01e). Thus, the chromatin binding dynamic of Pol II and HSF during the heat shock response was similar, emphasising a role for HSF binding at chromatin for the transcriptional activation of the hsp70 locus [23].Recent ChIP-seq studies in Drosophila and mammalian cell lines have revealed PRC1 binding at genes regulated by paused Pol II, leading to the hypothesis that PRC1 could regulate paused genes [11, 24, 25]. We, therefore, assessed the binding dynamics of Ph during the heat shock response. In keeping with PRC1\u2019s role as a repressor, Ph occupancy at the hsp70 locus decreased significantly upon activation. However, as the locus recovered from the heat shock and occupancy of Pol II and HSF decreased, Ph binding to chromatin was steadily restored to pre-activation levels (Fig.\u00a01f).Taken together, these results reveal an antagonism between HSF and Ph (PRC1) for occupancy at the hsp70 locus.Co-localisation of Pleiohomeotic (Pho) and Pol II at the heat shock locus is independent of transcriptional elongationWe confirmed the previously identified co-localisation of Pho with Pol II at active genes by co-staining these factors on polytene chromosomes from larval salivary glands. Pho and Pol II co-localised at the majority of bands under basal conditions (Fig.\u00a02a). Upon heat shock, Pol II binding was most prominent at the heat shock puffs (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, Pol II signal intensity decreased outside the heat shock loci, in accordance with a genome-wide decrease in Pol II occupancy upon heat shock (Fig.\u00a02b). Interestingly, we observed a striking co-localisation of Pho and Pol II at all activated heat shock genes (Fig.\u00a02b).\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a02Co-localisation of Pleiohomeotic (Pho) and RNA polymerase II at the heat shock loci upon activation is independent of transcriptional elongation. a\u2013d Double polytene immunostaining for RNA polymerase II (green) and Pho (magenta) under control, HS (heat shock), FP (flavopiridol) control and FP HS (flavopiridol\u00a0+\u00a0heat shock), respectively.

Data information: In e, f, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM for n\u00a0=\u00a02To determine whether this co-localisation is dependent upon transcription, we blocked transcriptional elongation by treatment with flavopiridol, a P-TEFb inhibitor, prior to heat shock [26]. The striking overlap in binding patterns of Pho and Pol II was not perturbed by flavopiridol treatment, suggesting that the interaction between these two factors could occur independently of transcriptional elongation (Fig.\u00a02c). Furthermore, inhibition of P-TEFb followed by heat shock resulted in a marked decrease in the size of the heat shock puffs (Fig.\u00a02d) and strongly reduced hsp70 transcript levels (Additional file 3: Figure S3d). However, co-localisation of Pho and Pol II was not perturbed by flavopiridol (Fig.\u00a02d). This result indicated that the co-localisation between Pho and Pol II was intact during the paused state as well as during the elongation phase of the transcriptional cycle. It is conceivable that Pho might co-localise with the paused form of Pol II. However, we found it intriguing that a DNA-binding protein like Pho was also capable of co-localising with actively elongating Pol II at chromatin. In order to understand whether the interaction between Pho and elongating Pol II was dependent upon the DNA-binding activity of Pho, we employed native ChIP (N-ChIP) qPCR to measure the occupancy levels of Pho over the time course detailed in Fig.\u00a01a. We employed N-ChIP over formaldehyde cross-linked ChIP to measure the occupancy levels of Pho since N-ChIP only detects proteins that are associated with chromatin due to their direct interaction with DNA [27]. Indeed, while Pho was bound at the hsp70 locus under control conditions, its occupancy decreased upon heat shock. However, as the cells recovered from the heat shock, the binding of Pho to the hsp70 locus via DNA was restored (Additional file 3: Figure S3a). This suggested that the association of Pho to chromatin upon heat shock cannot be explained by its DNA-binding ability and could possibly be due to a protein\u2013protein interaction with RNA Pol II or an elongation factor.Previous observations established that flavopiridol treatment leads to considerable decrease in mature hsp70 transcript production, even though the density of Pol II in the gene body remains normal [28]. We have now shown that chromatin binding levels of Ph, a component of PRC1, anti-correlate with mature hsp70 transcript levels (Fig.\u00a01f). Thus, we hypothesised that HSF recruitment in the presence of flavopiridol could be used to uncouple its effect on the occupancy of Ph at chromatin from the production of mature hsp70 transcripts.We, therefore, examined the consequence of flavopiridol treatment on the binding of PRC1 at the hsp70 locus. We treated cells with flavopiridol prior to heat shock (hereafter referred to as FP\u00a0+\u00a0HS) followed by ChIP-qPCR. In agreement with previous observations, flavopiridol treatment led to a significant decrease in S2P Pol II levels in the hsp70 gene body upon heat shock (Additional file 3: Figure S3c), whereas unphosphorylated Pol II and HSF binding levels were not perturbed (Additional file 3: Figure S3b and Fig.\u00a02e). Ph binding at the hsp70 locus decreased under FP\u00a0+\u00a0HS conditions, once again demonstrating that HSF and PRC1 binding patterns are mutually exclusive at the hsp70 locus (Fig.\u00a02e, f).These data revealed that the co-localisation between Pho and Pol II was intact during the paused as well as during the elongation phase of the transcriptional cycle. Interestingly, while Pho continued to localise at the hsp70 locus upon heat shock, Ph (PRC1) was evicted from the locus. We, thus, concluded that HSF binding could be capable of disrupting the ability of Pho to recruit PRC1 at the hsp70 locus.Pho dynamically interacts with Spt5 and dSfmbtSince we determined that the co-localisation of Pho and Pol II at the hsp70 locus upon activation was independent of the DNA-binding ability of Pho, we hypothesised that this observation could possibly be explained by the reported genetic and biochemical interaction between Pho and Spt5 [20]. We also determined by ChIP-qPCR that chromatin occupancy of Spt5 does not change dramatically over the time course detailed in Fig.\u00a01a (Additional file 4: Figure S4a). In order to gain mechanistic insight into the significance of the interaction between Pho and Spt5, we sought to identify the amino acid residues in Pho that mediate the protein\u2013protein interaction with Spt5. Pho exhibits a modular structure with its protein\u2013protein interaction domains localised in the N-terminus and its DNA-binding property ascribed to the Zn-finger domains in the C-terminus [5, 29, 30]. To identify putative Spt5-interacting regions of Pho, we searched for evolutionary conserved functional domain(s) by performing a multiple protein alignment between Pho and YY1, the mouse and human homologue of Pho. The Zn-finger domains in Pho and YY1 showed a high degree of conservation in the multiple protein alignment (Fig.\u00a03a). However, a second stretch of amino acids, located in the N-terminus of Pho, also showed conservation with YY1 in the multiple protein alignment (Fig.\u00a03a). This region mapped to a domain known as the Pho spacer region [5], and its homologous region within YY1 is known as the Recruitment of Polycomb (REPO) as it was shown to be necessary and sufficient for PcG-mediated repression in Drosophila [31].\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a03Pho interacts dynamically with Spt5 and dSfmbt. a Multiple protein alignment between Pho and YY1, the mouse and human homologue of Pho.

S2 DRSC cells were either maintained at normal growth temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) or heat shocked at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, cell lysates were used for pull-downs using an anti-FLAG antibody and were later probed by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. MW\u00a0=\u00a0molecular weight in kDaWe hypothesised that the REPO domain of Pho could be involved in mediating its protein\u2013protein interaction with Spt5. To test this hypothesis, we generated two mutant constructs with the aim of disrupting the structure of the REPO domain [5] and analysed the effect of the mutation on the protein\u2013protein interactions of Pho by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). The first construct, PhoV164D, contained a point mutation resulting in a valine (a hydrophobic amino acid residue) to aspartic acid (a hydrophilic amino acid residue) substitution to interfere with its ability to contact hydrophobic surfaces, while the second construct, \u0394REPO, carried a 66-nucleotide deletion in the REPO domain [5] (Fig.\u00a03b).In agreement with previous findings, both mutant Pho constructs were incapable of interacting with dSfmbt [5] (Fig.\u00a03c). However, both mutant Pho constructs also significantly impaired the interaction between Pho and Spt5, indicating that the REPO domain represents an interaction surface with multiple protein interaction partners (Fig.\u00a03d). Next, we sought to explain the residual interaction between Pho and Spt5 in the mutant background using different N-terminal and C-terminal Pho constructs (1-351a.a N-Pho, 1-200a.a N-Pho, 173-351a.a N-Pho, 351-520a.a C-Pho). Our analysis revealed that in addition to the REPO domain containing N-terminal fragments of Pho, the C-terminus of Pho could also interact with Spt5, thus explaining the residual interaction in the absence of a functional REPO domain (Additional file 4: Figure S4c). In contrast, the Pho\u2013dSfmbt interaction was solely dependent on the REPO domain (Additional file 4: Figure S4b). In conclusion, the REPO domain facilitated the interaction of Pho with dSfmbt (a PcG protein) as well as with Spt5 (a transcription elongation factor). These data led us to hypothesise that the protein\u2013protein interactions of Pho might be dynamic under ON/OFF transcriptional states.To test this hypothesis, we performed co-IPs of Pho\u2013Spt5 and Pho\u2013dSfmbt under control and heat shock conditions. Upon heat shock, we observed a considerable increase in the interaction between Pho and Spt5 and a concomitant reduction in the interaction between Pho and dSfmbt, which was stronger in non-stimulated cells (Fig.\u00a03e and Additional file 4: Figure S4d). As a negative control, we tested whether the interaction between Spt4 and Spt5 is also dynamic upon heat shock. However, the interaction between Spt4 and Spt5 appeared stable under control and heat shock conditions (Fig.\u00a03e). Thus, our co-IP experiments support the view that Pho can dynamically interact with Spt5 and dSfmbt depending upon the transcriptional state of the hsp70 locus.Next, we tested whether the dynamic protein\u2013protein interactions of Pho recapitulated the dynamic chromatin binding patterns of activators and repressors during the heat shock response. To this end, we analysed Pho\u2013Spt5 and Pho\u2013dSfmbt interactions during the heat shock response. Interestingly, the Pho\u2013Spt5 interaction followed the Pol II and HSF (activator) binding dynamic. In contrast, the interaction between Pho and dSfmbt closely resembled the dynamic exhibited by Ph (PRC1, repressor) (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013d). This result suggested the possibility of a relationship between the chromatin binding dynamic of HSF and the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction of Pho with an activator (Spt5).\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a04Pho preferentially interacts with Spt5 and dSfmbt during the active and silencing phase, respectively, of the heat shock response. a, c co-IP assays of S2 DRSC cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged dSfmbt or Spt5 (FLAG-dSfmbt, FLAG-Spt5) and HA-tagged Pho (HA-Pho).

We, thus, relied on heat shock-independent ways to recruit HSF to chromatin.HSF is canonically chaperoned by Hsp90, which prevents it from trimerising and assuming its active conformation [32]. However, Hsp90 inhibition by radicicol triggers HSF to acquire its active confirmation through trimerisation, thus binding to its cognate site in the hsp70 locus and causing transcriptional activation. We confirmed both recruitment of HSF to the hsp70 locus by ChIP-qPCR and transcriptional activation of the locus upon radicicol treatment (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Interestingly, the interaction between Pho and Spt5 was enhanced by Hsp90 inhibition (Fig.\u00a05c, d). Therefore, we set out to decouple this increase in interaction from the transcriptional activation of the hsp70 locus by recruiting HSF under conditions that caused little or no transcription from the hsp70 locus.\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a05HSF recruitment to chromatin is necessary and sufficient for the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction between Pho and Spt5. a ChIP-qPCR measurements for the occupancy levels of HSF at the hsp70 locus in S2 DRSC cells upon HS (heat shock), radicicol, FP\u00a0+\u00a0HS (flavopiridol\u00a0+\u00a0heat shock) and Na Sal (Sodium Salicylate) treatment conditions, respectively.

Distance of the location of the primers used from the hsp70 TSS is +\u00a01492\u00a0bp and has been depicted in the form of a cartoon below the data figure. Data information: In a and b, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM for n\u00a0=\u00a02, while in e, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM for n\u00a0=\u00a03Upon flavopiridol treatment followed by heat shock (FP\u00a0+\u00a0HS), HSF was recruited to the hsp70 locus, but inhibition of P-TEFb led to a significant decrease in hsp70 transcript levels (Fig.\u00a05a, b). However, under FP\u00a0+\u00a0HS conditions, the interaction between Pho and Spt5 was still enhanced (Fig.\u00a05c, d). Treatment with sodium salicylate has also been shown to recruit HSF to chromatin without affecting transcription from the hsp70 locus [33]. While HSF was robustly recruited to chromatin upon sodium salicylate treatment, hsp70 transcript levels remained unchanged when compared to the control condition (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Upon sodium salicylate treatment, the interaction between Pho and Spt5 was, also, increased (Fig.\u00a05c, d). We could, thus, uncouple the increase in interaction between Pho and Spt5 upon HSF recruitment from transcriptional activation. Next, we tested whether HSF binding was also necessary for this interaction switch between Pho and Spt5 by RNAi-mediated knockdown of HSF. By knocking down HSF, the dynamic nature of the Pho\u2013Spt5 protein\u2013protein interaction was undetectable when compared to the control LacZ RNAi condition (Fig.\u00a05e, f).Thus, by performing gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we could establish that recruitment of HSF to chromatin is necessary and sufficient for the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction switch between Pho and Spt5.In order to confirm that the protein\u2013protein interaction between Pho and Spt5 was independent of the DNA-binding ability of Pho, we performed a co-IP between Pho and Spt5 under DNase I conditions. Indeed, we could confirm that the interaction as well as the dynamic switch between Pho and Spt5 was independent of DNA (Additional file 5: Figure S5a). We further went on to confirm the DNA-independent nature of the Pho\u2013Spt5 interaction by performing a co-IP between N-Pho (lacking the DNA-binding Zn-finger domains) and Spt5 (Additional file 5: Figure S5b). However, we did observe dependence for the dynamic interaction switch between Pho and Spt5 on RNA binding (Additional file 5: Figure S5a). This observation is in line with our conclusion that HSF is necessary and sufficient for the dynamic interaction switch between Pho and Spt5 since HSF binding can trigger release of paused RNA Pol II leading to the production of nascent RNA transcripts [23]. Furthermore, the KOW4-5 domain of Spt5 has been shown to be capable of binding RNA and thereby influence the position of paused RNA Pol II [34].Absence of a functional REPO domain disrupts the transcriptional kinetics of the hsp70 locus during the heat shock responseWe next tested the effect of mutating the REPO domain on the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction between Pho and Spt5 during the heat shock response. To this end, we performed a co-IP for Pho V164D\u2013Spt5 over the time course detailed in Fig.\u00a01a and compared it to the Pho WT\u2013Spt5 protein\u2013protein interaction dynamic.To our surprise, mutant and wild-type Pho exhibited comparable interaction strengths with Spt5 upon heat shock, indicating that the dynamic interaction switch upon heat shock is not affected by the V164D point mutation in the REPO domain (Fig.\u00a06a, b). However, while the interaction between Pho WT\u2013Spt5 diminished as the hsp70 locus was repressed in the absence of the activating stimulus, the increase in interaction between Pho V164D\u2013Spt5 remained sustained during the recovery phase (Fig.\u00a06a, b). This could be explained by the fact that in the absence of a functional REPO domain, dSfmbt could no longer compete with Spt5 for interaction with Pho during the recovery phase of the heat shock response (Fig.\u00a06a, b). Similar to the Pho WT\u2013Spt5 interaction dynamic, the Pho V164D\u2013Spt5 interaction switch was independent of DNA but dependent upon RNA (Additional file 6: Figure S6a).\nOpen in a separate windowFig.\u00a06Absence of a functional REPO domain disrupts the transcriptional kinetics of the hsp70 locus during the heat shock response. a co-IP assays of S2 DRSC cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged Spt5 (FLAG-Spt5) and HA-tagged PhoV164D (HA-PhoV164D). The S2 DRSC cells were subjected to a heat shock and then allowed to recover from the heat shock according to the experimental scheme depicted in Fig.\u00a01a. At the indicated time points in the experimental scheme, cell lysates were prepared and were used for pull-downs using an anti-FLAG antibody. They were later probed by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. b Quantification of the co-IP assay in a and its comparison with the quantification of the Pho\u2013Spt5 co-IP assay across the same time course.

Details of the procedure used for quantification can be found in Materials and Methods. c qRT-PCR measurements of nascent hsp70 transcripts produced over the course of the heat shock response from S2 DRSC cells upon over-expression of WT Pho and mutant Pho (PhoV164D), respectively. Distance of location of the primers from the hsp70 TSS is +\u00a0687\u00a0bp and has been depicted in the form of a cartoon below the data figure. Data information: In b, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM for n\u00a0=\u00a02, while in c, data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM for n\u00a0=\u00a03To directly assess the effect of the PhoV164D mutant on transcription from the hsp70 locus upon heat shock, we expressed the PhoV164D mutant by placing it under the control of the copper-inducible metallothionein promoter. As a control, PhoWT was expressed under the control of the same promoter. The expression levels of the copper-inducible constructs were compared to endogenous Pho after 72\u00a0h of induction (Additional file 6: Figure S6b). After expression of the WT and mutant constructs for 72\u00a0h, respectively, the transcriptional kinetics of the heat shock response was assessed by measuring nascent RNA production from the hsp70 locus. The expression of the PhoV164D mutant did not affect the up-regulation of the hsp70 locus in response to a heat shock as compared to the control (Fig.\u00a06c). However, upon withdrawing the heat shock stimulus, while nascent RNA production in the control cells sharply decreased, this was not observed in the case of PhoV164D mutant (Fig.\u00a06c). Thus, the absence of a functional REPO domain negatively affected the recovery kinetics of the hsp70 locus during the heat shock response. DiscussionOur study aimed at gaining mechanistic understanding about how PcG proteins regulate their target genes, which are transiently activated by an extracellular stimulus. To this end, we used the heat shock-responsive hsp70 gene in Drosophila as it exhibits a dynamic pattern of expression during the well-characterised heat shock response and it is also a target for PRC1. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis supports a role for PcG proteins in the re-establishment of silencing at the hsp70 locus in the absence of the heat shock stimulus.Our results highlight antagonism between HSF and PRC1 for binding at the hsp70 locus, suggesting a role for PRC1 in repressing the locus in the absence of the heat shock stimulus. Furthermore, we could uncouple the eviction of PRC1 from the hsp70 locus upon heat shock from production of mRNA by treating cells with flavopiridol, a P-TEFb inhibitor. We demonstrated that Pho could preferentially interact with Spt5 and dSfmbt under ON/OFF conditions, respectively, at the hsp70 locus. Our data also conclusively showed that the recruitment of HSF to chromatin is sufficient and necessary for the dynamic interaction between Pho and Spt5. The REPO domain of Pho is central for the interaction switch, since a mutation in the REPO domain not only disrupted the kinetics of the protein\u2013protein interaction between Pho and Spt5 but also disrupted the kinetics of nascent RNA production from the hsp70 locus during the heat shock response.Several reports have described a role for Pho in both the activation and the repression of its target genes [19, 35, 36]. In order to dissect the relationship between binding patterns of PRC1, Pho and Trx and their respective effect on transcriptional activity, ChIP-chip was employed to identify their binding sites in the ANT-C and BX-C gene clusters in two different Drosophila cell lines. At silent loci, the Pho signal localised at PREs. However, in case of active loci, the Pho signal spread over the gene body [19]. Another study demonstrated the requirement of a Pho-binding site and a functional Pho protein for a pairing-sensitive silencing element in the Drosophila even skipped (eve) locus for propagation of the silenced as well as the activated state in different cellular contexts, respectively [35]. Yet another reported example is the Ubx gene in Ubx\nON and Ubx\nOFF cells in the developing Drosophila larvae; the levels of Pho remained unchanged at the bx PRE in Ubx\nON cells, while the occupancy of PRC1 and PRC2 was reduced by twofold [36].Our results demonstrate the ability of Pho to switch its protein interaction partners in a HSF-dependent manner. Our current observations at the hsp70 locus lead us to propose that, in the absence of transcription factor binding, Pho interacts with dSfmbt, forming a recruitment platform for PRC1 and PRC2, and stably maintains the silent state [6, 9, 37]. However, upon activation, TF binding could lead to an increase in interaction affinity between Pho and Spt5, thereby relieving Polycomb-mediated silencing and enabling a switch to the activated state. It is thus plausible that dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction switches between Polycomb group members and Spt5 could potentially play a role in enabling rapid switches in expression states at Pho target genes.Our study also assessed the contribution of the dynamic switch in Pho protein\u2013protein interactions on the transcriptional output of the hsp70 locus during the heat shock response. It was notable that Pho preferentially interacts with Spt5 and dSfmbt when the hsp70 locus is active and silent, respectively. A point mutation in the REPO domain of Pho resulted in ablation of its interaction with dSfmbt. While the PhoV164D mutant was capable of strongly interacting with Spt5, immediately upon heat shock, it was incapable of switching back to its interaction with dSfmbt in the absence of the heat shock stimulus. This result underscores the importance of a functional REPO domain in mediating the switch in the protein interaction partners of Pho depending upon the binding kinetics of HSF at the hsp70 locus. Nascent RNA analysis also suggested that the dynamic protein\u2013protein interactions of Pho could contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the hsp70 locus. Expression of PhoV164D mutant negatively affected the transcriptional kinetics of the hsp70 locus in response to a heat shock when compared to the control. We speculate that in the absence of a functional REPO domain, the dynamic nature of the protein\u2013protein interactions of Pho is lost, thereby preventing cells from efficiently switching between ON/OFF states in the presence/absence of the activating stimulus.Taken together, our study highlights how dynamic protein interaction switches between PcG members and Spt5 could facilitate the transcriptional regulation of a Polycomb-regulated inducible gene like hsp70. Additional open questions remain regarding the complex relationship between PcG proteins and paused RNA polymerase II. Nonetheless, this study provides a new perspective on how the plasticity of Polycomb gene silencing is mediated by dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction switches between activators and repressors. ConclusionsIn this study, we sought to understand the mechanistic basis of dynamic gene regulation by Polycomb group proteins at stress-inducible loci like hsp70. We identified a role for the dynamic protein\u2013protein interaction switch between Pho and Spt5 in the transcriptional regulation of the hsp70 locus. Crucially, we show that the recruitment of HSF to chromatin and a functional REPO domain in Pho is necessary for the dynamic interaction switch between Pho and Spt5. Thus, our study reveals how a dynamic interaction switch between PcG proteins and an elongation factor could enable inducible genes regulated by Polycomb to switch between active and repressed transcriptional states. Materials and methodsCell cultureS2 DRSC cells (DGRC, stock #181) were cultured in Schneider\u2019s medium (Sigma-Aldrich)\u00a0+\u00a010% heat-inactivated FBS (PAN Biotech GmbH) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C.Cells were instantaneously heat shocked by adding Schneider\u2019s medium, which was pre-warmed to 48\u00a0\u00b0C, and then, the temperature was maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min by incubating the cells in a water bath as previously described [18].

One million cells were plated in 1\u00a0ml of serum-free medium onto 6-well plates. Ten micrograms of dsRNA was added to the well, and this was followed by a 45-min incubation period. Thereafter, 1\u00a0ml of Schneider\u2019s medium\u00a0+\u00a020% heat-inactivated FBS was added to the wells, and the cells were incubated for a period of 96\u00a0h.Chromatin immunoprecipitationApproximately 25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells were resuspended in PBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma, F8775) for 10\u00a0min. The reaction was quenched with 125\u00a0mM glycine for 5\u00a0min. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 500g for 5\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended in buffer A (100\u00a0mM Tris ph8, 10\u00a0mM DTT) and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C on a rotor for 15\u00a0min. Thereafter, the cells were incubated on a thermomixer at 30\u00a0\u00b0C at 300\u00a0rpm. The cells were briefly vortexed for 5\u00a0s and centrifuged at 500g for 5\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended in buffer B (10\u00a0mM HEPES ph8, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 10\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C on a rotor for 5\u00a0min. The cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended in buffer C (10\u00a0mM HEPES ph8, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 200\u00a0mM NaCl) and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C on a rotor for 5\u00a0min. The cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended in buffer D (50\u00a0mM HEPES ph8, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS) and sonicated using S220 ultrasonicator (Covaris) to obtain chromatin fragments approximately 500\u00a0bp long.The chromatin was adjusted to RIPA conditions and centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 13,000\u00a0rpm. One hundred microlitres of the chromatin was aliquoted as an input fraction. Appropriate amount of the antibody (amount of each antibody used per IP is stated in Additional file 8: Table S2) was added to the chromatin solution and incubated overnight on a rotor at 4\u00a0\u00b0C.In order to prepare the Dynabeads\u2122 Protein A/G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for purification of the immunocomplexes, 40\u00a0\u03bcl of the magnetic beads was washed with 1\u00a0ml RIPA. The ChIP sample was centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min at 13,000\u00a0rpm, transferred to the tube containing the magnetic beads and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C on a rotor for 2\u20133\u00a0h. The immunocomplexes along with the magnetic beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris ph8, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate), once with LiCL buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris ph8, 250\u00a0mM LiCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate) and twice with TE (10\u00a0mM Tris ph8, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). The immunocomplexes were eluted thrice with the elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1\u00a0M NaHCO3) at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min with gentle agitation (800\u00a0rpm). The ChIP sample was reverse cross-linked with 200\u00a0mM NaCl and incubated at 65\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The input and ChIP samples were treated with RNase (Roche, 11 119 915 001) and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min. This was followed by treatment with Proteinase K (Axon Lab AG, A4392.0001) and incubated at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min. The DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, 28106). All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free, Roche, 4693132001).Polytene immunostaining\nDrosophila salivary glands were dissected from third-instar larvae, permeabilised in solution 1 (1xPBS, 1% Triton X-100) and then fixed for 10\u00a0min (50% acetic acid, 3.7% p-formaldehyde). The squashed salivary glands were prepared as described previously [39]. The slides were washed with PBS and blocked for 60\u00a0min with the blocking solution (3% BSA, 0.2% NP40, 0.2% Tween 20, 10% non-fat dry milk powder). Dilutions of the primary antibody (Pho, 1:50 and RNA pol II, 1:100) were made with the blocking solution, and the slides were incubated with the primary antibody overnight in a humid chamber at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The slides were washed with PBS, dilutions of the secondary antibody (1:200) were made with the blocking solution and the slides were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 60\u00a0min in a humid chamber at room temperature. The slides were washed with wash buffer \u2018300\u2019 and wash buffer \u2018400\u2019 (1xPBS, 300/400\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.2% NP40, 0.2% Tween 20). The slides were then stained with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DAPI (Roche, 236 276), mounted using 40\u00a0\u03bcl Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, 0100-01) and analysed using a Leica DMI6000 B fluorescent microscope.Native ChIP (N-ChIP)The protocol for N-ChIP had been previously described in [27]. Approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 cells were harvested by scraping, washed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 1200g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended in TM2+ buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5\u00a0mM PMSF). Nuclei were released by adding 0.6% NP-40 to the cell suspension and incubating for 3\u00a0min and 30\u00a0s on ice. During the incubation, the cell suspension was gently vortexed at intervals of 1\u00a0min. The nuclei were centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 1000g and washed once with TM2+. The nuclei were resuspended in TM2+ with protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free, Roche, 4693132001). MNase treatment was performed as follows: the nuclei were preheated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. 1\u00a0mM CaCl2 was added to the nuclei followed by addition of 80U MNase (M0247S, NEB). The digestion with MNase was carried out for precisely 6\u00a0min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 2\u00a0mM EGTA. The nuclei were incubated on ice for 2\u00a0min after the MNase treatment and centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 1000g. Nuclei were washed with TM2+ containing protease inhibitors and 2\u00a0mM EGTA and centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 1000g. The nuclei were resuspended in 80T buffer (70\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7.5, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 2\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5\u00a0mM PMSF, protease inhibitors), cavitated 10 times through a 26G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u00bd\u201d needle (4710004512, Henke Sass Wolf), and chromatin was centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min at 1000g. Ten percentage of the chromatin was aliquoted as the input fraction. Anti-Pho antibody (rabbit polyclonal, a gift from Jurg Muller) was used for each IP at 1:100 dilution and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C on a rotating wheel overnight. Forty microlitres of Dynabeads\u2122 Protein G magnetic beads was added to the IP and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Beads were washed twice with 80T buffer, and beads were resuspended in 80T buffer. Following treatment with RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) and Proteinase K (Axon Lab AG, A4392.0001), DNA was extracted by phenol\u2013chloroform and ethanol precipitation.Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)The co-IP protocol was adapted from [40]. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min at 500g. The cells were resuspended and lysed in co-IP buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris ph7.5, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 20\u00a0mM NaF) for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The cells were centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min at 12,000\u00a0rpm. Prior to treating the cell lysate with nucleases, 0.4\u00a0mM MgCl2 was supplemented to the cell lysate. The cell lysate was incubated with RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EN0531) or DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2222) for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. The reaction with the nuclease was terminated by addition of 5\u00a0mM EDTA to the cell lysate. The supernatant was transferred to a siliconised tube. Ten percentage was aliquoted as the input fraction. 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg of \u03b1-mouse FLAG was added to the IP fraction and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0h. Forty microlitres of Dynabeads\u2122 Protein G magnetic beads was added to the IP fraction and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u00a0h. The immunocomplexes were washed thrice with co-IP wash buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris ph7.5, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The immunocomplexes were eluted with co-IP buffer, denatured with a mixture containing NuPage\u00ae 4x LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0008) and 200\u00a0mM DTT upon heating to 70\u00a0\u00b0C with mild agitation at 800\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min. Western blots were visualised using Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection reagent (GE Healthcare, RPN2106) and Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare, 28906836). All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free, Roche, 4693132001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets, Roche, 4906837001). For the quantification of HA-Pho co-IP, the intensity of the co-IP band was normalised against the intensity of the corresponding FLAG IP band using ImageJ software.Native elongating transcript isolation and quantificationThe protocol used for the isolation of native elongating transcripts had been previously described [41]. Cells were grown in medium containing 0.5\u00a0mM CuSO4 for 72\u00a0h to induce the expression of stably integrated constructs. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 2000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The cells were resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 2000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The cells were resuspended in cytoplasmic buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.15% NP-40) and incubated on ice for 5\u00a0min. The cell lysate was layered on top of NET-seq sucrose buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris pH 7, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.34\u00a0M sucrose) and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Nuclei were washed twice with nuclei wash buffer (1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, PBS) and centrifuged at 2000g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The nuclei were resuspended in glycerol buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris pH 8, 75\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.85\u00a0mM DTT) and harsh nuclei lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES ph 8, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1\u00a0M urea, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT). This was followed by 4 rounds of vortexing for 2\u00a0s each with an incubation period of 1\u00a0min on ice between each round of vortexing. Samples were incubated on ice for 2\u00a0min and centrifuged at 18,500g for 2\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatant represented the nucleoplasmic fraction while the pellet contained the chromatin fraction. The chromatin fraction was washed once using a mix of the glycerol and harsh nuclei lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of TRIzol. All the buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete EDTA-free, Roche, 4693132001) and actinomycin D (Sigma, A1410).Nascent RNA was isolated from the chromatin fraction following manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596018). The RNA was precipitated overnight using ethanol. Mature RNAs were depleted from the sample by performing two rounds of Oligo dT-based depletion (Dynabeads\u2122 Oligo(dT)25, Thermo Fischer Scientific, 61002). The RNA was DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-free\u2122 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1907) and reverse transcribed using First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K1612). cDNA was diluted (1:50), mixed with FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche, 06402712001) and assayed using Light Cycler\u00ae 96 (Roche). \u0394\u0394CT method was used to measure transcript levels relative to control.Quantitative real-time PCRFor measurement of mRNA levels using qRT-PCR, cells were lysed using TRIzol\u2122 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596018), and RNA was extracted using Direct-zol\u2122 RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research, R2052). The RNA was DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-free\u2122 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1907) and reverse transcribed using First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K1612). cDNA was diluted (1:50), mixed with FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche, 06402712001) and assayed using Light Cycler\u00ae 96 (Roche). \u0394\u0394CT method was used to measure transcript levels relative to control.For measurement of % input values for the ChIP and N-ChIP samples, the input DNA samples were diluted in fivefold dilution series (1:10 up to 1:1250) and the ChIP sample was diluted (1:5). The standard curve obtained from the input DNA dilutions was used to determine the amount of DNA in the ChIP, which was calculated in terms of % input.\n Additional files\n\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1. Schematic representation of the proteins involved in the silencing, activation and re-silencing of the hsp70 locus. a At optimal growth temperature, Pho, a DNA-binding PcG member, binds to promoter region of the hsp70 locus. Pho interacts with dSfmbt, which together form a recruitment platform for PRC1 to the hsp70 locus. In addition, RNA polymerase II is maintained in the paused state by NELF and Spt5, which act as pausing factors. Upon heat shock, HSF, along with P-TEFb, is recruited to chromatin and releases RNA polymerase II from the paused state. P-TEFb modifies Spt5 and converts into an elongation factor. It also modifies the CTD of RNA polymerase II to enable productive elongation. However, upon removal of the heat shock stimulus, the locus should eventually return to its paused state. Thus, hsp70 is an ideal model gene to study the eviction and recruitment of PRC1 upon activation and re-silencing, respectively. The colour code for the protein names is as follows: silencing in red, pausing factors in orange and activators in green.(533K, jpg)\n\nAdditional file 2: Figure S2.
