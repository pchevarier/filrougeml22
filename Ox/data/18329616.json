Several host proteins have been shown to play an important role in VP40-mediated virus-like particles production; however, the host cell proteins and mechanisms responsible for VP40 intracellular transport prior to its contribution to virion formation remain to be elucidated. We therefore used coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses to identify host proteins interacting with VP40. We found that Sec24C, a component of the COPII transport system, interacts specifically with VP40 via the region at amino acids 303-307. Coimmunoprecipitation and dominant-negative mutant studies indicated that the COPII transport system plays a critical role in VP40 intracellular transport to the plasma membrane. Marburg virus VP40 was also shown to use the COPII transport system for intracellular transport. These findings enhance our understanding of filovirus replication and provide a new target for development of antiviral drugs. IntroductionEbola virus is an enveloped RNA virus of the family Filoviridae in the order Mononegavirales. The virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever accompanied by extremely high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates (Feldmann et al., 2003; Sanchez et al., 2001). Effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have not yet been licensed (Feldmann et al., 2003).Ebola viral particles consist of seven structural proteins encoded by a genome of nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (Feldmann et al., 2004; Feldmann et al., 2003). Four viral proteins -- nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), VP30, and L -- and viral RNA form the nucleocapsid, which is responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome (Muhlberger et al., 1999). Three other proteins -- VP40, glycoprotein (GP) and VP24 -- are membrane-associated proteins. VP40 is the major matrix protein and its expression alone leads to the formation and release of filamentous Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) (Jasenosky et al., 2001; Timmins et al., 2001). GP expression further enhances the amount of VP40-induced VLP production (Licata et al., 2004).A so-called late-domain was originally identified in the retrovirus gag protein as a region important for a late step in virus budding (Gottlinger et al., 1991). This domain mediated interactions with cellular proteins involved in multivesicular body sorting machinery (Strack et al., 2000; VerPlank et al., 2001). Ebola virus VP40 has two overlapping late-domains (7-PTAP-10 and 10-PPEY-13) that interact with Tsg101\u2014a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I\u2014via its PTAP motif and with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 via its PPXY motif (Harty et al., 2000; Licata et al., 2003; Yasuda et al., 2003). These host proteins play a role in the last step of virus budding (Hartlieb and Weissenhorn, 2006; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001). The efficiency of Ebola VLP production is reduced by alteration of the late-domains of VP40 by amino acid substitutions or by inhibition of Nedd4 function (Harty et al., 2000; Yasuda et al., 2003). However, the interaction between VP40 late-domains and these cellular proteins are not essential for Ebola viral replication, since a mutant Ebola virus possessing substitutions abolishing both of the VP40 late-domains was able to replicate with only a one log unit reduction in virus titers in cell culture (Neumann et al., 2005).VP40 has to be transported to the plasma membrane before it induces VP40-mediated VLP production at the plasma membrane (Noda et al., 2002; Panchal et al., 2003). Thus, we chose a proteomics approach to identify cellular machineries responsible for the intracellular transport of VP40. Here we demonstrate that the COPII transport system is responsible for the intracellular transport of Ebola virus VP40. ResultsA tandem-tag-based pull-down analysis reveals Ebola virus VP40 interaction with Sec24CTo identify the host factors responsible for intracellular transport of Ebola virus VP40, we employed a tandem-tag-based pull-down assay. For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid expressing VP40 with both a FLAG and an HA tag at its N-terminus (FH-VP40) and examined the properties of this mutant, including its expression level, reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, intracellular distribution, VLP formation (Fig. S1), and the shapes of the VLPs induced by the tandem-tagged VP40. There were no appreciable differences between FH-VP40 and authentic VP40 except for the reactivity of the tandem-tagged VP40 with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies and the apparent molecular weight due to the tags (data not shown). Next, we applied FH-VP40 to a tandem-tag-based pull-down assay for identification of host proteins interacting with VP40, leading to the identification of 10 host proteins that interact with VP40: LARP (Gene ID 23369), DHX9 (1660), HNRPU (3192), Sec24C (9632), NCL (4691), ILF3 (3609), DDX21 (9188), HSPA9B (3313), HSPA5 (3309), and HSPA8 (3312) (Fig. 1A).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Interaction between VP40 and Sec24C. (A) Identification of host proteins interacting with VP40. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing either FLAG and HA-tagged VP40 (FH-VP40) or authentic VP40. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies, sequentially. Coimmunoprecipitated host proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The band marked by an asterisk represents FH-VP40, while the arrow heads indicate the proteins analyzed by the MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS system. (B) Schematic diagram of the vesicle budding process of the COPII complex. Activation of Sar1 by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (step I) leads to membrane recruitment and formation of a Sec23/24 complex (step II), cargo selection, and coat polymerization by Sec13/31 complex (step III). This figure was modified from Bickford et al., 2004. (C) VP40 immunoprecipitates endogenous Sec24C and Sec23. A plasmid encoding either FLAG-tagged wild-type VP40 or an empty vector was transfected into 293 cells. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG or an anti-Sec24C antibody. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-VP40, -Sec24C, -Sec23, or -FLAG antibody. Input and IP denote the total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples, respectively. (D) VP40 interacts with Sec24C during Ebola virus infection. Three days after infection of Zaire Ebola virus, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-VP40 antibody. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Sec24C, -VP40, -VP24, -GP, or -NP antibody.Among these proteins, we selected Sec24C for further study because it is a component of the COPII complex, which is responsible for ER-to-Golgi transport of vesicles (Bickford et al., 2004; Haucke, 2003; Watson and Stephens, 2005) and is possibly involved in VP40 intracellular transport. Formation of the COPII complex requires assembly of the coat proteins Sec23/Sec24, Sec13/Sec31, and Sar1 (Barlowe, 2002), a process initiated by GDP-to-GTP exchange on GTPase Sar1, which belongs to an ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family (Fig. 1B, Step I). Activated Sar1 recruits a heterodimeric complex of Sec23/Sec24 to generate a prebudding complex (Fig. 1B, Step II). Finally, recruitment of Sec13/Sec31 heterodimers induces ER membrane deformation and budding of vesicles coated with COPII complex (Fig. 1B, Step III). During vesicle formation, cargo proteins are selected and concentrated by Sec24 (Kuehn et al., 1998). The Sec24 family has four members, Sec24A, Sec24B, Sec24C, and Sec24D (Pagano et al., 1999), and Sec24C has been shown to interact with Sec23A by yeast two hybrid assays (Pagano et al., 1999).Since Sec24C exists as a heterodimeric complex with Sec23 in cells (Barlowe, 2002), we analyzed whether VP40 precipitated not only Sec24C but also Sec23. We found that both proteins were immuprecipitated with VP40 (see IP: anti-FLAG in Fig. 1C). Moreover, when a rabbit antibody against Sec24C was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous Sec24C from cell lysates, VP40 was coimmunoprecipitated (see IP: anti-Sec24 panel in Fig. 1C). To further confirm that VP40 specifically interacts with Sec24C, we performed immunoprecipitation/Western blot assays by coexpressing cMyc-tagged Sec24C (cMyc-Sec24C) and authentic VP40, FLAG-tagged VP40 (FLAG-VP40), or FLAG-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (FLAG-GFP; negative control). FLAG-VP40 was also coexpressed with a cMyc-tagged VP40 as a positive control for this assay, since VP40 forms a homo-oligomer (Panchal et al., 2003). As shown in Fig. S2, both cMyc-Sec24C (lane 7) and cMyc-VP40 (lane 12) were coimmunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody. However, with an anti-FLAG antibody, cMyc-Sec24C did not coimmunoprecipitate with FLAG-GFP (lane 11). The results suggest the specific interaction of cMyc-Sec24C (lane 7) and cMyc-VP40 with FLAG-VP40. The same observation was made in reverse experiments (i.e., coimmunoprecipitation of FLAG-VP40 with cMyc-Sec24C with use of an anti-cMyc antibody and detection of coimmunoprecipitated VP40 with use of an anti-FLAG antibody, data not shown). These results indicate that VP40 specifically interacts with endogenous and exogenous Sec24C.Next, we attempted to demonstrate an interaction between VP40 and Sec24C during Ebola virus infection. To this end, we infected 293 cells with authentic Ebola virus, prepared lysates from Ebola virus-infected cells, and performed immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-VP40 antibody. We found that endogenous Sec24C was coimmunoprecipitated with VP40 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that VP40 interacts with Sec24C during Ebola virus infection.Intracellular localization of cMyc-Sec24C and FLAG-Sec23A shifted to the plasma membrane upon coexpression of cMyc-VP40To visually examine VP40 interaction with Sec23A/Sec24C heterodimer, we evaluated the intracellular localization of both Sec23A and Sec24C in the presence (Fig. 2B) or absence (Fig. 2A) of VP40. In 293 cells expressing both Sec23A and Sec24C, Sec23A colocalized with Sec24C as punctuated staining in the perinuclear region (Fig 2A). The intracellular localization of both proteins shifted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, arrows) upon expression of VP40 and both proteins colocalized there with VP40.Open in a separate windowFigure 2VP40 colocalizes with Sec24C and Sec23A at the plasma membrane. FLAG-Sec23A and cMyc-Sec24C were expressed in the presence (B) or absence (A) of VP40. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed and stained with a combination of an anti-FLAG, an anti-cMyc, or an anti-VP40 antibody. Arrows indicate accumulation of VP40, cMyc-Sec24C, and/or FLAG-Sec23A.Ebola VLP production is reduced by downregulation of endogenous Sec24C or Sar1To evaluate the direct contributions of endogenous Sec24C and Sar1 to Ebola VLP release, we applied RNA interference for specific knockdown of mRNA encoding Sec24C or Sar1. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) possessing the shRNA cassette for GFP (control), Sec24C, or Sar1 and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) was inoculated into 293 cells, and the cells were then maintained with puromycin (1\u03bcg/ml) for selection of MuLV-infected cells. shRNA-expressing cells, designated shGFP 293, shSec24C 293, and shSar1 293, were used without further cloning.To confirm whether the expression levels of target proteins were reduced in these shRNA-expressing cells, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Sec24C antibody, an anti-Sar1 antibody, or an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Fig. 3A). The results showed that the expression levels of Sec24C in shSec24C 293 cells and Sar1 in shSar1 293 cells were reduced as compared with those in shGFP 293 cells. To further demonstrate the reduction of expression levels of Sec24C and Sar1 in the shRNA-expressing cells, we performed functional analyses by transfecting these cells with a plasmid expressing secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and examining the amount of SEAP secreted in the culture supernatants (Fig. 3B). The results showed that the secretion index (calculated as described in the legend of Figure 3B) of shSec24C 293 cells or of shSar1 293 cells was reduced to 68.6% or 68.2%, respectively, as compared with that of shGFP 293 cells (P<0.001 by Student\u2019s t-test).Open in a separate windowFigure 3VP40-mediated VLP production is reduced by downregulation of endogenous Sec24C or Sar1. (A) Protein expression levels of Sec24C and Sar1. Cell lysates were prepared from normal 293, shGFP 293, shSec24C 293, or shSar1 293 cells, and analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-Sec24C, an anti-Sar1, or an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody. (B) Reduction of SEAP secretion in shSec24C 293 or shSar1 293 cells. shGFP 293, shSec24C 293, and shSar1 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing SEAP and SEAP activity in the supernatants and within these cells were measured. The data are presented as a Secretion Index, defined as the ratio of SEAP activity detected in the culture supernatant to the intracellular SEAP activity (n=3). P values were determined by Student\u2019s t-test. (C) Reduction of VLP release from shSec24C 293 or shSar1 293 cells. A plasmid encoding authentic VP40 was transfected into normal 293, shGFP 293, shSec24C 293, or shSar1 293 cells. Released VLPs and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-VP40 antibody. The intensities of the VP40 bands were quantified. The extent of VLPs in the first lane from the left was set to 100%. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.We subsequently used these cells to compare the efficiency of VLP production by measuring the amounts of VLPs by Western blot analysis with an anti-VP40 antibody (Fig. 3C). In cell lysates, VP40 was detected at a similar level among all test samples. Although the efficiency of VLP production was not appreciably reduced (93%) in shGFP 293 cells, it was lowered to 38% in shSec24C 293 cells and to 42% in shSar1 293 cells. These results indicate that the COPII transport system involving Sar1 and Sec24C is required for efficient VLP production.Dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 inhibit VLP production by interfering with the plasma membrane accumulation of VP40To evaluate the functional contributions of the COPII transport system to VLP release, we used two dominant-negative mutants of Sar1, Sar1_T39N and Sar1_H79G, which are well characterized as COPII transport inhibitors (Ward et al., 2001). To confirm the inhibitory effect of these mutants, we examined the expression of VSV-G protein on the cell surface (Fig. 4A). Although the cell surface expression of VSV-G was not appreciably affected by coexpression with Sar1, it was decreased to 37.2% upon coexpression with Sar1_T39N, and to 6.1% with Sar1_H79G. Similar levels of inhibition by these dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 were observed for the secretion of SEAP (Fig. S3). We then evaluated their effects on VP40-induced VLP production by measuring the amount of VP40 released into culture supernatant by Western blot analysis with an anti-VP40 and an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B). In cell lysates, VP40 and FLAG-Sar1 or its dominant-negative mutants were detected at similar levels. Although the efficiency of VLP production as measured by the amount of VP40 released into culture supernatants was not appreciably influenced by coexpression with Sar1 (2nd lane from the left), it was decreased to 61% upon coexpression with Sar1_T39N (3rd lane from the left), and to 12% with Sar1_H79G (4th lane from the left). These results indicate that the COPII transport system, especially when involved in formation of the prebudding complex by Sar1, is required for efficient VLP production.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 interfere with VLP production by inhibition of VP40 plasma membrane accumulation. (A) VSV-G transport to the cell surface was inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of Sar1. VSV-G was coexpressed with an indicated protein in 293T cells. VSV-G on the cell surface was analyzed by Flow cytometry using an anti-VSV-G antibody. Red lines indicate the results with a goat anti-VSV-G antibody, and black lines indicate the results with a normal goat antibody as a primary antibody. (B) Dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 inhibit VP40-induced VLP production. VP40 was expressed in the absence (1st lane from the left) or presence of FLAG-Sar1 (2nd lane from the left), FLAG-Sar1_T39N (3rd lane from the left), or FLAG-Sar1_H79G (4th lane from the left) in 293T cells. Released VLP and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG or an anti-VP40 antibody. The intensities of the VP40 bands were quantified; the amount of VP40 in the first lane from the left was set to 100%. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 interfere with the accumulation of Venus-VP40 at the plasma membrane. Venus-VP40 was expressed in the presence or absence of FLAG-Sar1, FLAG-Sar1_T39N or FLAG-Sar1_H79G in living 293T cells. The cells were stained with ER-tracker Blue-White and visualized with a confocal microscope. Venus-VP40 was detected as bright yellow and ER was detected as light blue.To determine the steps at which Sar1 dominant-negative mutants inhibit Ebola VLP production, we assessed the intracellular localization of VP40 in living cells in their presence. To visualize VP40 in living cells, we fused VP40 at the N-terminus to Venus (Venus-VP40), a derivative of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) that was optimized for expression in mammalian cells. Venus-VP40 induced VLP production as efficiently as the wild-type VP40 and other VP40s with a short tag (Fig. S1). Next, Venus-VP40 was expressed in the presence or absence of FLAG-Sar1, FLAG-Sar1_T39N or FLAG-Sar1_H79G in 293T cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were stained with ER-tracker Blue-White and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C). Venus-VP40 was mainly associated with the plasma membrane with limited signals in the cytoplasm (Top, Empty vector). This plasma membrane association of Venus-VP40 was not appreciably altered by coexpression with FLAG-Sar1 (Top, FLAG-Sar1). By contrast, the intracellular localization of Venus-VP40 was altered in the presence of dominant-negative mutants (Top, FLAG-Sar1_T39N and FLAG-Sar1_H79G); it was mainly detected in the cytoplasm and its association with the plasma membrane was substantially diminished. In addition, VP40 did not colocalize with an ER marker in the presence or absence of the dominant-negative mutants (Fig. 4C Bottom) or with a Golgi marker (Fig. S4). Similar results were obtained by using 293 cells and Cos-7 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 interfere with VP40-induced VLP production by inhibiting the accumulation of VP40 at the plasma membrane.VP40 amino acid residues essential for its interaction with Sec24C are required for its accumulation at the plasma membraneTo map the regions of VP40 important for its interaction with Sec24C, we generated a series of VP40 deletion mutants with FLAG-tag at their N-terminus (Fig. 5A). To examine their interaction with Sec24C, we coexpressed Sec24C with these deletion mutants, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-Sec24C antibody, or by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining (Fig. 5B). The expression levels of VP40 deletion mutants and Sec24C were confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG and an anti-Sec24C antibody, respectively (Fig. 5B, Input). The results showed that VP40 mutants lacking N-terminal regions still bind to Sec24C (Fig. 5B, IP, anti-Sec24C) although the amount of Sec24C in these samples were higher than that in the wild-type VP40 sample (Fig. 5B, Input, anti-Sec24C). Even though the expression levels of FLAG-VP40\u0394N80 and FLAG-VP40\u0394N120 were low, they still coprecipitated Sec24C. By contrast, three C-terminal deletion mutants of VP40 failed to coprecipitate Sec24C. These data suggest that the region spanning amino acids at position 287-326 of VP40 is important for its interaction with Sec24C.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Identification of the VP40 region interacting with Sec24C. (A) Schematic diagrams of VP40 deletion mutants. A series of VP40 deletion mutants was constructed by sequential deletion from the N- or C-terminus of VP40. A FLAG-tag was added at the N-terminus of the open reading frame. (B) Sec24C coprecipitated with N-terminal deletion mutants, but not with C-terminal deletion mutants. Each plasmid described in Fig. 5A was cotransfected with a plasmid encoding an authentic Sec24C into 293T cells. The cell lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-Sec24C antibody or by CBB stain. Input and IP denote the total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples, respectively. Asterisks indicate the bands of wild-type or mutant VP40s. The results shown are representative of four independent experiments.To further refine the Sec24C interaction domain in VP40, we prepared a series of plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged VP40 with multiple alanine substitutions (Fig. 6A). Expression of these mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody and an anti-VP40 polyclonal antibody (data not shown). These FLAG-tagged alanine-scanning VP40 mutants were used to evaluate their ability to coimmunoprecipitate Sec24C. Under conditions in which similar levels of Sec24C and VP40 mutants were expressed (Fig. 6B, the panels indicated by Input), and similar amounts of VP40 mutants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6B, the panels indicated by IP, anti-VP40), FLAG-VP40_303-306A and FLAG-VP40_305-308A did not coimmunoprecipitate Sec24C as efficiently as the wild-type protein and other VP40 mutant proteins (Fig. 6B, the panels indicated by IP, anti-Sec24C).Open in a separate windowFigure 6The region at amino acids 303 to 308 of VP40 is important for both interaction with Sec24C and VLP production. (A) Schematic diagrams of multi-alanine-scanning mutants of VP40. A series of such mutants was constructed by the substitution of amino acids for alanine from 286 to 326, sequentially. A FLAG-tag was added at the N-terminus of the open-reading frame. (B) Comparison of the interaction of multi-alanine-scanning mutants of VP40 with Sec24C. The immunoprecipitation assay/Western blot analysis was performed as described in Fig. 5 with an anti-FLAG antibody for IP assay and either an anti-Sec24C or an anti-VP40 antibody for Western blot analysis, respectively. Input and IP denote the total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples, respectively. The results are representative of three independent experiments. (C) Comparison of the efficiency of VLP production among multi-alanine mutants. A VLP release assay was performed as described in Fig. 4 with 293T cells. The results are representative of three independent experiments.We next examined the ability of these VP40 mutants to induce VLP production as an indicator of plasma membrane accumulation, since VP40 accumulation at the plasma membrane was associated with efficient VLP production (see Fig. 4). Although all VP40 mutants were expressed at an equivalent level (Fig. 6C, upper panel), VLP production was substantially reduced with FLAG-VP40_286-288A, FLAG-VP40_289-291A, FLAG-VP40_303-306A, and FLAG-VP40_305-308A. In addition, VLP production was appreciably reduced with FLAG-VP40_314-316A. These data suggest that the region spanning amino acids at position 303-308 of VP40 is important for its interaction with Sec24C and thus VP40-induced VLP production and that the regions at amino acids 286-291 and at amino acids 314-316 of VP40 are important for VP40-induced VLP release but not for interaction with Sec24C. These mutant VP40s, which are deficient in VLP production but interact normally with Sec24C, failed to accumulate at the plasma membrane (data not shown).To identify the individual amino acids essential for interaction with Sec24C, we prepared a second series of plasmids expressing VP40 with a single alanine substitution (Fig. 7A). Again, under the conditions in which similar levels of Sec24C and VP40 mutants were expressed (Fig. 7B, the panels indicated by Input), the amount of coprecipitated Sec24C, normalized to the amount of its VP40 immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7B, the panels indicated by IP, anti-VP40), was reduced to 46% for FLAG-VP40_L303A, to 56% for FLAG-VP40_V306A, and to 64% for FLAG-VP40_I307A (Fig. 7B, the panels indicated by IP, anti-Sec24C). Interestingly, the amount of Sec24C coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-VP40_M305A was increased to 186%. These data indicate that amino acids at position 303L, 305M, 306V, and 307I of VP40 are involved in the interaction with Sec24C.Open in a separate windowFigure 7303L, 305M, 306V, and 307I of VP40 are essential for both the interaction with Sec24C and its accumulation at the plasma membrane. (A) Schematic diagrams of single alanine-scanning mutants of VP40. A series of such mutants of VP40 was constructed by substitution of each amino acid to alanine from 303 to 308, sequentially. A FLAG-tag was added at the N-terminus of the open-reading frame. (B) Comparison of interaction of VP40 single alanine mutants with Sec24C. The immunoprecipitation assay/Western blot analysis was performed as described in Fig. 6. Input and IP denote the total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples, respectively. The intensities of the Sec24C and VP40 bands were quantified. The extent of Sec24C was normalized to the extent of its VP40 level, and the value in the first lane from the left was set to 100%. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. (C) FLAG-VP40_L303A, FLAG-VP40_V306A, and FLAG-VP40_I307A failed to accumulate at the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence assay was performed as described in Fig. 2 with an anti-VP40 antibody (red). The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). (D) FLAG-VP40_M305A induces lumps on the cell surface. 293 cells transfected with either an expression plasmid with no insert (empty vector) or a plasmid encoding either FLAG-VP40 or FLAG-VP40_M305A were analyzed by SEM as described in experimental procedures. Inset shows a higher magnification of a portion of the cells. The edges of cells transfected with an empty vector were traced with a white line (left panel). Arrowheads and arrows indicate filamentous VLPs induced by wild-type or lumps induced by FLAG-VP40_M305A, respectively.We next determined the cellular localization of Sec24C interaction-deficient VP40 mutants (Fig. 7C). Unlike a FLAG-tagged wild-type VP40 that was clearly associated with the plasma membrane, as described above (Fig. 2B), the plasma membrane association was unclear with VP40 mutants having a reduced level of Sec24C interaction (i.e., FLAG-VP40_L303A, FLAG-VP40_V306A, and FLAG-VP40_I307A). However, FLAG-VP40_T304A and FLAG-VP40_T308A, which showed properties similar to wild-type VP40 for Sec24C interaction and VLP production, were associated with the plasma membrane as was shown with wild-type VP40. FLAG-VP40_M305A, which showed an enhanced interaction with Sec24C, but reduced VLP production, associated with the plasma membrane, but bleb-like structures containing the mutant VP40 were apparent on the cell surface. To examine the nature of this unique structure, we undertook scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of the cells expressing FLAG-VP40_M305A (Fig. 7D). Many filamentous VLPs were protruding from the exterior of the cells expressing wild-type VP40 (Fig. 7D, arrowheads), while none were observed on cells transfected with an empty plasmid. These filamentous VLPs were indistinguishable from those observed in cells infected with authentic Ebola virus, as reported previously (Watanabe et al., 2004). Many lumps were apparent at the surface of cells expressing VP40_M305A, which had a higher binding activity with Sec24C (Fig. 7C, upper right panel; Fig. 7D, right panel).We next examined the efficiency of VLP production with these point mutants by measuring the amount of VP40 detected in the culture supernatant and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that with the exception of VP40_M305A mutant, the extent of VLP production was correlated with their interaction with Sec24C (i.e., less Sec24C association corresponded to less VLP production) (Fig. S5). In cells expressing VP40_I307A, we never found VLP budding although the transfection efficiency of these cells with plasmids was more than 50%, based on an immunofluorescent assay examining over 100 cells (Fig. S5B and data not shown), while in cells expressing other mutants or wild-type, VLP budding was readily observed (Fig. S5B). Although VP40_M305A mutant interacted more efficiently with Sec24C than with wild-type VP40, VLP production was reduced with this mutant. These data suggest that balanced interplay between VP40 and Sec24C is essential for the accumulation of VP40 at the plasma membrane and for VLP release.To eliminate the possibility that VP40 expression from a plasmid affects the secretory pathway in general by tying up the Sec24C, we examined the level of SEAP in the culture supernatant by coexpressing FLAG-VP40, or FLAG-GFP (Fig. S6). The results showed that FLAG-VP40 did not appreciably affect SEAP secretion into the culture supernatant, suggesting the lack of any general effect of VP40 expression on the secretory pathway.Do other viral matrix proteins use the COPII transport system for their intracellular transport?Since the COPII transport system was used for intracellular transport of Ebola virus VP40, we next examined whether it also functions with other viral matrix proteins that induce VLP production. To this end, we expressed human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gag (Strack et al., 2000), Lassa virus Z (Perez et al., 2003), and Marburg virus VP40 (Kolesnikova et al., 2004) in the presence or absence of FLAG-Sar1 or its dominant-negative mutants. The released VLPs were collected, and the efficiency of VLP production examined by Western blot analysis. Coexpression of FLAG-Sar1 or dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 did not affect VLP production induced by HIV-1 gag or Lassa virus Z (data not shown). By contrast, the VLP production induced by Marburg VP40 was inhibited by coexpression with dominant-negative mutants of Sar1; the efficiency of VLP production was reduced to 59% with Sar1_T39N and to 32% with Sar1_H79G (Fig. S7A).To characterize the inhibitory effects of Sar1 dominant-negative mutants on Marburg VP40-induced VLP production, Marburg VP40 was expressed in presence or absence of Sar1 dominant-negative mutants in 293 cells. Marburg VP40 accumulated to the multivesicular bodies (MVB), the budding site of Marburg virus (Fig. S7B, arrows), as reported previously (Kolesnikova et al., 2004). Coexpession of the wild-type Sar1 did not alter Marburg VP40 localization (+FLAG-Sar1 in Fig. S7B, arrows), while coexpression of Sar1 dominant-negative mutants reduced Marburg VP40 accumulation to the MVB (+FLAG-Sar1_T39N and +FLAG-Sar1_H79G in Fig. S7B, arrow heads). Since these data indicate that intracellular transport of Marburg VP40 to the viral budding site depends on the COPII transport system, we evaluated the interaction of Marburg VP40 with Sec24C biochemically and microscopically. Marburg VP40 (Fig. S7C) was not coprecipitated with Sec24C under conditions in which Ebola VP40 was efficiently precipitated, and did not colocalize with Sec24C (Fig. S7D). Similarly, HIV-1 gag or Lassa Z was not coprecipitated with Sec24C (Fig. S8A).We then compared the efficiency of VLP production in the shGFP, shSec24C, or shSar1 293 cells. Although the efficiency of VLP production was not appreciably reduced (93%) in shSec24C 293 cells, it was reduced to 57% in shSar1 293 cells (Fig. S7E). By contrast, the knockdown of Sec24C or Sar1 did not appreciably reduce VLP production induced by HIV-gag or Lassa Z protein (Fig. S8B).These results indicate that Marburg VP40 uses the COPII transport system for its intracellular transport but the specific interacting cellular protein appears to be different from that of Ebola VP40 (i.e., Sec24C). The results also show that this transport system is not involved in VLP production mediated by HIV-1 gag and Lassa Z proteins and that the inhibition of the secretory pathway by the knockdown of Sec24C or Sar1 does not have nonspecific, general inhibitory effects on the egress of enveloped viruses. DiscussionHere we show that Sec24C plays a critical role in the intracellular transport of Ebola VP40 to the plasma membrane. Amino acid substitutions in VP40 that abolished interaction with Sec24C and dominant-negative mutants of Sar1 that inhibited the COPII transport system interfered with the ability of VP40 to accumulate at the plasma membrane, suggesting that VP40 utilizes the COPII transport system though interaction with Sec24C during intracellular transport to the plasma membrane, an essential step for viral egress by VP40-mediated virion formation. Marburg VP40, but not HIV-1 and Lassa virus matrix proteins, also appear to use the COPII transport system for this purpose. This report is the first to demonstrate that viral matrix proteins exploit the COPII transport system for intracellular transport. Since the COPII transport system works at an initial step of secretory pathway in ER-Golgi transport under normal conditions, VP40 may encounter Sec24C at an early point of its intracellular transport, but the manner in which it is transported to the plasma membrane remains unclear. Since the intracellular locations of Sec24C and Sec23A shift to the plasma membrane upon coexpression with VP40, it is possible that transport of VP40 to the plasma membrane may be mediated by the COPII transport system. An example of such an altered intracellular localization of cellular proteins is Tsg101, which normally exists in late-endosome, but is recruited to the plasma membrane upon expression with Ebola VP40 (Panchal et al., 2003). Alternatively, the COPII transport system may play an initial role in the intracellular transport of VP40, followed by a role in other trafficking pathways [such as the COPI transport system (Bethune et al., 2006)], through which VP40 is eventually transported to the plasma membrane. Thus, it will be important to study other host proteins/machineries that might contribute to VP40 intracellular transport.Ebola VP40 interacts with Sec24C via amino acids 303-307 (303-LTMVI-307), which are conserved among all reported Ebola virus species and strains: Zaire Ebola virus, strain Mayinga (Accession No. {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAD14583\",\"term_id\":\"4262348\",\"term_text\":\"AAD14583\"}}AAD14583) and strain Gabon (Accession No. {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q2PDK5\",\"term_id\":\"110288015\",\"term_text\":\"Q2PDK5\"}}Q2PDK5); Sudan Ebola virus, strain Uganda (Accession No. {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q5XX06\",\"term_id\":\"81933487\",\"term_text\":\"Q5XX06\"}}Q5XX06) and strain Gulu (Accession No. YP138522); Reston Ebola virus, strain Reston (Accession No. {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q91DD9\",\"term_id\":\"81961764\",\"term_text\":\"Q91DD9\"}}Q91DD9) and strain Pennsylvania (Accession No. {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AAN04450\",\"term_id\":\"22671626\",\"term_text\":\"AAN04450\"}}AAN04450). The crystal structure of VP40 (Dessen et al., 2000) indicates that this region is exposed on its surface and is folded into a \u03b2-strand with amino acids extending to position 310, supporting the possibility that the VP40 molecule interacts with Sec24C via these amino acids. Interestingly, amino acids at positions 303-307 are not conserved between Ebola and Marburg VP40s. Although both Ebola and Marbrug VP40s use the COPII transport system for their intracellular transport to the budding site, the former (Figs. 1C and 1D), but not the latter (Fig. S7C), interacts with Sec24C. Since the Sec24 family has four members, Sec24A, Sec24B, Sec24C, and Sec24D, Marburg VP40 may interact with Sec24 family members other than Sec24C during its intracellular transport. The cocrystallization of Ebola VP40 with Sec24C should reveal Sec24 interaction with these matrix proteins at the atomic level. The Sec24C domains responsible for interaction with cargos are not fully defined. In general, Sec24 recognizes specific motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins, such as the di-acidic motif first discovered in VSV-G (Nishimura and Balch, 1997) and the di-phenylalanine motifs found in the ERGIC-53 (Kappeler et al., 1997) and p24 proteins (Fiedler et al., 1996), via its cargo-binding domains (Bickford et al., 2004). Since the interaction region on VP40 differs from these motifs, and VP40 is not a transmembrane protein, VP40 might interact with Sec24C via a novel site on Sec24C.Because the transport of COPII-coated vesicles from the ER to the Golgi is microtubule-dependent (Presley et al., 1997), COPII-coated vesicles must be coupled to microtubules and motor proteins recruited as the driving forces. In fact, the COPII complex directly binds to dynactin (a component of a motor protein dynien associated with microtubules) via the p150Glued subunit (Watson et al., 2005), and COPII transport is inhibited by treatment with nocodazole (Presley et al., 1997), which causes microtubule depolymerization. In accord with these findings, we have shown that VP40-induced VLP production is also inhibited by microtubule disruption due to nocodazole treatment (Noda et al., 2006). Taken together, the data indicate that VP40 may be transported within cells via the COPII transport system, which is dependent on microtubules.A reduction in VLP production with FLAG-VP40_M305A showing an increased level of interaction with Sec24C provided valuable insight into the processes underlying VP40 intracellular transport and its involvement in virus budding. This finding suggests that VP40 transport to the plasma membrane is initiated via the COPII transport system through interaction with Sec24C and then dissociates from the COPII complex, followed by interaction with proteins associated with ESCRT complexes, such as Tsg101 and Nedd4, to initiate virus budding. Thus, a strong association of VP40 with Sec24C likely inhibits the proper transition of VP40 to other host machineries for the next steps in virus budding. Whether VP40 interacts with cellular proteins within ESCRT complexes, such as Tsg101 and Nedd4, immediately after dissociation from the COPII complex or whether other host mechanisms are involved remains unknown. A full understanding of Ebola virus budding will require studies to clarify how VP40 proceeds to function at the viral budding site.Unlike the VP40 of Ebola and Marburg viruses, the matrix proteins of HIV-1 gag and Lassa virus Z do not appear to use the COPII transport system. The latter proteins differ from the former in that they are myristoylated, an essential modification for their membrane association and virus budding (Gottlinger et al., 1989; Perez et al., 2004). Thus, myristoylated proteins may use a different intracellular transport pathway than the one selected by VP40.Three multiple alanine scanning mutants, FLAG-VP40_286-288A, FLAG-VP40_289-291A, and FLAG-VP40_314-316A, interacted with Sec24C in a manner similar to that of the wild-type VP40, but showed reduced VLP production and reduced accumulation at the plasma membrane. This result can be explained in at least two ways. First, unknown host factors may fail to interact with these mutant VP40s. In fact, the region spanning amino acids 286 to 291 has been reported to be a part of a Crk SH3-binding site, composed of proline-rich, hydrophobic amino acids (Aman et al., 2003). Although this region is not exposed on the surface of VP40 molecule base on the three-dimensional structure analysis (Dessen et al., 2000), it could still be transiently exposed. Secondly, amino acid changes at these positions may have altered the conformation of VP40. Further studies will help to clarify whether Crk or its related proteins are involved in VP40 intracellular transport.In summary, our data suggest that Ebola VP40 relies on the COPII transport system via interaction with Sec24C for its intracellular transport. This system is responsible for vesicular transport from the ER to the Golgi and is not thought to be involved in cargo transport to the plasma membrane. Thus, it will be important to clarify how the COPII complex transports VP40 to the cell surface and how VP40 dissociation from the complex is triggered. This information would greatly enhance our understanding of the Ebola virus life cycle and may thus provide a useful platform on which to develop novel strategies to combat Ebola virus infections. Experimental ProceduresCellsHuman embryonic kidney cells (293 cells and 293T cells) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and a penicillin-streptomycin solution (SIGMA). shSec24C 293 cells, shSar1 293 cells and shGFP 293 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS and a penicillin-streptomycin solution and puromicin (1\u03bcg/ml). These cells were grown in an incubator at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2.A tandem-tag-based pull-down assayA tandem-tag-based pull-down assay was performed as previously reported (Nakatani and Ogryzko, 2003) with some modifications. Briefly, 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing FH-VP40 or VP40 were collected at 24 hours post-transfection, lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail complete mini (Roche)), and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. After clarification by low-speed centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (SIGMA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The FLAG-agarose beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and the binding proteins eluted with FLAG elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, and 0.5mg/ml FLAG peptide [SIGMA]) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. After the FLAG-agarose beads were removed by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-HA agarose conjugate clone HA-7 (SIGMA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then eluted with HA elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 1M NaCl, and 0.5mg/ml HA peptide (SIGMA)) for 6 hours at 4\u00b0C. The final eluted mixtures were then removed from the HA-agarose beads, dialyzed with 50mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.5) for 6 hours at 4\u00b0C, and freeze dried. The dried protein mixtures were suspended in sample buffer (Invitrogen), incubated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS system analysis (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) for identification of coimmunoprecipitated host proteins.Immunoprecipitation assay293T cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing various FLAG-tagged proteins and cMyc-tagged or authentic Sec24C or 293 cells infected with Ebola virus were lysed in lysis buffer, and maintained for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. After clarification by centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel, or anti-VP40 antibody, followed by protein G sepharose (GE Healthcare), overnight at 4\u00b0C. A fraction of the supernatant was then mixed with tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, suspended in tricine sample buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. After the FLAG beads were removed by centrifugation, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed either by Western blot analysis with a rabbit anti-cMyc antibody (SIGMA), a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (SIGMA), a rabbit anti-Sec24C antibody (kindly provided by Dr. J.P. Paccaud, University of Basel) (Pagano et al., 1999), a rabbit anti-Sec23 antibody (Affinity BioReagents), a rabbit anti-NP antibody (Noda et al., 2006), a mouse anti-GP antibody (Watanabe et al., 2004), an anti-VP24 antibody (Watanabe et al., 2007), or a rabbit anti-VP40 antibody (Noda et al., 2006), or by Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) staining with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen).Infection of Zaire Ebola virusConfluent 293 cells were infected with Zaire Ebola virus (Neumann et al., 2005) at an MOI of 1. After 1h at 37\u00b0C, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with DMEM. Infected cells were maintained in DMEM supplement with 2% FCS for three days and then used for immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-VP40 antibody. All work with infectious Ebola virus was performed in the biosafety level 4 laboratories at the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba.VLP release assayAt 24 or 48 hours post-transfection of the cells with plasmids expressing virus matrix proteins in the presence or absence of FLAG-Sar1, FLAG-Sar1_T39N, or FLAG-Sar1_H79G, the culture media were harvested and cleared of cell debris. The cleared supernatants were then layered onto a 20% sucrose cushion and ultracentrifuged in an SW55 rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellet containing VLP was suspended in PBS and mixed with tricine sample buffer. The VLP samples were then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min before being resolved on 10%-20% tricine gels (Invitrogen). The plasmid-transfected cells were also suspended in PBS, mixed with tricine sample buffer, and resolved on 10%-20% tricine gels. Resolved proteins were detected with a rabbit anti-VP40 antibody, a mouse anti-FLAG antibody, a mouse anti-p24 antibody (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.), or a mouse anti-cMyc antibody (SIGMA) by Western blot analysis.Immunofluorescence Assay293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged alanine scanning mutants of VP40 or VP40, cMyc-Sec24C and FLAG-Sec23A. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Antigens were detected with a rabbit anti-VP40 or a rabbit anti-cMyc antibody and a mouse anti-FLAG antibody, as the primary antibody, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). In some experiments, nuclei were stained with 4\u2019, 6\u2019-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Slides were imaged by confocal microscopy using an LSM510 system (Carl Zeiss).Living cell imaging293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Venus-VP40 and FLAG-Sar1, FLAG-Sar1_T39N or FLAG-Sar1_H79G. After 24 hours, the cells were stained with 1\u03bcM ER-tracker Blue-White (Molecular Probes) and imaged with an LSM510 confocal microscope.
