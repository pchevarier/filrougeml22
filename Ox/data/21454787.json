Here, we show that the CTD of RNAPII is methylated at a single arginine (R1810) by the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). Although methylation at R1810 is present on the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAPII in vivo, Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylation inhibits CARM1 activity toward this site in vitro, suggesting that methylation occurs before transcription initiation. Mutation of R1810 results in the misexpression of a variety of small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs, an effect that is also observed in Carm1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryo fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that CTD methylation facilitates the expression of select RNAs, perhaps serving to discriminate the RNAPII-associated machinery recruited to distinct gene types. The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the major subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in mammals comprises 52 repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser (1). Although site-specific CTD phosphorylation mediates recruitment of other proteins to RNAPII, how this recruitment facilitates distinct processing events remains poorly understood (2\u20134). Nonconsensus repeats of the RNAPII CTD contain two arginine and seven lysine substitutions that primarily occur at position seven of the heptad motif. We hypothesized that such arginine and/or lysine residues might be targets for modification of the CTD of RNAPII and, as a consequence, engage activities associated with RNA production.A glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013CTD fusion protein containing repeats number 24\u201352 was not acetylated by HeLa-S3 nuclear extract as a source of enzymes, but specific methylation of the GST-CTD was observed, and its level correlated with increasing amounts of the extract (Fig. 1A). We purified the CTD methyltransferase enzyme from this extract (Fig. 1, B and C), detecting a band at ~65 kD that was crosslinked to a S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) after ultraviolet exposure (fig. S1B) (5). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), which migrates at a molecular mass of approximately 65 kD by means of SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). To ascertain whether CARM1 was the enzyme that methylates the CTD, we performed methylation reactions using increasing amounts of recombinant CARM1 in the presence of the CTD and confirmed that CARM1 is capable of catalyzing this modification (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis of the Superose 6 gel filtration fractions derived from conventional purification revealed that CARM1 and the CTD methyltransferase activity co-eluted (fig. S1C) (5). Given that we did not detect any CTD methyltransferase activity that fractionated apart from CARM1 during the purification and that nuclear extracts derived from Carm1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were devoid of this activity (Fig. 1E), we concluded that CARM1 is the enzyme responsible for methylating the CTD. CARM1 is a type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) that catalyzes a methyltransferase reaction, producing asymmetric dimethylated arginine. Its substrates include histone H3 and p300, and it has been implicated in co-activation of nuclear receptor\u2013directed transcription as well as in mRNA splicing (6,7), although the underlying mechanisms are largely obscure.Open in a separate windowFig. 1CARM1 methylates the CTD of RNAPII.

(Bottom) GST-CTD phosphorylation assay with the same extracts.The largest subunit of RNAPII contains two arginine residues within the CTD; one is present within the N-terminal half of the CTD (R1603, second repeat), and the other within the C-terminal half (R1810, repeat number 31) (8). We tested whether both arginines are targets of CARM1 using methylation assays with GST fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal (GST-N-CTD) or C-terminal (GST-C-CTD) portions of the CTD. Only the GST-C-CTD substrate was methylated by recombinant CARM1, indicating that CARM1 targets R1810 (Fig. 2A). An alignment of the residues surrounding R1810 from different species suggests that CARM1 methylation may be conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 2B).Open in a separate windowFig. 2The hypophosphorylated form of the RNAPII CTD is methylated on a single arginine residue, and phosphorylated CTD cannot be methylated in vitro.

Bars represent the mean T SD of three different experiments.CARM1 methylated highly purified RNAP II derived from HeLa-S3 cells (Fig. 2C): Only the hypophosphorylated (IIA) form of RNAPII was methylated; the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAPII (IIO) was not. Methylation experiments by use of the CTD fusion protein that was prephosphorylated by Ser5- (CAK) or Ser2-specific (P-TEFb) kinases suggest that CARM1 methylation is sensitive to Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, CARM1 was ineffectual when provided with synthetic peptides that were phosphorylated at Ser2 or Ser5 as substrates (Fig. 2, E and F). Phosphatase treatment of these peptides restored their ability to be methylated by CARM1 (Fig. 2G). The CTD of RNAPII is phosphorylated during the initiation of transcription; CARM1-mediated methylation probably takes place before phosphorylation, which is consistent with its recruitment during the early phases of transcriptional activation (9, 10). Immunofluorescence analyses performed on MEF cells by using a polyclonal antibody against a CTD peptide containing R1810me2a (fig. S2, A and B) showed that this modification is localized in the nuclei, which is similar to the case of phosphorylated CTD (anti-pSer5, clone 4H8) (Fig. 3A). Carm1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were devoid of CARM1, as expected (Fig. 3B) and also devoid of methylated CTD, as evidenced by the absence of signal using antibodies to CTDRme2a (anti-CTDRme2a) (Fig. 3A), which supports the conclusion that the CTD is methylated in vivo by CARM1. The anti-CTDme2a signal observed by using MEF cells was blocked by CTDme2a peptide but not by other synthetic peptides that are analog to CARM1 products, namely H3R26me2a or a symmetrically methylated peptide H4R3me2s (Fig. 3C). Using this antibody on Western blots, we detected methylation on hyperphosphorylated RNAPII purified from HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). Thus, CARM1 methylates the CTD of RNAPII in vivo and does so before the CTD is phosphorylated. Yet given that the methylated CTD is a substrate for subsequent phosphorylation and that phosphorylated RNAPII exhibits this methylation state (Fig. 3D), it is highly probable that R1810me is preserved on the transcribing polymerase, not having a major impact on CTD phosphorylation. To address the function of RNAPII methylation, we generated cell lines expressing an RNAPII resistant to a-amanitin and carrying either wildtype (WT) R1810 or an arginine-to-alanine substitution at that same residue, abolishing R1810 methylation of the CTD (Fig. 4A). In cells cultured in aamanitin, the a-amanitin\u2013resistant mutants fully replaced the functions of endogenous RNAPII, allowing us to study whether gene expression is affected by the absence of R1810me (11). Our transcriptome analysis results suggest that steady state levels of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) as well as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are affected in a general manner (Fig. 4B and fig. S3). We confirmed these results for a number of candidate transcripts through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total RNA derived from WT or R1810A cells (Fig. 4C). Because a large number of snRNAs and snoRNAs were affected, we asked whether there was a general correlation between the size of the RNA species whose expression was affected as a consequence of the absence of R1810me (fig. S4). The effect appeared specific to snRNAs and snoRNAs, however, because transcripts of comparable size with that of snRNAs and snoRNAs but belonging to different classes of RNA were not upregulated. Also, expression of RNAPIII-transcribed small RNAs, such as 5S and U6, was not affected (Fig. 4B, bottom plots). The misregulation of snRNA expression was also detected in Carm1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs through quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the functions of CARM1 and R1810me are related and that they are conserved, at least in mammals. The observed de-repression of snRNAs and snoRNAs in the absence of R1810me suggests that this CTD modification functions in opposition to the activating effect of Ser phosphorylation (12\u201314). In addition to the direct function of CARM1 in splicing, in which it modulates the recognition of 5\u2032 splice sites through its interaction with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (15), CARM1 may also contribute to splicing indirectly through modulating the levels of spliceosome components, such as U1 and U2 (Fig. 4).Open in a separate windowFig. 3The CTD of RNAPII is methylated in vivo.

Tudor domain\u2013containing proteins SMN, SPF30, and TDRD3 bind preferentially to both symmetric and asymmetric dimethyl arginine in the context of Gly-Arg patches (GR motifs). TDRD3 displayed a specific interaction with the R1810me2a-containing CTD peptide, as opposed to the unmodified CTD or mono- or symmetric-dimethylated R1810 (Fig. 5). In contrast, SMN and SPF30 did not exhibit affinity for either the unmodified CTD or any methylated version thereof. TDRD3 can be recruited to chromatin in a CARM1-dependent manner, although it is not clear whether histones or other substrates of CARM1 are recognized by this Tudor domain\u2013containing protein (19). On the basis of the crystal structure of the TDRD3 tudor domain (Protein Data Bank ID 2D9T), we mutated residues typically responsible for binding to methylated arginines (Fig. 5, bottom). The relevant TDRD3 mutants did not bind R1810me2a, demonstrating that TDRD3 interaction with dimethyl-R1810 probably depends on an aromatic cage structure within its tudor domain. However, knockdown of TDRD3 did not result in the same genome-wide alterations of snRNA and snoRNA expression as in the case of either the R1810A mutant or Carm1\u2212/\u2212 cells (fig. S5), suggesting that TDRD3 may be involved in a different function of CTD methylation, unrelated to snRNA and snoRNA regulation. We have shown here that the CTD of RNAPII is methylated at R1810 by CARM1 in vitro and in vivo. This modification plays a role in the regulation of snRNA and snoRNA expression. In addition, the tudor domain of TDRD3 specifically recognizes CTD-R1810me2a. Although TDRD3 does not play a role in the regulation of snoRNA expression, it could very well participate in different downstream functions of CTD-R1810me2a.Open in a separate windowFig. 5The methylated CTD is recognized selectively by TDRD3. Shown are silver staining of fractions eluted from the immobilized biotinylated peptides containing different modifications at R1810, as indicated on top. TDRD3 tudor domain selectively recognized the R1810me2a peptide. Mutations at the indicated TDRD3 aromatic residues abolished binding.
