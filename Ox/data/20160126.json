The coordinated induction of both IGF-I promoters by GH is accompanied by hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in promoter-associated chromatin, a decline in monomethylation at lysine 4 of histone H3, and recruitment of RNA Pol II to IGF-I promoter 2. We conclude that GH actions induce rapid and dramatic changes in hepatic chromatin at the IGF-I locus and activate IGF-I gene transcription in the liver by distinct promoter-specific mechanisms: at promoter 1, GH causes RNA Pol II to be released from a previously recruited paused preinitiation complex, whereas at promoter 2, hormone treatment facilitates recruitment and then activation of RNA Pol II to initiate transcription. GH plays a fundamental role in many physiological processes in most vertebrate species, including somatic growth, tissue differentiation and repair, and intermediary metabolism (1) and also has been implicated in the negative aspects of aging and in the development of certain cancers (2,3,4,5). Many of the actions of GH are mediated by IGF-I (6), a secreted 70-amino acid circulating peptide whose expression is rapidly and potently induced by GH (7,8,9). GH promotes production of both IGF-I mRNA and protein in the liver and in other tissues through activation of IGF-I gene transcription and additionally contributes to stabilization of circulating IGF-I through stimulation of hepatic expression of IGF-binding protein-3 and acid-labile subunit (8,10,11,12), components of the 150-kDa ternary protein complex that binds IGF-I in the blood (13,14). It is thus of considerable interest to characterize the mechanisms of regulation of IGF-I by GH.Recent studies in both experimental animals and in humans with growth deficiency have shown that the transcription factor Stat5b plays a key role in transmitting signals from the cytoplasm, initiated by binding of GH to its cell-membrane receptor into the nucleus to regulate gene expression, including inducing IGF-I gene transcription (15,16). To date, however, the molecular mechanisms by which GH-activated Stat5b promotes IGF-I gene activity have not been defined. The six-exon IGF-I gene contains two promoters with distinct tissue-limited profiles of expression (17,18,19) that govern production of multiple IGF-I mRNAs (19). The liver is one of few tissues in which both promoters are active (18,20), yet the fundamentals of IGF-I promoter function remain largely uncharacterized beyond identification of binding sites for some liver-enriched and other more broadly expressed transcription factors in promoter 1 (21,22,23,24). More critically, the mechanisms of promoter regulation by GH remain unknown. Here we assess the acute effects of GH on IGF-I promoter function in an animal model, the hypophysectomized rat, that resembles acquired GH deficiency in humans. We find that a single systemic GH injection to hormone-deficient male rats causes rapid changes in chromatin structure at both IGF-I promoters in the liver, consisting of immediate stimulation of core histone acetylation and modifications in histone methylation. These rapid epigenetic effects of GH in the liver are accompanied by distinct modes of activation of each IGF-I promoter. At IGF-I promoter 1, RNA polymerase (Pol) II is already present in a preinitiation complex in the absence of GH and then is activated by hormone treatment but is recruited by GH to promoter 2. Thus, our results, which show that GH-mediated signaling causes acute alterations in hepatic chromatin architecture at the IGF-I locus, also demonstrate that GH activates IGF-I gene transcription in the liver via distinct promoter-specific mechanisms. Results and DiscussionGH acutely activates IGF-I gene transcription from both promotersTo assess regulation of IGF-I promoter function by GH, we have used an in vivo model of hypophysectomized juvenile male rats treated acutely with a single systemic GH injection (8,15,25). In this well-documented model, GH caused an increase in the abundance of mature IGF-I mRNA in the liver within 60 min of hormone treatment, and transcript levels remained elevated for at least 6 h (Fig. 1A\u200b1A),), as shown previously (8). The peak amount of hepatic IGF-I mRNA seen after GH reached about 50% of values found in pituitary intact male rats of the same age (WT in Fig. 1A\u200b1A),), consistent with previous reports (8). By contrast with IGF-I, steady-state levels of S17 and GADPH mRNAs were unchanged by GH (Fig. 1A\u200b1A).Open in a separate windowFigure 1GH rapidly stimulates IGF-I gene transcription. A, Time-course studies of IGF-I, S17, and GAPDH mRNA levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR after GH treatment of pituitary-deficient rats and in pituitary-intact wild-type (WT) rats not treated with GH. Cycle numbers ranged from 30 (for IGF-I and GAPDH) to 35 (for S17). B, Time course of accumulation of nascent nuclear transcripts for IGF-I, S17, and GAPDH genes after GH treatment, measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Cycle numbers ranged from 31 [for IGF-I exon 1/intron 1 (ex1/int1) and exon 2/intron 2 (ex2/int2) to 34 (for S17)]. Negative controls from nuclear RNA from the 60-min time point prepared without reverse transcriptase (\u2212RT) are also shown and compared with GH 60 plus RT. C, Time course of accumulation of nascent nuclear transcripts for IGF-I, S17, and albumin genes after GH, measured by qRT-PCR, normalized to GAPDH, and quantified by using genomic DNA to generate standard curves (see Supplemental Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods for details). All results shown for A, B, and C are representative of at least three independent experiments. DNA sequences for primers used in A and B may be found in Table 1\u200b1 and for C in Table 3\u200b3.The primers used in the RT-PCR experiment in Fig. 1A\u200b1A are derived from exons 3 and 4 of the six-exon IGF-I gene, which detect expression of mature IGF-I transcripts, and do not separate mRNAs containing either exons 1 or 2, which originate uniquely from IGF-I promoters 1 or 2, respectively (18,19). We have shown previously, using both a semiquantitative RT-PCR assay with cDNA derived from nuclear RNA as the template and by nuclear run-on assays, that GH causes rapid induction of IGF-I gene transcription in the liver (8,15,25) but have not been able to directly assess the effects of GH on individual promoter activity. As depicted in Fig. 1B\u200b1B,, GH stimulates production of nascent nuclear IGF-I transcripts within 30 min of systemic hormone administration. Although these data show clearly with primer pairs derived from exon 1 and intron 1 (detecting nascent RNA directed by promoter 1), that IGF-I promoter 1 was activated by GH, results with primers from exon 2 and intron 2 were equivocal, because they do not allow separation of transcripts directed by the more 3\u2032 promoter 2 from elongation of nascent RNA initiating from the more 5\u2032 promoter 1 (see gene diagram in Fig. 2\u200b2).). To determine whether GH activates both IGF-I promoters in the liver, we developed a quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay for nascent nuclear transcripts, using cDNA generated from hepatic nuclear RNA as the test template for PCR and deriving standard curves for each primer pair with genomic DNA for quantification of transcript abundance (for details, see Supplemental Fig. 1 published on The Endocrine Society\u2019s Journals Online web site at http://mend.endojournals.org). We then measured the initial accumulation of primary nuclear RNA containing either IGF-I intron 1 or intron 2. Results showed that GH stimulated a more than 7-fold increase in unprocessed hepatic nuclear RNA within 30 min of systemic hormone treatment and a greater than 15-fold rise by 60 min (Fig. 1C\u200b1C).). Because at the latter time point, nascent transcripts containing intron 2 appeared to be about 50% more abundant than those containing intron 1, we interpret these results to indicate that GH activates both IGF-I promoters in the liver, with two thirds of GH-stimulated transcription directed by promoter 1 and one third by promoter 2, in good agreement with previous observations made by measuring accumulation of hepatic IGF-I mRNAs containing exon 1 or exon 2 (8,18,26). This quantitative assay also allows us to compare transcription rates of different genes in response to the same hormonal stimulus. In the absence of GH, IGF-I gene transcription is modest, with the activity of each promoter being no more than approximately five times the level of either S17 or GAPDH genes, which are each transcribed at a constitutively low rate (Fig. 1C\u200b1C,, Supplemental Fig. 1, and data not shown). In contrast, albumin, a highly expressed liver-specific gene, is transcribed at an approximately 1000 times higher rate than IGF-I (Fig. 1C\u200b1C and Supplemental Fig. 1). After a single systemic GH injection, S17 gene transcription was unchanged, whereas IGF-I transcription rose dramatically, and albumin transcription decreased by about 30%, as has been described (8,25), such that IGF-I gene transcription rates now approached 5% of those of albumin by 60 min after hormone administration (Fig. 1C\u200b1C).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Stat5b is not recruited to the IGF-I promoters by GH. Results are depicted of ChIP experiments assessing binding of Stat5b to the IGF-I promoters in hepatic chromatin of pituitary-deficient rats before (light gray bars) or 60 min after a single systemic GH injection (dark gray bars). The map above the graph shows the IGF-I gene and locations of 12 primer sets tiled across approximately 6.2 kb genomic DNA spanning both IGF-I promoters and the HS7 region (see Table 2\u200b2).). Numbers on the graph indicate the position of the central base pair of the amplicon relative to the most 5\u2032 transcription start site in IGF-I exon 1 and correspond with the schematic above (18). The positive control represents paired Stat5 binding sites in IGF-I intron 3 (31,32). Results are expressed as the percentage of input DNA necessary to achieve the detected amplification and are representative of at least three independent experiments.Absence of Stat5b binding sites at the IGF-I promotersUnlike several other GH-responsive and Stat5b-regulated genes (12,27,28,29,30), there are no canonical Stat5 binding sites in the proximal regions of the two IGF-I promoters, although binding of Stat5b to the IGF-I promoters has not been comprehensively evaluated in previous published studies (31,32). Although there are several putative GH-dependent Stat5 binding regions in chromatin within the IGF-I locus (30,31,32,33,34), only a Stat5-binding DNA segment termed HS7 has been mapped within the vicinity of the two promoters, being found in intron 2 about 1.6 kb 3\u2032 to exon 2 (Fig. 2A\u200b2A)) (33). To determine whether GH causes recruitment of Stat5b to the IGF-I promoters, we performed quantitative Stat5 chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) experiments with 12 nearly equally spaced primer pairs that spanned an approximately 6.2-kb region extending from the 5\u2032 end of promoter 1 to 500 bp 3\u2032 to HS7 in IGF-I intron 2 (Fig. 2\u200b2).). We reasoned that the amplicons generated by these primer pairs would allow us to survey the entire region, because our ChIP protocol leads to DNA fragments of average size of 500 \u00b1 100 bp (33). Furthermore, because most of the Stat5 in the liver is Stat5b (35), the pan-Stat5 antibody used for the immunoprecipitation step would measure Stat5b. Results show that binding of Stat5b is enriched by acute systemic GH treatment only at the HS7 region (>5-fold increase at 60 min, amplicons centering on +3250, +3740, and +4247) and that little Stat5b becomes associated with either IGF-I promoter (amplicons centering on \u22121036, \u2212541, and +10 for promoter 1 and +1291, +1746, and +2232 for promoter 2). By contrast, a recently identified putative Stat5b site within IGF-I intron 3, located 44 kb 3\u2032 to promoter 1 (31,32), shows much stronger GH-inducible binding (10-fold increase after hormone to levels more than three times higher than HS7; Fig. 2\u200b2).). Because Stat5b is required for GH-stimulated IGF-I gene transcription in vivo (15), we interpret the failure to detect a substantial association of Stat5b with either IGF-I promoter by ChIP to primarily reflect an absence of direct binding sites (although it should be noted that there appears to be some binding to each promoter). Other experimental approaches, such as 3C assay (36,37), will be needed to more definitively discern any indirect recruitment of activated Stat5b to the IGF-I promoters in response to GH via protein-protein interactions.GH induces histone acetylation at the IGF-I promotersModifications that open chromatin, including core histone acetylation and methylation, characteristically accompany gene activation (38), but very little is known about the chromatin landscape of the IGF-I gene. Previous studies, using relatively crude measurements of nuclease hypersensitivity as an index of chromatin status, showed that opening of promoter 1 accompanied postnatal developmental activation of IGF-I gene expression in the liver of juvenile rats (39) but did not identify any substantive changes in chromatin organization in either promoter in response to GH (8). To address the impact of GH on IGF-I chromatin structure, we first evaluated acetylation of histones in nucleosomes in and around the two IGF-I promoters by quantitative ChIP with acetyl H3 (recognizes acetyl K9 and 14) and acetyl H4 (acetyl K5, 8, 12, and 16) antibodies and the tiled primer series as above. Although it appears that in the absence of GH, there is little acetylation of either histones H3 or H4 (Fig. 3\u200b3,, A and B, and Supplemental Fig. 2, light gray bars), the values measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) were at least 10 times higher at the two promoters in GH-deficient rats than at a chromatin segment located 10 kb 5\u2032 to promoter 1 (see Supplemental Fig. 3). Within 60 min of systemic GH injection, a dramatic rise in acetylation of both core histones was observed throughout the entire 6.2-kb region, with the extent of increase over the GH-deficient state being variable but averaging approximately 6-fold (range 3- to 20-fold, Fig. 3\u200b3,, A and B, and Supplemental Fig. 2, dark gray bars). We also found that GH-stimulated histone acetylation encompassed an even broader region of genomic DNA at the 5\u2032 end of the IGF-I gene, as determined from results of a ChIP-chip experiment, which revealed that GH-induced enrichment of acetylated histone H3 spanned a chromosomal segment of about 10 kb, extending from \u22125 to +5 kb with respect to the first transcription start site in IGF-I exon 1 but was dramatically lower in the intergenic chromatin found further 5\u2032 and in IGF-I intron 3, located in the further 3\u2032 direction (Fig. 4\u200b4).Open in a separate windowFigure 3GH induces histone H3 and H4 acetylation at both IGF-I promoters. The graphs depict results of ChIP experiments assessing acetylation of histone H3 (A) and H4 (B) and binding of p300 (C) at the IGF-I promoters in hepatic chromatin of pituitary-deficient rats before (light gray bars) or 60 min after (dark gray bars) a single systemic GH injection. Depicted results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Additional details may be found in the legend to Fig. 2\u200b2.Open in a separate windowFigure 4GH-induced histone H3 acetylation extends over the 5\u2032 end of the IGF-I gene. The top graph depicts results of an acetyl histone H3 ChIP-chip experiment using hepatic chromatin from a pituitary-deficient rat treated with systemic GH for 60 min. Illustrated is a 50-kb genomic segment extending from 40 kb 5\u2032 to the start of IGF-I exon 1 into intron 3 in the body of the gene (+10 kb). The gray line describes histone H3 acetylation for the entire region and was compiled at each location from the average of five consecutive features in the tiled area. The gray box denotes the z-score range from \u22121.0 to +1.0. The bottom graph depicts a higher-resolution view of the segment from \u221210 to +10 kb with respect to the first transcription start site in IGF-I exon 1. The vertical lines represent peaks of enhanced histone H3 acetylation, as defined by three consecutive features from the tiled array with a z-score higher than +1.0. The dark box denotes a z-score of +1.0, and the larger light box +5.0. Note that no features from \u221240 to \u221210 kb met the criteria for a peak. See Materials and Methods for details.Localized increases in acetylation of histone tails within chromatin are caused by a net rise in histone acetyltransferase activity. We thus asked next whether the histone acetyltransferase and transcriptional coactivator p300 was recruited to the IGF-I promoters during GH-induced gene transcription. We focused on p300 because a positive role for this protein has been established previously for other genes activated by Stat5a or Stat5b (40,41) and because the coactivator was found to interact physically with both Stat5 proteins (40). Moreover, because p300 can acetylate lysine residues in the tails of both histones H3 and H4 (42), in aggregate, it seemed to be a strong candidate for an acetyltransferase recruited by GH. Surprisingly, we found that p300 was abundantly associated with chromatin at IGF-I promoter 1 in the absence of GH but was present at much lower levels at promoter 2 (Fig. 3C\u200b3C,, light gray bars). Furthermore, systemic GH treatment caused at best a small increase in p300 at each IGF-I promoter, such that the amount found at promoter 2 remained far less than at promoter 1. In addition, the abundance of p300 at IGF-I promoter 2 was dwarfed by the magnitude of GH-stimulated histone acetylation. We thus conclude that p300 cannot be the sole acetyltransferase responsible for the dramatic increase in GH-stimulated histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the IGF-I promoters, although it is likely to be a major contributor to activity at promoter 1. The transcriptional coactivator SRC3 (termed AIB1 and p/CIP) (43) also has acetyltransferase activity and had been postulated previously to regulate IGF-I gene expression, based on results of targeted gene knockout experiments in mice (44), but subsequent studies have not supported this hypothesis (45). It is possible that a posttranslational modification of p300 induced by GH, such as phosphorylation (46), could increase its enzymatic activity, although this would be very difficult to assess by ChIP. Alternatively, GH could recruit additional histone acetyltransferases to the IGF-I promoters (e.g. p300-associated P/CAF) (47) or could interfere with activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), thus tipping the balance toward enhanced core histone acetylation and more open chromatin. In support of this latter idea, recent observations have shown that sphingosine-1-phosphate, produced in the nucleus by sphingosine kinase 2, can block HDACs 1 and 2 and promote acetylation of histone H3 in chromatin at selected gene promoters (48). Further studies will be needed to determine whether GH-mediated signaling can influence the activity of sphingosine kinase 2 or can regulate specific histone acetyltransferases or HDACs by other mechanisms.GH acutely modifies histone lysine methylation at the IGF-I promotersWe next assessed the histone methylation status at the IGF-I promoters, specifically focusing on lysine 4 (K4) of histone H3, because this modification has been well defined in transcribed genes (38,49). Trimethylated H3-K4 (H3K4me3) characteristically peaks at the 5\u2032 end of an active gene (50), whereas monomethylated H3-K4 (H3K4me1) predominates toward the 3\u2032 end of a gene (51,52) and also has been proposed to comprise part of the chromatin signature of enhancers (49). Results of quantitative ChIP experiments for H3K4me3 revealed a robust enrichment across both promoters in the absence of GH that was up to 20-fold higher than adjacent DNA (\u22122004 in Fig. 5A\u200b5A;; also see Supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, except for the segment flanking the Stat5b binding sites at HS7 (+3250 to +4247), in which GH stimulated a 2-fold increase in H3K4me3, no changes were observed upon hormone treatment. In contrast, the amount of H3K4me1 underwent a decline within 60 min after GH that appeared to be more pronounced over the transcription start sites of exons 1 and 2 (from +10 to +2850) than elsewhere in the promoter region but was measurable over the approximately 5 kb from \u22121036 to +4247 (Fig. 5B\u200b5B).). Of the eight known mammalian K4 methyltransferases (53), the ones that modify chromatin at the IGF-I promoters in the absence of GH remain to be identified, as do mechanisms that lead to GH-induced loss of histone H3K4 monomethylation without an associated increase in trimethylation. This latter outcome could be secondary to recruitment and/or activation of a specific H3K4me1 demethylase, such as lysine-specific demethylase 1 (53), or to stimulation of a lysine methyltransferase, although the absence of an increase in H3K4 trimethylation renders this latter possibility unlikely. Further studies are needed to define the specifics of GH-regulated changes in histone methylation at the IGF-I promoters and to determine whether alterations in histone H3K4 methylation are part of the acute epigenetic actions of GH.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Evidence for modified histone lysine methylation at both IGF-I promoters. The graphs illustrate results of ChIP experiments assessing trimethylation (A) or monomethylation (B) of lysine 4 of histone H3 at the IGF-I promoters in hepatic chromatin of pituitary-deficient rats before (light gray bars) or 60 min after (dark gray bars) a single systemic GH injection. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments. For additional details, see the legend to Fig. 2\u200b2.Distinct modes of RNA Pol II activation by GH: RNA Pol II is present at IGF-I promoter 1 in the absence of GH but is recruited to promoter 2 by hormone treatmentClassically, the final steps in eukaryotic gene activation first involve recruitment of RNA Pol II to the gene promoter, followed by carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation at serine 5 by the CDK7 subunit of TFIIH (54), leading to onset of transcription, as measured by initiation and elongation of nascent RNA (55). Although for many eukaryotic genes, recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoter is the rate-limiting step for transcriptional activation (55), regulation at the level of initiation/elongation from a previously recruited but paused or poised polymerase has been recognized recently to be a major transcriptional control point for other genes (55,56). Of note in this regard are recent studies showing enrichment of RNA Pol II at about 36% of inactive gene promoters in primary human hepatocytes (57). To determine whether GH treatment recruits or activates RNA Pol II at the IGF-I promoters, we performed a series of quantitative ChIP experiments using the primers described above. The results show that Pol II is present at promoter 1 in liver chromatin in GH-deficient rats (Fig. 6A\u200b6A,, light gray bars, from \u22121036 to +10) but is minimally detected at promoter 2 (light gray bars, from +697 to +2232) yet is found further downstream in intron 2 (light gray bars, from +2850 to +4247). GH treatment leads to robust recruitment of Pol II to promoter 2 but causes little change at promoter 1 (Fig. 6A\u200b6A,, dark gray bars), except for the further 5\u2032 region (\u22122004, dark gray bar). Moreover, the Pol II found at IGF-I promoter 1 before GH appears to be activated, as evidenced by high levels of CTD serine 5 phosphorylation. By contrast, GH treatment stimulates both recruitment of Pol II and its CTD serine 5 phosphorylation at promoter 2 (Fig. 6B\u200b6B).). In this context, the GH-induced increase in Pol II phosphorylated at CTD serine 5 in intron 2 is consistent with hormone-activated transcriptional elongation (Fig. 6B\u200b6B).Open in a separate windowFigure 6RNA Pol II is present at IGF-I promoter 1 in the absence of GH but is recruited by GH treatment to promoter 2. The graphs present results of ChIP experiments showing binding of RNA Pol II (A) or RNA Pol II phosphorylated at serine 5 of its cTD (Pol II CTD-S5P) (B) at the IGF-I promoters in hepatic chromatin of pituitary-deficient rats before (light gray bars) or 60 min after (dark gray bars) a single systemic GH injection. Depicted results for RNA Pol II are representative of at least three independent experiments. Additional details may be found in the legend to Fig. 2\u200b2.Based on these observations, we conclude that the mechanisms of stimulation of IGF-I promoter 1 and promoter 2 by GH-mediated signaling are distinct. Promoter 1 appears to be poised to undergo transcriptional initiation/elongation after hormone treatment, because in the absence of GH, p300 has been recruited to the promoter, and RNA Pol II is already present in a presumptive preinitiation complex and may even have initiated transcription, as supported by its phosphorylation on serine 5 in the CTD. This interpretation further implies that GH actions must promote recruitment of positive transcriptional elongation factors to promoter 1 (e.g. P-TEFb or others) (58) and/or cause inhibition of negative elongation factors [e.g. DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), a dimer of SPT4-SPT5, or negative elongation factor (NELF), which act synergistically to pause RNA Pol II at promoters of several genes] (59,60). Further studies will be needed to determine whether DRB sensitivity-inducing factor and negative elongation factor are present at IGF-I promoter 1, and to elucidate how GH promotes transcriptional initiation/elongation. In contrast, at IGF-I promoter 2 the key issues appear to be to discern how GH stimulates recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and RNA Pol II.PerspectivesOverall, our results show that GH orchestrates dramatic changes in the organization of chromatin surrounding the two IGF-I promoters concurrent with robust induction of IGF-I gene transcription in the liver after a single systemic hormonal pulse to GH-deficient rats. Surprisingly, despite minimal ongoing transcription in the absence of GH, both IGF-I promoters appear to reside in open chromatin environments, at least as inferred both from relatively high levels of core histone acetylation when compared with adjacent intergenic DNA (Figs. 3\u200b3 and 4\u200b4 and Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3) and from enhanced histone H3K4 trimethylation (Fig. 5\u200b5 and Supplemental Fig. 3). This landscape of open chromatin may reflect the impact of previous long-term exposure of the rats to GH and possibly to other trophic factors, because in this experimental model, the hypophysectomy and consequent GH deficiency did not occur until wk 7 of postnatal life, at a time when GH signaling and IGF-I gene expression have reached adult levels (39). Additional studies will be needed to address the biochemical mechanisms responsible for chromatin opening of the IGF-I locus during postnatal development. In particular, it will be of interest to determine whether or not exposure to GH or other pituitary hormones is critical for this maturation process or whether the same epigenetic modifications at the IGF-I gene occur independent of hormonal influences. We additionally postulate that the dramatic effects observed here on IGF-I chromatin within minutes after a single GH injection are not different from the responses that are seen to a single endogenous hormonal pulse, but this remains to be documented. We predict that a recurrent pattern of chromatin modifications at the IGF-I promoters involving acetylation and deacetylation, methylation and demethylation of core histones, and recruitment and modification of transcriptional coregulators represent fundamental and physiologically relevant dynamic genomic effects of GH. A major challenge will be to connect these observations at a mechanistic level to the biochemical actions of activated Stat5b to promote IGF-I gene expression, because Stat5b appears to be the critical signaling link between the cell membrane-associated GH receptor and the nuclear events that culminate in acute chromatin reorganization and induction of IGF-I gene transcription. Materials and MethodsMaterialsAntibodies to Stat5 (C17), RNA Pol II (H-224), and p300 (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); acetyl-histone H3 (recognizes acetyl K9 and 14) and acetyl-histone H4 (recognizes acetyl K5, 8, 12, and 16) were from Millipore (Temecula, CA); histone H3 trimethyl K4 and histone H3 monomethyl K4 were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK); and RNA Pol II H14 (phospho-serine 5) was from Covance (Emeryville, CA). Recombinant rat GH was purchased from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (Torrance, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) DNA Services Core. Qia-Quick PCR purification kit was from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA); SuperScript III reverse-transcriptase system, protein A-Sepharose beads, and SYBR Green Platinum qPCR mix were from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA); and antimouse IgM-agarose beads and whole genome amplification kit were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was from Pierce Biotechnologies (Rockford, IL). Protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Sciences (Indianapolis, IN), and okadaic acid was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers.Animal studiesMale Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, IN), and had been hypophysectomized by a transauricular route at age 7 wk. Rats were housed at the OHSU Animal Care Facility on a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule with free access to food and water and received care according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. GH deficiency was confirmed by failure to grow during a 2-wk observation period. Rats subsequently received a single ip injection with either vehicle (10 mm NaHCO3) or recombinant rat GH (1.5 mg/kg) and were killed at different times after hormone injection (30 min to 6 h). The liver was removed, and chromatin, nuclear RNA, and RNA were isolated from individual animals as outlined below. For the gene expression studies and for ChIP experiments, up to four independent series of rats were used. All animal studies were approved by the OHSU Committee on Animal Care and Use.RNA isolation and analysisHepatic total and nuclear RNA were isolated as described (8). RNA integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. RNA (5 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed with oligo-deoxythymidine primers (total RNA) or random hexamers (nuclear RNA) in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl using an RT-PCR kit. The cDNA was used as a template for either conventional or qPCR (absolute quantitation method described below and illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1). All primers for RT-PCR are listed in Table 1\u200b1.. For conventional PCR, pilot studies were performed to establish a cycle number for each primer set that achieved product amplification in the linear range (usually 30\u201335 cycles). Products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. Individual experiments presented in the figures are representative of three or more independent qPCR experiments and replicated with at least two independent series of rats.Table 1Primers used for RT-PCR of total or nuclear RNAGeneLocationDNA sequence 5\u2032\u20133\u2032Product size (bp)IGF-IExon 3CTCTTCAGTTCGTGTGTGGACC214Exon 4GTCTTGGGCATGTCAGTGTGGS17Exon 3ATCCCCAGCAAAAACCTTCGGAACA301Exon 4TATGGCATAATGGATTAAACAGCTCGAPDHExon 5TGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTCG365Exon 8GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTGGGIGF-IExon 1CTGCCTCTGTGACTTCTTGAAGG224Intron 1AATGCATTCATCTCCCGGACCTCIGF-IExon 2GTACCAAAATGAGCGCACCTCCA316Intron 2CTCCCCATATGTTCTCCATTCCCS17Exon 1GTTCGCACCAAGACTGTGAAGA347Intron 1ACTGCAGCAATAAGGTTTGGAGGTCOpen in a separate windowChIPInitial steps were modified from published protocols (33,61). For each time point studied, a 600-mg fragment of rat liver was minced and incubated at 20 C in 30 ml DMEM plus 1% formaldehyde on a rotating platform for 15 min, followed by addition of 4.5 ml 1 m glycine and incubation for an additional 5 min. After centrifugation at 200 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 20 C, the pellet was washed in PBS and suspended in 1 ml lysis buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS (pH 8.1) plus protease inhibitors] and incubated for 15 min at 4 C. Each sample was sonicated on ice with a Branson microtip sonicator (setting 10) using a total of 10 rounds of 10 pulses for 1 sec each, interspersed with 30-sec incubations on ice, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 C (these steps generated DNA fragments of average size of \u223c500 \u00b1 100 bp). The protein concentration of the supernatant (measured by bicinchoninic acid assay) was adjusted to 1 mg/ml in immunoprecipitation buffer [50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 8.1) plus protease inhibitors], and 1 ml aliquots were stored at \u221280 C until use. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (62), and DNA was extracted using the QiaQuick PCR purification kit, suspended in 50 \u03bcl 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.1), and used as the template in qPCR. Primers were designed with PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA www.idtdna.com) to be complementary to different regions of the rat IGF-I gene and to yield amplicons ranging in length 70\u2013110 bp (see Table 2\u200b2).). PCR experiments were performed using a Bio-Rad Chromo4 Real-Time PCR detection system. Reactions (20 \u03bcl final volume) contained 1\u00d7 SYBR Green mix, 200 nm primers, and ChIP-enriched DNA and were performed in eight-well strips in a 96-well format. Standard curves contained 0.01\u20131.25 ng genomic DNA and were included in each experiment for each primer set. Values are expressed as percent input necessary to achieve the identical cycle threshold. Individual results presented in the figures are representative of three or more independent qPCR experiments. The total number of independent immunoprecipitations and series of rats for each antibody are as follows: Stat5, eight immunoprecipitations and four series of rats; acetyl H3, five and four; acetyl H4, three and three; p300, two and one; H3K4me3, two and two; H3K4me1, three and two; RNA Pol II, three and two; and Pol II S5P, one and one. See Supplemental Fig. 2 for results of three acetyl H3-ChIP experiments, each being performed using chromatin immunoprecipitated from independent series of rats treated with vehicle or GH.Table 2Primers used in ChIP of the IGF-I locusLocationa (center)DNA sequence 5\u2032\u20133\u2032Product size (bp)\u221210485AGCAAAGTCCAGCTTCAACCGA83TGAAACGGACCATGAAGCCAGA\u221210054CCAGCCGTTAAACACCAAGAAG94TGCTAGTCCCAGTACAGCATCT\u22129954GCACCTACACGAATGGACACAT76GGTGCTAGTGCTATGCACATTCTC\u22122004AACTCACAGTACTGGCTTGCAC104TGAGAGTTGACAGGTCCTTGGT\u22121036AGCAGGTCTGGCTCATTTCCAT78AGATCAGATGCTGCGCTTTCCA\u2212541TAGTGTGTGCCTCCCATACTGCTT105TGAGCTCTGGGACAGTCTGAAA+10AAACGCCTCTGTGCTCCAGTTT104TCTCTCTCCCTCTTCTGGCAAAGT+697ACTTCTATAGGGCTTCCACGCT93CCCGCGTTTATATCCATGCTTCCT+1291TCTCCTTTCGATCACTGGACCT105TGACAGCGGCTTAGAAGTGCTTG+1746TGCAGAACATTTCAGAAGCGGAGC110CTATGTTTCAGACCACCACGCA+2232ACCCACTCTGACCTGCTGTGTAAA86AGGGCAACAGTTGTAAGAGGGT+2850TGGACTTAAATGCACCGTCCCT98TGTTACTCAGCCTCACAGCCTT+3250CTGGTGTCTTTGGTTGTATGGAG70GGAACTCTTTACTCTCATCAGGGAC+3740GGTGAAACCGCTCACCTTGG103TTCTAAGAAGCAGACAGAGG+4247ACATGGGCATTTGCTTCTGACC79AGACAAGGCAGGCAGCAGATTTintron 3GGCCAATTCATTCGGCAACTGT87TCCTTTCTGAGAACTGGAGACCGTOpen in a separate windowaThe reference point for each primer is the most 5\u2032 transcription start site in exon 1 of the rat IGF-I gene (18).\u00a0ChIP-chip analysisChromatin from liver tissue of hypophysectomized rats at 60 min after a systemic GH injection was used to prepare input and acetyl H3-ChIP enriched DNA. Two rounds of whole genome amplification were performed on each sample, per a protocol from Sigma, to provide a total DNA yield of more than 4 \u03bcg and a concentration of more than 250 ng/\u03bcl. Agarose gels of aliquots confirmed that most of the amplified DNA was between 200 and 500 bp in length, and no dominant individual DNA bands were present. Labeling and hybridization of the amplified DNA to the rat 385K genomic tiling array set 17 of 37 was performed by Roche-NimbleGen. The enrichment of binding of DNA from the acetyl H3-ChIP to the tiling array was calculated for each feature in the array by dividing raw figures for acetyl H3-ChIP hybridization by input DNA hybridization, and mean and sd for the data set were determined. The z-scores (also known as sd scores) for the individual features were calculated, and peaks of enrichment were defined as three consecutive features with z-scores higher than +1.0. The moving average of five consecutive features was also calculated to demonstrate trends while scanning across loci.Quantitative RT-PCR assaysAfter preparation of cDNA from 5 \u03bcg nuclear RNA, each 50-\u03bcl sample was diluted to 5 ml, and 1 \u03bcl was used as template for qPCR experiments (the equivalent of 1 ng nuclear RNA input). Primer sets within IGF-I intron 1 (+697) and intron 2 (+2850) were designed to amplify transcribed segments downstream of promoters 1 and 2, respectively (Table 3\u200b3).). Primer sets for nascent S17, albumin, and GAPDH transcripts are located in exons of each gene (Table 3\u200b3).). A series of seven rat genomic DNA standards ranging from 0.016\u2013250 ng was prepared by serial dilution. PCR amplification was performed with the Bio-Rad Chromo4 Real-Time PCR detection system. For each primer set, a standard curve was constructed by plotting the cycle threshold vs. the amount of input DNA (log10 scale), and the slope and correlation coefficient for each curve were determined (see Supplemental Fig. 1). Primer sets were judged to be acceptable if the slope of the curve approximated \u22123.3 (theoretical maximum efficiency of amplification) and the r2 coefficient exceeded 0.985. The cycle threshold for each cDNA sample was extrapolated to the standard curve to determine the quantity of nascent transcript (nanograms).Table 3Primers used for qPCR of nuclear RNAGeneLocationDNA sequence 5\u2032\u20133\u2032Product size (bp)IGF-IIntron 1ACTTCTATAGGGCTTCCACGCT93(+697)CCCGCGTTTATATCCATGCTTCCTIGF-IIntron 2TGGACTTAAATGCACCGTCCCT98(+2850)TGTTACTCAGCCTCACAGCCTTS17Exon 1GTTCGCACCAAGACTGTGAAGA94ACACGCGCTTGTTGGTGTGAAAGAPDHExon 3ACTCTACCCACGGCAAGTTCAA73ATGGGTTTCCCGTTGATGACCAAlbuminExon 12CATCCTGAACCGTCTGTGTG86TTTCCACCAAGGACCCACTAOpen in a separate window Supplementary Material\n[Supplemental Data]\nClick here to view.\n FootnotesThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants K08 DK077897 and K12 HD057588 to D.J.C. and Grant R01 DK69703 to P.R.Disclosure Summary: The authors have nothing to disclose.First Published Online February 16, 2010Abbreviations: ChIP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; HDAC, histone deacetylase; Pol, polymerase; qPCR, quantitative PCR.
