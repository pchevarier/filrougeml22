{"title": "The Integrator complex at the crossroad of coding and noncoding RNA", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ceb.2020.11.003", "PMID": "33340967", "abstract": "Genomic transcription is fundamental to all organisms. In metazoans, the Integrator complex is required for endonucleolytic processing of noncoding RNAs, regulation of RNA polymerase II pause-release, and premature transcription attenuation at coding genes. Recent insights into the structural composition and evolution of Integrator subunits have informed our understanding of its biochemical functionality. Moreover, studies in multiple model organisms point to an essential function of Integrator in signaling response and cellular development, highlighting a key role in neuronal differentiation. Indeed, alterations in Integrator complex subunits have been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental diseases and cancer. Taken together, we propose that Integrator is a central regulator of transcriptional processes and that its evolution reflects genomic complexity in regulatory elements and chromatin architecture.", "author": [{"author": "Nina Kirstein", "affiliation": ["University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Human Genetics, Biomedical Research Building, Room 719, 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA."], "href": "/?term=Kirstein+N&cauthor_id=33340967"}, {"author": "Helena Gomes Dos Santos", "affiliation": ["University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Human Genetics, Biomedical Research Building, Room 719, 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA."], "href": "/?term=Gomes+Dos+Santos+H&cauthor_id=33340967"}, {"author": "Ezra Blumenthal", "affiliation": ["University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Human Genetics, Biomedical Research Building, Room 719, 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA."], "href": "/?term=Blumenthal+E&cauthor_id=33340967"}, {"author": "Ramin Shiekhattar", "affiliation": ["University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Human Genetics, Biomedical Research Building, Room 719, 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Miami, FL 33136, USA.
