To date, the pathophysiology of COVID-19\u2013associated ARDS (CARDS) remains poorly understood. This has led to discussion about a different presentation from non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS, regarding lung mechanics abnormalities and hypoxemia mechanisms (1, 2).However, little attention has been paid to the value of biomarkers of lung injury. The soluble form of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is a well-characterized marker of lung alveolar epithelial injury (3) and has been associated with both prognostic and pathogenic values in patients with ARDS (4).This study aims to investigate the value of baseline plasma sRAGE in CARDS and how it could differ between COVID-19 and non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS.Patients and MethodsWe prospectively enrolled all consecutive adult patients admitted to the medical ICU of the Saint-Louis hospital, Paris, France, between March 1 and June 1, 2020, for CARDS according to the Berlin definition (5). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de R\u00e9animation de Langue Fran\u00e7aise (CE SRLF no. 20-32).Management of patients included protective volume-controlled ventilation, neuromuscular blockers, and prone position if needed. All measurements were performed within 24 hours after intubation. Ventilator settings and respiratory mechanics measures were collected, together with dead space fraction, ventilatory ratio, and shunt fraction. When available, measurements of the recruitment-to-inflation ratio were collected (6). A value \u2a7d0.5 was considered as a potential for lung recruitment.The severity of lung edema was assessed using the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, evaluated by two independent physicians on the chest radiography of the day of mechanical ventilation (MV) initiation.Levels of plasma sRAGE were measured in duplicate from thawed samples collected within 24 hours after MV initiation. A commercially available sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit (Human sRAGE Quantikine ELISA Kit; R&D Systems) was used following recommendations from the manufacturer.Patients with CARDS were then compared with a historical multicentric prospective cohort of patients with ARDS in whom plasma sRAGE had been measured (7) and with control patients (e.g., mechanically ventilated patients without COVID-19 infection or ARDS, n\u2009=\u200915).Continuous variables are described as medians (interquartile ranges) and compared using the Wilcoxon\u2019s rank sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis test; categorical variables are summarized by counts (percentages) and compared using the Fisher exact test. Correlations were assessed with the Rho Spearman\u2019s correlation test. Prognosis value of sRAGE on Day-90 mortality was assessed using Cox model adjusted on potential confounders (e.g., ARDS etiology, cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, driving pressure, and PaO2/FiO2).All tests were two-sided and P values <5% were considered to indicate significant associations. Analyses were performed using R statistical platform, version 3.0.2.ResultsCharacteristics of patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Overall, 50 patients with CARDS (median [interquartile range], 62.0 [54.0\u201368.7] yr of age; 68% male) were included. Median time from symptoms onset to invasive MV initiation was 9.0 (7.0\u201314.0) days. For further details, see Table 1.Baseline plasma sRAGE correlates with lung injury severity and outcome in COVID-19. At baseline, plasma sRAGE was 4,044.0 (1,763.0\u20134,768.0) pg/ml and significantly differed from control (525.0 [411.0\u2013638.5] pg/ml; P\u2009<\u20090.001; Figure \u200bFigure11).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Value of plasma soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) levels at baseline in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or non\u2013COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Plasma sRAGE levels were higher in patients with high potential for recruitability (4,245.0 [3,795.0\u20134,854.0] pg/ml vs. 2,890.0 [2,312.0\u20133,566.0] pg/ml; P\u2009=\u20090.02).Of note, baseline plasma sRAGE was significantly higher in Day-90 decedents than in survivors (4,403.1 [2,564.0\u20134,990.2] pg/ml vs. 2,708.0 [1,965.9\u20134,304.5] pg/ml; P\u2009=\u20090.04).Comparison between patients with CARDS and those with non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS. Compared with patients with non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS, patients with CARDS were significantly different with regard to body mass index, cardiovascular risk factors, and incidence of ARDS severity at Day 1 (Table 1). Median static compliance of respiratory system was similar between patients with ARDS with or without COVID-19 (29.5 [26.2\u201335.0] vs. 28.6 [21.9\u201334.5] ml/cm H2O, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.17).Table 1.Comparisons between Patients with COVID-19\u2013related ARDS and Patients with ARDS from Other Causes\u00a0COVID-19 ARDS(N\u2009=\u200950)Non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS(N\u2009=\u2009117)P ValueDemographic\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Age, yr62.0 (54.0\u201368.7)60.0 (45.0\u201370.0)0.38\u2003Sex, M34 (68)80 (68)1.00\u2003BMI, kg/m227.7 (24.3\u201330.7)25.9 (22.2\u201328.5)0.008\u2003Hypertension27 (54)38 (32)0.015\u2003Diabetes18 (36)22 (19)0.029\u2003Dyslipidemia24 (48)17 (15)<0.0001\u2003At least one cardiovascular risk factor32 (64)54 (46)0.052\u2003SAPS II45.0 (36.0\u201356.0)49.0 (39.0\u201364.0)0.10ARDS cause\u00a0\u00a0<0.05\u2003Pulmonary50 (100)85 (73)\u00a0\u2003Lung infection50 (100)85 (100)\u00a0\u2003Extrapulmonary\u201427 (27)\u00a0\u2003Intraabdominal infection\u201422 (81)\u00a0\u2003Acute pancreatitis\u20145 (19)\u00a0ARDS severity\u00a0\u00a00.001\u2003Mild13 (26)8 (7)\u00a0\u2003Moderate24 (48)56 (48)\u00a0\u2003Severe13 (26)52 (45)\u00a0Respiratory parameters, Day 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Vt, ml/kg PBW6.0 (6.0\u20136.17)6.6 (6.0\u20137.3)<0.0001\u2003Pplat, cm H2O23.0 (21.0\u201325.0)28.0 (24.0\u201330.0)<0.0001\u2003PEEP, cm H2O10.0 (8.0\u201312.0)10.0 (8.0\u201313.0)0.57\u2003Crs, ml/cm H2O29.5 (26.2\u201335.0)28.6 (21.9\u201334.5)0.17\u2003Ventilatory ratio1.6 (1.4\u20131.9)2.0 (1.7\u20132.4)<0.0001Biological data\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003PaO2/FiO2, mm Hg126 (99.25\u2013199.8)107.2 (71.11\u2013147.2)0.005\u2003pH7.38 (7.34\u20137.42)7.35 (7.27\u20137.40)0.008\u2003PaCO2, mm Hg40.5 (36.9\u201345.8)44.0 (37.7\u201350.0)0.070\u2003Baseline plasma sRAGE, pg/ml4,044.0 (1,763.0\u20134,768.0)2,230.0 (1,156.0\u20133,954.0)0.005Treatments\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Prone position use28 (56)24 (21)<0.0001\u2003NO therapy4 (8)33 (28)0.007\u2003VV-ECMO4 (8)2 (2)0.11Outcomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Duration of MV, d12.0 (4.0\u201317.0)11.0 (6.0\u201320.0)0.31\u2003ICU LOS, d14.0 (10.0\u201322.0)18.0 (10.0\u201334.2)0.063\u2003In-ICU mortality27 (54)38 (33)0.016\u2003Day-90 mortality27 (54)42 (36)0.045Open in a separate windowDefinition of abbreviations: ARDS\u2009=\u2009acute respiratory distress syndrome; BMI\u2009=\u2009body mass index; COVID-19\u2009=\u2009coronavirus disease; Crs\u2009=\u2009static compliance of respiratory system; LOS\u2009=\u2009length of stay; MV\u2009=\u2009mechanical ventilation; NO\u2009=\u2009nitric oxide; PBW\u2009=\u2009predicted body weight; PEEP\u2009= positive end-expiratory pressure; Pplat\u2009=\u2009inspiratory plateau pressure; SAPS II\u2009=\u2009simplified acute physiology score; sRAGE\u2009=\u2009soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products; VV-ECMO\u2009=\u2009venovenous extracorporal membrane oxygenation.Results are presented as n (%) or median (interquartile range).Baseline sRAGE levels were significantly higher in CARDS compared with non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS (4,044.0 [1,763.0\u20134,768.0] pg/ml vs. 2,230.0 [1,156.0\u20133,954.0] pg/ml; P\u2009=\u20090.005; Figure \u200bFigure1).1). Overall, Day-90 mortality rate was 54% in CARDS and 36% in non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS (P\u2009=\u20090.045). Adjusted on potential confounders, baseline plasma sRAGE levels were significantly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.51 [1.05\u20132.16] per one log increment; P\u2009=\u20090.02).DiscussionWhether CARDS-related lung injury is similar to that from other causes of ARDS is an important question. The answer may guide the ventilatory strategy and carry some prognostic information. Using a well-characterized marker of lung epithelial injury, this study suggests that CARDS includes a component of pulmonary alveolar damage higher than other causes of ARDS. Moreover, as in non\u2013COVID-19 ARDS, plasma sRAGE is associated with CARDS severity and outcome, especially lung edema, assessed by baseline RALE score and oxygenation impairment.Since the onset of the pandemic, CARDS has been suggested to be an atypical subset of ARDS (2, 8). This assertion has been recently challenged, mainly through comparisons of lung mechanics parameters (9). Although sRAGE production could have several sources, numerous works have provided evidence that alveolar type I cells are the main source of plasma sRAGE, and that sRAGE is a reliable marker of diffuse lung alveolar injury and impaired fluid clearance in both clinical and experimental models of ARDS (3). In this study, we found a marked elevation in sRAGE levels among patients with CARDS, which argues for intense lung epithelial injury. This is consistent with recent pathological reports from postmortem lung biopsies, in which diffuse alveolar damage was the most common histological finding (10).This study has some limitations. First, the limited number of patients from a single center requires additional data to confirm this hypothesis. Second, plasma sRAGE was only measured at baseline and the value of changes over time is unknown.In summary, our findings suggest that lung epithelial injury, as reflected by plasma sRAGE, may be a key pathophysiological feature with prognostic information in CARDS.
