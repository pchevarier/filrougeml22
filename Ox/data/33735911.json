Baseline platelet count was associated with subsequent and long-term mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. IntroductionThe ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is caused by the infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 91 million confirmed cases and nearly 2 million deaths globally as of January 11, 2020 [1]. The clinical manifestations in COIVD-19 patients have been extensively reported since the outbreak. Patients with COVID-19 can represent with abdominal symptoms, acute heart injury, secondary infections, acute liver injury, acute kidney injury and coagulation abnormalities in addition to pulmonary symptoms [2\u20134]. And the main changes in complete blood cells are characterized with lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia [5].Thrombocytopenia is a common manifestation and also an indicator of poor prognosis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 according to previous researches [6\u20139]. Low platelet count has been proven to be related to disease severity and hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients [10\u201312]. What was noteworthy was that severe COVID-19 patients had significantly lower platelet count than non-severe patients [11, 13]. However, the detailed association between platelets and subsequent organ functions in severe COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) remain to be explored. The long-term prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients also remain to be uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the subsequent organ dysfunction and 180-day outcome in critically ill COVID-19 with thrombocytopenia. MethodsStudy design and participantsThe study enrolled ICU patients from 2 centers in Wuhan, namely Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Leishenshan Hospital, which were managed by the same medical team from Zhongnan hospital since early February of 2020. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the guidance [14] issued by National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (7th edition), and admitted to the two ICUs from January 5 to March 21 were enrolled in this study. And those with pregnancy or lactation, malignant tumor with a life expectancy of less than 3 months, immunodeficiencies (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome and leukemia), and diseases that cause excessive consumption of platelets (i.e., primary immune thrombocytopenia and heparin induced thrombocytopenia) were all excluded. Clinical outcomes (mortality) were monitored up to September 17, 2020. Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (2020057K). Considering the epidemic situation, oral informed consent was approved to obtain from participants during telephone follow-up by the Medical Ethics Committee. Telephone questionnaire in both Chinese and English was presented in supporting information (S1 Appendix).Data collectionDemographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, treatment, laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. The records were first accessed on February 15 and last accessed on May 31. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and laboratory data including white blood cell count, neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, lymphocyte percentage, creatinine, blood urea, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, hypersensitive troponin I, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase were collected on the 1st, 3rd and 7th day after transferred to ICU. Platelet count, six-point ordinal scale scores and oxygenation indexes were recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th day. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) Score was assessed within 24 h after transferred to ICU. The detection of SARS-Cov-2 was conducted by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method or next-generation sequencing. The duration of invasive ventilation, vasopressor days, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and death were also recorded. The primary end point of 28-day 90-day and 180-day mortality were obtained from medical records or telephone follow-up.DefinitionSix-point ordinal scale was used to evaluate the degree of lung impairment [15]. It was defined as follows: death = 6; ICU admission with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation = 5; ICU admission with high-flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation = 4; ICU admission with oxygen therapy = 3; ICU admission but not requiring oxygen therapy = 2; discharged from ICU = 1. According to the test project manual of Leishenshan Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital, the normal range of platelet count was 125\u2013350 \u00d7109/L. Thus, we defined thrombocytopenia as blood platelet count \u2264125\u00d7109/L and non-thrombocytopenia as blood platelet count >125\u00d7109/L. Secondary infections were diagnosed if positive result of a new pathogen was found in blood, sputum or urine cultures. Septic shock was defined bases on Sepsis 3.0 [16]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed based on the Berlin Definition [17]. Acute kidney injury was determined based on KDIGO clinical practice guideline [18]. Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if the hypersensitive troponin I exceeded the upper limit of reference range (>0.04 ng/mL). And coagulation disorder was diagnosed if PT >14 s or APTT > 40 s.Statistical analysisContinuous variables were expressed in the way of mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) according to its distribution type, and categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages (%). Independent-samples T test would be used when the continuous variables were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test would be used. The chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to analyze categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable cox regression were used to explore the risk factors related to 28-day and 180-day death. Kaplan-Meier analysis was also used in statistical analysis.P value less than 0.05 was set as statistically significant. SPSS software version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism version 8.00 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, California) were used in data processing and statistical analysis. ResultsA total of 167 adult COVID-19 patients (109 from Leishenshan Hospital and 58 from Zhongnan Hospital) were finally included in this study. 58 patients died during 28 days and a total of 87 patients died within 180 days. All patients ranged in age from 29 to 93, with a median age of 66.00 (IQR, 58.00\u201377.00), and 67.07% of them were male. Hypertension turned out to be the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease. No significant differences in age, gender and comorbidities between two groups were found. While it was noticed that patients in thrombocytopenia group had significant lower white blood count, platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as significant higher blood urea, total bilirubin, and SOFA score, compared with non-thrombocytopenia group. Patients with thrombocytopenia had higher creatinine, procalcitonin and high-sensitive cardiac troponin I than the other group though the differences not reach the statistical significance.

In the same way, we found that older age, higher white blood cell, lower platelet count, and longer activated partial thromboplastin time were risk factors of 180-day death (Table 2).Table 2Risk factors associated with 28-day mortality and 180-day mortality.Variables28-day mortality180-day mortalityUnivariable RR [95% CI]p valueMultivariable RR [95% CI]p valueUnivariable RR [95% CI]p valueMultivariable RR [95% CI]p valueDemographic and clinical characteristicsAge, years1.02 [1.00\u20131.04]0.031.03 [1.00\u20131.05]0.041.03 [1.01\u20131.05]<0.011.04 [1.02\u20131.06]<0.01Gender0.88 [0.51\u20131.51]0.640.94 [0.60\u20131.47]0.80Diabetes1.00 [0.57\u20131.77]0.990.93 [0.58\u20131.49]0.77Hypertension1.51 [0.89\u20132.54]0.131.41 [0.92\u20132.16]0.11Coronary heart disease1.35 [0.76\u20132.41]0.311.51 [0.96\u20132.40]0.07Chronic lung disease0.64 [0.20\u20132.04]0.450.82 [0.36\u20131.87]0.63Chronic renal failure1.41 [0.67\u20132.98]0.371.42 [0.77\u20132.61]0.26Malignant tumor1.26 [0.46\u20133.48]0.661.51 [0.66\u20133.46]0.33Cerebrovascular disease0.91 [0.48\u20131.71]0.761.10 [0.67\u20131.79]0.71Laboratory findingsWBC, \u00d7109/L1.06 [1.02\u20131.10]<0.011.04 [0.98\u20131.11]0.161.07 [1.04\u20131.10]<0.011.06 [1.01\u20131.12]0.03Neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, %1.05 [1.02\u20131.08]<0.011.01 [0.91\u20131.12]0.841.05 [1.02\u20131.07]<0.010.95 [1.03\u20131.12]0.44Lymphocyte percentage, %0.93 [0.89\u20130.98]<0.010.96 [0.84\u20131.10]0.550.95 [0.91\u20130.98]<0.011.00 [0.90\u20131.11]0.99Platelet count, \u00d7109/L\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thrombocytopenia, \u22641252.79 [1.65\u20134.74]<0.012.98 [1.48\u20136.02]<0.012.08 [1.32\u20133.29]<0.012.45 [1.32\u20134.57]<0.01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-thrombocytopenia, >1251 (ref)---1 (ref)---Creatinine, \u00d7109/L1.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.411.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.22Blood urea, mmol/L1.00 [0.99\u20131.01]0.601.00 [1.00\u20131.01]0.60AST, IU/L1.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.401.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.88ALT, IU/L1.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.841.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.65Total bilirubin, \u03bcmol/L1.03 [1.00\u20131.05]0.050.99 [0.96\u20131.03]0.701.03 [1.01\u20131.05]0.010.99 [0.97\u20131.02]0.68Procalcitonin, ng/mL1.00 [0.98\u20131.01]0.640.99 [0.98\u20131.01]0.48PT, seconds1.11 [1.04\u20131.18]<0.010.98 [0.87\u20131.10]0.731.13 [1.06\u20131.19]<0.011.00 [0.90\u20131.10]0.93APTT, seconds1.02 [1.00\u20131.04]0.021.02 [1.00\u20131.04]0.051.03 [1.01\u20131.04]<0.011.00 [1.02\u20131.04]0.01hs-CTn I, ng/mL1.05 [0.80\u20131.37]0.751.04 [0.83\u20131.29]0.76D-dimer, \u03bcg/L1.02 [1.01\u20131.03]<0.010.99 [0.97\u20131.01]0.501.02 [1.01\u20131.03]<0.010.98 [1.00\u20131.01]0.57LDH, U/L1.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.041.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.351.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.011.00 [1.00\u20131.00]0.15Open in a separate window(RR) relative risk; (CI) confidence Interval; (WBC) White blood cell; (AST) Aspartate aminotransferase; (ALT) Alanine aminotransferase; (PT) Prothrombin time; (APTT) Activated partial thromboplastin time; (Hs-CTn I) hypersensitive troponin I; (LDH) Lactate dehydrogenase.To better understanding the association between thrombocytopenia and organ functions, the changes of laboratory data and rating scores over time in patients with and without thrombocytopenia are presented. It showed that six-point ordinal scale score and SOFA score as well as oxygenation index had tendencies to deteriorate over time in patients with thrombocytopenia.

The time curves of platelet count, six-point ordinal scale score and oxygenation index were also drawn. For non-survival group, the platelet and oxygenation index gradually decreased over time while the six-point ordinal scale score showed an upward trend, which meant the worse respiratory function was probably related to the lower platelets (Fig 1A and 1B). But the downtrends were not seen in survival group (Fig 1C and 1D), which may come down to the different incidences of thrombocytopenia and severity of disease (S1 Table). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Log Rank analysis showed that patients with thrombocytopenia at ICU admission had significant lower probability of survival than the other group (Fig 2). The median survival time in patients with thrombocytopenia was 17 (IQR, 7.5\u2013180) days.Open in a separate windowFig 1Time curves of platelet count, six-point ordinal scale score and oxygenation index.Shaded areas show the standard error while the curves show the means of platelet count, six-point ordinal scale and oxygenation index. a.

In addition, patients with thrombocytopenia had significant higher proportion of receiving antiviral therapy (60.98% vs 42.86%, p = 0.04), and invasive ventilation (58.54% vs 38.89%, p = 0.03), but shorter ICU length of stay (median day, 10.50 [IQR, 5.50\u201315.80] vs 13.00 [IQR, 8.00\u201323.00], p = 0.03), which might be related to more early death events (S2 Fig). It appeared that patients with thrombocytopenia were much more in need for vasopressor therapy. Moreover, patients with thrombocytopenia were much more likely to develop septic shock, arrhythmia, coagulation disorder, compared with patients without thrombocytopenia. Most deaths (96.55%) occurred within 90 days, suggesting that COVID-19 was as an acute blow to human health. No significant differences in long-term prognosis between groups were found, but patients with thrombocytopenia had higher proportion of extra oxygen supply (35.71% vs 13.64%, p = 0.06) (Table 4).Table 4Complications, treatments and clinical outcomes.VariablesTotal (n = 167)Thrombocytopenia (n = 41)Non-thrombocytopenia (n = 126)P valueTreatments\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antiviral therapy79 (47.31%)25 (60.98%)54 (42.86%)0.04\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arbidol28 (16.77%)12 (29.27%)16 (12.70%)0.01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ribavirin19 (11.38%)6 (14.63%)13 (10.32%)0.57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Entecavir1 (0.60%)1 (2.44%)00.25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interferon21 (12.57%)3 (7.32%)18 (14.29%)0.29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chloroquine phosphate3 (1.80%)1 (2.44%)2 (1.59%)0.57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotic therapy154 (92.22%)38 (92.68%)116 (92.06%)0.90\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imipenem/meropenem73 (43.71%)23 (31.5%)50 (39.68%)0.07\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quinolone106 (63.47%)27 (65.85%)79 (62.70%)0.72\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cephalosporin95 (56.89%)24 (58.54%)71 (56.35%)0.81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Piperacillin sodium and sulbactam sodium23 (13.77%)3 (7.32%)20 (15.87%)0.17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Azithromycin5 (2.99%)1 (2.44%)4 (3.17%)0.81\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linezolid31 (18.56%)5 (12.20%)26 (20.63%)0.23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Polymyxin B12 (7.19%)3 (7.32%)9 (7.14%)0.97\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vancomycin20 (11.98%)6 (14.63%)14 (11.11%)0.55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daptomycin1 (0.60%)01 (0.79%)1.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tigecycline17 (10.18%)4 (9.76%)13 (10.32%)1.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antifungal therapy34 (20.36%)9 (21.95%)25 (19.84%)0.79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Caspofungin12 (7.19%)4 (9.76%)8 (6.35%)0.46\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fluconazole6 (3.59%)1 (2.44%)5 (3.97%)1.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voriconazole13 (7.78%)3 (7.32%)10 (7.94%)1.00Immunomodulator\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thymalfasin/ Thymosin21 (12.57%)4 (9.76%)17 (13.49%)0.53\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0XUE BI JING injection20 (11.98%)8 (19.51%)12 (9.52%)0.09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ulinastatin6 (3.59%)2 (4.88%)4 (3.17%)0.64\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corticosteroids therapy73 (43.71%)21 (51.22%)52 (41.27%)0.27Respiratory support\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High-flow oxygen therapy63 (37.72%)14 (34.15%)49 (38.89%)0.59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-invasive ventilation59 (35.33%)16 (39.02%)43 (34.13%)0.57\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invasive ventilation75 (44.91%)24 (58.54%)51 (40.48%)0.04Duration of invasive ventilation, days11.00 [6.00\u201320.00]12.00 [7.00\u201322.00]8.50 [5.00\u201313.00]0.08Vasopressors70 (41.92%)22 (53.66%)48 (38.10%)0.08CRRT34 (20.40%)8 (19.50%)26 (20.60%)0.88ECMO21 (12.60%)4 (9.80%)17 (13.50%)0.53Complications\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondary infections98 (57.68%)21 (51.22%)77 (61.11%)0.26\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Septic shock48 (28.74%)17 (41.46%)31 (24.60%)0.04\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ARDS148 (88.62%)38 (92.68%)110 (87.30%)0.35\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acute kidney injury34 (20.48%)11 (26.83%)23 (18.40%)0.25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arrhythmia35 (20.96%)17 (41.46%)18 (14.29%)<0.01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Acute cardiac injury57 (34.13%)19 (46.34%)38 (30.16%)0.06\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coagulation disorder43 (25.75%)18 (43.90%)25 (19.84%)<0.01Main outcomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ICU length of stay, days12.00 [7.00\u201321.00]10.50 [5.50\u201315.75]13.00 [8.00\u201323.00]0.03\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hospital length of stay, days21.00 [15.00\u201335.00]20.00 [11.00\u201326.50]23.00 [15.75\u201336.25]0.06\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a028-day mortality58 (34.73%)23 (56.10%)35 (27.78%)<0.01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a090-day mortality84 (50.29%)27 (65.85%)57 (45.24%)0.02\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0180-day mortality87 (52.1%)27 (65.85%)60 (47.62%)0.04Survival prognosis in 180 days\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Survival, numbers801466\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Extra oxygen supply14 (17.50%)5 (35.71%)9 (13.64%)0.06\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exertional dyspnea17 (21.25%)3 (21.43%)14 (21.21%)1.00weakness15 (18.75%)3 (21.43%)12 (18.18%))0.72Open in a separate window(SD) standard deviation; (IQR) Inter quartile range; (SOFA) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; (CRRT) continuous renal replacement therapy; (ECMO), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; (ARDS) acute respiratory distress syndrome. DiscussionThis is an observational study of the 180-day prognosis and clinical development in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our study did a long-term follow up and confirmed a few risk factors of 180-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Besides, our study found that the decrease of platelet was associated with poor respiratory function, which were further proved by the time curves of six-point ordinal scale, oxygenation index and platelet count. Our study also confirmed that thrombocytopenia was associated with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. 86.6% of death events occurred within 90 days, and 66.67% of them occurred within 28 days, which means this disease developed rapidly and led to death in a short time in high-risk patients.Thrombocytopenia and respiratory functionAs a vital blood component, platelets play a crucial role in initial clot or thrombus formation. Other than that, platelets are believed to be the first responders in innate immune and can interact with pathogens including bacteria and virus through multiple platelet surface receptors [19\u201321]. In addition to against microbial insults directly, platelets aid primary immune cells in the clearance of pathogens. Platelets can secret cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, which will lead to endothelium high permeability, as well as recruitment and attachment of leukocytes to the endothelium [22, 23]. Platelets can also interact with other immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes [23\u201325].The decrease of platelet was associated with poor respiratory function in critically ill patients. Platelets directly interact with viral pathogens through the pathogen recognition receptors such as protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) and glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa), and this interaction can lead to platelet activation, which is associated with lung inflammation as well as the severity of viral infections, lung injury and death [26, 27]. The interactions between platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells are also critical in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury [28, 29]. All of these evidences indicated that platelets played a role in lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. In a phase IIb case control study [30], antiplatelet therapy improved ventilation/perfusion in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, which further supported the point that the platelet participated in the progression of lung injury and respiratory failure in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Endothelial injury was reported to be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 [31]. The endothelial injury and cytokines released from endothelial cells can also lead to platelet activation and aggregation, leading to microthrombi formation and thrombocytopenia and lung injury [31, 32]. Thus, the association between thrombocytopenia and respiratory dysfunction is quite intricate and cannot be explained by simple causation.Mechanism of thrombocytopeniaThrombocytopenia is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in critically ill patients [33\u201335]. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients might be related to decreased production, increased consumption and destruction of platelets [36].First, SARS-CoV-2 infections may reduce the production of platelet. Coronavirus can infect and inhibit the growth of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells and the megakaryocytes [37]. SARS-CoV-2 may also decrease the production of platelets by entering the bone marrow cells and platelet cells through CD13 and CD66a [38\u201341]. Besides, evidence [42] showed that amounts of megakaryocytes release platelet when they circulate through the lungs. Pulmonary capillary injury and microthrombi formation can block the circulation and platelet release in COVID-19 patients [31]. Second, SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to increased consumption of platelet. COVID-19 patients often have the extremity deep vein thrombosis and alveolar capillary microthrombi [31, 43, 44]. Platelet play a role in innate immune and can be activated by bacteria and virus [19\u201321]. Influenza A H1N1 and EMCV can trigger platelet activation in Fc\u03b3R\u2161a-dependent and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent way separately [45, 46]. As a member of single-stranded RNA virus just like influenza A H1N1 and EMCV, SARS-CoV-2 may also trigger platelet activation and aggregation, leading to platelet consumption [47]. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 virus was found within endothelial cells, suggesting that the endothelial injury may be caused by direct viral effects [31]. As a result of endothelial injury, sub-endothelial collagen exposure promotes innate adhesion of platelets to collagen through von Willebrand factor, which is vital in the adhesion process and significantly increased in COVID-19 patients [32, 48]. Meanwhile, activated endothelial cells will facilitate the expression of tissue factor (TF), and may activated coagulation cascade culmination [32]. Third, it\u2019s reported that SARS-CoV-2 might specifically destroy platelets through autoantibodies [36]. Antiplatelet antibodies were also confirmed to be the cause of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia [49, 50]. Other than that, Drugs such as linezolid, ribavirin, interferon, cephalosporin and chloroquine phosphate may result in drug-associated thrombocytopenia [50\u201353]. ECMO and CRRT have also been reported to be associated with decrease of platelet counts [54\u201357]. High incidences of secondary infections and septic shock were seen in our study, and the intense inflammation response will promote thrombosis and lead to thrombocytopenia as well [33, 58].Mortality risk factorsOlder age, lower platelet count, higher white blood cell has been proven to relate with clinical worsening and poor outcome in many studies [10, 11, 59, 60]. Longer activated partial thromboplastin time was one of the characteristics in blood system of COVID-19 patients. Previous study reported D-dimer, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time could be used as indicators for disease prognosis [61]. We also found longer activated partial thromboplastin time was a risk factor of death, though D-dimer and prothrombin time didn\u2019t show significance in our study.Thrombocytopenia and mortalityThe lower platelet count has been reported to be a marker of poor prognosis, not only in COVID-19 patients but also in different population of critically ill patients [10\u201312, 33]. Thrombocytopenia has been demonstrated to be associated with increased length of ICU and hospital stay as well as higher mortality [33]. Our findings were consistent with previous studies, and demonstrated that thrombocytopenia had almost threefold risk of death in 28 days and more than double risk of death in 180 days than those with non-thrombocytopenia at admission. However, the intrinsic connection between thrombocytopenia and death was not clear yet. Respiratory failure, followed by multiple septic shock and organ failure, turned out to be the main cause of death of COVID-19 patients [62]. As the thrombocytopenia induced the development of organ impairment including renal failure, acute lung injury, respiratory distress syndrome, vascular leakage syndromes and septic shock [33, 63], thrombocytopenia may relate to death in a roundabout way.LimitationsThis study has several limitations. First, this is an observational study, and it is hard to exclude all potential confounders, and keep data integrity and consistency, so the role of some variables might be underestimated in predicting the prognosis. Second, our study proved that low platelets were associated with subsequent poor respiratory function and mortality, but it is difficult to confirm if the association is causality. It needs more basic researches, animal experiments or prospective trials to confirm that. Third, we didn\u2019t measure the platelets count and coagulation functions in 180 day-survivors. Nevertheless, this observational study truly provided some evidence on the association between thrombocytopenia and progress of organ functions, and long-term outcome in critically ill COVID-19. ConclusionThrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality of COVID-19. The subsequent change of platelet was associated with respiratory function as well as other organ functions, and finally contributed to the death in patients with severe COVID-19 in ICU.

Such studies already existMajor1. The authors should try and explain how this study is different to papers published already on thrombocytopenia and poor prognosis in COVID-19 (for example; ?longer follow-up)2. Several factors were noted to be associated with poor prognosis on univariate analysis. How important is platelet count among these3. The significant finding is the correlation with respiratory function. it would be useful to build upon this finding4. You explain on page 20, line 162...the worse respiratory function was probably related to the lower platelets. But the tendencies in survival group didn\u2019t seem to make sense -- could you elaborate5. page 23, line 193 says, shorter ICU length of stay, which might be related to more early death events -- is it possible to confirm this6. page 27, line 212, Most death events occurred within 90 days, which means the COVID-19 is an acute attack to those affected -- what is meant by acute attack7. In the mechanism of thrombocytopenia, the role of high Von Willebrand levels is worth explaining8. the discussion on thrombocytopenia and respiratory function would benefit from some explanation for causation. The description here is about role of platelets rather than thrombocytopenia9. use mortality risk factors rather than Death risk factorsReviewer #2:\u00a0I would like to thank the editor for giving me the opportunity to review this article. The authors reported a detailed data of a cohort of sars-cov2 patients and thoroughly investigated the prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in this group of patients.Major Comments1. Results- One the major findings of the study was that both thrombocytopenia and prolonged aPTT were associated with higher 28-day and 180-day mortality. This finding may suggest that patient who died would have higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Tang N et al reported that the incidence of DIC in patients who died because of sars-cov2 pneumonia was as high as 71.4 % (J Thromb Haemost, 2020). This parameter was not investigated per se by the authors. I would advise the authors to define it and to investigate its value in predicting mortality.- Results: Table 3 displays the data on day 2, 2 and 3 while the authors mentioned in the methods that data were collected on day 1, 3 and 7. Please clarify.- Similarly, figure 1 displays platelet count, the oxygenation index and the the six-point-ordinal score up to day 10 which is contrasting the statement mentioned in the methods. Please clarify.- 43.7 % of the patients required mechanical ventilation but the duration of mechanical ventilation was 0 [0-10] ? I would suggest to the authors to double check this finding.Discussion- Mechanism of thrombocytopenia: In addition to the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia discussed by the authors, other factors should be probably discussed for the group of patients included in the study:o Drug-associated thrombocytopenia: 18.5 % received linezolid and others received chloroquine phosphate.o ECMO was required in 12 % of the patients in CRRT in 20 % : in addition to heparin requirement, both ECMO and CRRT have been associated with thrombocytopenia (ref: Panigada M, Minerva Anestesiol. 2016 Feb; 82(2):170-9 - Weingart C, Artif Organs. 2015 Sep; 39(9):765-73.o Procalcitonin was higher in patients with thrombocytopenia and higher incidence of septic shock was seen in patients with thrombocytopenia). The role of inflammation as a cause of thrombocytopenia should be discussed.- Platelets and respiratory function:The authors well described that thrombocytopenia is incriminated in worsening respiratory function. However, thrombocytopenia can also be the consequence of the disease. In fact, endothelial dysfunction in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome has been identified as a cause of thrombocytopenia.Minor comments- Line 69: organ dysfunction rather than organ function.- Line 175 (median survival time in patients with thrombocytopenia: Please add the quartiles. It would be better to include this statement in the results rather than in the title of figure 2.**********6.

We have added the two articles you mentioned to illustrate that platelets can interact with pathogens and are involved in the immune process (Page 20, line 210-212; Page 21, line 244-245). In addition, we also added two concrete examples of influenza A H1N1 and EMCV, which belong to the same family of single-stranded RNA viruses as SARS-CoV-2, and explained how the interaction between platelet and viruses leads to platelet activation and increased platelet consumption (Page 21-22, line 245-249). Review CommentsReviewer #1: 1. In this study, the authors try to correlate platelet counts with deterioration of respiratory function and prognosis. Such studies already exist. Major1. The authors should try and explain how this study is different to papers published already on thrombocytopenia and poor prognosis in COVID-19 (for example; ?longer follow-up)Response: Thank you for your comment. The association between thrombocytopenia and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients has been reported in previous studies. However, we presented new information about the prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients in longer follow-up period (such as 90-day and 180-day mortality) and the association between thrombocytopenia and respiratory dysfunction. We stated it in the discussion section (Page 20, line 210-217).2. Several factors were noted to be associated with poor prognosis on univariate analysis. How important is platelet count among these\uff1fResponse: Thank you very much for your question. We did the cox regression and multivariable analysis. All three risk factors of 28-day mortality and all four risk factors of 180-day mortality are shown in following tables. The B in tables means \u03b2 (regression coefficient). The \u03b2 of thrombocytopenia are higher than the other risk factors. Thus, we believe that thrombocytopenia contributes more to death, and is more important than the other mortality risk factors.. Variables in the Equation of 28-day mortality. Variables in the Equation of 180-day mortality.3. The significant finding is the correlation with respiratory function. it would be useful to build upon this findingResponse: Thank you for your suggestion. We added the analysis on the relationship between different levels of platelets and oxygenation indexes at admission (See S2 Fig), and found that patients with lower platelets had lower oxygenation index. We stated it in result section (page 16, line 163). For your convenience, the figure is also presented below. The figure, combined with the time curves we provided in revised manuscript (Result section, Fig 1), may better illustrate the association between platelet count and respiratory function.S2 Fig 1. The platelet counts and oxygenation index at admission4. You explain on page 20, line 162...the worse respiratory function was probably related to the lower platelets. But the tendencies in survival group didn\u2019t seem to make sense -- could you elaborateResponse: We are grateful for your thoughtful comment. The downtrends of platelet count and respiratory function were only seen in non-survival group, but not in survival group. It is because the platelet counts in most survivors were not low and their respiratory functions were not too bad. We compared the severity of disease between survivors and non-survivors and found survivors had better organ functions than non-survivors (See S3 Table), which is consistent with the point that thrombocytopenia is related with severity of COVID-19 (Lippi G, 2020). We added the sentence in revised manuscript: \u201cBut the downtrends were not seen in survival group (Fig 1c, d), which may come down to the different incidences of thrombocytopenia and severity of disease (S3 Table)\u201d (Result section, page 16, line 167-169).S3 Table 1.

Patients with thrombocytopenia had shorter ICU length of stay and higher mortality than non-thrombocytopenia group in our study. And we believe that this phenomenon is due to more early death events within ICU in thrombocytopenia group. The median ICU length of stay was 12 days in the whole population, so we did a 14-day Kaplan-Meier analysis (See S4 Fig 1). The survival curve of thrombocytopenia group drops faster than the other group (P<0.01), which means the patients with thrombocytopenia suffered a higher risk of early death within ICU.S4 Fig 1. 14-day Survival Curve in Patients with and without Thrombocytopenia.6. page 27, line 212, Most death events occurred within 90 days, which means the COVID-19 is an acute attack to those affected -- what is meant by acute attackResponse: We appreciate and agree to your comments. We compared the mortality within 180 days and found that most death events occurred within 28 days. Thus, we considered COVID-19 as an acute attack to human health. We revised our manuscript as follow: \u201c86.6% of death events occurred within 90 days, and 66.67% of them occurred within 28 days, which means this disease developed rapidly and led to death in a short time in high-risk patients\u201d (Discussion section, page 20, line 206-208).7. In the mechanism of thrombocytopenia, the role of high Von Willebrand levels is worth explainingResponse: Thank you for this helpful comment. We had added the relevant content related to high von Willebrand factor in revised manuscript: \u201cAs a result of endothelial injury, sub-endothelial collagen exposure promotes innate adhesion of platelets to collagen through von Willebrand factor, which is vital in the adhesion process and significantly increased in COVID-19 patients [32, 48]\u201d (Discussion section, page 22, line 250-252).8. the discussion on thrombocytopenia and respiratory function would benefit from some explanation for causation. The description here is about role of platelets rather than thrombocytopeniaResponse: We appreciate for this helpful comment. We described the role of platelet in the revised manuscript (Discussion section, page 20, line 210-217). Platelets can interact with virus and bacteria via surface cell receptors, and participate in the process of pathogen clearance and lung injury. SARS-CoV-2 couldn\u2019t be effectively cleared in patients with thrombocytopenia, and high load of SARS-CoV-2 in lung led to endothelial injury, microthrombi formation, and subsequently worsening acute lung injury. The role of interaction between platelets and endothelial cells is discussed in revised manuscript (Page 20-21, line 219-232).9. use mortality risk factors rather than Death risk factorsResponse: Thank you for your revise. We have corrected this descriptionReviewer #2: I would like to thank the editor for giving me the opportunity to review this article. The authors reported a detailed data of a cohort of sars-cov2 patients and thoroughly investigated the prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in this group of patients.Major Comments1. Results: One the major findings of the study was that both thrombocytopenia and prolonged aPTT were associated with higher 28-day and 180-day mortality. This finding may suggest that patient who died would have higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Tang N et al reported that the incidence of DIC in patients who died because of sars-cov2 pneumonia was as high as 71.4 % (J Thromb Haemost, 2020). This parameter was not investigated per se by the authors. I would advise the authors to define it and to investigate its value in predicting mortality.Response: We really appreciate this thoughtful comment. The DIC is a clinical diagnosis, which needs to be diagnosed by combining the patient\u2019s condition, medication and laboratory indexes and other data. We tried to define it, but we found that the incomplete clinical data and laboratory indexes make it impossible. However, we had defined the coagulation disorder using APTT and PT and found that patients died within 28 days had significant higher incidence of coagulation disorder than survivors (44.8% vs 15.6%, p<0.01). This may partly prove that coagulation disorder is associated with death in critically ill COVID-19 patients.2. Results: Table 3 displays the data on day 2, 2 and 3 while the authors mentioned in the methods that data were collected on day 1, 3 and 7. Please clarify.Response: Thank you. We apologize for the typo. We have corrected this error in Table 3.3. Similarly, figure 1 displays platelet count, the oxygenation index and the six-point-ordinal score up to day 10 which is contrasting the statement mentioned in the methods. Please clarify.Response: Thank you for pointing out this neglect. We have now modified the sentence in revised manuscript: \u201cPlatelet count, six-point ordinal scale scores and oxygenation indexes were recorded on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th day\u201d (Method section, page 4, line 90-91).4. 43.7 % of the patients required mechanical ventilation but the duration of mechanical ventilation was 0 [0-10] ? I would suggest to the authors to double check this finding.Response: We apologize for the typo. We checked and re-analyzed our data. We modified the duration of invasive ventilation in table 4 (Result section, Page 18-19). 5. Discussion-Mechanism of thrombocytopenia: In addition to the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia discussed by the authors, other factors should be probably discussed for the group of patients included in the study:o Drug-associated thrombocytopenia: 18.5 % received linezolid and others received chloroquine phosphate.o ECMO was required in 12 % of the patients in CRRT in 20 % : in addition to heparin requirement, both ECMO and CRRT have been associated with thrombocytopenia (ref: Panigada M, Minerva Anestesiol. 2016 Feb; 82(2):170-9 - Weingart C, Artif Organs. 2015 Sep; 39(9):765-73. o Procalcitonin was higher in patients with thrombocytopenia and higher incidence of septic shock was seen in patients with thrombocytopenia). The role of inflammation as a cause of thrombocytopenia should be discussed.Response: Thank you for this helpful comment. We added other possible mechanisms including those you mentioned above: \u201cAntiplatelet antibodies were also confirmed to be cause of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia [49, 50]. Other than that, the drugs such as linezolid, ribavirin, interferon, cephalosporin and chloroquine phosphate may result in drug-associated thrombocytopenia. [50-53]. ECMO and CRRT have also been reported to be associated with decrease of platelet count [54-57]. High incidences of secondary infections and septic shock were seen in our study, and the intense inflammation response will promote thrombosis and lead to thrombocytopenia as well [33, 58]\u201d (Discussion section, page 22, line 255-261).6. Platelets and respiratory function: The authors well described that thrombocytopenia is incriminated in worsening respiratory function. However, thrombocytopenia can also be the consequence of the disease. In fact, endothelial dysfunction in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome has been identified as a cause of thrombocytopenia.Response: Thank you for your comment. We agree with you. We have modified the discussion section, and added the sentence in revised manuscript: \u201cEndothelial injury was reported to be directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 [26]. The endothelial injury and cytokines released from endothelial cells can also lead to platelet activation and aggregation, leading to microthrombi formation and a decrease in platelet count [26, 32], which may also result in thrombocytopenia and lung injury. Thus, the association between thrombocytopenia and respiratory dysfunction is quite intricate and cannot be explained by simple causation\u201d (Discussion section, page 21, line 227-232). We also mentioned it in limitation section that further studies are needed to confirm their association. Minor comments- 7. Line 69: organ dysfunction rather than organ function.Response: Thank you. We have corrected it.8. Line 175 (median survival time in patients with thrombocytopenia: Please add the quartiles. It would be better to include this statement in the results rather than in the title of figure 2.Response: Thank you for this helpful commend. We deleted the description from the title of figure 2, and added the quartiles in the result section in the revised manuscript: \u201cThe median survival time in patients with thrombocytopenia was 17 (IQR, 7.5-180) days\u201d (Result section, page 16, line 171).AttachmentSubmitted filename: Response to Reviewers.docxClick here for additional data file.(169K, docx) \n4 Mar 2021\nAssociation between thrombocytopenia and 180-day prognosis of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units: a two-center observational study.PONE-D-20-31221R1Dear Dr. Peng,We\u2019re pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been judged scientifically suitable for publication and will be formally accepted for publication once it meets all outstanding technical requirements.Within one week, you\u2019ll receive an e-mail detailing the required amendments.
