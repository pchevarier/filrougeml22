{"title": "Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication-Crosstalk of Post-translational Modifications on the RNA Polymerase II", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jmb.2021.166912", "PMID": "33676925", "abstract": "The highly conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II comprises a consensus heptad (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) repeated multiple times. Despite the simplicity of its sequence, the essential CTD domain orchestrates eukaryotic transcription and co-transcriptional processes, including transcription initiation, elongation, and termination, and mRNA processing. These distinct facets of the transcription cycle rely on specific post-translational modifications (PTM) of the CTD, in which five out of the seven residues in the heptad repeat are subject to phosphorylation. A hypothesis termed the \"CTD code\" has been proposed in which these PTMs and their combinations generate a sophisticated landscape for spatiotemporal recruitment of transcription regulators to Pol II. In this review, we summarize the recent experimental evidence understanding the biological role of the CTD, implicating a context-dependent theme that significantly enhances the ability of accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II. Furthermore, feedback communication between the CTD and histone modifications coordinates chromatin states with RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, ensuring the effective and accurate conversion of information into cellular responses.", "author": [{"author": "Mukesh Kumar Venkat Ramani", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United States."], "href": "/?term=Venkat+Ramani+MK&cauthor_id=33676925"}, {"author": "Wanjie Yang", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United States."], "href": "/?term=Yang+W&cauthor_id=33676925"}, {"author": "Seema Irani", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United States."], "href": "/?term=Irani+S&cauthor_id=33676925"}, {"author": "Yan Zhang", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, United States; The Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology.
