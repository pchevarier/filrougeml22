{"title": "Initiation and termination of human U1 RNA transcription requires the concerted action of multiple flanking elements", "pubDate": "1989", "PMCID": "PMC335133", "DOI": "10.1093/nar/17.22.9305", "PMID": "2587258", "abstract": "Sequences in the 5' flanking region of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes are responsible for recognition of 3' end signals. Formation of the pre-U1 3' end occurs at the downstream signal closest to the promoter, probably by transcription termination. We have analyzed promoter elements for their participation in formation of the 3' ends of pre-U1 RNA. To do this, a human U1 RNA gene with deletions in individual promoter elements was microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the resulting RNAs were analyzed by a nuclease S1 protection assay. Each of the promoter elements, except element B (the functional equivalent of a TATA box), was shown to be dispensable for recognition of the snRNA 3' end signal. This latter element was necessary, but not sufficient, for initiation of transcription; so its possible role in termination could not be assessed. Therefore, it is likely that recognition of the 3' end signal is an inherent feature of transcription complexes that initiate at an snRNA promoter.", "author": [{"author": "H E Neuman de Vegvar", "affiliation": ["Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison 53706."], "href": "/?term=Neuman+de+Vegvar+HE&cauthor_id=2587258"}, {"author": "J E Dahlberg", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Dahlberg+JE&cauthor_id=2587258"}], "refPMID": ["3428274", "3656448", "2963336", "3437891", "2456520", "3180217", "3181131", "3182863", "3054517", "2974920", "2853685", "2714253", "2658217", "2472398", "175165", "985495", "922889", "631324", "631339", "274710", "383387", "7350544", "7190224", "6157418", "7232224", "6167267", "6179630", "6310323", "6194199", "6194892", "6419127", "6198328", "6203910", "2580642", "2410138", "2410771", "2411548", "2942763", "3462701", "2944599", "3768956", "3021336", "3024969", "3805053", "3027566", "3029720", "3031597", "3036847", "3037343", "3601664", "3627254", "2744461", "2752422", "3428599"], "citedInPMID": ["2587258", "28615474", "21925386", "20513430", "10329632", "8816454", "8668525", "8423795", "8413239", "8355718", "7891697", "7681521", "2251119", "2001675", "1986243", "1732737", "1715021", "1633438", "1579449", "1569941", "1508209"], "body": ""}
