While the majority of infected individuals (>90%) develop a self-limiting disease and recover, \u223c5%\u201310% of individuals develop severe respiratory disease marked by lung infiltrates and reduced oxygen saturation, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). To date, well over 2 million individuals have succumbed to COVID-19, including >500,000 in the United States alone. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age and comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, although younger and previously healthy individuals are also susceptible (Cummings et\u00a0al., 2020; Davies et\u00a0al., 2020). For individuals who recover from self-limiting illness, the immune system acts in a coordinated fashion to clear the virus and establish virus-specific immunity (Rydyznski Moderbacher et\u00a0al., 2020). However, the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 remains unclear, and understanding this phenomenon is urgently required to develop new treatment and prevention strategies.Immune responses to respiratory virus infection are focused in the lung, where innate immune responses are initiated by tissue-resident alveolar macrophages as well as infiltrating monocytes and granulocytes (Yoo et\u00a0al., 2013). The initial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung can precipitate cytokine storms in severe respiratory infections (Teijaro et\u00a0al., 2011b). Adaptive immune responses mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells involve mobilization of effector T\u00a0cells to the lung for mediating the clearance of infected cells in situ (Kohlmeier and Woodland, 2009). A proportion of these lung effector T\u00a0cells develop into tissue-resident memory T\u00a0cells (TRMs), which are retained in the lung and can mediate rapid protective responses upon viral challenge (Teijaro et\u00a0al., 2011a; Turner et\u00a0al., 2014; Turner and Farber, 2014; Wu et\u00a0al., 2014). In mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection, CD4+ TRM-like cells in the airways are required for protection (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2016). In adult lungs, TRMs are the predominant T\u00a0cell subset and persist in stable frequencies throughout many decades of life (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2018; Thome et\u00a0al., 2014), suggesting a crucial role in protection to respiratory pathogens. The role of resident immune cells, including alveolar macrophages and lung TRM in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their function in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 have yet to be elucidated.Studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have examined innate and adaptive immune cells as well as soluble mediators in the circulation of infected individuals, revealing elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hadjadj et\u00a0al., 2020; Laing et\u00a0al., 2020) and alterations in immune cell composition (Lucas et\u00a0al., 2020; Mathew et\u00a0al., 2020). Robust virus-specific adaptive immune responses have also been identified in the blood of individuals during acute infection and following recovery, including virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells (Grifoni et\u00a0al., 2020; Thieme et\u00a0al., 2020; Weiskopf et\u00a0al., 2020), and neutralizing antibodies specific for viral proteins (Long et\u00a0al., 2020; Ni et\u00a0al., 2020). How these systemic immune responses relate to innate and adaptive immunity in the respiratory tract and their contribution to disease is unclear and difficult to assess.Here, we sought to define the dynamic immune processes involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 by high-dimensional phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional profiling of immune responses in paired airway and blood samples obtained longitudinally from patients with severe COVID-19. This analysis, in conjunction with airway and blood samples from uninfected controls, suggests key functional roles for airway T\u00a0cells, monocytes, and macrophages associated with disease outcome. T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 airways exhibited activated and tissue-resident signatures as well as functionally protective profiles, and their frequencies in airways (but not in blood) correlated with younger age and survival. Conversely, airway monocytes and macrophages exhibited hyperinflammatory signatures producing chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL3, while the blood contained aberrant CD163hi and HLA-DRlo monocyte populations expressing the chemokine receptor CCR2. Accordingly, infiltrating myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways likely derive from recruitment from circulation, and their frequency was associated with older age and mortality. Our results provide evidence for myeloid cell-driven lung inflammation in severe COVID-19 and reveal potential targets for reducing lung damage by inhibiting airway-specific inflammatory processes. ResultsObtaining paired airway and blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients and controlsDuring the height of the pandemic in New York City, between April and June 2020, we enrolled patients with severe COVID-19 from adult and pediatric intensive care units at New York Presbyterian Hospital (see Method details for enrollment criteria). All of the enrolled patients exhibited clinical features of ARDS requiring mechanical ventilator support and intubation. We obtained daily paired airway and blood samples longitudinally from these patients starting at 24\u201336\u00a0h after intubation, and continuing for up to 10\u00a0days during their hospitalization (average 6\u20137 sample days per patient; sample numbers varied due to patient extubation or death during enrollment). Patients represented a broad age range (14\u201384 years old) and 8/15 (53%) died during enrollment or soon after (Table S1). Enrolled COVID-19 patients exhibited similar clinical features of disease severity and ARDS independent of outcome as assessed by markers of inflammation, neutrophil levels, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (Jones et\u00a0al., 2009), and PaO2:FiO2 (P:F) ratios (Ranieri et\u00a0al., 2012). Comorbidities were similar between deceased patients and those who survived, while the median age of survivors was significantly younger than those who succumbed (39 versus 72 years old). Treatments including steroids, anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) therapy, and remdesivir were given comparably to both groups and were not associated with mortality (Table S1). All of the patients developed high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies as measured in plasma (Weisberg et\u00a0al., 2021).Airway samples were obtained using a saline wash of the endotracheal tube performed daily as part of clinical care, which we have previously shown contains respiratory immune cell populations (Connors et\u00a0al., 2016, 2018). A total of 141 blood and airway cell preparations from COVID-19 patients were analyzed by high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry in comparison to airway samples obtained from washes of healthy control lungs (Snyder et\u00a0al., 2019) and blood samples from healthy volunteers (n\u00a0= 5; see Method details). Airway supernatants and blood plasma at early and late time points were assayed for cytokine and chemokine protein content, and successive samples from four COVID-19 patients were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Figure\u00a01\nA; Tables S2 and S3).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Immune cell composition in airways and blood compartments of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls(A) Schematic diagram showing assays performed on COVID-19 patient airway and blood samples for this study.(B) Principal-component analysis (PCA) of all COVID-19 samples based on mean marker expression colored by site (left), condition (center), and subjects (right).(C) UMAP embedding of flow cytometry results from all airway and blood samples combined colored by major cell lineage (top panel), and separated by tissue site in COVID-19 and healthy donor samples (bottom 4 panels) (COVID-19 airway: n\u00a0= 69, COVID-19 blood: n\u00a0= 83, healthy airway: n\u00a0= 5, healthy blood: n\u00a0= 5).(D) Boxplots showing the frequency of major immune cell lineages of total CD45+CD66b\u2212 cells in COVID-19 and healthy airway (left) and blood (right) samples.

Color of boxes corresponds to lineage, and each dot is an individual patient sample.Distinct immune cell composition in the airways and blood of severe COVID-19 patientsMononuclear cells in airway and blood samples were isolated from severe COVID-19 patients and uninfected healthy controls (see Method details), stained using a 34-marker panel containing antibodies specific for major lineage determinants and markers for differentiation, tissue residence, activation, and function (see Key resources table), and analyzed by spectral flow cytometry (gating strategy for mononuclear cells shown in Figure\u00a0S1). Principal-component analysis (PCA) of mean marker expression for each sample segregated airway and blood samples along PC2, but not by individual (Figure\u00a01B). While healthy airway samples intermixed with COVID-19 airway samples, healthy blood segregated from COVID-19 blood samples along PC1 (Figure\u00a01B; Table S4). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embeddings of flow cytometry data from all COVID-19 and control samples showed distinct separation of the major lineages (exclusive of neutrophils) into myeloid cells, CD4+ T\u00a0cells, CD8+ T\u00a0cells, B cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that were predominantly natural killer (NK) cells (Figures 1C and S1B).Quantitative comparison of immune cell frequencies between severe COVID-19 and healthy samples for each site revealed disease- and site-associated variations. Airways exhibited similar immune cell compositions between COVID-19 and controls, with predominant myeloid cells, lower frequencies of\u00a0T\u00a0cells, and negligible B cells and ILCs. By contrast, blood samples demonstrated multiple differences in immune cell composition between COVID-19 and controls, including decreases in CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cell frequencies and substantial increases in myeloid cell frequencies (Figure\u00a01D), consistent with previous studies (Lucas et\u00a0al., 2020). Our longitudinal sampling from COVID-19 patients demonstrated that the distinct immune cell compositions in airways and blood were stable across time (Figure\u00a01E). These findings indicate the compartmentalized distribution of immune cells in the airways during homeostasis and severe COVID-19, along with disease-driven changes in overall immune cell composition more highly manifested in blood.Age-related alterations in airway immune cell subsets are associated with survival from severe COVID-19Age is a strong independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 (Cummings et\u00a0al., 2020; Garibaldi et\u00a0al., 2021). We investigated whether the overall immune cell composition in airways and blood (average of all longitudinal samples obtained for each patient) was altered with age and/or associated with patient outcome. There were statistically significant correlations of age with immune cell frequencies in airways but not with those in blood (Figures 2\nA and S2A). In particular, there was a strong positive correlation of airway myeloid cells with age (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0= 0.65), while airway total and CD4+ T\u00a0cell frequencies were inversely correlated with age (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1\u00a0= \u22120.56 and \u22120.69, respectively) (Figure\u00a02A). Notably, mortality from severe COVID-19 was exclusive to older patients in the cohort (Figure\u00a02A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Longitudinal assessments of immune cell composition and association with age and outcome(A) Correlation of immune cell frequencies in the airways (left) and blood (right) with age.

Statistical significance was calculated by Spearman correlation (indicated by \u03c1), with p value shown in each graph.(B) Daily frequencies of immune cells in the airways (left) and blood (right) for each patient over time stratified by deceased and survived. Solid red and blue lines show mean cell lineage frequency for deceased and survived patients, respectively. Area under the curve (AUC) normalized for number of sampling days was calculated for each patient, and mean AUC is shown in each graph. Statistical significance was calculated by 1-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests (see Method details) for the AUC with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons and is denoted by \u2217p \u2264 0.05.(C) k-means trajectory clustering analysis of clinical and immune cell frequencies with outcome.

The true outcome of each patient is denoted by red (deceased) or blue (survived) lines, and inferred clustering by k-means is denoted by solid (deceased) or dashed (survived) lines. Correct clustering denoted by red solid lines and blue dashed lines. Right: patient outcome classification performance of longitudinal k-means clustering for different combinations of immune cell trajectories and clinical parameters (SOFA score and P:F ratio). The percentage of patient outcomes successfully classified as deceased or survived is shown for each parameter measured in airways (gray) or blood (black). Dotted red line indicates classification performance by the P:F ratio and SOFA score.Our acquisition of longitudinal data enabled the assessment of immune cell and clinical trajectories for their potential associations with disease outcome. Using an area under the curve (AUC) calculation, we found differences in the immune cell frequencies of both airway T\u00a0cells and myeloid cells, as well as blood myeloid cells of patients who died versus those who survived (Figure\u00a02B). The frequencies of other immune cells in airways (B cells, ILC) and blood (T cells, B cells, and ILCs) did not differ between these groups (Figures 2B and S2A). We further investigated whether the longitudinal trajectories of immune cell composition in the airways or blood were predictive of outcome, relative to corresponding clinical measurements of disease severity (SOFA scores and P:F ratio). We used a k-means clustering approach (see Method details) to classify the temporal dynamics of immune cell frequencies and clinical measurements (Figure\u00a02C). The clinical parameters (SOFA score\u00a0and P:F ratio) and immune cell frequencies in the blood\u00a0did not predict outcome (\u223c50% success rate), whereas both T and myeloid cell frequencies in the airways were predictive of outcome, with a 75% success rate (Figure\u00a02C). These results show that the frequencies of T and myeloid cells in the airways were associated with age and outcome, suggesting specific roles for these cell populations in COVID-19 disease pathogenesis.Tissue-resident memory T\u00a0cells predominate in airways and become activated in severe COVID-19The subset composition of airway and blood T\u00a0cells in severe COVID-19 versus healthy controls was examined using computational analysis of the high-dimensional flow cytometry data. Multiple markers of T\u00a0cell differentiation were used to distinguish CD4+ and CD8+ naive (CD45RA+CCR7+) and memory subsets (CD45RA\u2212CCR7\u2212/+CD95+), TRMs (CD69+CD103+/\u2212), regulatory T\u00a0cells (Tregs; CD4+CD25+CD127\u2212Foxp3+), along with markers of activation (human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype [HLA-DR], programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1]), co-stimulation (CD27, CD28), senescence and terminal differentiation (CD57, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 [KLRG1]), and \u03b3\u03b4 T\u00a0cells (TCRGD) (Figure\u00a03\nA). We used UMAP embeddings to visualize the expression of these multiple markers by the combined airway and blood T\u00a0cell dataset, showing segregation of the CD4+ lineage on the left, CD8+ on the right, and airway T\u00a0cells segregating at the top of each embedding (Figure\u00a0S3A). There was biased expression of CD69, CD103, PD-1, and HLA-DR in the airways, while CCR7, CD45RA, and CD127 expression was more prevalent in the blood (Figure\u00a0S3A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Airway T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 are dominated by TRM and activated phenotypes(A) Heatmap displaying expression of markers within PhenoGraph-generated, hierarchical T\u00a0cell clusters.

Right: frequency of T\u00a0cells expressing HLA-DR and PD-1 in the airways and blood for each COVID-19 patient (n\u00a0= 13; averaged over all time points) or healthy controls (n\u00a0= 5). Statistical significance was calculated using a 1-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s test for multiple comparisons and indicated by \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001.To analyze specific subsets of T\u00a0cells, PhenoGraph clustering based on marker expression yielded 24 clusters, which were coalesced into 13 denoting biological subsets, functional, and/or activation states in the airways and blood (Figure\u00a03A). Compositional analysis shown by UMAP embeddings, corresponding pie charts depicting frequency of each subset in the aggregated data (Figure\u00a03B), and quantification of individual compiled and paired data (Figures 3C and S3B) demonstrated site- and disease-associated alterations in T\u00a0cell subsets induced by severe COVID-19. T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 airways were predominantly CD4+ and CD8+ TRMs, as in healthy airways, but showed elevated proportions of activated TRM and TEM (effector memory) subsets expressing HLA-DR, PD-1, and reduced levels of CD127 (Figures 3A\u20133C). Severe COVID-19 airways also contained reduced Treg frequencies compared to healthy airways (Figures 3B and 3C) and overall increased frequencies of circulating TEM and TCM (central memory) cells in the aggregated analysis (Figure\u00a03B). These results suggest that T\u00a0cells are being activated in situ as well as recruited to the respiratory tract.By contrast, T\u00a0cell subset proportions in COVID-19 blood were similar to those of healthy controls, with comparable frequencies of naive, TCM, and TEM populations for both CD4+ and CD8+ lineages, although some COVID-19 patients showed an increase in blood CD4+ TEM cells (Figures 3B and 3C). Both COVID-19 and healthy blood lacked measurable TRM cells, which were compartmentalized exclusively in the airways, consistent with previous studies showing TRM in airways and lungs but not blood during homeostasis (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2017; Sathaliyawala et\u00a0al., 2013; Snyder et\u00a0al., 2019; Thome et\u00a0al., 2014). Importantly, activation markers (HLA-DR, PD-1) were highly expressed by T\u00a0cells specifically in COVID-19 airways, compared to the low level of expression by T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 blood and in both control sites (Figure\u00a03D). These analyses indicate that activated T\u00a0cells responding to the ongoing infection in severe COVID-19 were localized to the airways and are not present at high levels in circulation, a finding that is consistent with airway but not blood T\u00a0cells associated with improved outcome.Dysregulation of myeloid cells in the airways and blood of severe COVID-19We applied similar high-dimensional analysis to identify subsets of myeloid populations in aggregated airway and blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. PhenoGraph clustering of myeloid marker expression identified 21 clusters, which were coalesced into 9 clusters based on phenotypic similarity to classical and intermediate monocyte subsets (based on CD14 and CD16 expression) (Kapellos et\u00a0al., 2019) and macrophage subsets based on CD163 expression (Bharat et\u00a0al., 2016), along with key differentially expressed markers HLA-DR, CD86, and CD11c (Figures 4\nA and S4A). Data were visualized by UMAP and pie charts (Figure\u00a04B), as with T\u00a0cells in Figure\u00a03.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Dysregulated myeloid cell subsets in the blood and airways of COVID-19 patients(A) Heatmap displaying expression of markers within PhenoGraph-generated, hierarchical myeloid cell clusters.

Boxplots (to the right or below the contour plots) indicate the percentage of cells within each condition and site that were positive for specific markers. Statistical significance was calculated using a 1-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey HSD and indicated by \u2217p \u2264 0.05; \u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.01; and \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001.Severe COVID-19 airways and blood showed profound and significant alterations in the compartmentalization, distribution, and phenotypes of myeloid cell subsets compared to healthy controls (Figures 4B and 4C). In healthy controls, the myeloid populations in airways and blood were distinct; airways predominately contained CD163hi macrophages, with a minor CD163lo subset, as well as monocyte populations (CD163hi and intermediate subset) not found in blood (Figures 4B and 4C). Healthy blood contained a preponderance of HLA-DRhi classical monocytes (typically \u223c80%), with dendritic cells (DCs) comprising the remaining myeloid cells (Figures 4B and 4C). By contrast, COVID-19 airways exhibited substantial phenotypic overlap with blood myeloid subsets, suggesting infiltration from blood to airways. In COVID-19 airways, conventional CD163hi macrophages (blue) were present, along with an increased frequency of CD163loHLA-DRlo (green) and CD86hiHLA-DRhi cells (yellow) relative to control airways, as well as different monocyte subsets also seen in blood (Figures 4B and 4C). In COVID-19 blood, there were stark differences in monocyte phenotypes, including a predominance of CD163hi and HLA-DRlo monocytes that are not significantly present in healthy blood and additional monocytic subsets that were shared between COVID-19 airways and blood (Figures 4B and 4C). This analysis showed major aberrations in the distribution, phenotype, and composition of myeloid cells in the airways and blood of severe COVID-19 patients.To further investigate COVID-19-associated features of myeloid cells for each site, we analyzed the coordinate expression of antigen presentation-related molecules HLA-DR and CD86, functional myeloid markers CD64 and CD163, and CD14 and CD16 expression, which define monocyte subsets (Geissmann et\u00a0al., 2003). While HLA-DR was highly expressed by myeloid cells in COVID-19 and healthy airways, myeloid cells in the blood showed a profound reduction in HLA-DR expression relative to healthy controls, reflecting recent findings and suggesting a dysregulated or immature phenotype (Figure\u00a04D) (Schulte-Schrepping et\u00a0al., 2020). Conversely, airway myeloid cells in COVID-19 patients exhibited CD163 expression that was similar to levels expressed by CD163hiHLA-DRlo monocytes aberrantly present in blood, which was at a lower level compared to healthy airway CD163hi macrophages (Figure\u00a04E). Lastly, COVID-19 airways exhibited a striking reduction in CD16-expressing\u00a0monocytes, denoting an intermediate phenotype (CD14+CD16+) compared to healthy controls (Figure\u00a04F). Moreover, all COVID-19 blood monocyte subsets showed a reduction in HLA-DRhi cells relative to their respective healthy controls (Figure\u00a0S4B). Thus, our results indicate dysregulated monocytes in the blood, alterations of airway macrophages, and evidence for the infiltration of aberrant monocyte populations into the airways, a finding that is consistent with increased airway myeloid cells associated with worse outcomes.Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals biased expression of activated and inflammatory signatures in airway immune cellsTo dissect the functional states of T and myeloid cells in severe COVID-19, we applied transcriptome profiling by scRNA-seq to daily paired airway and blood samples from 4 patients (total of 126,564 cells; Table S3). This scRNA-seq profiling identified immune cell compositions that were consistent with flow cytometry results, along with additional airway cell types such as epithelial cells and ionocytes (Figures S5A, S5B, S6A, and S6B). Coordinate analysis of the transcriptomic profile of T and myeloid cells between airways and blood revealed how the immune processes in the respiratory tract were connected to those in circulation.For T\u00a0cells, scRNA-seq revealed distinct transcriptional profiles expressed by airways compared to circulating T\u00a0cells, as depicted in UMAP of the aggregated data and heatmaps of differentially expressed genes stratified by individual sample (Figures 5A and 5B). TRM signature genes CXCR6 and ITGA1 were uniquely expressed by airway T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a05A; Table S5), which is consistent with our previous scRNA-seq analysis of human TRM cells in airways and lungs (Snyder et\u00a0al., 2019; Szabo et\u00a0al., 2019). Naive and TCM cells distinguished by SELL expression were highly enriched in blood, while CCL5 expression indicated that TEM cells were found in both sites (Figure\u00a05A). The top differentially expressed genes between airways and blood revealed that T\u00a0cells from the airways exhibited a gene signature associated with TRM and tissue T\u00a0cells (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2017; Szabo et\u00a0al., 2019), including the upregulated expression of CXCR6, ITGA1, PDCD1, LGALS, LAG3, and RBPJ compared to blood T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a05B; Table S5). Importantly, airway T\u00a0cells also upregulated expression of multiple genes encoding key cytokines and chemokines, including IFNG, CCL2, and CCL4, compared to those in blood (Figure\u00a05B), which is consistent with an activated and pro-inflammatory state. By contrast, blood T\u00a0cells exhibited a higher expression of genes associated with quiescence (TCF7, LEF1) (Choi et\u00a0al., 2015) and lymphoid homing (SELL) (Figure\u00a05B). These results demonstrated the compartmentalization of functionally activated TRM populations exhibiting the signatures of protective T\u00a0cells in the respiratory tract of severe COVID-19 patients. These findings are also consistent with increased T\u00a0cells in the airways correlating to better outcomes.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Inflammatory gene signatures of T\u00a0cells and myeloid cells are enriched in the airways of COVID-19 patientsT cells, monocytes, and macrophages from the blood and airways of COVID-19 patients were analyzed by scRNA-seq (see Method details).(A) Separate UMAP embeddings showing gene expression from total T\u00a0cells obtained from airways and blood of paired samples from 4 patients. UMAP embeddings show sample site origin, subject, and indicated gene expression (based on log2(CPM+1)).(B) Heatmap showing major differentially expressed genes in airway compared to blood T\u00a0cells from each individual patient and time point. Data are colored by row Z scored log2(CPM+1) for each sample.(C) UMAP embeddings of total monocytes and macrophages obtained from airways and blood from 4 COVID-19 patients. UMAP embeddings show sample site origin, patient, and selected gene expression displayed as log2(CPM+1)/maximum.(D) Heatmap of subset-defining genes, homing receptors, and key inflammatory molecules for monocytes and macrophages in airways and blood from each patient sample. The heatmap shows genes that are not differentially expressed between airways and blood (CD14-FCGR3A) and genes are consistently differentially expressed (ITGAV-TREM2).Transcriptome analysis of myeloid cells revealed overlapping lineage markers between airways and blood, but elevated expression of inflammatory gene signatures in the airways that were consistent across individuals (Figure\u00a05; Table S6). There was similar expression of lineage-defining genes (CD14, FCGR3A, CD68, CD163) by myeloid cells in airways and blood (Figures 5C and 5D). The expression of tissue macrophage markers MARCO and MRC1 (CD206) (Bharat et\u00a0al., 2016) and the integrin ITGAV (vitronectin receptor) were specific to airway myeloid cells, while blood myeloid cells expressed transcripts for chemokine, homing, and egress receptors (CX3CR1, CCR2, SELL, S1PR4) (Figures 5C and 5D). For genes associated with myeloid cell function, airway myeloid cells exhibited elevated levels of transcripts for multiple inflammatory mediators, including chemokines for the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4), lymphocytes (CCL18, CCL20, CCL23), neutrophils (CXCL3, CXCL5), complement components (C3, C1QB, C1QC), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9, MMP14) implicated in tissue damage in ARDS (Hendrix and Kheradmand, 2017) (Figure\u00a05D). Together, these results demonstrate that airway myeloid cells exhibit a hyperinflammatory state in the expression of multiple cytokines and chemokines for the recruitment of immune cells. In particular, the airway-specific expression of CCL2 transcripts along with the biased expression of its receptor CCR2 by blood monocytes reveals a potential mechanism for the observed infiltration of blood-derived monocytes into the airways in severe COVID-19.Interferon (IFN)-regulated genes are associated with innate antiviral immunity and may be dysregulated in COVID-19 (Hadjadj et\u00a0al., 2020). However, there was a negligible expression of genes encoding types I, II, and III IFNs from myeloid cells, epithelial cells, or T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a0S6B), consistent with the lack of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences (see Method details) in scRNA-seq data from 4 patients. However, transcripts associated with multiple IFN-regulated gene families (i.e., ISG, IFI, IFIT, IRF, MX, and OAS) were detected in both the airway and blood myeloid cells, as well as airway epithelial and T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a0S6B), suggesting a persisting antiviral state in immune cells across compartments. While the expression of IFN-regulated genes may also be triggered by IFNG expressed by airway T\u00a0cells (Figures 5A and 5B), our scRNA-seq analysis indicates that major inflammatory pathways are propagated by airway myeloid cells and may include the high-level production of chemokines and cytokines for cellular recruitment and promoting tissue damage in situ.Inflammatory mediators are highly elevated in the airways during severe COVID-19To investigate whether the transcript expression of inflammatory markers correlated to secreted proteins, we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in airway supernatants and plasma samples from each COVID-19 patient (Table S2), using a microfluidic multiplexed secretome proteomic platform (Farhadian et\u00a0al., 2020). Overall, we found marked differences in cytokine and chemokine content in the airways compared to plasma as seen in paired samples and at early (day 1) and later (days 3\u20137) time points (Figures 6\nA, S7A, and S7B). Analytes elevated in\u00a0airways compared to blood include the chemoattractants monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 [CCL2]), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1 [CCL3]), and MIP-1\u03b2 (CCL4), and T\u00a0cell-associated cytokines granzyme B, IL-7, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b2 (TNF-\u03b2) (Figures 6A, 6B, and S7B). By contrast, in the blood CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), granzyme B, TNF-\u03b2, and IL-7 were undetectable, while CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) was present at variable levels across patients (Figures 6A and 6B). Both blood and airways contained low and/or variable levels of molecules associated with T\u00a0cell effector function (perforin, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and IL-2), additional innate cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8), and TGF-\u03b2 (Figures 6A, 6B, and S7B). These results show the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the airway, with only a subset of these detected in the blood.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06COVID-19 airways contain highly elevated levels of myeloid and T\u00a0cell-derived cytokines(A) Pairwise comparison of cytokine levels averaged across both time points in airway wash and blood plasma samples collected from 15 patients.

Heatmap shows log2(mean CPM+1) gene expression.To define the cellular origin of the soluble mediators detected in each compartment, we analyzed transcript expression for each of the molecules in Figure\u00a06B by scRNA-seq. Overall, transcript expression of prominent cytokines/chemokines largely correlated to the protein data; airway myeloid cells expressed high levels of CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 transcripts corresponding to the high levels of the respective proteins in airways, while blood myeloid cells expressed lower or undetectable levels of these transcripts (Figure\u00a06C). Airway and blood myeloid cells also expressed CXCL8 and TGFB1, consistent with the protein data (Figure\u00a06C). In the airways, T\u00a0cells expressed GZMB, CXCL8, CCL4, PRF, IFNG, and TGFB1 transcripts, which were expressed by blood T\u00a0cells at lower or variable levels (Figure\u00a06C). Airway epithelial cells expressed predominantly CXCL8 transcripts, as well as lower levels of transcripts for IL-7 and several chemokines (Figure\u00a06C). Overall, these results demonstrate a highly inflammatory environment in the airways of severe COVID-19 patients and establish a chemokine gradient for recruiting immune cells from the circulation to the site of infection, particularly for the monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL3.Accumulation of monocytes and macrophages in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patientsWe hypothesized that the production of monocyte chemoattractants in the airways may recruit dysregulated blood monocytes into the lung. We therefore examined T and myeloid cells in lung autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients with diffuse alveolar damage, the main pathological finding in COVID-19 ARDS (De Michele et\u00a0al., 2020), relative to lungs from uninfected organ donor controls (Carpenter et\u00a0al., 2018) (Table S7). In uninfected lungs, CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells were clustered around the airway epithelium, while CD163+ monocytes and macrophages as well as neutrophils (MMP9+) were dispersed in the parenchyma (Figure\u00a07\nA, top left). In COVID-19 lungs, there was a marked increase in CD163+ myeloid cells aggregated in the alveolar spaces, critical sites for oxygenation. Also detectable were CD8+ T\u00a0cells producing granzyme B, consistent with a cytotoxic response (Figure\u00a07A). Quantitative analysis of the lung imaging data showed significant increases in the frequency and density of CD163+ monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 versus uninfected lungs, while numbers and density of lymphocytes (CD4+ T\u00a0cells, CD8+ T\u00a0cells, and B cells) and neutrophils were similar between COVID-19 and control lungs (Figure\u00a07B). However, myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways and blood did not express genes associated with proliferation (Ki67, TOP2A, UBE2C) (Figure\u00a07C). These findings, together with our phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional analysis of myeloid cells in airways and blood (Figures 4, \u200b,5,5, and \u200band6),6), strongly implicate myeloid cell recruitment as a major mechanism perpetuating the inflammation and pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07COVID-19 lung autopsies exhibit specific and extensive accumulation of monocyte and macrophages relative to control lungs(A) Lung sections obtained from non-diseased organ donors and autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients with diffuse alveolar damage were stained with indicated antibodies and analyzed using Vectra.

DiscussionDuring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the restoration of normal life is impeded first and foremost by the most severe COVID-19 cases, including debilitating ARDS and its high mortality. For respiratory viruses, protective immune responses as well as immunopathology occur in the lung and respiratory tract. While numerous studies demonstrate characteristic features of innate and adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection that are detectable in blood (Kuri-Cervantes et\u00a0al., 2020; Lucas et\u00a0al., 2020; Mathew et\u00a0al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et\u00a0al., 2020; Schulte-Schrepping et\u00a0al., 2020), the role of these COVID-19-specific immune alterations in disease pathogenesis is unclear. Several studies have assessed cellular composition within the respiratory environment in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and lung autopsies (Chua et\u00a0al., 2020; Damiani et\u00a0al., 2021; Liao et\u00a0al., 2020; Veras et\u00a0al., 2020). However, an understanding of the dynamic immune processes in the respiratory tract in the context of circulating immune cell populations is required to dissect mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.In this study, we obtained paired respiratory and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 longitudinally during the course of intensive care hospitalization. We used high-dimensional profiling by spectral flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, along with multiplex cytokine quantification and\u00a0immunofluorescence imaging to characterize airway and systemic immune responses in COVID-19 compared to healthy control samples. Our results suggest functional protective signatures for T\u00a0cells in the respiratory tract, consistent with their associations with younger age and survival from severe COVID-19. Conversely, we identify a key role for airway myeloid cells, primarily macrophages and monocytes, in driving and perpetuating immune cell recruitment and lung inflammation, consistent with their associations with older age and mortality. We further identify a potential role for CCL2 in promoting the recruitment of dysregulated monocytes through a chemotactic axis that could serve as a therapeutic target for reducing lung inflammation and damage in severe COVID-19.A striking feature of T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 was their biased activation and functional profiles in airways. T\u00a0cells in COVID-19 airways were predominantly tissue resident, bearing TRM phenotypes and gene expression profiles similar to control airways. TRM in COVID-19 airways exhibited activation profiles, including surface phenotypes (HLA-DRhiPD-1hiCD127lo) and upregulated expression of transcripts for effector molecules such as perforin, GZMB, and IFNG, features of protective T\u00a0cell responses in viral infections. The presence of activated TRM in the airways of COVID-19 patients and not in control airways further indicates a virus-directed response. In mouse influenza infection, the presence of activated lung TRM in situ to influenza infection correlates with virus-specific responses (Paik and Farber, 2021; Turner et\u00a0al., 2014), further supporting the idea that in situ activation is a surrogate for antiviral protective responses. Our results also suggest that T\u00a0cell activation, as assessed in circulation during active COVID-19 (Mathew et\u00a0al., 2020; Takahashi et\u00a0al., 2020), may not reflect T\u00a0cell responses in the respiratory tract.Myeloid cells in the airways and blood of COVID-19 patients exhibited profound alterations in phenotype, function, and compartmentalization. Notably, COVID-19 airways contained tissue macrophages with inflammatory signatures expressing multiple genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators such as\u00a0CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL8, MMP, and complement components. Excessive levels of CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1), and CCL4 (MIP-1\u03b2) proteins were detected in the airways, but not in blood, further supporting a role of airway myeloid cells in perpetuating inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19. This phenotypic and functional profile of COVID-19 airway monocytes and macrophages\u00a0shares features with human macrophages in ARDS due to non-infectious causes, including the production of CCL2 and CXCL8, as well as the induction of MMPs and complement (Aggarwal et\u00a0al., 2014; Morrell et\u00a0al., 2019). Our results indicate that COVID-19 ARDS shares some key features with ARDS resulting from other infectious or non-infectious causes.Our coordinate analysis of airway and blood myeloid cells and soluble mediators suggests an analogous role for airway macrophages driving lung damage in COVID-19 ARDS through the recruitment of circulating monocytes. We show that blood monocytes in severe COVID-19 express increased levels of CCR2 transcripts and aberrant CD163hiHLA-DRlo/CD86lo phenotypes compared to healthy blood monocytes. Reduced HLA-DR expression indicative of immature or dysregulated monocytes has been identified in blood myeloid cells in severe COVID-19 (Schulte-Schrepping et\u00a0al., 2020; Silvin et\u00a0al., 2020) and may derive from inflammation-induced mobilization from the bone marrow, called emergency myelopoiesis (Schultze et\u00a0al., 2019; Shi et\u00a0al., 2011; Venet et\u00a0al., 2020). We show that monocyte chemoattractants (CCL2, CCL3) are specifically produced in the respiratory tract, while blood monocytes express the cognate receptor CCR2, suggesting recruitment along a CCL2 gradient as found in ARDS models (Aggarwal et\u00a0al., 2014). Immunofluorescence imaging of lungs from severe COVID-19 patients also shows a striking accumulation of CD163-expressing monocytes and macrophages in the alveolar spaces of the lungs, a key site for blood gas exchange, suggesting their involvement in diffuse alveolar damage observed in COVID-19 pathology (De Michele et\u00a0al., 2020). Our findings are further consistent with studies of influenza-infected individuals that identified inflammatory monocytes in severe disease (Cole et\u00a0al., 2017) and increased inflammatory chemokines in the airways, which correlated with airway monocyte infiltration and disease severity (Oshansky et\u00a0al., 2014).Our results defining airway immune responses in COVID-19 and their relation to the corresponding immune reactants in blood have profound implications for treating and preventing disease. Treatments targeting systemic inflammation, either globally with steroids or specifically with cytokine blockade, have shown variable efficacy in severe COVID-19 (Della-Torre\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Furlow, 2020). Our results suggest that targeting airway-derived cytokines such as CCL2 through CCR2 antagonists or other airway-specific mediators may be more effective in reducing lung damage or even promoting recovery from ARDS in severe COVID-19. Importantly, preventing CCL2-mediated monocyte recruitment to the lungs was an effective strategy to reduce severity in mouse models of influenza infection (Lin et\u00a0al., 2008, 2011), suggesting a generalized mechanism for respiratory virus-induced lung injury.Conversely, airway T\u00a0cells exhibit protective functional signatures and increased proportions are associated with younger age and survival. Interestingly, monitoring airway T\u00a0cell frequencies was a more robust predictor of outcome than the SOFA score and P:F ratio, which are two of the most commonly used severity-of-illness measures and strongest predictors of mortality in ARDS (Ranieri et\u00a0al., 2012; Vincent et\u00a0al., 1998). While these results require validation in larger cohort studies, airway T\u00a0cell measurements could be a useful biomarker to monitor patients. In addition, promoting lung-localized immune responses could be beneficial in vaccines. The current approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines target the generation of neutralizing antibodies and are robust strategies for establishing sterilizing immunity (Jeyanathan et\u00a0al., 2020); however, respiratory targeting could be considered for individuals who are unable to develop effective antibody responses. These cohorts may include the immunocompromised or the elderly, or this strategy could be used as a booster for those at risk of infection due to frequent interactions with others through their living or work situations. A recent pre-clinical study demonstrated that intranasal administration of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccine promoted lung TRM generation and protection from viral challenge in mice (Hassan et\u00a0al., 2020).In summary, our study provides a dynamic view of ongoing respiratory and systemic immunity in severe COVID-19, revealing key roles for airway immune cells in promoting protection and driving lung inflammation. These findings have important implications for how we monitor, treat, and protect from this pandemic and future infectious challenges to the respiratory tract.Limitations of studyLimitations of this study include a small cohort size and short sampling window (up to 10\u00a0days after intubation) during a course of prolonged acute illness. Due to the small sample size and the older age of patients who died, we were not able to separate the role of age and immune cell frequencies with outcomes. However, the strong inverse correlation that we observed between age and lower T\u00a0cell frequencies suggests that there are age-related changes in airway immunity that may explain the higher mortality observed in older adults with severe COVID-19. Moreover, we only studied respiratory and blood responses in severe COVID-19 and not in more mild manifestations of the disease, and it will be interesting in future studies to incorporate upper respiratory sampling to assess immunity during a resolved infection.

Additional Supplemental Items are available from Mendeley Data at http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/fm7v43jrbk.4\nExperimental model and subject detailsHuman samples We recruited patients from CUIMC/NYP and Morgan Stanley Children\u2019s Hospital of NY with severe COVID-19 and ARDS (n\u00a0= 15) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs (Tables S1 and S2). Blood and airway sampling began within 24-36 hours for all patients. ARDS was defined by clinical consensus criteria including infiltrates on chest radiograph and a PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio of less than 300, or pediatric criteria equivalent (Khemani et\u00a0al., 2015; Ranieri et\u00a0al., 2012). Exclusion criteria included patients with cancer, transplant recipients, immunodeficiencies, and existing bacterial infection. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated on all hospitalized patients using previously validated adult and pediatric score tools to provide additional clinical insight into patient disease severity (Matics and Sanchez-Pinto, 2017; Singer et\u00a0al., 2016; Vasilevskis et\u00a0al., 2016). All patients and samples in this study were enrolled on protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at CUIMC. Due to the limitations placed on direct contact with infected patients and a need to conserve personal protective equipment, verbal informed consent was obtained from surrogates of critically ill COVID-19-ARDS patients.Paired airway and blood samples were obtained from COVID-19 patients enrolled as above daily or every second day up to 7-10\u00a0days; the number of samples obtained varied due to patient death or extubation. Airway samples were collected from saline washes of the endotracheal tube during routine clinical care and blood samples were obtained by venous puncture. Healthy blood was obtained from 5 adult volunteers 31-57 years.Control, uninfected lung tissues were obtained from deceased organ donors (who died > 2 years before the pandemic) as part of organ acquisition for clinical transplantation through an approved protocol and material transfer agreement with LiveOnNY as described previously (Carpenter et\u00a0al., 2018; Dogra et\u00a0al., 2020). Donors were free of cancer, chronic diseases, seronegative for hepatitis B, C, and HIV, and negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (Table S7). Use of organ donor tissues does not qualify as \u201chuman subjects\u201d research, as confirmed by the Columbia University IRB as tissue samples were obtained from brain-dead (deceased) individuals.Method detailsProcessing of blood samples and isolation of PBMCs from COVID-19 patients Whole blood collected in heparinized vacutainers was centrifuged at 400 x g for 10\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to isolate plasma, which was then stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE) density gradient centrifugation in a Biosafety Level 2+ facility. To remove neutrophils, blood was incubated with RosetteSep Granulocyte Depletion Cocktail (StemCell Technologies, Inc.), diluted 1:3 in room temperature DPBS (Corning), layered over Ficoll-Paque PLUS in 50mL conical tubes, and centrifuged for 20\u00a0min at 1,200 x g. The PBMC layer was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were washed twice with DPBS before counting with the automated NucleoCounter NC-3000 cell counter (ChemoMetec).Processing of airway samples and isolation of airway MNCs from COVID-19 patients Both the cellular content and supernatants were collected from airway samples. To collect airway supernatants, DPBS was added 1:1 directly to airway samples and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10\u00a0min at RT. The resulting supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. To isolate airway MNCs, samples were treated with Benzonase (Millipore Sigma), purified through 100\u00a0\u03bcm filters, and centrifuged on a density gradient using Ficoll-Paque PLUS. The MNC layer was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were washed twice with DPBS before counting with the automated NucleoCounter NC-3000 cell counter.Cell preparation for scRNA-seq, library generation and sequencing Airway and blood MNC populations were isolated as above, and the remaining neutrophils and red blood cells were removed by incubating samples with biotinylated anti-CD66b and anti-CD235ab antibodies, and depleting antibody-bound cells with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Bangs Labs). Dead cells were subsequently removed using the Dead Cell Removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The Next GEM Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) and Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3\u2032 Reagent kit v3.1 (10x Genomics) was used for co-encapsulation and scRNA-seq library construction as per manufacturer\u2019s suggested protocols. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, targeting \u223c300M raw reads per sample (\u223c60,000 raw reads per cell). Sample details and number of cells sequenced in each are shown in Table S3.Isolation of airway washes from non-diseased lungs Uninfected lungs were obtained from deceased organ donors as described above. Airway washes were obtained by flushing out the major airway with 60\u00a0mL saline as described (Snyder et\u00a0al., 2019). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in DPBS and stained with antibodies for flow cytometry.High-dimensional flow cytometry For high parameter analysis using the Cytek Aurora panel, 5x106 cells from each site were stained in 5\u00a0mL U-bottom tubes in the dark using antibody panels as described in the Key resources table. Briefly, cells were first washed with DPBS, re-suspended with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at RT in the dark for 30\u00a0min. Cells were washed with cold FACS-buffer (DPBS\u00a0+ 2% FBS\u00a0+ 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA) and re-suspended with human TrueStain FcX and True-Stain Monocyte Blocker (BioLegend) and incubated in the dark for 10\u00a0minutes. Next, cells were incubated with a cell-surface marker staining cocktail as described in Key resources table at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Stained cells were washed twice with cold FACS-buffer to remove unbound antibodies. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with intracellular antibodies (Key resources table) using a Foxp3 Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) as per manufacturer\u2019s suggested protocols. Cells were incubated in the dark for 30\u00a0minutes with intracellular antibodies and washed twice. Data was collected on 5-laser Cytek Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Bio).Highly-multiplexed CodePlex chip secretome proteomics Cryopreserved tracheal washes and plasma were thawed at room temperature for 30-60\u00a0minutes and mixed well by pipetting up and down prior to loading. An aliquot of 5.5\u00a0\u03bcL of each sample was pipetted into each macrochambers of a CodePlex chip pre-patterned with a complete copy of a 23-plex antibody array. 2% BSA/PBS was used as background control. The chip was then loaded into an IsoLight automation system and various proteins were measured by fluorescence ELISA and analyzed by the IsoSpeak software using the IsoPlexis Human Adaptive Immune Panel: GM-CSF, Granzyme B, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, Perforin, sCD137, TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2.Multispectral staining and imaging of lung tissue Representative samples of lung tissue 0.5\u20131.0\u00a0cm in thickness were obtained from organ donors and autopsy cases of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and found on post-mortem exam to have pathological findings consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (Table S7). Uninfected lung sections were obtained from deceased organ donors who were brain dead due to trauma > 2 years prior to the pandemic. None of the donors used for the control staining in Figure\u00a07 showed pathological evidence of lung damage or diffuse alveolar damage.Samples were fixed in 10% formalin (Anatech Ltd.) for 48 hours prior to dehydration and embedding in paraffin. These lung samples were sectioned at 5-mm thickness and stained using 7-color multispectral Opal reagents (Akoya Biosciences) as previously described (Gartrell et\u00a0al., 2018; Weisberg et\u00a0al., 2019). The multiplex panel included DAPI for nuclear counterstaining, CD4 (1:150 dilution), CD8 (1:600 dilution), CD163 (1:200 dilution), granzyme B (GzmB) (1:200 dilution), CD19 (1:50 dilution), MMP9 (1:900 dilution). Single controls and an unstained slide were stained with each group of slides. After staining, the sections were mounted in Vectashield Hard Set mounting media (Vector Labs, Cat#H1600) and stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 48 hours prior to image acquisition. Multispectral imaging and acquisition at 20x magnification (numerical aperture 0.75) was performed using the integrated Vectra 3 automated quantitative pathology imaging system (PerkinElmer) as previously described (Weisberg et\u00a0al., 2019). Images were analyzed using inForm software (PerkinElmer/Akoya Biosciences). Representative areas (10-30) from each donor were chosen for quantitative analysis.Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry data was pre-gated to exclude any doublets, dead cells and CD66b+ granulocytes using FlowJo v 10.7 (Tree Star) (Figure\u00a0S1). Cleaned data was exported as .fcs files with compensated parameters and analyzed further and visualized using a Python (v3.7) (Python Software Foundation. Python Language Reference, version 2.7.) computational pipeline. In brief, first the data was filtered to remove any noise using quantile gates; events that fell below 0.01% of marker expression intensity were removed from the sample. Following initial filtering, data from COVID-19 and healthy samples was merged after subsetting 60,000 events from each COVID-19 airway and blood sample, 120,000 events from each healthy blood sample, and all events from healthy airway samples. Any sample with fewer than 1000 events was removed from further analysis. The merged dataset was transformed using arcsinh function from Python numpy library (van der Walt et\u00a0al., 2011) after manually adjusting the cofactor for each marker. Following normalization, the dataset was normalized on a 0-1 feature scale for each marker using MinMaxScaler function from Python scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et\u00a0al., 2011). The cleaned, transformed and scaled dataset was used to run the first round of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (McInnes et\u00a0al., 2018) dimensionality reduction to remove any residual granulocyte contamination identified as clusters of CD45loCD66b+ cells. The resulting dataset was used for downstream analysis.We ran PCA analysis at sample level using mean expression of markers in each sample, PCA loadings provided in Table S3. Next, we ran UMAP dimensionality reduction (k\u00a0= 60) on this dataset using 10 lineage-defining markers (CD14, CD16, CD19, CD3, CD33, CD4, CD8, CD64, CD56, CD335). The data were projected in 2-dimensions using UMAP embeddings and clusters of major immune cell types (CD4 and CD8 T\u00a0cells, B cells, NK/ILC and Myeloid cells) were identified based on expression of lineage defining markers (Figure\u00a0S2A). Frequency of the major lineages was calculated for each donor sample.For immune cell lineage and age analyses (Figures 2A and S2A), the average frequency values across all time points for each patient was calculated and plotted relative to age, showing spearman\u2019s rho values with corresponding p value. For longitudinal analyses of immune cell frequencies between deceased and surviving patients (Figure\u00a02B), area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated for each patient and divided by the number of sampling days (omitting COV007 who was sampled for one day only). Statistical significance between deceased and survived groups was calculated based on AUC using a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, testing the specific hypothesis that increased protective responses (T cells) are associated with positive outcomes (D\u00a0< S) and increased pro-inflammatory responses (myeloid cells) would be associated with negative outcomes (D > S). We applied a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.For lineage specific analysis (T cells, myeloid cells), we ran UMAP dimensionality reduction and subsequent Phenograph clustering (Levine et\u00a0al., 2015) on each lineage specific dataset using cell subset defining markers selected based on literature review. Markers used for T\u00a0cell UMAP are shown in Figure\u00a0S4A. Myeloid cell markers are shown in Figure\u00a0S5A. Major cell subset clusters were identified and functionally similar subsets were coalesced and manually annotated. Heatmaps were generated for average marker expression in each of the annotated clusters. Data are presented as row normalized expression of marker across all clusters. All graphs were generated using the Python matplotlib and seaborn libraries (Hunter, 2007).Classifying patient outcomes using longitudinal K-means clustering Patients were partitioned into two groups using a longitudinal K-means algorithm applied to the trajectories of the frequencies of myeloid, B cell, CD4 and CD8 T\u00a0cell and ILCs in blood or airways in addition to the trajectories of SOFA score and P/F ratio. The proximity of two patients\u2019 trajectories was defined using the sum of the squared Euclidean distances between their subset frequencies at each location at each time point, after normalizing each subset frequency across all patients and time points. The clustering outcome was robust to this definition of distance, giving identical results when performed using log- or logit-transformed frequencies. Classification performance was defined as the percentage of patients that were assigned to the correct outcome cluster (deceased or survived). We compared the abilities of different immune cell subsets to distinguish patient outcome by repeating the clustering analysis on different combinations of trajectories. Greater classification performance indicated increased power to identify patient outcomes. Clustering analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.3 using the kml3d package, version 2.4.2, and the results were visualized using the ggplot2 package.Processing of scRNA-seq data We used kallisto v0.46.2 in \u201cBUS\u201d mode to pseudo-align the raw reads for each sample to a merged human GRCh38 (Ensembl 93)/SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome (Bray et\u00a0al., 2016; Kim et\u00a0al., 2020; Melsted et\u00a0al., 2019a; Melsted et\u00a0al., 2019b). To correct for index swapping, which can occur on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000, we applied the algorithm of Griffiths et\u00a0al. (2018) to the equivalence classes obtained from kallisto pseudo-alignment. We generated a raw count matrix from the swap-corrected BUS file using bustools v0.40.0 (Melsted et\u00a0al., 2019b), filtered using the EmptyDrops algorithm (Lun et\u00a0al., 2019), and removed all cells with mitochondrial pseudo-alignment rates > 20% or counts per gene greater than two standard deviations above the mean for each sample.scRNA-seq cell annotation We merged the scRNA-seq data from all of the airway samples and identified likely markers of specific subpopulations using the previously described drop-out score method for finding genes that are detected in fewer cells than expected given their expression level (Levitin et\u00a0al., 2019; Szabo et\u00a0al., 2019). Next, we computed a cell-by-cell Spearman\u2019s rank correlation matrix using these putative marker genes. Using this matrix, we constructed a k-nearest neighbor\u2019s graph (k\u00a0= 20) as input for Louvain community detection as implemented in Phenograph (Levine et\u00a0al., 2015). To associate the resulting clusters with major cell populations in the airway, we examined the statistical enrichment of the following marker genes in each cluster using the binomial test as described in Shekhar et\u00a0al. (2016): T\u00a0cells (CD3D, TRAC, TRBC1, TRBC2, TRDC, TRGC1, TRGC2), NK cells (NCAM1), myeloid cells (CD14, FCGR3A, CD163), epithelial/club/goblet cells (EPCAM, SCGB1A1, MUC5B, KRT78), ionocytes (CFTR), neutrophils (CD16B), plasma cells (CD19, JCHAIN), B cells (CD19, MS4A1), platelets (ITGA2B, PF4), mast cells (KIT), dendritic cells (FCER1A, CD1C) and red blood cells (HBA1, HBA2, HBB).We identified clusters as likely multiplets based on co-expression of multiple marker sets (e.g., clusters enriched in both CD14 and CD3D were marked as likely T\u00a0cell / myeloid cell multiplets). All of the cells in these clusters were marked as multiplets. UMAP embeddings for all cells from each patient across all time points for airways and blood are shown in Figure\u00a0S5.In the main text, we present focused analyses on myeloid cells, T\u00a0cells, and epithelial/club/goblet cells from the airway. To further refine our annotation, we re-clustered the cells annotated as each of these three cell types separately using the methods described above. We then re-analyzed the enrichment of cell type-specific markers in the resulting new clusters. As expected, this focused re-analysis of each of these three major populations identified additional putative multiplet clusters and cells that we likely mis-clustered in the initial merged analysis. We conducted two rounds of re-clustering for each of these three major cell types to produce a refined annotation. The top of Figure\u00a0S6A shows a gene expression heatmap for key marker genes in the merged airway dataset colored by patient and cell type annotation. We repeated the above procedure for the merged blood scRNA-seq profiles including a focused re-clustering analysis of the cells that we originally annotated as myeloid and T\u00a0cells for refinement. The bottom of Figure\u00a0S6A shows a gene expression heatmap for key marker genes in the merged blood dataset colored by patient and cell type annotation.scRNA-seq visualization and differential expression analysis We generated merged UMAP embeddings for the blood and airway T\u00a0cells (Figure\u00a05A) and the blood and airway myeloid cells (Figure\u00a05C). In each case, we first identified genes that were likely to contaminate either the myeloid or T\u00a0cell profiles in either the blood or airway to avoid including them in any of our downstream clustering, visualization, or differential expression analysis. We conducted pairwise differential expression analysis between all of the cells annotated as a cell type-of-interest (e.g., myeloid) and each group of cells with a different annotation for the blood and airway from each patient separately. For each pairwise comparison, we randomly subsampled the two groups of cells to the same cell number. Next, we randomly subsampled the molecular counts for cells in the two groups such that they have the same average number of counts per cell. We then generated a merged count matrix for the two groups and applied the pooled normalization technique from the scran package of Lun et\u00a0al. (2016) using the computeSumFactors function. Finally, we conducted a gene-by-gene, non-parametric differential expression analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test as implemented with the function mannwhitneyu from the Python package scipy. We corrected the resulting p values for false discovery using the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure with the function multipletests from the Python package statsmodels. Using the results of pairwise differential expression analysis, we generated a blacklist of genes for a given cell type by taking any gene with at least 10-fold enrichment in a different cell type with FDR\u00a0< 0.001 in at least two patients. We removed all genes with any enrichment in the cell type-of-interest with FDR\u00a0< 0.001 in any patient to avoid eliminating patient-specific markers of the cell type-of-interest. The final blacklists for blood and airway myeloid and T\u00a0cells appear in Table S8.For both myeloid and T\u00a0cells, we took all of the cells in the dataset that we had annotated as each of these two cell types and used the drop-out score method described above to generate a list of putative, highly variable marker genes for each patient. Next, we generated a merged count matrix across all patients for a given cell type, which we normalized using the pooling method of Lun et\u00a0al. (2016) as described above. We then generated a log-normalized submatrix (log2(counts per million\u00a0+1)) containing the union of the marker gene sets identified for each patient after removing genes on the airway and blood blacklists for the cell type-of-interest. Using the PCA function in the Python package scikit-learn, we decomposed this submatrix into its principal components. We used the 10 principal components with the largest eigenvalues as input to the scRNA-seq batch correction algorithm Harmony (Korsunsky et\u00a0al., 2019). We made the function HarmonyMatrix aware of only the first 10 principal components and the patient identifiers for each cell. Finally, we computed a two-dimensional embedding using the Python implementation of the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm (McInnes et\u00a0al., 2018) and the Pearson correlation matrix of the Harmony-corrected principal components. These embeddings appear in Figure\u00a05.For the differential expression analysis between blood and airway myeloid cells and between blood and airway T\u00a0cells, we used the Mann-Whitney U-test approach described above. We removed genes on the blacklists described above for each cell type prior to subsampling, normalization, and statistical testing. We also restricted this analysis to protein-coding genes and removed all T\u00a0cell receptor and immunoglobulin variable regions. We performed differential expression separately on each pair of matched airway and blood samples (there are 12 patient time points for which we have matched samples). Stringent criteria were used to select the differentially expressed genes displayed in the heatmaps in Figure\u00a05. For the myeloid cell heatmap in Figure\u00a05, a gene had to be differentially expressed with a fold-change of at least 4 in either direction and FDR\u00a0< 0.001 in at least 9 of the 12 matched sample pairs. For the T\u00a0cell heatmap in Figure\u00a05, we applied the first two criteria, but required them in only 6 of the 12 matched sample pairs. Results for all of the pairwise differential expression analyses comparing airway and blood T and myeloid cells can be found in Tables S5 and S6, respectively.Analysis and visualization of cytokine data Non-log transformed cytokine expression data from both time points was averaged for airway and plasma from each patient and used for paired-site analysis. Cytokine expression data from early and late time points was log10 normalized and visualized as boxplots overlaid with individual data points. The log10 normalized data was averaged across both time points and used to generate heatmaps for cytokine expression across individual patient samples. Graphs were generated using the Python matplotlib and seaborn libraries (Hunter, 2007).Lung tissue imaging analysis Tissue segmentation was performed using inForm software on 10-30 representative fields (Version 2.3, PerkinElmer/Akoya Biosciences). Immune cell constituents within each tissue segment were defined by the DAPI nuclear counterstain to define the nucleus of each cell, with each associated membrane detected via presence of a specific stain (CD3, CD19, CD4, GzmB, MMP9 and/or CD163). Cell segmentation was adjusted as previously described to accurately locate all cells and minimize nuclear hypersegmentation and hyposegmentation (Weisberg et\u00a0al., 2019). Cells were then phenotyped by training the phenotyping algorithm of inForm software, identifying: monocytes and macrophages (CD163+ magenta cells), T\u00a0cells (CD4+ cyan cells and CD8+ orange cells), B cells (CD19+ yellow cells), neutrophils (MMP9+). The cell segmentation data summary provided densities and numbers of each cell type in the lung tissue segments and the full cell segmentation data file provided the X and Y coordinates of each phenotyped cell.Quantification and statistical analysisDifferences in means between two sample groups were compared using two-tailed t tests or two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests, except when testing specific directed hypotheses (one-tailed). Pearson correlations were used to correlate age and immune cell frequencies. Multiple group comparisons were done using ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD post-test. For comparing paired airway to blood values we used paired two tailed t tests. All statistical tests were run using custom scripts based on Python sciPy library (Virtanen et al., 2020) or R (version 3.5.3.). P-values below 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. For all figures \u2217\u2217\u2217 denotes p value\u00a0< 0.001, \u2217\u2217 denotes p value\u00a0< 0.01, and \u2217 denotes p value\u00a0< 0.05.
