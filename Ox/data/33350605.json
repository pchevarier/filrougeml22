COVID\u201019 led to a worldwide healthcare crisis with over 20 million confirmed cases and over 700\u00a0000 fatalities (as of 11 August 2020).\n1\n While SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 primarily involves the respiratory system, leading to severe pneumonia with consequent acute respiratory distress syndrome in up to 10% of all cases, the disease has also a considerable impact on the cardiovascular system according to latest studies.\n2\n Especially patients with pre\u2010existing cardiovascular conditions were shown to be at higher risk for a severe disease course and death.\n2\n Furthermore, COVID\u201019 was associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury. Myocardial injury (CI) has thus been reported in 20\u201328% of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients, more common in patients in intensive care units (ICU), and was associated with increased mortality.\n3\n, \n4\n First case reports have also reported COVID\u201019 associated myocarditis.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n In line with these observations, histological changes of cardiac tissue are suggestive of COVID\u201019\u2010specific cardiac involvement.\n6\n, \n8\n, \n9\n This theory is further supported by the high affinity of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to angiotensin converting enzyme 2,\n10\n as well as from previous observations in SARS disease, which was also associated to specific cardiac involvement.\n11\n Furthermore, COVID\u201019 seems to typically cause thrombotic events, which potentially further aggravate cardiovascular outcomes.\n12\n\nAnother important point concerning SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the heart is the deterioration and delay in medical treatment in areas severely affected by the pandemic, due to considerable shortages in ICU capacity, medical staff, and available tests.\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n Cardiac involvement, on the other hand, is also observed in patients suffering from pneumonias of other (non\u2010COVID\u201019) origin,\n16\n associated to disease severity and outcome in critically ill patients.\n17\n, \n18\n Also thrombotic events, which seem to be very common in COVID\u201019, are frequently observed in such ICU population.\n19\n It could be thus speculated, that in severe COVID\u201019 disease, CI and cardiovascular outcome are primarily driven by severity of pulmonary disease with consequent end\u2010organ ischemia and generation of toxic radicals, rather than disease\u2010specific cardiac involvement.This important pathophysiological issue is yet to be properly investigated. Comparison studies matching COVID\u201019 to severe pneumonias of other origin are still scarce. Therefore, in this multicentre study, in order to characterize CI in COVID\u201019, we examined cardiovascular outcomes in critically ill patients requiring ventilator therapy due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010induced pneumonia. To uncover COVID\u201019\u2010specific characteristics of CI, we matched our study population to a historical cohort requiring respiratory support due to severe pneumonia of non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin (non\u2010COVID\u201019). To avoid unspecific effects caused by collapsing healthcare provision, patients were only recruited in two European countries (Germany and Austria), where medical systems were not overstrained due to COVID\u201019 outbreak and enough ICU capacities were available. We hypothesized that compared with other pneumonias, COVID\u201019 would promote higher CI rates with specific characteristics.Key questionsWhat is already known about this subject? Myocardial injury is a common occurrence in critical COVID\u201019; hence, a disease\u2010specific involvement of the myocardium has been suggested. Yet myocardial injury also occurs in pneumonias of other origin, usually secondary to the severe pulmonary disease.What does this study add? In this multicentre study, myocardial injury and mortality were high but similar in patients requiring ventilatory support due to COVID\u201019 or pneumonias of other origin. While thrombotic events were more frequent, as they seem to be a typical feature of COVID\u201019, myocardial injury on the other hand, might be merely secondary to severe pulmonary disease and systemic inflammation.How might this impact on clinical practice? The herein presented clinical data shape our understanding on how COVID\u201019 affects the cardiovascular system. The findings should have an impact on developing treatment strategies and the effective allocation of resources aimed at reducing the high mortality of the pandemic. MethodsThe study was conducted in four European tertiary centres (see further) in accordance with standards of good clinical practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the respective local ethic committees.Study cohortsWe included all critically ill 76 COVID\u201019 patients, who required ventilator therapy between March and May 2020 [in Germany: University Hospital M\u00fcnster (n\u00a0=\u00a018) and Maria Hilf Hospital M\u00f6nchengladbach (n\u00a0=\u00a018); in Austria: University Hospital Salzburg (n\u00a0=\u00a028) and Kepler University Hospital Linz (n\u00a0=\u00a012)]. Critical COVID\u201019 disease was defined as the need for ventilator therapy, which was specified as either non\u2010invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Treatment of critical COVID\u201019 pneumonia was performed according to current recommendations.\n20\n Diagnosis of COVID\u201019 was established according to positive results of oropharyngeal or/and nasopharyngeal swabs test shown by real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction assay for COVID\u201019 (performed according to the manufacturer) and chest radiography and/or computer tomography of the thorax indicative for COVID\u201019\u2010related pneumonia according to current recommendations.\n21\n Treatment of all patients was concluded, meaning they were either discharged or had died at the time of data analysis.The control cohort was recruited from a consecutive, retrospective cohort of 1029 patients treated between 2016 and March 2020, requiring ventilator therapy (non\u2010invasive or invasive ventilation) due to respiratory failure induced by severe pneumonia of non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin according to current intensive care guidelines.\n22\n To account for potential comorbidities and severity of respiratory failure, 76 patients were matched to COVID\u201019 patients according to gender and age, as well as to the type of required ventilator therapy (non\u2010invasive or invasive ventilation). If more than one candidate in the retrospective non\u2010COVID\u201019 cohort fully fulfilled the matching criteria, the patient with the closest admission time point as compared with the time point of the beginning of the recruitment of the COVID\u201019 cohort (March 2020) was chosen for matching.Data collection and analysesA detailed description of data collection and analyses including applied definitions is provided in the supporting information. Briefly, in all eligible patients, patient data including demographics, medical history, laboratory examinations, comorbidities, complications, specific treatment measures, and outcomes were collected and analysed. To further characterize CI, available transthoracic echocardiography and radiographic images were investigated. CI was defined as high\u2010sensitive troponin (hs\u2010Tn) above the 99th\u2010percentile upper reference limit,\n3\n, \n4\n regardless of new abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography. To account for the usage of different hs\u2010Tn assays in the recruiting centres, levels of hs\u2010Tn are given as the relative value (%) of the troponin assay\u2010specific cut\u2010off value (14.0\u00a0ng/L for hs\u2010TnT and 51.4\u00a0ng/mL for hs\u2010TnI).Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was carried out blindly by our statistical analytic team using SPSS 20 software package. Descriptive statistics were obtained for all study variables. All categorical variables were compared for the study outcome by using the Fisher exact test. Ordinal data are presented as median (interquartile range) values, and variables were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Continuous variables were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. According to results, continuous variables were compared using the independent Student's t\u2010test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, as appropriate. Continuous data are expressed as mean and standard deviation or median (interquartile range) values. A P value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was regarded statistically significant. ResultsBaseline characteristics of the two cohorts are presented in Table\n\n1\n. According to matching criteria, there were no differences in relevant variables (gender, age, and respiratory therapy). The majority of non\u2010COVID\u201019 presented with a pneumonia of primarily bacterial origin (Table\n\n1\n). However, both cohorts did not present any differences in the prevalence of relevant pre\u2010existing pathologies (Table\n\n1\n), indicating a similar status of comorbidities in both groups.Table 1Baseline characteristics of investigated cohortsCOVID\u201019 (n\u00a0=\u00a076)Non\u2010COVID\u201019 (n\u00a0=\u00a076)Characteristic\nn\nMean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, Median (Q3\u2013Q1) or %\nn\nMean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, Median (Q3\u2013Q1) or %\nP valueGender (female)23/7630.3%23/7630.3%>0.999Age (years)7666.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.47665.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.40.480BMI (kg/m2)7627.5 (6.0)7226.0 (7.8)0.159Aetiology of pneumoniaBacterial0/760%51/7667.1%Viral76/76100%22/7628.9%Toxic0/760%3/763.9%Bacterial superinfection if viral or toxic28/7636.8%19/7625.0%Required respiratory therapyNon\u2010invasive ventilationa\n13/7617.1%13/7617.1%>0.999Invasive ventilation63/7682.9%63/7682.9%>0.999Medical historyArterial hypertension43/7656.6%41/7653.9%0.870Coronary artery disease10/7613.2%14/7618.4%0.505Peripheral vascular disease4/765.3%4/765.3%>0.999Diabetes mellitus20/7626.3%17/7622.4%0.706Current smoking13/7617.1%22/7628.9%0.123Heart failure7/769.2%14/7618.4%0.157Valvular heart disease3/763.9%5/766.6%0.719Atrial fibrillation9/7611.8%16/7621.1%0.189Pulmonary arterial hypertension4/765.3%2/762.6%0.681Obstructive lung disease11/7614.5%17/7621.1%0.295Restrictive lung disease3/763.9%7/769.2%0.327Malignancy11/7614.5%17/7622.4%0.295Open in a separate windowBMI, body mass index; ICU, intensive care unit; SD, standard deviation.Baseline characteristics of the investigated cohorts.a\nThe term non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV) refers to mechanical ventilation involving end\u2010expiratory and inspiratory positive air pressure support via a tightly fitted face mask or helmet, as opposed to invasive ventilation necessitating endotracheal intubation. All patients included in the study had some form of mechanical ventilation (patients who merely needed oxygen insufflation were not included).*\nP\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Inspired by previous reports indicating a high burden of CI in COVID\u201019,\n3\n, \n4\n we evaluated cardiac markers, echocardiography, and radiology images in both populations. Indeed, CI as indicated by elevated hs\u2010Tn levels was a frequent finding in both COVID\u201019 and non\u2010COVID\u201019 (Figure\n\n1\nA and Table\n\n\n2\n). Surprisingly, despite the described previous reports in COVID\u201019, non\u2010COVID\u201019 presented higher levels of cardiac biomarkers [hs\u2010Tn, creatine kinase myoglobin fraction, and N\u2010terminal pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide; Figure\n\n1\nB\u2013D and Table\n\n\n2\n] suggesting a higher burden of CI in non\u2010COVID\u201019. Simultaneously, a higher frequency of CI in laboratory results and pulmonary congestion on radiography imaging in non\u2010COVID\u201019 was observed (Figure\n\n1\nA and Table\n\n\n2\n). Therefore, we speculated that a high burden of CI is generally observed in critical pneumonic disease of various non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin and not specifically a COVID\u201019\u2010dependent finding. In order to further evaluate our hypothesis, we investigated echocardiography and cardiac radiographic images. They revealed a high frequency of novel functional cardiac impairment, which however was similar in both groups (Figure\n\n1\nF\u2013H and Table\n\n\n2\n). We then evaluated if CI might rather depend on the severity of disease progression with consequent end\u2010organ ischemia. Therefore, we investigated lactate and pH levels. Indeed, as indicated by lower pH and higher lactate values, they revealed a more severe course in non\u2010COVID\u201019 (Table\n\n3\n). While this observation probably could explain a higher incidence of CI in this population, general outcomes and required ICU therapies like usage of catecholamine, extracorporal membrane oxygenation therapy, and rate/reasons of/for cardiopulmonary resuscitation were not significantly different in both groups (Table\n\n4\n). Importantly, mortality was high in both groups and tended to be even higher in non\u2010COVID\u201019 but not significantly different (Figure\n\n1\nE and Table\n\n\n4\n), thus reflecting a poor outcome in both COVID\u201019 and non\u2010COVID\u201019\u2010related pneumonia. To further evaluate potential associations with inflammatory processes, further laboratory parameters were studied. However, besides increased procalcitonin (PCT) and leucocytes (Table\n\n3\n), which could be driven by the high proportion of bacterial pneumonia in non\u2010COVID\u201019 (Table\n\n1\n), we did not observe any differences in other relevant inflammatory markers including C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), and fibrinogen (Table\n\n3\n). While these biomarkers were strongly elevated, they indicated pronounced inflammatory processes in both COVID\u201019 and non\u2010COVID\u201019. Interestingly, despite a similar inflammatory activity (or even potentially higher inflammatory activity as indicated by leucocytes and PCT levels in non\u2010COVID\u201019) in both populations, COVID\u201019 revealed an increased d\u2010dimer levels (Figure\n\n2\nA and Table\n\n\n3\n) suggesting a potentially higher thrombogenicity in this population. Consequently, with respect to our results as well recent literature dealing with COVID\u201019 disease,\n12\n we investigated the incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events in both populations. Indeed, the incidence of these events was significantly higher in COVID\u201019 (Figure\n\n2\nB\u2013F and Table\n\n\n4\n). Of note, this observation was primarily influenced by the high rate of pulmonary embolism in this population (Figure\n\n1\nD and Table\n\n\n4\n). Therefore, our results indicate that independently of severity of pneumonic disease as well as inflammatory activity, COVID\u201019 specifically provokes thrombogenicity, which potentially might drive cardiovascular outcome in the COVID\u201019 population.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Myocardial injury and outcome in COVID\u201019 vs. non\u2010COVID\u201019: (A) Incidence of myocardial injury (for the definition, see supporting information) was high in both groups. However, higher rates were revealed in non\u2010COVID\u201019. (B\u2013D) Levels of relevant cardiac biomarkers: (B) high\u2010sensitive (hs) troponin, (C) CK\u2010MB, and (D) NT\u2010proBNP were increased in non\u2010COVID\u201019.

DiscussionSevere COVID\u201019 disease is generally characterized by pneumonia with acute lung injury, yet a high incidence of CI has also been reported,\n3\n, \n4\n as well as cases with disease\u2010specific myocardial alterations.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n On the other hand, CI in the absence of acute coronary syndrome has been well described in pneumonia of non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin,\n16\n and is common in patients requiring ICU treatment.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n23\n In order to assess potential implications on the cardiovascular system, we retrospectively compared critically ill COVID\u201019 patients with other similarly ill patients with pneumonia of other origin. Compared with other countries at initial outbreaks,\n13\n, \n14\n our fatality rate of 38.2% in mechanical\u2010ventilated COVID\u201019 patients was low (Figure\n\n1\nE and Table\n\n\n4\n), indicating adequate ICU support in less strained medical systems in Germany and Austria. Interestingly, such ICU mortality was not different in matched non\u2010COVID\u201019 patients (Figure\n\n1\nE and Table\n\n\n4\n). Our finding reassures the importance of available ICU capacities during the pandemic, as it seems that, given adequate ventilatory capacity, the mortality outcome of the severe cases of COVID\u201019 is similar to that of non\u2010COVID\u201019 pneumonias.Our cohort presented a much higher rate of CI (78.1%; Figure\n\n1\nA and Table\n\n\n4\n) than previous studies (20\u201328%), but those studies included both ICU and non\u2010ICU populations.\n3\n, \n4\n While we also included in\u2010hospital follow\u2010up investigations of cardiac biomarkers, our results might indicate a higher burden of CI in critical COVID\u201019 patients than previously assumed. Surprisingly though, CI was even more frequent in non\u2010COVID\u201019 (Figure\n\n1\nA\u2013D and Table\n\n\n4\n). Notably, our incidence rates in non\u2010COVID\u201019 are in line with other reports investigating myocardial damage in critical pneumonias (55\u201381% in the first 24\u201348\u00a0h and 85% during a follow\u2010up of 7\u00a0days).\n17\n, \n18\n, \n23\n\nSeveral case series reported reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction in COVID\u201019 patients.\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n24\n Consistently, we saw high rates of newly onset reduction of LV ejection fraction (20.8%; Table\n\n2\n and Figure\n\n1\nF\u2013H\n), with a consequent similar rate of cardiomegaly during follow\u2010up radiography (Table\n\n2\n) in our cohort. However, consistent with previous reports indicating up to 30% incidence of transient cardiac functional impairment in pneumonias of non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin,\n16\n functional impairment was not more severe in our COVID\u201019 patients (Figure\n\n1\nF\u2013H and Table\n\n\n2\n). Our results suggest that in critical COVID\u201019 pneumonia, myocardial impairment is a frequent observation in COVID\u201019, but similar to other pneumonias (at least in terms of CI and systolic LV impairment). But although histologically confirmed cardiomyocyte injury has been described in non\u2010COVID\u201019 pneumonias,\n25\n systolic LV impairment is usually a transient observation.\n16\n Whether a similar outcome is also true for COVID\u201019 remains unclear.A further aspect that reflects the severity of critical pneumonic disease is inflammation. Increased inflammatory burden was reported to drive CI in pneumonia of non\u2010COVID\u201019 origin. Among others, in critically ill patients, specific inflammatory markers IL6 and PCT were linked to higher troponin levels.\n17\n, \n26\n In COVID\u201019, an inflammatory cytokine storm with consequent acute respiratory distress syndrome is presumed to be the main drive of morbidity and fatality.\n2\n Similar to non\u2010COVID\u201019, a high inflammatory activity indicated by CRP and PCT levels has been linked to CI.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n In our study, inflammatory activity was high in both COVID\u201019 and non\u2010COVID\u201019, indicating the critical stage of disease in both populations. IL6 and CRP levels were not different between groups, but PCT and leucocytes were increased in non\u2010COVID\u201019, possibly explained by the majority of bacterial infections in non\u2010COVID\u201019 pneumonias (Table\n\n1\n). Nevertheless, our data indicate a high inflammatory activity in both groups (Table\n\n3\n), which probably drives CI. It can be speculated that in COVID\u201019 (like in other pneumonias), CI and systolic impairment in severe disease is driven by pronounced inflammatory burden and reduced myocardial supply with consequent functional impairment of cardiac function. The likely speculation that the high inflammatory burden and reduced myocardial supply are responsible for CI and LV systolic impairment in severe COVID\u201019 pneumonia is supported by a recent report of post\u2010mortem examination, which revealed cardiac inflammatory processes not meeting the criteria of true myocarditis in COVID\u201019.\n27\n\nDespite the similar inflammatory activity, we saw a higher thrombogenicity in COVID\u201019 (Figure\n\n1\nA and Tables\n\n\n3\n, \n4\n). The observation in terms of thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism, is in line with reports from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which reported similar high rates (31% and 27%, respectively).\n28\n, \n29\n Although all our patients received anticoagulation at least at prophylactic dosages and there was no difference in rates of therapeutic anticoagulation between cohorts (Figure\n\nS1\n), thromboembolic events were much higher in COVID\u201019. Our results are further supported by autopsy studies that found deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in most deceased COVID\u201019 patients.\n30\n Indeed, the common occurrence of pulmonary embolism and other thromboembolic events seems one of the major challenges of present COVID\u201019 therapy and research and could have potential impact on cardiovascular outcomes. The potential benefit of an effective anticoagulant therapy in COVD 19 needs to be further evaluated.LimitationsThe observational design presents the main study limitation, while the control cohort was not prospectively randomized. Assessment of CI was based on cardiac enzymes and echocardiography, not including more precise imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and/or myocardial biopsy. Our efforts to contain the hospital spread of the virus (from these ventilated, highly contagious patients) resulted in a restrictive approach to imaging and interventional procedures. Cardiac inflammatory burden and the question of COVID\u201019\u2010associated myocarditis are thus not sufficiently covered. Advanced imaging and coronary/haemodynamic workups would have provided useful information on the ischaemic and inflammatory nature of CI. Not all patients had echocardiography (about 21%), and in some patients, cardiac enzymes were not measured (Table\n\n2\n). Missing follow\u2010up analysis could also have revealed whether CI was reversible in survivors. Regarding the comparison group, PCR of infectious viruses and bacterial work\u2010up was not able to identify the infectious agents in all control patients. Therefore, while interpreting our results, we are not able to account for specific cardiac involvements, which are associated with some viral and bacterial agents. Additionally, the heterogeneity of our comparison group, which consists of patients suffering from bacterial, viral and/or toxic pneumonia might in part differ with regards to the pathogenetic mechanisms compared with COVID\u201019 pneumonia (\nTable S2\n). On the other hand, the high rates of superinfection in both groups might partly attenuate these differences. Nevertheless, the heterogenic aetiology of pneumonia in our control population remains one the main study limitations. The passionate use of untested treatments in a number of COVID\u201019 patients (such as tocilizumab or hydroxychloroquine, Table\n\nS1\n) might have affected the results. Finally, instead of screening, diagnostic workups for thromboembolic events were only performed when clinically suspected and are therefore most probably underestimated.In conclusion, we report a very high rate of CI in critical COVID\u201019 disease, which in this study was even higher in severe pneumonias of other origin. While ICU mortality was similar, COVID\u201019 differed significantly in terms of a high occurrence of thromboembolic events. Whether CI, including viral myocarditis, is a specific feature of the COVID\u201019 disease is put in doubt by our findings and requires further investigation. Prevention and management of thrombotic complications, including pulmonary embolism, should be one of the main targets of the therapy of critically ill COVID\u201019 patients.
