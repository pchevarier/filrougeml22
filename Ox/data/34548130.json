Improving outcomes depends on not only evidence-based care once ARDS has already developed but also preventing ARDS incidence. Several environmental exposures have now been shown to increase the risk of ARDS and related adverse outcomes. How environmental factors impact the risk of developing ARDS is a growing and important field of research that should inform the care of individual patients as well as public health policy.", "author": [{"author": "Katherine D Wick", "affiliation": ["Department of Anesthesia, University of California, San Francisco, 513 Parnassus Avenue, HSE 760, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA; Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Wick+KD&cauthor_id=34548130"}, {"author": "Michael A Matthay", "affiliation": ["Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Avenue, M-917, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA; Department of Anesthesia, University of California, San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Avenue, M-917, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.
