CTD phosphorylation is thought to mark a critical\nmechanistic transition, during which RNA polymerase clears the promoter\nand shifts into an elongation mode in which the polymerase\nis resistant to pausing (Payne et al. 1989; Weeks et al.\n1993; O'Brien et al. 1994; Akhtar et al. 1996). The CTD also\nintegrates transcription and processing of the nascent mRNA, by\nrecruiting mRNA capping, splicing, cleavage, and polyadenylation\ncomplexes directly to the transcribing polymerase (Hirose and Manley\n2000; Fong and Bentley 2001). As transcription progresses the CTD is\ndephosphorylated, so that Pol II is eventually able to repeat the\ntranscription cycle (Dahmus 1996; Komarnitsky et al. 2000; Schroeder et\nal. 2000; Cho et al. 2001).During the transcription cycle, the CTD repeat is phosphorylated on\nboth Ser 2 and Ser 5. Initially, Ser 5 is phosphorylated by the\ncyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) component of the general factor TFIIH:\nKin28 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or CDK-7 (metazoans)\n(Hengartner et al. 1998; Komarnitsky et al. 2000). Ser 5\nphosphorylation predominates near the promoter, and allows the CTD to\nrecruit activities which place the 5\u2032 cap on the pre-mRNA (Komarnitsky\net al. 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2000; Schroeder et al. 2000). Less is\nunderstood about the role of CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation, which may\ngenerally predominate on elongating Pol II (Komarnitsky et al. 2000).\nIn metazoan embryos, CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation levels correlate closely\nwith transcription activity (Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Tenenhaus et al.\n1998; Palancade et al. 2001; Walker et al. 2001). In S.\ncerevisiae however, this CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation is mediated\nprimarily by the CDK Ctk1, which promotes elongation and is required\nfor some cellular processes, but not for viability (Sterner et al.\n1995; Lee and Greenleaf 1997; Patturajan et al. 1999; Cho et al. 2001).The metazoan kinase CDK-9 and its cyclin partners (T1, T2 or K) form\nthe transcription factor P-TEFb, which prevents transcription from\nstalling in vitro (Marshall and Price 1995; Price 2000). CDK-9 is\nsimilar to and may be functionally related to yeast Ctk1. Stimulation\nof elongation by P-TEFb is required for human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) transcription, during which P-TEFb is recruited directly to the\nnascent mRNA by the transactivator Tat (Mancebo et al. 1997; Yang et\nal. 1997; Zhu et al. 1997; Wei et al. 1998; Price 2000). P-TEFb\npreferentially phosphorylates CTD Ser 2 in vitro, but in association\nwith Tat P-TEFb also phosphorylates Ser 5, and may thereby bypass the\nrequirement for CDK-7 (Chen and Zhou 1999; Zhou et al. 2000). P-TEFb is\nrecruited by cellular activators that include NF-\u03baB and c-Myc\n(Kanazawa et al. 2000; Barboric et al. 2001; Eberhardy and Farnham\n2001; Lee et al. 2001), and it is present at sites of active\ntranscription in Drosophila (Lis et al. 2000). Treatment of\nmammalian cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of CDK-9 appears to\nblock most Pol II transcription (Chao and Price 2001), but P-TEFb\nfunctions have not been investigated in a genetic system. It is an\nimportant issue for HIV therapeutics to understand how broadly P-TEFb\nis required for transcription of cellular genes, because CDK-9\ninhibition is a preeminent strategy for interfering with Tat (Mancebo\net al. 1997; Flores et al. 1999; Chao et al. 2000).Transcription proceeds independently of P-TEFb in vitro in the absence\nof the factor DSIF, which cooperates with the negative factor NELF to\ninhibit elongation (Wada et al. 1998a,b; Yamaguchi et al. 1999, 2002;\nRenner et al. 2001). While this argues that P-TEFb is required simply\nto overcome DSIF/NELF-dependent pausing, DSIF increases elongation in\nvitro under conditions that enhance pausing, suggesting that it has a\ndual function (Wada et al. 1998a). The bulk of in vivo evidence also\nsuggests that DSIF facilitates elongation, possibly in concert with\nP-TEFb. DSIF consists of the proteins SPT-4 and SPT-5 (Wada et al.\n1998a), which yeast and zebrafish genetic experiments indicate are\npositive elongation factors (Hartzog et al. 1998; Kaplan et al. 2000;\nLindstrom and Hartzog 2001; Keegan et al. 2002). SPT-5 is related to\nEscherichia coli NusG, an antiterminator that increases\nelongation (Wada et al. 1998a). Accordingly, SPT-5 is associated with\nelongating RNA Pol II in vivo (Andrulis et al. 2000; Kaplan et al.\n2000) and is required for HIV Tat to stimulate elongation (Wu-Baer et\nal. 1998; Kim et al. 1999; Parada and Roeder 1999; Ivanov et al. 2000;\nBourgeois et al. 2002). To understand how P-TEFb promotes transcription\nelongation, it is critical to determine whether an inhibitory effect of\nSPT-4/SPT-5 can be identified in vivo, and to elucidate how P-TEFb\ninteracts functionally with SPT-4/SPT-5 in vivo.We have performed the first genetics-based study of P-TEFb functions,\nin the C. elegans embryo. Using RNA interference (RNAi), we\ninvestigated the requirements for P-TEFb for CTD Ser 2 and Ser 5\nphosphorylation, and for early embryonic transcription. We also tested\nwhether depletion of SPT-4/SPT-5 relieves any requirements for P-TEFb.\nOur results indicate that P-TEFb is required for phosphorylation of CTD\nSer 2 but not for most Ser 5 phosphorylation. In apparent contrast to\nyeast Ctk1, P-TEFb is also broadly essential for transcription in the\nearly embryo. Simultaneous inhibition of spt-4 and\nspt-5 restored heat shock gene transcription in\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos, suggesting that P-TEFb counteracts an\ninhibitory function of SPT-4/SPT-5 in vivo. Significantly, other genes\nstill required P-TEFb when spt-4 and spt-5 were\ninhibited, suggesting that they and heat shock genes maintain\ntranscription elongation through different P-TEFb-dependent pathways. ResultsCDK-9 and cyclin T required for early embryonic\u2009developmentWell conserved unambiguous orthologs of each P-TEFb and DSIF\ncomponent gene are present in the C. elegans genome.\ncdk-9 encodes a predicted kinase that is highly related to\nhuman CDK-9 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A),1A), and includes the\nsignature PITALRE motif (Grana et al. 1994; Price 2000). Two closely\nrelated C. elegans cyclin T genes, cit-1.1 and\ncit-1.2 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1B),1B), encode predicted proteins that are each\nslightly more similar to human cyclin T1 than T2, but neither contains\nthe motif through which HIV Tat binds human cyclin T1 (Price 2000). The\nrespective human and C. elegans cyclin T gene pairs each\nappear to have arisen independently from an ancestral gene (Fig. \u200b(Fig.11B).\nC. elegans also encodes a single conserved ortholog each of\nspt-4 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C)1C) and spt-5 (Hartzog et al. 1998; Wada\net al. 1998a; Guo et al. 2000). Each of these C. elegans genes\nre-identifies its human or yeast counterparts as its closest relative\nin GenBank databases.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 1Predicted C. elegans (ce) CDK-9, cyclin T,\nand SPT-4 proteins.

A phylogenic tree based on\nsequence comparison is shown at the bottom of the panel.\n(C) ceSPT-4 and ySPT-4 are compared with hSPT-4 as in\n(A).The early C. elegans embryo provides an advantageous system\nfor studying transcription in vivo. C. elegans embryonic\ndevelopment is initiated by maternally derived proteins and mRNAs, and\nthen new mRNA transcription begins around the four-cell stage (Seydoux\nand Dunn 1997; Newman-Smith and Rothman 1998). Because RNAi inhibits\nboth maternal and zygotic expression of early embryonic genes (Fire et\nal. 1998), it is possible to deplete expression of a transcription\nfactor of interest starting at the beginning of embryogenesis. When\nembryonic mRNA transcription is inhibited, maternal gene products\nmaintain viability until approximately the 100-cell stage, making it\nfeasible to manipulate expression of even essential transcription\nfactors in these living cells (Powell-Coffman et al. 1996; Dantonel et\nal. 2000; Kaltenbach et al. 2000; Walker et al. 2001). To determine\nwhether the CDK-9 protein is present in the early embryo, we examined\nits expression by antibody staining. Using conditions optimized for\nearly embryos, CDK-9 was readily apparent in interphase nuclei from the\ntwo-cell stage until morphogenesis (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.2A;2A; data not shown). CDK-9 was also\ndetectable in adult germline and oocyte nuclei (data not shown),\nsuggesting that it is maternally expressed.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 2Phenotypic analysis of RNAi embryos. (A)\nExpression of CDK-9 and RNA Pol II. Representative wild-type and RNAi\nembryos (indicated in rows) were stained with DAPI to visualize DNA, or\nwith the indicated antibodies. The CDK-9 protein was not detected in\nany cdk-9(RNAi) or cdk-9; spt-4;\nspt-5(RNAi) embryos. The Pol II large subunit AMA-1 was\ndetected with an antibody against the unphosphorylated CTD (8WG16).\n(B) Terminal and early cell division phenotypes of RNAi\nembryos. Embryos produced by N2 (wild-type) or pie-1\u2237gfp\nmothers were examined by differential interference (DIC) or\nfluorescence (FL) microscopy. Typical wild-type or RNAi embryos are\nshown in rows, as indicated to the left. In the leftcolumn, terminally arrested RNAi embryos are compared with a\nwild-type embryo that is continuing to develop. The right two\ncolumns show four-cell WT and RNAi pie-1\u2237gfp embryos. These\nRNAi embryos were indistinguishable from wild-type with respect to each\naspect of PIE-1\u2237GFP germline and subcellular localization, including\nthe presence of PIE-1 in germline RNA-protein P granules. Anterior is\nto the left.We used RNAi to inhibit CDK-9 and cyclin T expression in the early\nembryo. In cdk-9(RNAi) embryos, the cdk-9 mRNA was\nsubstantially depleted (described below) and CDK-9 antibody staining\nwas eliminated (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2A),2A), suggesting a severe reduction in CDK-9\nexpression. As a benchmark for a general transcription defect, we\ninhibited expression of the Pol II large subunit gene ama-1\n(Powell-Coffman et al. 1996; Walker et al. 2001). To assess\naccumulation of maternal mRNA, we monitored early cell division\npatterns and performed parallel experiments in a transgenic strain that\nexpresses a fusion of the maternally derived germline protein PIE-1 to\ngreen fluorescent protein (GFP). PIE-1\u2237GFP recapitulates the\nendogenous PIE-1 localization pattern, which depends upon at least 20\nmaternal genes (Tenenhaus et al. 1998; Reese et al. 2000). Like\nama-1(RNAi) embryos, cdk-9(RNAi) embryos arrested\ndevelopment at \u223c100 cells and lacked signs of differentiation, but\ntheir maternal PIE-1\u2237GFP expression and localization patterns\nappeared normal at every stage (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B;2B; data not shown). Early cell\ndivision timing and cleavage planes were also generally normal in\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos, except for the cell cycle period of the\ntwo E cell daughters (E2 cells), which give rise to the endoderm. When\nmRNA transcription is broadly inhibited, the E2 cell cycle length is\nshortened from 45 min to \u223c22 min, resulting in a failure of\ngastrulation (Powell-Coffman et al. 1996; Walker et al. 2001). The E2\ncells similarly divided after 22 min in cdk-9(RNAi) embryos\n(data not shown). Lack of CDK-9 in the embryo thus does not detectably\naffect maternal mRNA stores, but may significantly impair new mRNA\ntranscription.Inhibition of cit-1.1 and cit-1.2 individually by\nRNAi did not impair development to adulthood or fertility (data not\nshown). In contrast, simultaneous RNAi inhibition of both cyclin T\ngenes resulted in an early undifferentiated embryonic arrest similarly\nto inhibition of cdk-9 or ama-1 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B).2B). This\nsuggests that the two C. elegans cyclin T genes function\nredundantly in the early embryo, and is consistent with broad\ninvolvement of P-TEFb in embryonic transcription.Dependence of CTD serine 2 phosphorylation on\u2009P-TEFbThe patterns and intensity of Pol II CTD phosphorylation appear to\nparallel overall transcription activity in the C. elegans\nembryo (Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Tenenhaus et al. 1998; Walker et al.\n2001). We assayed CTD Ser 5 phosphorylation in wild-type and RNAi\nembryos by staining with the P-CTD antiserum (Schroeder et al. 2000),\nwhich recognizes a pattern indistinguishable from that obtained with\nthe phospho-Ser 5 antibody H14 (Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Walker et al.\n2001). We detected phospho-Ser 2 with the H5 antibody (Bregman et al.\n1995; Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Patturajan et al. 1998; Cho et al. 2001).\nFor clarity, we refer to P-CTD and H5 as \u03b1-PSer5 and \u03b1-PSer2,\nrespectively. Phosphorylation of CTD serines 5 and 2 is first detected\nin embryonic nuclei at the three-to-four-cell stage, concurrently with\nthe onset of transcription in somatic cells (Seydoux and Dunn 1997).\n\u03b1-PSer5 staining then appears in a generalized punctate nucleoplasmic\npattern in somatic cells (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A),3A), and as\ntwo discrete nuclear foci in the transcriptionally silent germline\nprecursor (data not shown; Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Walker et al. 2001).\nNuclear \u03b1-PSer2 staining is uniformly robust in wild-type somatic\ncells, but is undetectable in the early germline (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3B;3B; data not\nshown; Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Walker et al. 2001).\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 3CDK-9 and cyclin T are required for\nphosphorylation of Ser 2 of the Pol II CTD repeat, but not for most Ser\n5 phosphorylation. In A and B, representative\nwild-type or RNAi embryos that are actively undergoing cell division\nare shown in rows, as indicated. Embryos were stained with DAPI to\nvisualize DNA (column 1), and with \u03b1-P-Ser5 (A) or\n\u03b1-P-Ser2 (B) antibodies (Ab; column 2).\n(A) CTD Ser5 phosphorylation levels are not detectably reduced\nwhen CDK-9 is depleted by RNAi. \u03b1-P-Ser5 staining was comparable to\nwild-type at each stage in 100% of cdk-9(RNAi) embryos, but\nwas dramatically reduced when transcription initiation was inhibited by\ndepletion of the essential factor TFIIB [ttb-1(RNAi)\nembryos]. (B) CTD Ser2 phosphorylation is not detectable in\nembryos lacking P-TEFb. Throughout their development until terminal\narrest, in 100% of cdk-9(RNAi), cit-1.1;\ncit-1.2(RNAi), and cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos,\n\u03b1-P-Ser2 staining in interphase nuclei was not detectable above the\nbackground seen in ama-1(RNAi) embryos. Within each embryo\nset, in mitotic cells \u03b1-P-Ser2 also detected a\ncross-reactive epitope that does not derive from Pol II (see text).\nExamples of nuclei in early and late stages of mitotic chromosome\ncondensation are indicated by an asterisk and arrowheads, respectively.\nNo nuclear \u03b1-P-Ser2 staining is detectable in the wild-type germline\nprecursor, which is not visible in the focal plane shown. Some\n\u03b1-P-Ser2-stained germline cells have weak perinuclear staining\nderiving from cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody with P\ngranules (Walker et al. 2001). A white dot denotes a germline cell\nwithin the focal plane.Depletion of the CDK-9 kinase resulted in dramatically different\neffects on the levels of embryonic CTD Ser 2 and CTD Ser 5\nphosphorylation. When the Pol II large subunit AMA-1 is depleted by\nRNAi, embryonic staining with multiple Pol II antisera is reduced to\nbackground (Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Walker et al. 2001), as is \u03b1-PSer5\nstaining (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A).3A). As reported previously (Seydoux and Dunn 1997), in\nama-1(RNAi) embryos a cross-reactive mitotic epitope is\ndetected where chromosome condensation is apparent, but specific\n\u03b1-PSer2 staining in interphase nuclei is abolished (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3B).3B). When\ngenes involved in transcription initiation are inhibited by RNAi,\n\u03b1-PSer5 and \u03b1-PSer2 staining levels are generally decreased in\nparallel (Walker et al. 2001). For example, \u03b1-PSer5 and \u03b1-PSer2\nstaining is reduced to background when the essential initiation factor\nTFIIB (ttb-1) is depleted (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A;3A; Walker et al. 2001). In\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos, AMA-1 (Pol II) protein levels appeared\nnormal (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2A),2A), but the \u03b1-PSer2 signal was reduced to background in\nall interphase cells at all stages, as in ama-1(RNAi) embryos\n(Fig. \u200b(Fig.3B).3B). Specific \u03b1-PSer2 staining was also eliminated in\ncit-1.1; cit-1.2(RNAi) embryos, but was normal when\ncit-1.1 and cit-1.2 were inhibited individually (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.3B;3B; data not shown). In striking contrast, in cdk-9(RNAi)\nembryos, \u03b1-PSer5 staining was not distinguishably different from\nwild-type (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A).3A). We conclude that P-TEFb is required for\nphosphorylation of CTD Ser 2, but not for the bulk of embryonic CTD Ser\n5 phosphorylation.P-TEFb is required broadly for gene\u2009expressionTo investigate the importance of P-TEFb for transcription of\nindividual genes, we performed RNAi experiments in C. elegans\nstrains that carry reporter transgenes in which regulatory regions are\nintact, and coding regions are fused to GFP. These reporters are\nexpressed in the early embryo in parallel to the corresponding\nendogenous genes. We first examined expression of med-1, which\nspecifies mesendodermal lineages, and pes-10; each\nof these genes is expressed as transcription initiates (Seydoux and\nFire 1994; Maduro et al. 2001). In cdk-9(RNAi) embryos,\nPES-10\u2237GFP and MED-1\u2237GFP expression was reduced to very low levels\nthat were characteristic of ama-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.4).4). cdk-9 was similarly required\nfor induction of the heat shock gene hsp-16.2 (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.5A),5A), a finding which is notable because\nS. cerevisiae heat shock gene transcription does not require\nctk1 (Patturajan et al. 1999). cdk-9 was also\nrequired for expression of let-858 and rps-5, which\nare common to yeast and metazoans, and was essential at multiple genes\nwhich are specific to metazoans (Table \u200b(Table1).\nThe1).\nThe latter group includes the broadly expressed genes cki-2\nand sur-5 (Gu et al. 1998; Hong et al. 1998), and the\ndevelopmental specification genes end-1 (Zhu et al. 1998),\npha-4 (Horner et al. 1998; Kalb et al. 1998), and\nelt-5 (Koh and Rothman 2001).

Like cdk-9(RNAi)\nembryos, spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos failed to gastrulate (data\nnot shown). They arrested development with >300 cells and showed many\nsigns of differentiation, including presence of birefringent granules\n(gut), twitching (muscle), and some morphogenesis (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B;2B; data not\nshown), suggesting that transcription was not completely blocked.\nAccordingly, in spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos, \u03b1-PSer2 staining\nlevels were approximately normal (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B).5B). spt-5(RNAi)\nembryos had very similar phenotypes, but most spt-4(RNAi)\nembryos survived to hatching (data not shown). The developmental arrest\nphenotypes of spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos were highly\nconsistent, and accompanied by depletion of the target mRNAs as\ndetected by RT-PCR (data not shown), suggesting that spt-4 and\nspt-5 expression was significantly reduced in these RNAi\nembryos.P-TEFb is required in vitro to overcome transcription pausing that\ndepends upon SPT-4/SPT-5 (Wada et al. 1998b; Renner et al. 2001). If\nthe importance of P-TEFb in vivo derives largely from this effect, it\nwould be predicted that a reduction in spt-4 and\nspt-5 expression would relieve requirements for P-TEFb during\nearly embryonic transcription. To test this model, we inhibited\nspt-4 and spt-5 along with cdk-9 by RNAi,\nusing procedures in which individual and total input RNA concentrations\nwere carefully controlled (Materials and Methods). PES-10\u2237GFP and\nMED-1\u2237GFP were expressed robustly in spt-4; spt-5(RNA)\nembryos, but were inhibited in all cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi)\nembryos (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4).4). In addition, cdk-9; spt-4;\nspt-5(RNAi) embryos were indistinguishable from\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos not only in their overall levels of CTD\nSer 2 and Ser 5 phosphorylation, but also in their appearance upon\nterminal arrest (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3),3), suggesting that they were subject to a severe\ntranscription block. Together, these findings suggest that depletion of\nSPT-4 and SPT-5 did not bypass requirements for cdk-9 at many\nembryonic genes.Significantly, however, our analysis of heat shock gene transcription\nuncovered an inhibitory effect of SPT-4/SPT-5 in cdk-9(RNAi)\nembryos. In spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos, the HSP-16.2\u2237GFP\nreporter was induced to wild-type levels by heat shock (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A).\nAlthough5A).\nAlthough HSP-16.2\u2237GFP was not induced above background in\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos, in response to heat shock it was\nexpressed robustly in 50%\u201370% of cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi)\nembryos (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A;5A; data not shown). HSP-16.2\u2237GFP induction was also\nrestored in \u223c50% of cdk-9; spt-5(RNAi) embryos, but to\nmoderately lower levels (data not shown). The cdk-9 mRNA and\nCDK-9 protein were comparably depleted in cdk-9(RNAi) and\ncdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos (Figs. \u200b(Figs.22A,\n\u200bA,6A,6A, lanes 2,4,6; Materials and Methods),\nindicating that this restoration of HSP-16.2\u2237GFP expression did not\narise from a failure of cdk-9 RNAi. In contrast, in\nheat-shocked cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos, MED-1\u2237GFP\nwas not expressed above the low levels apparent in ama-1(RNAi)\nembryos, and CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation was undetectable (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5C,D).\nThese5C,D).\nThese last findings suggest that the HSP-16.2\u2237GFP expression observed\nin cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos did not arise from the\nheat shock response stimulating an alternative pathway of CTD Ser 2\nphosphorylation, or a more general recovery of transcription.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 6Restoration of endogenous hsp-70\ntranscription in cdk-9(RNAi) embryos by depletion of\nSPT-4/SPT-5. (A) Specific depletion of cdk-9 mRNA in\nRNAi embryos. Total RNA from the indicated embryo sets was assayed by\nRT-PCR to detect expression of cdk-9 (lanes\n2,4,6), and a control mRNA (rgr-1;\nlanes 3,5,7). Each PCR primer set spanned an\nintron (data not shown). Products were analyzed on an agarose gel\nstained with ethidium bromide. DNA size markers are designated as M.\n(B) The hsp-70 gene, with exons indicated by a thick\nline. Primers used for RT-PCR (gray bars) flank intron 2. Sizes of\npredicted spliced and unspliced products are shown. (C)\nEndogenous hsp-70 expression. The samples analyzed in\nB were assayed by RT-PCR for hsp-70 RNA, using the\nprimers shown in A. The hsp-70 mRNA (315-bp fragment)\nwas present at markedly reduced levels in cdk-9(RNAi) embryos,\nbut was significantly restored in cdk-9; spt-4;\nspt-5(RNAi) embryos. The 377-bp species in lane 4\ncorresponds to the unspliced hsp-70 sequence. It could not be\nestablished whether this product derived from incompletely processed\nRNA, because some samples contained trace amounts of genomic DNA (data\nnot shown).To investigate expression of a second heat shock gene in these sets of\nRNAi embryos, we assayed production of the endogenous hsp-70\nmRNA by RT-PCR. We used primers that were located well within the gene\nand spanned an intron, so that they would detect the presence of long,\nprocessed transcripts (Fig. \u200b(Fig.6B).6B). Compared to wild-type, in\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos levels of the hsp-70 RT-PCR\nproduct were dramatically reduced (Fig. \u200b(Fig.6C,6C, lanes 2,3). In contrast, a\nconsiderable level of endogenous hsp-70 mRNA was produced in\ncdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. \u200b(Fig.6C,6C, lane 4). We\nconclude that when SPT-4 and SPT-5 levels are depleted, these heat\nshock genes can be transcribed independently of P-TEFb. DiscussionP-TEFb, a broadly required elongation\u2009factorIn this first genetics-based study of P-TEFb, we determined that\nC. elegans P-TEFb is broadly required for embryonic\ntranscription. In cdk-9(RNAi) embryos, terminal arrest\nphenotypes were indistinguishable from those caused by lack of the\nessential transcription factors ama-1 or ttb-1 (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.2B;2B; Walker et al. 2001), and expression of each gene that we analyzed\nwas reduced to background levels (Figs. \u200b(Figs.4,4, \u200b,5A,5A, \u200bA,6C;6C; Table \u200bTable1).\nSimultaneous1).\nSimultaneous inhibition of the cyclin T genes cit-1.1 and\ncit-1.2 had similar effects (Figs. \u200b(Figs.2B,2B, \u200bB,4,4, \u200b,5A;5A; Table \u200bTable1),\nsuggesting1),\nsuggesting that in the embryo these cyclin T proteins function\nredundantly. This broad requirement for P-TEFb suggests that a\nsignificant number of transcription activators or coactivators may\nrecruit P-TEFb directly. P-TEFb-dependent elongation pathways might be\nespecially important in rapidly dividing early embryonic cells, but we\nconsider it more likely that P-TEFb is also generally essential for\nmRNA transcription in other metazoan cell types, a model that is\nconsistent with previous pharmacologic inhibitor studies (Chao and\nPrice 2001). Although Tat-dependent transcription is particularly\nsensitive to CDK-9 inhibition (Chao et al. 2000), treatment with highly\nspecific CDK-9 inhibitors may significantly impair transcription of\nimportant host cell genes.C. elegans P-TEFb also appears to be essential for most\nembryonic CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation. RNAi embryos in which either CDK-9\nor cyclin T was depleted lacked detectable specific \u03b1-PSer 2\nstaining, comparably to ama-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3B).\nDepletion3B).\nDepletion of CDK-9 did not appear to reduce the overall level of CTD\nSer 5 phosphorylation however (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A),3A), although we cannot exclude the\npossibility that some embryonic Ser 5 phosphorylation might be\nP-TEFb-dependent. Our results suggest that P-TEFb is the major\nembryonic CTD Ser 2 kinase, and that CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation by\nP-TEFb may be generally important for metazoan transcription. An\nanalysis of two genes in S. cerevisiae suggests that during\ntranscription, the CDK-9-related kinase Ctk1 phosphorylates Ser 2 after\nSer 5 phosphorylation has occurred (Komarnitsky et al. 2000; Cho et al.\n2001). In the C. elegans embryo, appearance of both the\n\u03b1-PSer 5 and \u03b1-Ser 2 CTD phosphoepitopes depends on the CTD Ser 5\nkinase CDK-7 (Wallenfang and Seydoux 2002), and on essential initiation\nfactors such as ttb-1 (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A;3A; Walker et al. 2001). Our\nfinding that P-TEFb may not be required for most CTD Ser 5\nphosphorylation (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A)3A) suggests that a sequential ordering of CTD\nSer 5 and Ser 2 phosphorylation may be a general characteristic of Pol\nII transcription (Fig. \u200b(Fig.77).\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 7P-TEFb-dependent elongation mechanisms. Details and\nreferences are given in the text. (1) The TFIIH kinase (CDK-7;\nKin28) phosphorylates CTD Ser 5 (orange asterisks) upon promoter\nclearance, and independently of P-TEFb. Pol II is then susceptible to\nDSIF (SPT-4/5)-dependent pausing. This phosphorylation also recruits\ncapping enzyme (C.E.) to the CTD. (2) P-TEFb phosphorylates\nCTD Ser 2 and SPT-5 (green asterisks), and relieves inhibition by\nSPT-4/5. A speculative possibility is that SPT-4/5 may thereby be\nconverted into a positively acting form. This mechanism may enhance the\nefficiency of elongation or mRNA processing by monitoring the presence\nor activity of factors required for these events. P-TEFb, the\nphosphatase FCP-1, and SPT-5 may remain associated with active\nelongating polymerase complexes, either continuously or intermittently,\nsuggesting that SPT-5 may be regulated by opposing effects of P-TEFb\nand FCP-1. It is not known whether SPT-4 is then present. Heat shock\ngenes can be expressed independently of cdk-9 when SPT-4 and\nSPT-5 are depleted by RNAi. (3) At most other genes, P-TEFb\nappears to be required in an additional mechanism. This mechanism may\ninvolve the release of a distinct, possibly chromatin-associated\nbarrier to elongation, or an enhancement of cotranscriptional mRNA\nprocessing.In S. cerevisiae, the CTD Ser 2 kinase Ctk1 is not essential\nfor viability (Sterner et al. 1995; Patturajan et al. 1999), in\napparent contrast to the importance of C. elegans P-TEFb for\nembryonic transcription. Yeast genes on average are shorter than\nmetazoan genes, but some genes analyzed here are less than 2 kb in\nlength (med-1; hsp-16.2), arguing against a\nsignificant difference in intrinsic elongation requirements.\nAlternatively, differences in biological contexts may be involved, or\nin S. cerevisiae a different kinase might compensate for Ctk1\nat some genes or substrates. A candidate is the related kinase Bur1,\nwhich promotes elongation but preferentially phosphorylates CTD Ser 5\n(Murray et al. 2001). Finally, given that mRNA processing is coupled to\nelongation (Hirose and Manley 2000), a broader requirement for a CTD\nSer 2 kinase in metazoans might be related to the greater relative\nimportance of mRNA splicing.Functional antagonism between P-TEFb and SPT-4/SPT-5 in\u2009vivoIn light of the considerable evidence that SPT-4/SPT-5 promotes\ntranscription elongation (as discussed at the beginning of this paper),\nit seems paradoxical that in vitro SPT-4/SPT-5 induces polymerase\npausing that must be overcome by P-TEFb (Wada et al. 1998b; Renner et\nal. 2001). Here we obtained in vivo evidence to support the latter\nmodel. In cdk-9(RNAi) embryos, transcription of two different\nheat shock genes was significantly restored when spt-4 and\nspt-5 were also inhibited by RNAi (Figs. \u200b(Figs.5A,5A, \u200bA,6C).6C). This\nrecovery of heat shock gene expression in spt-4; spt-5;\ncdk-9(RNAi) embryos was not associated with a global activation of\nan alternative CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation pathway by heat shock (Fig.\n\u200b(Fig.5C),5C), strongly suggesting that removal of an inhibitory effect of\nSPT-4/SPT-5 was involved. HSP-16.2\u2237GFP expression was\nrestored to a lesser extent in spt-5; cdk-9(RNAi) embryos,\nindicating that both spt-4 and spt-5 contribute to\nthis inhibition (data not shown). Although these effects could derive\nfrom unanticipated functions of P-TEFb and SPT-4/SPT-5, a simpler\nexplanation is that these factors have opposing influences on\ntranscription. Biochemical evidence indicates that P-TEFb counteracts\nSPT-4/SPT-5 by phosphorylating the CTD (Wada et al. 1998b; Yamaguchi et\nal. 1999; Renner et al. 2001), but its phosphorylation of SPT-5 might\nalso be important (Ivanov et al. 2000). By demonstrating an\nantagonistic relationship between cdk-9 and\nspt-4/spt-5 directly in a genetic system, our data\nstrongly support the model that overcoming SPT-4/SPT-5-dependent\ninhibition is a critical function of P-TEFb. At the same time, the\nmodel that SPT-4/SPT-5 has both negative and positive effects may\nexplain why we did not observe elevated HSP-16.2\u2237GFP expression in\nspt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos (Fig. \u200b(Fig.55A).A model that accommodates both positive and negative roles is that\nSPT-4/SPT-5 monitors recruitment of elongation or mRNA processing\nfactors at the Pol II complex (Andrulis et al. 2000; Orphanides and\nReinberg 2002). By enforcing this transcription \u201ccheckpoint,\u201d\nSPT-4/SPT-5 may enhance the efficiency of elongation, or the fidelity\nof cotranscriptional mRNA processing (Fig. \u200b(Fig.7).7). This scheme is\nconsistent with evidence that SPT-5 directly promotes mRNA capping (Wen\nand Shatkin 2000). SPT-5 may also promote elongation by acting as an\nantiterminator (Bourgeois et al. 2002), presumably after\nSPT-4/SPT-5-dependent pausing has been relieved by P-TEFb. It has been\nproposed that SPT-4/SPT-5 and NELF together induce 5\u2032 pausing of Pol II\nprior to elongation or capping (Andrulis et al. 2000; Orphanides and\nReinberg 2002), but the evidence that SPT-4/SPT-5 is opposed by P-TEFb\nsuggests that SPT-4/SPT-5-dependent pausing might also occur more\ndistally within a gene (Fig. \u200b(Fig.7).7). In yeast, CTD Ser 2 phosphorylation\npredominates >500 bp from the promoter, where Ctk1 and the CTD\nphosphatase Fcp1 engage in an ongoing process of CTD Ser 2\nphosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Komarnitsky et al. 2000; Cho et\nal. 2001). SPT-5 similarly appears to be present along actively\ntranscribed metazoan genes (Andrulis et al. 2000; Kaplan et al. 2000).\nIf SPT-5-dependent pausing is regulated by a dynamic modulation of CTD\nSer 2 phosphorylation (Fig. \u200b(Fig.7),7), this process may monitor recruitment of\nelongation or mRNA processing factors until late stages of the\ntranscription cycle.P-TEFb-dependent pathways of elongation\u2009controlcdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos expressed two heat shock\ngenes, but not the early genes med-1 or pes-10 (Figs.\n\u200b(Figs.4,4, \u200b,5A,D,5A,D, 6C). cdk-9; spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos also were not\ndistinguishably different in their terminal arrest phenotype from\ncdk-9(RNAi) or ama-1(RNAi) embryos, suggesting that\nthey failed to transcribe many or possibly most other genes. In yeast,\nheat shock genes differ from most cellular genes in that they can be\ntranscribed independently of the CTD, and do not require activation\nmechanisms that depend upon kin28 or certain Mediator\ncomponents (Lee and Lis 1998; McNeil et al. 1998). Our findings\nindicate that heat shock genes are also distinct in their requirements\nfor P-TEFb, suggesting that metazoans are able to sustain transcription\nelongation through two different P-TEFb-dependent pathways.What distinguishes these P-TEFb-dependent postinitiation pathways from\neach other? It is possible that heat shock genes are highly resistant\nto SPT-4/SPT-5-dependent pausing, and that sufficient residual\nSPT-4/SPT-5 remained in cdk-9; spt-4;\nspt-5(RNAi) embryos to prevent expression of med-1,\npes-10, and most other embryonic genes. This seems unlikely\nhowever, given that spt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos were\ncharacterized by consistent and severe developmental abnormalities\n(Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B).2B). Alternatively, at most cellular genes P-TEFb may be required\nin an SPT-4/SPT-5-independent mechanism that was not predicted by in\nvitro experiments that were performed using naked DNA. For example,\nP-TEFb may be needed to overcome an SPT-4/SPT-5-independent elongation\nblock that is specific to a chromatin environment. Consistent with this\nmodel, the FACT complex is required along with P-TEFb for elongation to\noccur on chromatin templates in vitro (Orphanides et al. 1998; Wada et\nal. 2000). P-TEFb might also activate other positive elongation\nfactors. Alternatively, evidence that the phosphorylated CTD stimulates\ncertain mRNA processing steps (Hirose and Manley 2000) suggests that\nthese steps may be facilitated by P-TEFb, an effect that could increase\nelongation rates (Fong and Zhou 2001). Elucidation of this\nP-TEFb-dependent mechanism, and of why it is regulated differently at\nheat shock genes, should provide important and perhaps unexpected\ninsights into postinitiation levels of transcription regulation. Materials and methodsC. elegans and\u2009bioinformaticsC. elegans strains were maintained as described (Brenner\n1974). The wild-type strain was N2. GFP reporter strains were\ngenerously provided by many laboratories, as cited previously (Walker\net al. 2001). C. elegans orthologs of genes that encode CDK-9,\nT-type cyclins, and SPT-4 were identified by searching WORMpep or\ngenomic databases (Sanger Centre) with human or S. cerevisiae\nprotein sequences. C. elegans SPT-5 was identified previously\n(Hartzog et al. 1998; Wada et al. 1998a; Guo et al. 2000). Alignments\nwere produced by Megalign (DNAStar). Both cdk-9 open reading\nframes (ORFs) H25P06.2A and H25P06.2B are represented in EST databases.\nPreviously reported observations obtained in large-scale RNAi screens\nconcur with our findings that RNAi inhibition of either\ncit-1.1 or cit-1.2 individually has no effect on\ndevelopment, and that spt-5(RNAi) leads to 100% embryonic\nlethality (Gonczy et al. 2000; Maeda et al. 2001). The\ncit-1.1, cit-1.2, spt-4, spt-5, and\nhsp-70 ORFs are F44B9.4, F44B9.3, F54C4.2, K08E4.1, and\nC12C8.1, respectively.Immunostaining and fluorescence\u2009analysisThe P-CTD (\u03b1-PSer5) (Schroeder et al. 2000), H5 (\u03b1-PSer2)\n(Babco), 8WG16 (\u03b1-unP CTD) (Babco), and POL 3/3 (Bellier et al. 1997)\nantibodies were used to detect forms of the Pol II large\nsubunit. \u03b1-PSer5 and \u03b1-PSer-2 staining were performed as\nin Seydoux and Dunn (1997), and POL 3/3 and 8WG16 staining as in Walker\net al. (2001). It was reported that at extremely high antigen\nconcentrations, \u03b1-PSer2 shows some cross-reactivity in vitro with the\nCTD phosphorylated at Ser 5 (Cho et al. 2001). \u03b1-PSer2 completely\nfails to detect the characteristic nuclear phospho-Ser 5 foci that are\npresent in C. elegans and Drosophila embryonic\ngermline precursors, however (Seydoux and Dunn 1997; Walker et al.\n2001), indicating that this weak cross-reactivity does not affect our\nfindings. Two rabbit antisera were raised against the CDK-9 peptide\nRPPKRPNTEHAQEPPKR, with a carboxyl terminal Cys added. For CDK-9\nstaining, freeze-cracked embryos were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and\nthen methanol, and washed with PBT (1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline, 1%\nTriton X-100, 1% BSA) prior to staining with affinity-purified CDK-9\nantiserum. CDK-9 antibody staining was competed by the immunogenic but\nnot heterologous peptides (data not shown). For GFP analysis, embryos\nwere transferred to 2% agarose pads. Images were captured with a Zeiss\nAxioSKOP2 microscope and AxioCam digital camera, and GFP or antibody\nstaining intensities were compared over a range of exposure times.\nPixel intensities were standardized using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.RNAi analysiscdk-9 (yk443b10), cit-1.2 (yk426d10),\nspt-4 (yk254b1), and spt-5 (yk72d11) cDNAs were\nobtained from Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Japan). A\ncit-1.1 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR from a C.\nelegans cDNA library [gift of Marc Vidal (Dana-Farber Cancer\nCenter, Boston, MA)]. Sense and antisense RNA strands were\nsynthesized using the Ribomax kit (Promega), then annealed and injected\nat 0.33\u20131.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcL into young adults (two to eight embryos).\nEmbryos were collected after at least 24 h because uniform populations\nof terminally arrested spt-4; spt-5(RNAi),\ncdk-9(RNAi), and cit-1.1; cit-1.2(RNAi)\nembryos appeared at 18, 22, and 24 h after injection, respectively. In\nheat shock experiments, hsp-16.2\u2237gfp RNAi and\ncontrol embryos were collected at least 24 h after injection, then\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 min in 10 \u03bcL of M9. Fluorescence was\nexamined 1 h later. Embryos that were not heat shocked were monitored\nin parallel to confirm their developmental phenotypes. In comparison to\nother heat shock protocols, this procedure minimized effects of heat\nshock on embryonic development, but yielded maximal expression of\nHSP-16.2\u2237GFP. To analyze expression of endogenous hsp-70, N2\nand RNAi worms were heat shocked as above, then allowed to recover at\nroom temperature for 10 min prior to RNA preparation.In performing RNAi on cdk-9, spt-4, and\nspt-5 simultaneously, care was taken to control for injected\nRNA concentrations, because differences in input RNA levels can\ninfluence the efficiency of RNAi. These dsRNAs were mixed to\n1:1:1 to a total concentration of 1.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcL. In parallel\nexperiments, the phenotypic effects of administering these individual\ndsRNAs on their own were comparable when they were injected at either\n0.33 or 1.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, or at 0.33 \u03bcg/\u03bcL but brought to a total RNA\nconcentration of 1.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcL with an unrelated dsRNA (glp-1)\n(as judged by terminal phenotype and PES-10\u2237GFP, MED-1\u2237GFP, and\nHSP-16.2\u2237GFP expression; data not shown). In multiple experiments,\nRT-PCR indicated that in cdk-9(RNAi) and cdk-9;\nspt-4; spt-5(RNAi) embryos, the cdk-9 mRNA was\nreproducibly depleted in parallel to a similar extent (>10\u2013100 fold\nreduction).RT-PCREach RT-PCR reaction included total embryonic RNA prepared from 10\ngravid hermaphrodites using Tri-reagent (Sigma). RT-PCR was performed\nessentially as described (Longman et al. 2000), using the\nSuperscript One Step system (GIBCO BRL) and 40 cycles of\namplification, followed by analysis on an ethidium bromide-stained\nagarose gel.
