In particular, ASOs are frequently used to functionally interrogate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and to discriminate lncRNA loci that produce functional RNAs from those whose activity is attributable to the act of transcription. Transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of nascent transcripts, generally during polyadenylation, resulting in degradation of the residual RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated RNA by XRN2 and dissociation of elongating Pol II. Here we show that ASOs act upon nascent transcripts and, consequently, induce premature transcription termination downstream of the cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Targeting the transcript 3\u2019 end with ASOs, however, allows transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. These results demonstrate that the effects of ASOs on transcription must be considered for appropriate experimental and therapeutic use of these reagents. Graphical Abstract eTOC blurbAntisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated transcript knockdown is commonly used to interrogate the function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, Lee et al. demonstrate that ASOs induce cleavage of nascent transcripts and thereby trigger premature transcription termination. Thus, these reagents cannot be used to establish an RNA-mediated function for a lncRNA locus. INTRODUCTIONAntisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are broadly used tools that allow modulation of RNA processing, protein production, or transcript abundance in cellular and animal model systems and represent a rapidly emerging class of therapeutics for diverse diseases. ASOs exert their effects on gene expression through several different mechanisms. First, ASOs can modulate pre-mRNA splicing by binding and sterically-blocking splice sites or other sequences that regulate exon inclusion. For example, ASOs that cause exon skipping in the DMD transcript or exon inclusion in SMN2 have been approved by the FDA for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, respectively (Havens and Hastings, 2016; Rinaldi and Wood, 2018). Second, ASOs can block ribosome association, thereby reducing protein production from the targeted mRNA (Baker et al., 1997). The most common use of ASOs, however, is to induce decay of targeted transcripts by triggering RNase H-mediated cleavage. The formation of DNA-RNA hybrids between ASOs and their targets recruits endogenous RNase H1, resulting in hydrolysis of the RNA strand of the duplex (Wu et al., 2004). ASOs that trigger target mRNA degradation are undergoing clinical testing for diverse diseases including Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and familial hypercholesterolemia (Rinaldi and Wood, 2018; Stein and Castanotto, 2017). Through the incorporation of specific nucleotide modifications, ASOs can be purposefully designed to engage these various modes of target regulation.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of noncoding transcripts defined simply by having a length greater than 200 nucleotides and a lack of protein-coding potential. Because of this broad definition, these RNAs represent a diverse array of functional entities (Derrien et al., 2012; Kung et al., 2013; Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013). LncRNAs are often classified into those that function to regulate local gene expression in cis or those that leave the site of transcription and perform various functions in trans (Kopp and Mendell, 2018). While demonstration of a trans-acting function for a lncRNA is experimentally straightforward since the heterologous expression of these transcripts will rescue a loss-of-function phenotype, it has proven much more challenging to establish an RNA-mediated function for lncRNA loci that regulate gene expression in cis. DNA regulatory elements such as enhancers are broadly, if not ubiquitously, transcribed (Core et al., 2014; De Santa et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Li et al., 2016). Moreover, transcription or splicing of lncRNAs may influence the local chromatin state and affect RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy of nearby genes (Anderson et al., 2016; Engreitz et al., 2016; Latos et al., 2012). Thus, the mere production of a lncRNA transcript is not sufficient to infer a functional role for the RNA itself. Rather, at least three possible mechanisms must be considered when dissecting the function of a cis-acting lncRNA locus: i) local gene regulation is mediated by the action of regulatory DNA elements within the lncRNA gene body whose transcription is not required for function; ii) transcription of the lncRNA locus is required for regulatory activity but the transcribed RNA itself is not functional; or iii) the lncRNA molecule performs an RNA-mediated regulatory function (Kopp and Mendell, 2018). Establishing that transcription of a lncRNA locus is necessary for function can be readily achieved by introducing sequence elements that terminate transcription using genome editing techniques (Anderson et al., 2016; Engreitz et al., 2016; Latos et al., 2012). In cases where transcription is required, knockdown of the RNA using ASOs has emerged as the most frequently used approach to assess a possible function for the lncRNA molecule itself. ASOs that trigger RNase H-mediated cleavage are very effective for lncRNA knockdown, in part due to their activity in the nucleus where many lncRNAs are predominantly localized (Derrien et al., 2012). The interpretation of these experiments could be confounded, however, if ASOs influence transcription, a possibility that has not yet been formally examined.For the majority of eukaryotic genes, transcription termination is triggered by cleavage of the nascent transcript by the polyadenylation machinery at the polyA signal sequence (PAS) (Birse et al., 1998; Connelly and Manley, 1988; Rosonina et al., 2006; Whitelaw and Proudfoot, 1986). Nascent transcript cleavage engages the \u2018torpedo mechanism\u2019, whereby the phosphorylated 5\u2019 end of the uncapped residual RNA still associated with elongating Pol II provides an entry point for 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 exonucleolytic decay by XRN2, which degrades the nascent transcript until it reaches and displaces the bound Pol II from the chromatin template (Connelly and Manley, 1988; Kim et al., 2004; Proudfoot, 2016; Rosonina et al., 2006; West et al., 2004). Interestingly, it has been reported that XRN2 promotes premature transcription termination within gene bodies, at sites of promoter proximal Pol II pausing (Brannan et al., 2012; Nojima et al., 2015). Furthermore, XRN2 promotes termination downstream of PAS-independent cleavage events (Ballarino et al., 2009; Fong et al., 2015; Wagschal et al., 2012). Therefore, the XRN2-mediated torpedo mechanism is not limited to PAS-dependent termination and can be activated by other events that cause endonucleolytic cleavage of nascent Pol II-associated transcripts.In this study, we examined the possibility that ASO-mediated cleavage of nascent RNAs induces transcription termination by activating the torpedo mechanism, thereby confounding the interpretation of functional studies of cis-acting lncRNA loci. Nuclear run-on (NRO) experiments and analysis of nascent chromatin-associated RNA in human cells revealed efficient targeting of nascent noncoding and protein-coding transcripts by ASOs. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that introduction of ASOs reduced Pol II occupancy downstream of the transcript cleavage site in an XRN2-dependent manner. Together, these results establish that ASO-mediated knockdown triggers premature transcription termination by initiating the torpedo mechanism. We further show that targeting the 3\u2019 end of transcripts with ASOs allows RNA knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the distal gene body. These findings reveal important considerations for the appropriate use of ASO reagents and provide an opportunity to manipulate transcription termination for experimental and therapeutic purposes. RESULTSASOs induce cleavage of nascent transcriptsTo determine whether ASOs trigger degradation of nascent transcripts, we first employed the NRO assay, a classic technique for measuring nascent transcript production from a gene of interest (Smale, 2009). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) gapmer ASOs, which contain standard DNA nucleotides flanked by LNA-modified nucleotides to increase target affinity and oligonucleotide stability, were designed to target three well-characterized lncRNAs, NORAD, MALAT1 and HOTAIR, and the housekeeping protein-coding transcript PPIB (designated ASO1 in Figure S1A). These transcripts were chosen based on their variable cytoplasmic or nuclear subcellular localization and the presence or absence of introns. Following transfection of cultured cells with ASOs, nuclei were isolated under conditions in which engaged Pol II was paused. An in vitro NRO transcription reaction was then performed in the presence of ribonucleotide precursors including bromouridine-triphosphate (Br-UTP), allowing the specific recovery and quantification of BrU-labeled nascent transcripts (Figure 1A).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.ASOs induce cleavage of nascent transcripts in isolated nuclei(A) Schematic of nuclear run-on (NRO) experiments.

Similar experiments were performed in HEK293T cells with an ASO targeting HOTAIR, due to the higher expression of this lncRNA in this cell line. Compared to transfection with non-targeting control ASO, introduction of gene-specific ASOs resulted in a ~60\u201390% reduction in steady-state abundance of each targeted transcript in transfected cells prior to nuclear isolation (Figures 1B\u2013E). NRO assays were then performed and nascent transcripts were measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase (qRT)-PCR using primer sets that assessed the 5\u2019, middle, or 3\u2019 segments of each targeted RNA. Two independent reference genes, GAPDH (Figures 1F\u2013I) and B2M (Figures S1B\u2013E), were used to minimize the possibility of normalization artifacts. For each assayed transcript, introduction of the cognate ASO resulted in a significant reduction in nascent transcript abundance downstream of the ASO targeting site (Figures 1F\u2013I and S1B\u2013E). In the case of NORAD and PPIB, nascent transcript levels upstream of the site of ASO-mediated cleavage were also significantly reduced. Thus, ASOs efficiently target nascent transcripts in isolated nuclei. Transcript fragments upstream of the ASO target site are likely released from elongating Pol II and, in the absence of a stabilizing polyA tail, degraded by the exosome (Garneau et al., 2007), whereas the 3\u2019 fragment provides a substrate for XRN2, potentially engaging the torpedo mechanism of transcription termination.ASOs promote cleavage of chromatin-associated nascent RNAs in intact cellsWe next performed metabolic labeling experiments to ascertain whether ASOs induce degradation of nascent transcripts in intact cells. Following transfection of HCT116 or HEK293T cells with ASOs, cells were pulse-labeled with 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) for 30 minutes to allow EU incorporation into newly synthesized RNA. Chromatin-associated RNAs were then isolated, further enriching for nascent transcripts. Following cell lysis and chromatin isolation under conditions prohibiting new transcription initiation, EU-labeled RNAs were biotinylated, purified, and assayed by qRT-PCR to measure chromatin-associated nascent RNA (Figure 2A). Consistent with the results of the NRO experiments, transfection of ASOs targeting NORAD, MALAT1, PPIB, or HOTAIR resulted in a significant reduction in chromatin-associated nascent transcript levels (Figures 2B\u2013E and S2A\u2013D). Reduced nascent transcript abundance downstream and, in most cases, upstream of the ASO target site was observed, consistent with XRN2- and exosome-mediated decay of the endonucleolytic cleavage products, respectively. These data document that ASOs efficiently target chromatin-associated nascent RNAs derived from both noncoding and protein-coding gene loci in human cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.ASOs promote cleavage of chromatin-associated nascent transcripts in intact cells(A) Schematic of metabolic labeling and analysis of chromatin-associated nascent transcripts.

ChIP was used to monitor the occupancy of total Pol II or Pol II phosphorylated at the serine 5 residue of the C-terminal domain repeat region (P-Ser5) along the gene bodies of ASO-targeted transcripts (Figure 3A). Total and P-Ser5 Pol II was readily detectable across NORAD, MALAT1, PPIB, or HOTAIR in cells transfected with control ASO (Figures 3B\u2013E). Following transfection with ASOs that target each respective transcript, however, a significant reduction in both total and P-Ser5 Pol II association was observed at the 3\u2019 end of each gene body. Notably, the presence or absence of introns downstream of the ASO targeting site had little impact on the magnitude of downstream Pol II association. These results demonstrate that ASO-mediated cleavage triggers premature transcription termination downstream of the ASO targeting site.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.ASO-mediated knockdown triggers premature transcription termination(A) Schematic of Pol II ChIP experiments.(B-E) ChIP-PCR analysis of total and P-Ser5 Pol II occupancy at the indicated loci in HCT116 (B-D) or HEK293T cells (E).

XRN2-mediated termination is not limited to PAS-dependent cleavage and can be triggered by transcript cleavage through other mechanisms that produce a nascent transcript fragment with a phosphorylated 5\u2019 end (Ballarino et al., 2009; Brannan et al., 2012; Fong et al., 2015; Wagschal et al., 2012). To test whether ASO-induced premature transcription termination depends upon XRN2 activity, we examined nascent transcript levels and Pol II-association of ASO-targeted genes following XRN2 depletion. Cells were first transfected with control or XRN2-targeting siRNA, and then ASOs targeting NORAD or PPIB, or a non-targeting control ASO, were introduced 48 hours later (Figure S3A). This strategy resulted in efficient depletion of XRN2 and the ASO-targeted transcripts (Figures 4A and \u200band4D4D).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.XRN2 is required for ASO-mediated premature transcription termination(A) qRT-PCR analysis of XRN2 (upper) and NORAD (lower) transcript levels in HCT116 cells following transfection of non-targeting control siRNA (siNT) or XRN2-targeting siRNA (siXRN2) followed by transfection with the indicated ASO.

In cells depleted of XRN2, nascent transcript abundance at the 3\u2019 end of NORAD or PPIB was no longer significantly reduced following transfection of ASOs targeting these transcripts (Figures 4B, \u200b,4E,4E, and S3B\u2013C). Accordingly, analysis of P-Ser5 Pol II along the gene bodies of NORAD and PPIB using ChIP demonstrated that XRN2 depletion fully restored the association of Pol II at the 3\u2019 end of these genes (Figures 4C and \u200band4F).4F). These data support the model that ASO-mediated cleavage of nascent transcripts induces the torpedo mechanism, resulting in premature transcription termination within targeted gene bodies.Targeting the distal portion of transcripts with ASOs preserves Pol II associationThe demonstration that ASOs trigger premature transcription termination downstream of the site of RNA cleavage suggested that targeting the 3\u2019 end of a gene, proximal to the polyadenylation site, could result in transcript knockdown while preserving Pol II association with the gene body. To test this hypothesis, additional ASOs were designed to target the distal portion of the lncRNA NORAD or the protein coding gene PPIB (designated ASO2 in Figure S1A). Both proximally-targeting ASOs (ASO1) and distally-targeting ASOs (ASO2) resulted in efficient knockdown of total NORAD or PPIB transcript levels (Figures 5A\u2013B). Metabolic labeling with EU was then used to examine the effects on chromatin-associated nascent transcript levels. In the case of NORAD, targeting either the proximal or distal segment of the transcript comparably reduced nascent transcript levels throughout the gene body (Figure 5C). For PPIB, however, the distally-targeted ASO (ASO2) only significantly reduced nascent transcript abundance downstream of its cleavage site and, overall, was much less effective at knockdown of the nascent PPIB transcript (Figure 5D). Since ASO1 and ASO2 were equally effective at reducing total PPIB transcript levels (Figure 5B), the distinct behavior of these oligos at the level of nascent RNA suggests differential availability of the ASO target sites. For example, rapid transcription elongation at the PPIB locus would limit the time available for engagement of the distal targeting site by an ASO relative to the proximal target site which would emerge from elongating Pol II earlier.Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Distal targeting of transcripts with ASOs preserves Pol II association(A-B) Steady-state ASO-mediated knockdown in total RNA. qRT-PCR analysis of NORAD (A) or PPIB (B) levels after ASO transfection in HCT116 cells.

At both gene loci, P-Ser5 Pol II association with distal gene segments was preserved after transfection of 3\u2019-targeting ASOs (Figures 5E\u2013F). These data demonstrate that the confounding effect of premature transcription termination induced by ASO-mediated nascent-transcript cleavage may be avoided by targeting the distal segment of the gene body. DISCUSSIONIt is widely assumed that ASO-mediated RNA cleavage affects gene expression solely at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, however, we show that due to the ability of ASOs to act upon nascent transcripts, targeting an RNA of interest with this approach induces premature transcription termination, an effect which must be considered in order to appropriately interpret experiments that employ these reagents. Mechanistically, ASO-induced nascent transcript cleavage provides an entry point for degradation of the residual, uncapped Pol II-associated RNA by XRN2 in a 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 manner. This scenario activates the \u2018torpedo mechanism\u2019 of transcription termination, whereby XRN2 triggers dissociation of elongating Pol II when it fully degrades the residual transcript and reaches the polymerase complex (Figures 6A\u2013B). This mechanism of transcription termination mirrors the natural termination mechanism that occurs following cleavage and polyadenylation of most Pol II transcripts.Open in a separate windowFigure 6.Mechanism of transcription termination following cleavage and polyadenylation or ASO-mediated nascent transcript cleavage(A) The torpedo mechanism is activated by cleavage and polyadenylation, or other events that lead to cleavage of the nascent transcript. The resulting uncapped, phosphorylated 5\u2019 end of the residual Pol II-associated transcript provides an entry point for the 5\u2019-to-3\u2019 exoribonuclease XRN2, which degrades the nascent transcript until it reaches and displaces the elongating polymerase from the chromatin template.(B) ASO-mediated nascent transcript cleavage produces a residual Pol II-associated transcript that is an XRN2 substrate, thereby activating the torpedo mechanism in a manner analogous to the events that follow cleavage and polyadenylation.(C) When the site of ASO cleavage is directed to the distal segment of the transcript, as close as possible to, but upstream, of the PAS, efficient transcript knockdown can still be achieved while preserving Pol II association with the distal gene body.Our demonstration that ASOs induce premature transcription termination has important implications for the appropriate interpretation of experimental data derived from the use of these reagents. Foremost among these is the principle that ASO-mediated transcript knockdown cannot, in isolation, establish an RNA-mediated function for a transcribed locus. This tenet is perhaps most relevant for the study of lncRNAs, many of which act in cis to regulate local gene expression (Kopp and Mendell, 2018). Such cis-acting lncRNA loci have been proposed to produce RNAs that recruit chromatin modifying complexes or transcription factors and, through chromatin looping, deliver these complexes to nearby promoters. In practice, however, it can be extremely challenging to establish that these loci function through the encoded RNA. Traditional enhancers or other types of DNA regulatory elements are broadly, if not ubiquitously, transcribed (Core et al., 2014; De Santa et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Li et al., 2016). Moreover, the act of transcription or splicing of a nascent transcript can itself influence expression of neighboring genes (Anderson et al., 2016; Engreitz et al., 2016; Latos et al., 2012). Thus, the production of an RNA does not necessarily imply functionality. Prior to this work, it was generally accepted that ASO-mediated knockdown could provide compelling additional data that would support an RNA-mediated function for a transcript produced by a noncoding locus. Our findings reported here, demonstrating that ASOs have an inhibitory effect on transcription, clearly show that ASO-mediated knockdown is not sufficient to support this conclusion.Given the confounding effect of ASOs on transcription, how can one establish an RNA-mediated function for a noncoding RNA locus of interest? We have described one straightforward strategy that can potentially mitigate this issue. If the site of ASO cleavage is directed to the distal segment of the transcript, as close as possible to, but upstream, of the PAS, efficient transcript knockdown can still be achieved while preserving Pol II association with the complete gene body (Figure 6C). In some cases, distal targeting efficiently reduces nascent transcript abundance but does not provide an opportunity for premature torpedo-mediated termination because the targeting site is close to the 3\u2019 end of the gene. Our experiments with ASO-mediated knockdown of NORAD exemplify this concept. In other cases, the distal segment of the transcript may not be available for efficient targeting at the level of nascent RNA, perhaps due to the kinetics of transcription elongation at the target locus, as exemplified by PPIB. In either case, premature transcription termination may be avoided by targeting the distal segment of the gene body, despite allowing knockdown of the total cellular levels of the transcript. Although our data suggest that these principles should be broadly applicable, direct assessment of the effect of ASO knockdown on transcription of a locus of interest, for example using Pol II ChIP, is recommended.In addition to targeting the 3\u2019 ends of transcripts with ASOs, it will be important in the future to evaluate whether orthogonal methods of transcript knockdown similarly act upon nascent RNAs and consequently affect transcription. In principle, any experimental strategy that induces cleavage of a nascent transcript can trigger premature transcription termination through the torpedo mechanism. RNA interference (RNAi), for example, has been reported to act both in the cytoplasm (Zeng and Cullen, 2002) and nucleus (Burger and Gullerova, 2015; Gagnon et al., 2014; Kalantari et al., 2016), suggesting that this pathway may have the ability to act upon nascent transcripts. More recently, the CRISPR/Cas13 system has been developed for targeted RNA knockdown (Abudayyeh et al., 2017; Cox et al., 2017), potentially providing an alternative approach to interrogate lncRNA activity. However, catalytically dead Cas13 orthologs from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (CasRx) are capable of targeting pre-mRNA and altering splicing (Konermann et al., 2018), suggesting that Cas13 proteins may interact with nascent transcripts. Nevertheless, this system might be useful for specifically knocking down cytoplasmic lncRNAs by, for example, appending the protein with a nuclear export signal and thereby limiting its access to the nascent RNA. A similar approach may allow engineering of Cas13 variants that are directed to subnuclear compartments distinct from the site of transcription. Finally, transcript tethering strategies could, in principle, be used to overcome the limitations of knockdown approaches and establish a cis-acting RNA-mediated lncRNA function. One could delete the genomic sequence encoding a lncRNA, or insert a transcriptional terminator, and then perform a rescue experiment in which the lncRNA, expressed in trans, is recruited to its original site of expression. CRISPR-display, a method in which long RNAs are incorporated into Cas9 guide RNAs (Shechner et al., 2015), or other well-established tethering systems such as the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (Coller et al., 1998), could be adapted for this purpose. This strategy could potentially provide convincing evidence that a lncRNA performs an RNA-mediated function at its site of transcription that is independent of the DNA sequence from which it is encoded.In addition to the experimental caveats revealed by our demonstration that ASOs promote transcription termination, this activity offers previously unrecognized experimental and therapeutic opportunities. For example, the purposeful induction of transcription termination by ASOs may be useful for modulating the activity of lncRNA loci whose activity is dependent upon transcription, but independent of the encoded RNA itself. Previously, this could only be accomplished by laborious genome editing strategies, such as insertion of strong polyadenylation sequences within the gene body (Anderson et al., 2016; Engreitz et al., 2016; Latos et al., 2012). ASOs can now potentially be used to more rapidly rule in or rule out a transcription-dependent activity of a noncoding locus of interest and to determine the consequences of loss-of-function of the underlying transcription-dependent sequence element. ASO-induced transcription termination could also potentially be exploited for therapeutic purposes. For example, mutations in the PAS of the HBA2 gene, which encodes \u03b12-globin, have been described in \u03b1-thalassaemia (Higgs et al., 1983). These mutations not only impair appropriate 3\u2019 end processing of the HBA2 message, but also cause transcriptional readthrough which interferes with transcription of the downstream HBA1 gene (encoding \u03b11-globin) (Whitelaw and Proudfoot, 1986). The resulting deficiency of both \u03b12-globin and \u03b11-globin leads to a more severe \u03b1-thalassaemia phenotype than would be expected due to loss of \u03b12-globin alone. In this scenario, therapeutic targeting of the 3\u2019 end of the HBA2 transcript with an ASO could potentially restore transcription termination, thereby rescuing expression of HBA1 and, at least partially, ameliorating the \u03b1-thalassaemia phenotype. This example illustrates the potential therapeutic utility of inducing transcription termination using ASOs, a strategy that merits further investigation in other pathophysiologic contexts.

All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement.EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSHuman cell culture HCT116 cells (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5A media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco). HEK293T (ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco). HCT116 is a male cell line and HEK293T is most likely female due to the presence of multiple X chromosomes and no detectable Y chromosome. Cell lines were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination.METHOD DETAILSDesign and transfection of oligonucleotides All locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides used in this study were 15\u201316 nucleotides in length with a phosphorothioate backbone and contained central DNA nucleotides flanked by LNA nucleotides at both the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends. ASOs were obtained from QIAGEN and designed using the QIAGEN Antisense GapmeR Designer. For each experiment, 1\u00d7106 cells were reverse-transfected with ASOs at 50 nM concentration using 5 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Transfected cells were harvested within 36 hours for analysis.ON-TARGETplus Human XRN2 siRNA SMARTpool (Dharmacon) was used for XRN2 knockdown. 1\u00d7106 HCT116 cells were reverse-transfected with a final siRNA concentration of 40 nM using 2 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sequences of ASOs and siRNA used in this study are provided in Table S1.RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAGEN miRNeasy Mini kit with the on-column DNase digestion step and cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. SYBR Green PCR master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used for qPCR reactions. RNA expression levels were normalized to GAPDH or B2M using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. The number of biological replicates for each experiment is described in the figure legends and three technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are provided in Table S1.Nuclear run-on Nuclear run-on (NRO) was performed as previously described (Roberts et al., 2015) with minor modifications to the protocol. 2\u00d7106 cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in cold PBS, and pelleted at 400g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of cold lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 1300g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and washed in lysis buffer to remove residual cytoplasm. The intact nuclei were then resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of cold nuclear storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 40% (v/v) glycerol) and placed on ice. Transcription reactions were prepared as follows: 50 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 Transcription buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, and 4 mM DTT), 2 \u03bcl RNaseOUT (40 U/\u03bcl, Invitrogen), 1 \u03bcl 100 mM BrUTP (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 \u03bcl 100 mM ATP (Roche), 2 \u03bcl 100 mM GTP (Roche), 2 \u03bcl 100 mM CTP (Roche), and 1 \u03bcl UTP 100 mM (Roche) were combined. This 60 \u03bcl reaction mixture was then added to 40 \u03bcl of nuclei in storage buffer. The reaction was mixed gently by pipetting and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. To halt the reaction, 600 \u03bcl of TRIzol LS (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added, mixed well, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After chloroform extraction, RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with the on-column DNase step according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Immunoprecipitation of bromouridylated RNA was performed as follows: For each sample, 30 \u03bcl protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were pre-washed in PBST (0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS) and combined with 2 \u03bcg of anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation on a rotating platform for 10 min at room temperature, the beads were washed twice in PBSTR (PBST supplemented with 8 U/mL RNaseOUT) and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl PBSTR. 2 \u03bcg of bromouridylated RNA was denatured at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, mixed with the anti-BrdU conjugated beads, and rotated for 30 min at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were magnetically separated and washed three times with PBSTR. To harvest the RNA, 500 \u03bcl of TRIzol (Ambion) was added to the beads, mixed by pipetting, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 100 \u03bcl of chloroform was added, vortexed for 15 s, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The aqueous phase was collected and transferred to a new tube. RNA was precipitated by adding 250 \u03bcl of isopropanol and 20 \u03bcg of GlycoBlue (15 mg/ml, Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit with random primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time PCR amplification was performed using Fast SYBR Green master mix (Life Technologies). Relative quantification of each target, normalized to an endogenous control (GAPDH or B2M), was performed using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. Primer sequences are provided in Table S1.Metabolic labeling and analysis of nascent transcripts Metabolically-labeled nascent transcripts were isolated as previously described (Mayer and Churchman, 2016) with minor modifications. 0.5 mM EU (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium 30 min prior to harvesting, according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 4\u00d7106 EU-labeled cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in cold PBS, and pelleted at 400g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 \u03bcl of cold cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 25 \u03bcM \u03b1-amanitin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 U SUPERaseIn (Invitrogen) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 1300g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and washed in lysis buffer to remove residual cytoplasm. Nuclei were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl cold nuclear lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.05% SDS, 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, 25 \u03bcM \u03b1-amanitin, and 10 U SUPERaseIn and incubated on ice for 10 min. The chromatin was pelleted at 1700g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl chromatin resuspension buffer (1\u00d7 PBS supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, 25 \u03bcM \u03b1-amanitin, 20 U SUPERaseIn). 700 \u03bcl of QIAzol lysis reagent was added, mixed well, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with on-column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The EU-labeled RNA was biotinylated and captured using the Click-it Nascent RNA Capture Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of EU-labeled RNA was biotinylated with 0.5 mM biotin azide in Click-iT reaction buffer. The biotinylated RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in distilled water. Click-iT RNA binding buffer supplemented with RNaseOUT was then added to the biotinylated RNA. The mixture was heated at 68\u00b0C for 5 min and added to MyOne Strepta vidin T1 Dynabeads followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min with gentle vortexing. Beads were washed with Click-iT wash buffers 1 and 2 using magnetic separation. The washed beads were resuspended in Click-iT wash buffer 2 and directly used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit with random primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time PCR amplification was performed as described for NRO reactions.Native chromatin immunoprecipitation Native chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (Skene and Henikoff, 2017) with minor modifications. 4\u00d7106 cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in cold PBS, and pelleted at 400g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of cold nuclear preparation buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1\u00d7 PhosSTOP (Roche) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 1300g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in 250 \u03bcl cold dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.05% SDS, 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail, and 3 mM CaCl2 and incubated on ice for 10 min. 2.5 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 MNase (2000 U/\u03bcl, NEB) was added followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 min. The MNase reaction was stopped by adding 250 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 ChIP buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.2 % (w/v) sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 40 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant containing soluble chromatin was collected and combined with an additional 500 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 ChIP buffer. Chromatin was pre-cleared with 30 \u03bcl protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either 10 \u03bcg anti-RNA Pol II (Active motif, Clone 4H8) or 5 \u03bcg anti-Pol II P-Ser5 antibody (Active motif, Clone 3E8). Antibody-bound complexes were captured by incubation with 30 \u03bcl of protein G Dynabeads for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed 5 times with ChIP buffer and antibody-bound complexes were then eluted in 100 \u03bcl of Elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 1% SDS, and 5 \u03bcl of proteinase K (50 mg/ml, Lucigen)) for 1 h at 55\u00b0C. 2 \u03bcl RNase A (5 mg/ml, Lucigen) was added followed by incubation for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and eluted in 50 \u03bcl TE buffer. Both input and immunoprecipitated DNA were quantified by real-time PCR with primers listed in Table S1.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISAll experiments were repeated with a minimum of three independent biological replicates as indicated in each figure legend.
