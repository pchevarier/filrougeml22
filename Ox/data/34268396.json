Prevention of lung injury translates to improved survival, shorter need for mechanical ventilation, and reduced length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital (1-3). One proven effective measure against ventilator-induced lung injury is the use of an adequately-sized, i.e., low tidal volume (VT) (4-6). Maintaining respiratory muscle activity may prevent ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (1,7).There is a clear trend towards a preference for assisted over controlled modes of ventilation. Use of assisted ventilation which allows spontaneous breaths may not only reduce the risk of lung injury by additional recruitment of non-aerated areas, but also keeps a patient\u2019s diaphragm active (2,8,9). However, assisted ventilation may also result in high inspiratory efforts and a higher respiratory drive, which can potentially increase lung injury (10). Thus, it remains uncertain whether increased use of spontaneous breathing translates into clinical benefit. The results of a recent post-hoc analysis of a large observational study in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients suggests that spontaneous breathing in the first days of ventilation does not impact survival but hastens liberation from the ventilator (9).To gain a better understanding of the effect of the amount of spontaneous breathing on outcome in critically ill patients who received mechanical ventilation for various reasons, the \u2018Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)\u2019-III was analyzed. The primary hypothesis tested was that the amount of spontaneous breathing is associated with an increased number of ventilator-free days at day 28 in patients surviving and receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. We present the following article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-7901). MethodsStudy design and ethical concernsThis is a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-III database that contains high-resolution clinical data from patients admitted to the ICUs of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, MA (11,12). The data in MIMIC-III has been previously de-identified, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013) and approved by the institutional review boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (No. 0403000206) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2001-P-001699/14). Due to the study\u2019s retrospective nature, the requirement for individual consent was waived.Inclusion and exclusion criteriaPatients in the MIMIC-III version v1.4 database were selected for the current analysis if: (I) age \u226516 years; and (II) they received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 consecutive hours. Patients who received ventilation through a tracheostomy cannula at any time during the first 48 hours of ventilation. Only data of the first ICU admission of the first hospitalization were included. Patients transferred from other hospitals were considered only when mechanical ventilation started in the final hospital.Data extraction and preparationThe dataset was assessed for completeness and consistency; outliers, defined as observations that lied outside 1.5\u00d7 interquartile range (IQR), were checked and substituted by the 5th or 95th percentile (13). Ventilatory variables were extracted as the highest and the lowest values per each time-frame of six hours during the first 48 hours of ventilation. These values were summarized as the mean for every 6-hour time window.The ventilation modes were extracted per each time-frame of six hours during the first 48 hours of ventilation. The classification of the ventilation modes that was used for the longest time in each time-frame follows the categorization in previous studies (14,15), as follows:\u2756 Modes mandating spontaneous breathing: in these modes spontaneous breathing is always required, i.e., the ventilator will never provide a breath when the patient does not trigger the ventilator [e.g., \u2018continuous positive airway pressure\u2019 (CPAP), \u2018proportional assisted ventilation\u2019 (PAV) or \u2018pressure support ventilation\u2019 (PSV)]; and\u2756 Modes allowing spontaneous breathing: spontaneous breathing is possible, but when the patient does not trigger the ventilator, only controlled breaths will be delivered [e.g., \u2018pressure-controlled ventilation\u2019 (PCV) or \u2018volume-controlled ventilation\u2019 (VCV)].For details, see Tables S1,S2.DefinitionsFor every 6 hours during the first 48 hours of ventilation, it was defined whether a patient was spontaneous breathing, as follows:\u2756 A patient was considered not to have spontaneous breathing if set respiratory rate (RR) equaled the total RR, and\u2756 A patient was considered to have spontaneous breathing if receiving a ventilation mode mandating spontaneous breathing, or if set RR was lower than the total RR.Then each patient was classified as follows:\u2756 Breathing spontaneously for equal or more than 50% of the time (high spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients), if the proportion of time with spontaneous breathing was \u226550% in the first 48 hours of ventilation; and\u2756 Breathing spontaneous for less than 50% of the time (\u2018low spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients), if the proportion of time with spontaneous breathing was <50% in the first 48 hours of ventilation.OutcomesThe primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days, defined as the number of days from successfully weaning to day 28; patients who died before weaning were deemed to have no ventilator-free days. Secondary outcomes included duration of ventilation in survivors, ICU-, hospital and 30-day mortality, and ICU- and hospital length of stay.Power calculationNo formal sample size calculation was carried out, and all patients included in the current version of the dataset were eligible for inclusion.Statistical analysisOnly complete case analysis was carried out and no assumption for missing data was done. All patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. Continuous variables are presented as medians with their interquartile ranges and categorical variables as total number and percentage. Proportions were compared using \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests and continuous variables were compared using the t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate.VT size was collected as an absolute volume (mL) and then normalized for predicted body weight (mL/kg PBW). The PBW was calculated as equal to 50+0.91 (centimeters of height 152.4) in males, and 45.5+0.91 (centimeters of height 152.4) in females (16). Presence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the first 48 hours of ventilation was scored according to current definition for ARDS, the Berlin Definition, which means that all patients had to be reclassified when previous definitions or criteria were used (17).All main analyses were performed using mixed-effect models to account for within-year clustering. Heterogeneity between years was determined by fitting a fixed interaction term between the variable of interest and year of admission as continuous variable, while overall effect of the comparison of \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 with \u2018low spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients was reported with year of admission treat as a random effect.In a first assessment, group assignment (\u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 vs. \u2018low spontaneous breathing\u2019) was entered in a mixed-effect multivariable model adjusted for relevant covariates known to predict outcome (description in the Supplementary File). The variable of interest was forced in the models as it were the main focus of the study.As the use and the effect of spontaneous breathing could vary according to baseline characteristics and severity of the patients, the following subgroups were assessed: (I) ARDS vs. non-ARDS in the first 48 h; (II) low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) vs. non-LTVV, with LTTV defined as a median tidal volume \u22648 mL/kg PBW in the first 48 hours of ventilation; and (III) baseline PaO2/FiO2 \u2264250 vs. PaO2/FiO2 >250. To determine if the relationship between group and the primary outcome differs between the subgroups, fixed interaction terms between treatment and subgroup were added in the adjusted models for the primary outcome described above. To further ascertain if the treatment-subgroup interaction varied between the year of admission, a three-way fixed interaction between year, treatment and subgroup were also reported.To address heterogeneity of treatment effect, the models described above were re-assessed in two groups using stricter definitions, as follows:\u2756 exclusively breathing spontaneously (\u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients), if the proportion of time with spontaneous breathing was 100% in the first 48 hours of ventilation; and\u2756 never breathing spontaneous (\u2018never spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients), if the proportion of time with spontaneous breathing was 0% in the first 48 hours of ventilation.Statistical significance was considered to be at two-sided P<0.05. All analyses were performed with R v.3.6.0 (www.R-project.org). ResultsPatientsFrom 2001 until 2012, 3,380 patients were selected for the current analysis, 2,374 (70%) were classified as \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients, and 1,006 (30%) as \u2018low spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients (Figure S1). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Table S3. \u2018High spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients were older, had more comorbidities, lower SOFA scores and less often needing vasopressors.

In the adjusted analysis, only duration of ventilation remained lower in \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients.Subgroup analysesResults of the subgroup analyses are present in Figure S3. There was no interaction among any of the subgroups and \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients.Additional analysisOf all patients available, 1,809 (53.5%) were classified as \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients, and 755 (22.3%) as \u2018never spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients. Baseline characteristics, vital signs and laboratory tests, and ventilation data in \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients and \u2018never spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients are shown in Tables S5-S7, and Figures S4,S5.In unadjusted analysis, ICU length of stay was different between \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients and \u2018never spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients (Table S8). In the adjusted analysis, ventilator-free days was higher in \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients (Table S9). DiscussionThe results of this retrospective analysis of the database of a large cohort of mechanically ventilated ICU patients surviving and receiving ventilation for at least 48 hours can be summarized as follows: (I) many patients breath spontaneously for more than 50% of the time within the first 48 hours of invasive ventilation; (II) the proportion of spontaneous breathing in the first 48 hours is not associated with the number of ventilator-free days when one compares high vs. low spontaneous breathing; (III) but this proportion is associated with a shorter duration of ventilation among survivors. In addition, (IV) \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 is associated with more ventilator-free days.The main strength of this analysis is the comprehensive and high-resolution data capture throughout the hospital course of a large group of well-defined and characterized ICU patients. By excluding patients who were breathing through a tracheostomy in the first 48 hours, we avoided the inclusion of patients receiving long-term mechanical ventilation prior to the hospitalization, and those expecting to receive long-term mechanical ventilation (e.g., patients with neurological or neuromuscular disease). Also, the analysis leverages the availability of time\u2013stamped vital signs, laboratory test results, and ventilatory parameters. This is the first clinical study addressing spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with this level of resolution and granularity of the data. Instead of defining the type of ventilation according to one single assessment per day, as in the majority of the studies (9), in the present investigation, this was assessed for every 6 hour-time windows, increasing the power of the study and avoiding surveillance bias. Also, the 48-hour time-interval inclusion criterion guaranteed that all patients were exposed to mechanical ventilation for a sufficient period of time. Finally, all results considered the effect of time using mixed-effect models with year of admission in the ICU as random effect. Indeed, this is important since distinct ventilation practices were applied over time.The finding of this investigation mirror, at least in part, the analysis of the LUNG SAFE study (9) that showed spontaneous breathing to be associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length stay in patients with ARDS. Our findings are also in agreement with results from studies of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), a ventilation mode that allows spontaneous breathing, on patients with ARDS (3). Indeed, use of APRV was associated with shorter duration of ventilation and ICU length of stay. However, bias may have been introduced in these analyses, since spontaneous breathing was used more often in less sick patients.In previous observational studies, bias may have been introduced in the analysis from confounding by indication, since spontaneous breathing is usually used more often in less sick patients. In addition, the classification of patients was based on one single observation point per each ventilation day (9). Of note, confounding by indication may not have been fully addressed by our analysis despite adjustment. But categorizing patients according to presence of spontaneous breathing at eight time\u2013frames in the first 48 hours, surveillance bias was mitigated, at least more than in previous studies.The potential benefits of the use of spontaneous breathing in patients receiving mechanical ventilation should be interpreted with caution. First, ventilator dyssynchronies are common, and its occurrence could increase with spontaneous breathing, and are associated with worse outcomes (18,19). Also, previous studies in ARDS patients suggest that the effect of spontaneous breathing depends on the etiology and severity, with risk of harm proportional to ARDS severity (9,20,21). An appropriate assessment of respiratory drive and inspiratory efforts is important when assessing the potential benefits of spontaneous breathing, and should be encouraged at bedside (10). Measurements like airway occluding pressures, esophageal manometry, diaphragm electrical activity and even occlusion holds during PSV, are optimal to determine if harm arises from the spontaneous breaths (22-25). It is important to emphasize that in the present study the presence of inspiratory effort was not assessed and the presence of spontaneous activity was based in the mode of ventilation and respiratory rate. However, to the date this is a widely used approach to detect spontaneous breathing in observational studies (9,26,27).In the present analysis, the VT size was similar in patients with \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 and those with \u2018low spontaneous breathing\u2019. However, plateau and peak pressure, and PEEP were significantly lower in the group with \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019. It is important to note that patients in the \u2018high spontaneous breathing\u2019 were more often ventilated with PSV, thus, the lower peak pressure can be due to the ventilatory mode and not only due to other respiratory factors, like the severity of the disease. The finding of a similar VT size between the two groups is important, since a large VT during spontaneous breathing may indicate a high inspiratory effort potentially increasing lung injury (9). However, in the presence of lower airway pressures, as in this analysis, even a larger VT size may be acceptable when there are no other signs of increased inspiratory efforts, since it may just represent a more compliant respiratory system (28).LimitationsThe observational retrospective nature of the study should be considered when interpreting the findings. Residual confounding is always a concern despite appropriate modeling and sensitivity analyses. The data was extracted from a single\u2013center which may limit generalizability. Only patients who survived and received invasive ventilation for at least 48 hours were included, aiming to select more severely ill patients and also those who had been exposed to the primary exposure of interest for a sufficient period of time. However, the results cannot be applied to patients who were extubated or died within 48 hours of ICU admission. Total RR was compared with set RR to determine whether patients had spontaneous breathing. Nevertheless, it cannot be ascertained that patients whose total and set rate did not have spontaneous breathing. Also, the exposure assessed was dependent on the patient clinical condition over time, and this should be considered when interpreting the results. In addition, since the dataset used in this study is for clinical purposes and the present analysis is a secondary analysis of these data, we cannot guarantee that plateau pressure and other ventilatory variables were collected under standard conditions. Finally, the observation that patients with no spontaneous breathing were sicker may reflect a systematic bias toward the use of controlled ventilation in patients with higher severity. ConclusionsIn conclusion, in this analysis of a large ICU dataset of high resolution, in critically ill patients surviving and receiving ventilation for at least 48 hours, the amount of spontaneous breathing during this period was not associated with an increased number of ventilator-free days at day 28. This finding was not different for the various subgroups However, the amount of spontaneous breathing was associated with duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors, and the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was higher in \u2018always spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients compared to \u2018never spontaneous breathing\u2019 patients.
