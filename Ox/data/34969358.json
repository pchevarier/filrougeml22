ARDS is often accompanied by diffuse alveolar inflammation or alveolar interstitial edema syndrome, leading to lung infection, pancreatitis, various pathogenic substances in and outside the lung, shock, organ dysfunction syndrome and even death [2]. Due to the susceptibility to pulmonary injury in neonates, causing high mortality in preterm infants [3]. Neonatal ARDS commonly occurs in premature infants, which results from lung immaturity, excessive inflammation and abnormal synthesis of pulmonary surfactant [4]. Prior studies have reported that excessive inflammation participates in the pathogenesis of neonatal ARDS, and basing on the uncontrolled inflammatory response and impaired alveolar-capillary membranes, of high-protein edema fluid in the lung tissues gradually accumulates [5,6]. At present, ARDS treatment is limited to supportive measures and the treatments directly targeting the pathophysiology of ARDS are scarce, which don\u2019t make significant improvement on the mortality rate and poor prognosis [1,7]. Thus, it\u2019s urgent to investigate the pathogenesis relevant to acute lung inflammation in ARDS and develop novel therapeutic targets for treatment of neonatal ARDS.Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), is a member of the lipocalin family [8]. LCN2 plays roles in multiple biological processes, including cell migration and differentiation, defense against certain bacterial infections, induction of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells and transport of fatty acids [9\u201311]. Besides, LCN2 also is a main regulator of mammalian iron metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation [8,12]. It is reported that LCN2 is one of the hub genes in the neutrophil degranulation pathway, and increased neutrophils threshing within minutes after the onset of trauma, leading to the development of ARDS [13]. Sveger et al. revealed that preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) showed high expressions of LCN2, human elastase-\u03b11-antitrypsin complex (HEAT) and free and complexed neutrophil protease 4 (NP4), and RDS severity and the risk of developing chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) may be correlated with LCN2 expression [14]. However, the biological of LCN2 in neonatal ARDS were not still reported.In this study, we aimed to identify the role of LCN2 in neonatal ARDS and we hypothesized that LCN2 silencing protects from ARDS by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by ferroptosis and whether MAPK/ERK pathway is involved in the regulation of LCN2 in ARDS. Materials and methodsAnimalsThis study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Yichang Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital (approval no. DLLSC2021001) and were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Sixty 6-day-old neonatal C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center (Guangdong, China) and housed in an SPF environment on a 12-h light/dark cycle (temperature, 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C; humidity, 55\u201365%), with free access to feed and tap water.Mouse model of neonatal ARDSThe neonatal ARDS mouse model was established as previously described [15]. Sixty mice were randomly divided into five groups, (1) control; (2) LPS (2 mg/kg) only; (3) LPS (2 mg/kg) + sh-NC; (4) LPS (2 mg/kg) + sh-LCN2-1; (5) LPS (2 mg/kg) + sh-LCN2-2. Mice in the LPS-induced group were injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg/kg LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO). Mice in the control group were injected with an equal volume of sterile saline. Mice in the other three groups received injection of sh-NC, sh-LCN2-1 or sh-LCN2-2 per mouse 1\u00a0h after LPS injection through caudal veins, respectively. After treatment of LPS or saline treatment for 48\u00a0h, blood samples were collected from abdominal aorta and all mice were sacrificed via carbon dioxide asphyxiation (flow rate: 30% volume/min) followed by cervical dislocation.Lung wet/dry ratiosLung tissue samples were obtained and weighed immediately after the mice were sacrificed (wet weight), and were then dehydrated in an oven at 60\u00b0C and weighed was after 72\u00a0h (dry weight). The ratio of dry weight to wet weight of the lung was then calculated [16].Histopathological examinationLung tissue were excised, fixed immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. After sectioned into a 4-\u03bcm thickness, the embedded samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and observed under a light microscope (Olympus, Japan).Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)Total RNAs from lung tissues of mice with different treatments were extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The quality of RNA were detected by using NanoDrop 3000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Then, the RNA was transcribe reversely to cDNA by PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara, Japan). PCR reactions were conducted with the SYBR Premix ExTaq kit (Takara Bio, Inc.). The primer sequences for PCR are presented as below: LCN2: 5\u02b9-TGCAGGTGGTACGTTGTGG-3\u02b9 (forward) and 5\u02b9-TGTTGTCGTCCTTGAGGC-3\u02b9 (reverse); GAPDH: 5\u02b9-GGGAAACTGTGGCGTGAT-3\u02b9 (forward) and 5\u02b9-GAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGA-3\u02b9 (reverse). The relative mRNA level was normalized with GAPDH by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method [17].Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)To detect the effects of LCN2 on inflammatory cytokine in mice with ARDS, the levels of serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and MCP-1 were examined by ELISA kits (R&D, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [18]. The color absorbance at 450\u00a0nm was measured by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.Measurement of Fe2+ levelLung tissues from mice were collected and homogenized in 4\u201310 volumes of Iron Assay Buffer using a Dounce homogenizer sitting at 4\u00b0C. Then Fe2+ level in tissue homogenate was measured using kits from Abcam (ab83366) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [19].Cell culture and treatmentHuman bronchial epithelium cell line BEAS-2B was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with or without sh-LCN2/sh-NC for 48\u202fh in the presence or absence of 5\u00a0mmol/l LM22B-10 (the ERK pathway activator; MedChemExpress) or 10\u00a0\u03bcM erastin (a ferroptosis inducer; Abcam) before 10\u00a0ng/ml LPS treatment for another 6\u00a0h [20].Cell transfectionFor the knockdown of LCN2, the specific shRNA targeting LCN2 (sh-LCN2-1/2) and corresponding control shRNA (sh-NC) were synthesized by Gene Pharma (Shanghai, China). These recombinants were transfected into BEAS-2B cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 48\u00a0h transfection, cells were collected for subsequent experiments.Detection of oxidative stress levelsThe activity of MDA, SOD, GSH and CAT in lung tissues and cells was detected by using commercially available assay kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instrument. ROS level in BEAS-2B cells was measured by DCFH-DA staining. Briefly, cells with different treatments were incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM DCFH-DA (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min in darkness. After washing with PBS three times, the fluorescence intensity was detected by a fluorescence microscope at excitation wavelength of 485\u00a0nm and emission wavelength of 520\u00a0nm [21].TUNEL assayCell apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay [22]. Lung tissues or BEAS-2B cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and incubated with proteinase K for 15\u00a0min in 37\u00b0C. Then tissues or cells were placed in 3% H2O2 for 15\u00a0min and treated by TUNEL detection kit. After that, they were co-labeled with DAPI working solution (1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 10\u00a0min. The representative images of fluorescence were obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse80i).Western blot analysisLung tissues were harvested and homogenized while cells were transfected and resuspend. The totle proteins in treated tissues or cells were then extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes. After being blocked with 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against LCN2 (1:1000, ab23477, Abcam), Bcl-2 (1:1000, ab32124, Abcam), Bax (1:1000, ab32503, Abcam), cleaved caspase 3 (1:500, ab32042, Abcam), cleaved caspase 9 (1:1000, ab2324, Abcam), Ferritin Heavy Chain1 (FTH1; 1:500, ab75972, Abcam), Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4;1:1000, ab231174, Abcam), transferrin (Tf; 1:1000, ab277635, Abcam), p-ERK (1:1000, ab201015, Abcam), ERK (1:1000, ab184699, Abcam) and GAPDH (1:3000, ab125247, Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG H&L; 1:2000, ab6789 or ab6721, Abcam) for 2\u00a0h. The antibody-labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The density of the band was determined using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Statistical analysisSPSS 23.0 version software (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8 (San Diego, CA, USA) were used to analyze the data. Significant differences between groups were analyzed by Student t test or one\u2010way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons tests. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). P <\u00a00.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ResultsIn this study, we explored the biological role of LCN2 and the potential mechanism in neonatal mice with ARDS and LDS-induced BEAS-2B cells. The data showed that the silencing of LCN2 ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury, suppressed LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in neonatal mice with ARDS. In addition, LCN2 silencing repressed ferroptosis and the MAPK/ERK pathway in ARDS mice. Moreover, in vitro experiments that interference with LCN2 inhibited the inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis by reducing ferroptosis via the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.LCN2 silence mitigates LPS-induced lung injury in neonatal mice with ARDSTo explore the role of LCN2 in the pathogenesis of ARDS, an in vivo ARDS mouse model was established by treatment with LPS stimulation. As shown in Figure 1(a,b), we found that mRNA and protein level of LCN2 in lung tissues were both significantly increased in LPS-treated mice compared with that in mice in control group. Then we constructed LCN2-siencing shRNA and negative control to knockdown LCN2. As shown in Figure 1(c,d), LCN2 expression in lung tissues of mice was obviously downregulated after transfection with shRNA-LCN2-1/2 and shRNA-LCN2-2 showed the better transfection efficiency. Hence, we chosen shRNA-LCN2-2 for the further study. According to the results of lung wet/dry ratio, LPS treatment remarkably enhanced the ratio of wet/dry while LCN2 depletion reduced it, indicating the alleviation of pulmonary edema by knockdown of LCN2 (Figure 1(e)). In addition, by H&E staining, numerous alveolar sacs, hemorrhage, alveolar wall edema and neutrophil infiltration were observed in the lung tissue of neonatal ARDS mice. Interestingly, LCN2 knockdown effectively counteracted the histological changes (Figure 1(f)).\nFigure 1.Effects of LCN2 depletion on LPS-induced lung damage in neonatal ARDS mice.

However, LCN2 silencing reversed the effects of LPS on inflammation. In addition, the levels of SOD, GSH and CAT were reduced by LPS while MDA level was increased under LPS treatment. Expectedly, the trends were reversed by silencing of LCN2 (Figure 2(b)). Tunel assay was performed to evaluate cell apoptosis and the results showed an increased apoptosis rate in the lung tissue of ARDS mouse, and they could be inhibited by depletion of LCN2 (Figure 2(c,d)). Consistently, data from Western blot revealed that LPS reduced Bcl-2 level and increased the contents of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, but we observed an inverse results in LPS + shRNA-LCN2-2 (Figure 2(e)).\nFigure 2.Effects of LCN2 silencing on inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in neonatal ARDS mice induced by LPS.

As presented in Figure 3(a), relative iron content in tissues was evidently increased in response to LPS, but LCN2 knockdown notably reduced the iron content, compared with the LPS model group. Furthermore, Western blot results demonstrated that the expression levels of FTH1 and GPX4, compared with the control group, was downregulated in lung tissue in mice. sh-LCN2 treatment increased the decreased expressions of FTH1 and GPX4. In contrast, Tf protein level was elevated in LPS-treated mice whereas it was reduced by downregulation of LCN2 (Figure 3(b)).\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 3.Effects of LCN2 knockdown on ferroptosis in LPS-induced neonatal ARDS mouse model.

To investigate the effect of LCN2 on MAPK/ERK pathway, Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Figure 4, LPS prominently activated the phosphorylation of ERK protein while LCN2 silencing reversed the effects of LPS on the activation of ERK pathway. However, the total protein level of ERK was not affected by LPS or LCN2 silencing.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 4.Effects of LCN2 silencing on MAPK/ERK pathway in LPS-induced neonatal ARDS mice.

As illustrated in Figure 5(a), an obvious increase in ROS level was found in LPS-treated cells, but sh-LCN2-2 rehabilitated the level of ROS production. LM22B-10, an activator of ERK pathway, reversed the effects of sh-LCN2-2 on ROS level under LPS exposure. Moreover, LM22B-10 also reduced the levels of FTH1 and GPX4, and increased Tf level compared with the LPS+ sh-LCN2-2 (Figure 5(b)).\nFigure 5.Downregulation of LCN2 suppresses cell ferroptosis by inhibition of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in BEAS-2B cells.

LM22B-10 and erastin (a ferroptosis inducer) were added into LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells transfected with sh-LCN2-2 to observe the effects of ERK signaling and ferroptosis on cell inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6(a), LM22B-10 or erastin dramatically elevated the reduced levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 by LCN2 silencing. Additionally, the activity of SOD, GSH and CAT was inhibited after treatment of LM22B-10 or erastin, but MDA level was promoted, compared with the LPS+sh-LCN2-2 group (Figure 6(b)). The results from Tunel assay revealed that the cell apoptosis rate was significantly increased by LM22B-10 or erastin in LCN2 silenced cells (Figure 6(c,d)). Furthermore, as the Western blot assay showed, as compared with treatment of LPS+sh-LCN2-2, LM22B-10 or erastin resulted in reduced Bcl-2 and increased levels of Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 9 (Figure 6(e)).\nFigure 6.Silencing of LCN2 restrains cell inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells by inactivating MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and diminishing ferroptosis.

DiscussionARDS is a life-threatening syndrome accompanied with high mortality and morbidity worldwide, imposing a heavy medical and economic burden to individuals and society [23]. Premature infants more likely to suffer from ARDS due to pulmonary injury and immaturity of lung structure [24]. In this study, we revealed that LCN2 was associated with ARDS and its silencing protected against lung damage through inhibiting ferroptosis-mediated inflammatory response and oxidative stress via blocking MAPK/ERK pathway.Previous studies have reported that LPS stimulation caused severe histological changes, including infiltration of inflammatory cells, alveolar wall thickening, intra-alveolar exudates and alveolar congestion [25]. In the current study, we constructed an RDS model using 6-day-old neonatal C57BL/6 mice treated with 2 mg/kg LPS. The histological changes in lung tissue, such as inflammatory infiltration, hemorrhage, and alveolar wall edema were observed in LPS-stimulated mice. However, mice that were injected through caudal veins with of LCN2 silencing show a reduced histological damage, which is consistent with previous studies [26,27]. In addition, sh-LCN2 treatment resulted in lower weight ratio of wet and dry lung tissue, suggesting that inhibition of LCN2 has a potential therapeutic effect on LPS-exposed pulmonary damage.A large body of evidence shows that excessive inflammation has a critical role in various lung conditions and may contributes to the occurrence and progression of ARDS [28,29]. LCN2 has been proved to be involve in mammalian inflammatory response in neurocyte, intestinal and so on [30\u201332]. Sunil et al. reported that high LCN2 was associated with nitrogen mustard-induced inflammation and alveolar-epithelial barrier dysfunction [33]. LCN2 is also an oxidative stress marker and has been revealed to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stress [34]. In the present study, LCN2 silencing markedly attenuated the production of inflammatory factors including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and MCP-1 in lung tissues of ARDS mice and LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in tissues and cells were both observed to be suppressed in response to LCN2 depletion. Consistent with our findings, Zeng et al. demonstrated that compared with mice without acute lung injury, the expression of Lipocalin-2 in mice with sepsis was significantly up-regulated [35]. Additionally, Choi et al. revealed that elevated LCN2 levels in skeletal muscle were linked to muscle atrophy-related inflammation and oxidative stress in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice [36].Ferroptosis is correlative to a continuous release of inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), contributing to a series of inflammatory responses [37,38]. Inflammatory cytokines further accelerate ferroptosis and the interaction forms a self-amplifying loop that potentiates organ damage [39]. It is well documented that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in acute lung injury in mice, and pulmonary edema and alveolar inflammation can be exacerbated by ferroptosis inducers, with excessive secretion of cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [40]. In a previous study, mitochondrial shrinkage and rupture of the mitochondrial membrane were shown in ARDS animal model, and they also revealed down-regulated expression of ferritin, iron overload and decreased GSH level in ARDS lung tissues [41]. Thus, the regulation of ferroptosis could be a new therapeutic strategy for alleviating ARDS. Recently, it is found that LCN2 functions as a critical iron regulatory protein during physiological and inflammatory conditions [12]. Shin et al. reported that LCN2 deficiency reduced kainic acid-induced hippocampal iron overload and oxidative stress, indicating that LCN2 may participates in iron-related oxidative stress and neuroinflammation [42]. Besides, Jin et al. demonstrated that LCN2 was robustly induced in the hippocampus following obesity and increased blood-brain barrier leakage and iron accumulation-induced oxidative stress [43]. Our results revealed that downregulated LCN2 reduced iron content and Tf level, while increased the contents of FTH1 and GPX4 in vivo and in vitro, as well as decreased ROS level in BEAS-2B cells. These data suggest the inhibition of LCN2 may protect from inflammation and oxidative stress in ARDS through hindering ferroptosis.It is known that MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is tightly linked to ferroptosis in multiple types of diseases [44]. Lv et al. found that \u03b2-Phenethyl isothiocyanate therapy activated three MAPK (ERK, P38 and JNK) simultaneously, triggering iron death, apoptosis and autophagy in human osteosarcoma cells by inducing oxidative stress in osteosarcoma cells [45]. Wang et al. revealed that HY1702 reduced inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages and symptoms of mild ARDS in mouse models by inhibiting phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK pathway [46]. Moreover, another study showed that LCN2 promoted the invasion of prostate cancer cells, and enhanced SLUG expression through activation of ERK signaling pathway [47]. Consistent with these results, our data revealed that LCN2 silencing inhabited the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling and thereby suppressed ferroptosis-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. It is noteworthy that the phosphorylation level of ERK was changed but the total level of ERK was not affected after treatment of LCN-2, which may be speculates that LCN-2 exerts its role by affecting phosphorylation process of ERK, rather than the process of transcription or translation. In addition, there are some limitations in this study. To confirm that LCN2 regulates LPS-induced ARDS phenotype by ferroptosis, we added erastin to treat LPS-induced cells with transection with sh-LCN2. Meanwhile, it is significant to detect whether LPS-induced ARDS phenotype (in vivo and in vitro) can be rescued by ferroptosis inhibitor, such as GPX4 inhibitors or iron chelators. We will explore this issue in further study. Moreover, we will continue to investigate the enrichment of ferroptosis, apoptosis, inflammation pathways and MAPK/ERK pathway in transcriptome of ARDS tissues induced LPS or transfected with sh-LCN2. ConclusionIn summary, we demonstrate that inhibition of LCN2 alleviates ARDS by interfering with ferroptosis-mediated pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress via inhibiting MAPK/ERK signaling. Our findings may suggest a novel biomarker for ARDS and provide new insights for diagnosis and treatment for patients with ARDS.
