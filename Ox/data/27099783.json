Highly active\nantiretroviral therapy that is used to manage the HIV infection has\nsignificantly reduced mortality among patients with AIDS; however, interruption\nof treatment inevitably results in viral reproduction and increases the viral\ntiter. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is the presence of cells in the\nhuman organism with the transcriptionally silent provirus integrated in their\ngenome. The silent state, which is typical for the latent phase of the viral\ninfection, is characterized by the absence of full-fledged transcription from\nthe viral promoter. However, without treatment, the silent provirus can be\nactivated and cause the development of AIDS [1].\n\nThe hairpin structure located at the 5\u2019-end of the synthesized mRNA and\nknown as TAR (trans-activation response) plays a key role in active\ntranscription from the HIV-1 promoter. Elongation of transcription of the\nintegrated viral genome takes place only when TAR is bound by the viral regulatory\nprotein Tat (trans-activator of transcription)\n[2]. Formation of the TAR-Tat complex ensures\nphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II that is required for the elimination of\ntranscription block and transition into the elongation stage\n[3]. However, Tat protein is not detected in\nthe latently infected cells; hence, the mechanism of transcription activation of\nthe silent integrated provirus upon transition from the latent into the lytic\nphase of the HIV-1 life cycle remains unclear. This is highly relevant to study\nthe proteins partaking in the activation of transcription from the HIV-1\npromoter via the Tatindependent mechanism, since in the long run it could allow\none to understand the mechanism of transition of the virus from the latent to\nthe lytic phase and to develop approaches to regulate this process.\n\nIt has recently been shown that cellular protein HMGA1 can be recruited in the\nregulation of transcription from HIV-1 promoter during the latent phase (basal\ntranscription) [4, 5]. DNA- binding protein Ku, a component of DNA-dependent\nprotein kinase (DNAPK), can also be involved in transcription regulation [6-10].\nIn this review, we summarize the data on the effect of the Ku and HMGA1\nproteins on HIV-1 transcription and present the putative schemes for a possible\ninvolvement of these proteins in the regulation of transcription.\n REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FROM THE HIV-1 PROMOTER\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type I is a member of the genus Lentivirus, part\nof the family Retroviridae. It affects the human immune system and causes the\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Like the genome of other\nlentiviruses, the HIV-1 genome is an RNA molecule, which serves as a template\nfor the synthesis of a DNA copy by viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. The DNA\ncopy is then integrated into the cellular genome forming proviral DNA. However,\nmost of the viral DNA remains non-integrated [11]. This DNA mainly exists in the circular form.\nTranscription can be carried out from the circular viral DNA, but it is the\nintegrated provirus that serves as the main template for synthesizing viral\nproteins [12].\n\nBeing integrated into the chromosome of an infected cell, viral DNA can either\nstay silent or be actively transcribed. In other words, the transcription level\ncan be low thus resulting in a small number of transcripts without rapid\nprogression of the infection and is generally referred to as basal (not\nactivated) transcription. Alternatively, transcription can be active and yield\na large amount of RNA and new viral particles. Regulation of the HIV-1 genome\ntranscription, which precludes the fate of the provirus, depends on a large\nnumber of factors: cis-acting elements of viral DNA, cellular transcription\nfactors, viral trans-activator Tat, and the degree of chromatin condensation.\n\nViral DNA integrated into the cellular genome carries long terminal repeats\n(LTRs) at its ends. Each of them consists of U3, R, and U5 regions\n(Fig. 1).\nTranscription starts at the border between the U3\nand R regions in the 5\u2019-LTR, since the viral promoter recognized by RNA\npolymerase II (RNAP II) and some other regulatory elements are located in the\nU3 region. 5\u2019-LTR contains four functional regions partaking in the\nregulation of the HIV-1 genome transcription: the modulatory region, the\nenhancer, the promoter, and the leader regions\n(Fig. 1)\n[13]. They contain many binding sites for the\ncellular transcription factors, including the ones that play a crucial role in\nthe transcriptional regulation: NF-\u03baB, NFAT, Sp1, and AP-1\n(Fig. 1).\nThese factors are involved in the initiation of transcription\n[1, 13].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 1\nBinding sites of transcription factors in HIV-1 5\u2019-LTR. Schematic\nrepresentation of HIV-1 provirus and the major binding sites of transcription\nfactors. Positions of the 5\u2019-LTR regions are specified: U3 (nucleotides\n1\u2013455), R (456\u2013552), and U5 (553\u2013634). The transcription\ninitiation site is shown with an arrow and corresponds to the border between\nthe U3 and R regions [13].\n\nTransition of the provirus from a silent to an active state starts with the\ntranscription initiation. Short abortive transcripts ~60\u201380 nucleotides\nlong are synthesized [14]; they form a\nstable hairpin called TAR at the 5\u2019-end. Just after the TAR RNA synthesis\nRNAP II stops, since it is associated with the factors that repress elongation:\nNELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF\n(5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole\nsensitivity-inducing factor) [15]. To\ncontinue transcription and proceed to the active elongation stage, the\nC-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II needs to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser2\nresidues in heptapeptide repeats YSPTSPS. Hyperphosphorylation is ensured by\nthe transcription elongation factor P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation\nfactor b), which consists of cyclin- dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) and cyclin T1\n(CycT1). The level of accessible P-TEFb is regulated by its binding to 7SK\nsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK sn- RNP), which inhibits the kinase\nactivity of the P-TEFb factor and impedes transcription elongation [16].\n\nThe viral protein Tat is the key regulator at the elongation stage: it enhances\nefficiency of RNA synthesis by several orders of magnitude\n[2]. Binding of Tat to the synthesized TAR RNA\nfacilitates dissociation of PTEFb from the complex with 7SK snRNP and recruits\nit to the viral promoter. As a result, P-TEFb ensures hyperphosphorylation of\nRNAP II, as well as the NELF and DSIF factors [17].\nPhosphorylation of DSIF converts it to the activating\nelongation factor, while phosphorylated NELF dissociates from the transcription\ncomplex, thus allowing RNAP II to perform effective elongation and synthesize\nfull-size mRNA (Fig. 2)\n[3].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 2\nPossible mechanisms for recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter. A,\nB \u2013 Tat-independent transcription when P-TEFb stimulates basal\ntranscription from the HIV-1 promoter in the absence of Tat. P-TEFb can be\nrecruited by cellular proteins Brd4, SEC (A) or NF-\u03baB,\nSp1 (B). C \u2013 Tat-dependent\ntranscription. Tat is bound to TAR RNA, thus facilitating the release of P-TEFb\nfrom 7SK nsRNP and its recruitment to the paused elongation complex [14].\n\nHowever, Tat is not detected in cells at the latent stage of infection. Neither\nis it found when the provirus starts exiting from dormancy. In some cases, the\nTAR\u2013 Tat\u2013P-TEFb complex cannot be formed due to mutations\ndisrupting the interplay between its components [18].\nNevertheless, transcription from the HIV-1 promoter may\nstill occur. Several mechanisms of Tat-independent activation of transcription\nare known. First, it has been assumed that P-TEFb can perform phosphorylation\nof the CTD RNAP II required for transcription elongation in the absence of Tat\n[19]. Some cellular factors (Sp1\n[20], SEC [14],\nBrd4 [21, 22],\nand NF-\u03baB [14]) probably participate in the\nrecruitment of P-TEFb to the viral promoter\n(Fig. 2A,B). Alternatively,\na cellular protein different from P-TEFb but capable of the phosphorylation of CTD\nRNAP II (as well as the NELF and DSIF repressive factors) may bind to the HIV-1 promoter.\n\nAlthough a significant amount of data on the regulation of HIV-1 transcription\nand involvement of various cellular factors in it has been accumulated, many\naspects have not been completely elucidated yet. In particular, the role of two\ncellular proteins involved in HIV-1 transcription (Ku and HMGA1) remains\nunclear. Some available data attest to the positive role of these proteins in\nthe regulation of transcription, while other studies demonstrate that their\nrole is negative. Nevertheless, the accurate mechanisms of involvement of these\nproteins in HIV-1 transcription are still to be determined.\n ROLE OF KU PROTEIN IN HIV-1 TRANSCRIPTION\nHuman Ku protein is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits with masses of ~70\nand 80 kDa, which are known as Ku70 (p70) and Ku80 (Ku86, p80). These proteins\nare encoded by the xrcc6 (Ku70) and xrcc5\n(Ku80) genes. Ku protein mainly functions in the cell in the form of a\nvery stable heterodimer [23]. However,\nsome research demonstrates that isolated Ku70 and Ku80 subunits can be involved\nin certain processes [24].\n\nThe Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is a DNA-binding protein that mostly interacts with\nthe free ends of doublestranded DNA, and its biological function is mainly\nrelated to this feature. The interaction between the Ku heterodimer and DNA is\nrather strong: the Kd value varies within a range of\n1.5\u20134.0 \u00d7 10-10 M [25].\nAccording to X-ray data [26], Ku70 and\nKu80 within a heterodimer form an asymmetric\nring with a wide base and a thin bridge; the resulting channel is big enough to\nencircle DNA (Fig. 3).\nThe channel predominantly consists of\npositively charged amino acid residues that interact with the negatively\ncharged sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule, which explains why Ku can\nbind DNA in a sequence-independent manner. After binding to the DNA end, Ku can\nmigrate (slide) along DNA and pause at certain sequences\n[25, 27].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 3\nStructure of the Ku heterodimer in a complex with DNA according to\n[26]. DNA\n(shown in black) resides in the channel formed by Ku70 (shown in yellow) and\nKu80 (shown in brown). PDBID 1JEY\n\nThe most well-known and the best studied biological function of Ku is its\ninvolvement in double-strand DNA break repair by nonhomologous end joining\n(NHEJ). Ku also participates in such cellular processes as V(D)\nJ-recombination, mobile element-induced genomic rearrangement, telomere length\nmaintenance, apoptosis, and transcription [28, 29]. One key\nfunction of Ku is binding to the DNA-PKcs catalytic subunit to form\nDNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PK. It is worth mentioning that the catalytic\nfunction of DNA-PK is activated after its binding to DNA, which is provided by\nthe Ku heterodimer [25].\n\nThe possible mechanisms of Kumediated regulation of transcription\n\nParticipation in transcriptional regulation is one of the numerous functions of\nKu. Several mechanisms of transcriptional activation or suppression by Ku have\nbeen described. The first mechanism is a direct sequence- specific interaction\nbetween Ku and the promoter region of genes. It has been hypothesized that\ntranscription of the cellular genes c-Myc, Hsp70\n[30], U1 snRNA\n[31], as well as retroviruses HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotropic\nvirus) [32] and MMTV (mouse mammary\ntumor virus) [33], is regulated via this\nmechanism. The mechanism of Ku binding to the promoter region that does not\ninvolve interactions with DNA ends is yet unclear; however, there is data\nattesting to a possible sequence-specific interaction between the heterodimer\nand a certain Ku-binding motif in DNA [34].\n\nA sequence whose binding to Ku is considered to be truly sequence-specific and\nmore preferable compared to Ku binding to DNA ends has been identified in the\nNRE-1 region (negative regulatory element 1) in the LTR of MMTV retrovirus\n(Fig. 4)\n[34]. The\ninteraction between Ku and this sequence reduces the efficiency of\ntranscription from viral LTR. The catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs is believed to be\ninvolved in this regulation [33, 35].\nIt has been demonstrated that GR\n(glucocorticoid receptor) [34] and Oct-1\n[36], the two transcription factors\nbinding to 5\u2019-LTR MMTV and activating its transcription, can be\nin vitro phosphorylated by DNAPK. Specific recruitment of\nDNA-PK to the promoter and subsequent phosphorylation of transcription factors\nis probably one of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 4\nPutative Ku-binding sites in gene promoters. Ku-binding sites homologous to the\nNRE-1 sequence in the LTR of the GR strain of MMTV. Direct repeat is shown in\ncolor. Mismatches are denoted by lowercase letters [34].\n\nAll the Ku-binding sites in promoters homologous to the NRE-1 sequence in the\npromoter of the GR strain of MMTV and known up to the publication date are\nreported in [34]\n(Fig. 4). Only\nthese sequences were shown to be capable of direct and\nspecific interaction with the Ku heterodimer in the absence of free DNA ends.\n\nThe second mechanism via which Ku affects the transcription is\nits direct interaction with transcription factors, including Oct-1, Oct-2\n[36], NF45/NF90 [37], AP-1 [38], Ese-1\n[39], YY1 [40], and p53 [41]. Some\nof these factors are involved in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription. In\naddition, as mentioned above, some transcription factors can act as a DNA-PK\nsubstrate in vitro. The ability of DNA-PK to interact both\nwith transcription factors and a number of nuclear receptors (AR [42], GR [34], PR [43], and\nER-\u03b1 [44]) probably suggests that\nthere is a shared mechanism via which Ku participates in cell signaling and\ntranscription regulation.\n\nKu can indirectly regulate gene transcription by influencing the expression of\nother transcription factors. Thus, in the AGS cell line, Ku positively\nregulates the expression of the gene of the NF-\u03baB p50 subunit [45]. Ku80 also stimulates the expression of\nthe c-jun gene, the AP-1 transcription factor component [38]. It should be mentioned that NF-\u03baB\nand AP-1 are the key regulators of the transcription of HIV-1 genes.\n\nThe Ku70 and Ku80 subunits may have a different effect on transcription. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the subunits of the Ku heterodimer dynamically bind to\nthe promoter of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene and interact with the NF45/NF90\nfactor in response to T-cell activation [37]. This activation increases the amount of the Ku80/NF90\ncomplex bound to the antigen receptor response element (ARRE) sequence in the\nIL-2 gene promoter, while the amount of the Ku70 subunit bound\nto this region decreases [37]. In\nanother work [30], the repressive role\nof Ku in the transcription of the Hsp70 gene was attributed to\nthe Ku70 subunit rather than to Ku80.\n\nThe third mechanism of transcriptional regulation is the\ndirect interaction between Ku heterodimer or its Ku80 subunit and RNAP II\nholoenzyme. Ku80 was found to be colocalized with the elongational form of RNAP\nII and transcription factors specific for the elongation stage (in particular,\nDSIF) in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of Ku80 was also found to play a\nkey role in the interplay with these proteins [48]. Let us mention that DNA-PK can phosphorylate RNAP II\nin vitro [49]; however,\nthe role of this phosphorylation in transcriptional regulation still needs to\nbe ascertained.\n\nThe fourth mechanism of Ku involvement in transcriptional\nregulation is related to its role in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks\n[50]. Double-strand breaks need to be\nintroduced by DNA topoisomerase II\u03b2 to successfully initiate transcription\nfrom a number of promoters regulated by binding to AP-1 and nuclear receptors\n(including those interacting with Ku). In this case, the break repair and local\nalterations in the chromatin structure occur in the presence of the complex of\nthe proteins PARP-1 (poly[adenosinediphosphate\n(ADP)\u2013ribose]polymerase-1), DNA-PKcs, and Ku70/ Ku80.\n\nHence, the isolated heterodimer subunits, the heterodimer as a whole, or its\ncomplex with the DNAPKcs catalytic subunit can be involved in the regulation of\ntranscription. No common mechanism of action of Ku has been revealed. It is\nmost likely that there is a specific mechanism of Ku-dependent regulation for\neach particular gene. It should be mentioned once again that Ku may act both as\nan activator and as a suppressor; its effect usually depends on subunits, which\nare involved in the regulation. It seems that the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK\nis not necessarily involved in the Ku-dependent regulation of transcription;\nhowever, in certain cases its capability of DNA-dependent phosphorylation of\ntranscription factors and RNAP II can be the key element of regulation.\n\nRole of Ku in HIV-1 transcription\n\nThe significance of Ku for maintaining the HIV-1 life cycle has been\ndemonstrated in numerous studies. The Ku70 subunit is a part of the\npre-integration complex and interacts with HIV-1 integrase [51, 52]. The Ku80 subunit was detected within the virion [53], where it can be incorporated at the stage\nwhen a new viral particle is formed in a previously infected cell. Repair of\nsingle- strand breaks formed when viral DNA is integrated into the cellular\ngenome is required for successful integration of viral cDNA into the host cell\ngenome. It is believed that proteins from the NHEJ system, and the Ku70/Ku80\nheterodimer in particular, can be involved in this process [54]. Thus, lentiviral vector transduction\nefficiency is significantly decreased in cells defective in Ku80, DNA-PKcs,\nXrcc4 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4), and DNA ligase IV [55, 56]. Ku is also involved in the formation of the circular form\nof viral DNA from non-integrated linear DNA [57-59].\n\nInvolvement of Ku in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 was first reported\nin the early 2000s. However, the role of Ku in this regulation is still to be\nclarified. Data attesting both to the positive and negative effects of Ku on\ntranscription of the HIV-1 genome have been obtained.\n\nThe role of Ku in transcription from viral 5\u2019-LTR was first studied using\nthe xrs-6 cell line, a variant of CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary) cells lacking\nKu80 gene expression. These cells supported enhanced\nexpression from the plasmid carrying the CAT (chloroamphenicol\nacetyltransferase) gene under the control of the viral promoter from\n5\u2019-LTR [6]. Stable transfection of\nxrs-6 cells with the vector carrying the human Ku80 gene\nreduced CAT expression. Hence, Ku80 has a negative effect on transcription from\nthe HIV-1 5\u2019-LTR promoter. The negative role of Ku80 has been confirmed\nusing a human U1 cell line whose genome contained the integrated provirus; this\ncell line is used as a model of the latent state of HIV-1. It turned out that a\ndecreased amount of endogenous Ku80 in the cells increases the level of\ntranscription of the HIV-1 genes, both for basal and TNF\u03b1-induced\ntranscription.\n\nTaking into account that Ku has a negative effect on transcription from other\nretroviral promoters (MMTV, HTLV-1) [32,\n33], L. Jeanson and J.F. Mouscadet\n[6] searched for the Ku-binding site in\nthe HIV-1 LTR and detected a motif (-217/-197) in the NRE-1 region that was\nrather similar to the Ku-binding site in MMTV NRE-1\n(Fig. 5)\n[6]. Several variants of Ku-mediated\nrepression of HIV-1 transcription were proposed. Considering the fact that Ku\ncan bind to the Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors\n[36], which repress both the basal and\nTat-activated transcription of HIV-1, it was hypothesized that binding of Ku in the\nmodulatory region\n(Fig. 5A)\nfacilitates recruitment of these factors to the HIV-1 promoter\n[6]. It is\nalso possible that Ku can be involved in the regulation of the chromatin\nstructure. NRE-1 contains a nuclear matrix binding site\n[60] overlapping with the predicted Ku-binding site. The\ninterplay between Ku and the nuclear matrix in this region presumably impedes\nNF-\u03baB-activated transcription.\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 5\nScheme of the HIV-1 genome and position of the Ku-binding site in 5\u2019-LTR.\nA \u2013 positions of the 5\u2019-LTR regions are specified:\nU3 (nucleotides 1\u2013455), R (456\u2013552), and U5 (553\u2013638)\n(counting from the beginning of the genome).

B \u2013\nalignment between the putative Ku-binding sites in the NRE-1 region of HIV-1\nand MMTV, as well as some other sequences similar to MMTV NRE-1 [6].\n\nIn their next study [7], this group of\nauthors reported that Ku80 negatively influences transcription from retroviral\nvectors. It turned out that regardless of the promoter used in the lentiviral\nsystem, transcription was more active in the absence of Ku80. In other words,\nthe effect of Ku80 on retroviral vector expression was found to be not\nsequence-specific; hence, the Ku-binding site suggested in [6] could not completely explain the mechanism\nof negative transcriptional regulation. It has also been reported that Ku80 has\nno effect on the efficiency of transduction and integration of lentiviral\nvectors. Meanwhile, no Ku-dependent regulation was observed when plasmid\nvectors carrying the same promoters were used as a template instead of the\npseudotyped virus [7]. Ku80 is believed\nto guide integration of lentiviral vectors into transcriptionally inactive\nregions instead of directly influencing transcription.\n\nAs opposed to the aforementioned findings, Ku plays a positive role in the\nregulation of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in human MAGI and CEM-T4\ncell lines [8].\nFurthermore, insertion of siRNAs targeting Ku80 reduced the\nefficiency of integration of the viral genome into the infected cell DNA and\ndisrupted Tat- TAR trans-activation.\n\nThe positive influence of the Ku heterodimer on transcription of the HIV-1\ngenome was also mentioned in [9], where\nwild-type HCT 116 human cells and their Ku80+/-\nvariant, which were transduced with HIV-1- based lentiviral vectors, were used.\nIt has been preliminarily shown that in the HCT 116\nKu80+/- cells with a twofold reduced level of Ku80\nthe level of Ku70 is equally lowered. It turned out that a twofold decrease in\nthe amount of endogenous Ku in cells reduces the efficiency of viral\ntranscription. It should be mentioned that, as opposed to data [7], this effect was specific for viral LTR,\nsince changes in the Ku heterodimer level had no effect on transcription from\nother promoters. Moreover, viral proteins were not involved in Ku-mediated\ntranscriptional regulation and the influence of Ku was independent of\nTat-trans-activation. The effect of Ku on transcription was also noticeable in\nthe presence of Tat; however, its effect was most significant at the basal\nlevel of transcription from the nonactivated provirus, when Tat is not detected\nin the cell. Interestingly, Ku influences the basal HIV-1 transcription only at\nthe initial stage after integration of the viral genome and reduction of the Ku\nlevel in cells contributes to the emergence and maintenance of viral latency.\n\nIt is known that Ku80 is incorporated into the virion during its assembly\n[53]. Hence, both endogenous Ku80 and\nKu80 from the virion can influence provirus transcription in the infected cell.\nIn order to eliminate the effect of the latter, the lentivirus was harvested in\nthe cell line with a decreased level of Ku heterodimer [9]. It turned out that it is endogenous Ku that affects\ntranscription in the target cell.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the involvement of the previously predicted\nKu-binding site in HIV-1 LTR in Ku-mediated regulation of the provirus\ntranscription was also refuted in [9].\nReplacement of this site with a random sequence had no effect on Ku-dependent\ntranscriptional regulation.\n\nAnother important aspect of this study is that Ku does not affect transcription\nfrom the circular forms of viral DNA. Taking into account that, according to\n[7], Ku had no effect on transcription\nfrom the HIV-1 promoter within a plasmid vector, it can be concluded that Ku\nstimulates transcription only from the provirus integrated into the genome.\n\nWe would like to draw special attention to study [10] by S. Tyagi et al. who investigated the\npossible involvement of both the Ku70/Ku80 and the entire DNA-dependent protein\nkinase DNA-PK in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1. Experiments were\ncarried out using Jurkat-E4 cells whose DNA carried the integrated HIV-1\ngenome. Thus, this cell line was used as a model of T cells in the latency\nperiod of infection. DNA-PK was found on the HIV-1 promoter, and its location\ncorrelates with that of RNAP II. It was also determined that transcription\nactivation significantly increases the DNA-PK and RNAP II levels not only on\nthe promoter, but also on the transcribed region of the genome.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated [10] that\nDNA-PK can phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNAP II. Furthermore,\nin vitro experiments showed that DNA-PK predominantly phosphorylates\nSer2 rather than Ser5 or Ser7 in the heptapeptide repeats YSPTSPS. Considering\nthe fact that phosphorylation of Ser2 is required to activate elongation, it\nhas been hypothesized that involvement of DNA-PK can be important, mostly at\nthe elongation phase of transcription. DNA-PK presumably directly interacts\nwith RNAP II at the HIV-1 promoter, and DNA-PK can act as a factor\nphosphorylating polymerase and eliminating elongation block. At any rate,\nparallel distribution of DNA-PK and RNAP II along the provirus and their\nsimultaneous recruitment in response to transcription activation allow one to\nsuggest that DNA-PK (and Ku as its component) is an element of a large\ntranscriptional complex that is involved in HIV-1 gene expression.\n\nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that DNAPK has a positive effect on\ntranscription from HIV-1 5\u2019-LTR and lentiviral vectors [10]. Knockdown of the catalytic subunit\nDNA-PKcs in Jurkat cells significantly reduces expression of LTR-regulated\ngenes and has a minor effect on expression from another promoter (CMV). Hence,\nknockdown of both DNA-PKcs [10] and Ku80\n[9] reduces the level of transcription\nfrom the LTR promoter.\n\nSummarizing the role of the Ku protein in the regulation of HIV-1\ntranscription, it should be mentioned that the currently available data are\nrather controversial. The possible reason is that different cell lines and\ndifferent viral systems were used. Thus, most data attesting to negative\nregulation have been obtained using rodent cells, which obviously cannot be an\nadequate model for processes occurring in HIV-1-infected human cells.\nNevertheless, the data obtained using human cells provide ground for drawing\nsome reliable conclusions.\n\nThe first general conclusion is that Ku-mediated regulation of transcription\ndepends on viral LTR. The regulation mechanism remains unclear, but one should\nnot rule out the possibility of direct binding of the heterodimer to LTR,\nalthough the putative Ku-binding site within LTR probably is not the key\nelement in Kudependent regulation of HIV-1 transcription, as opposed to MMTV\nand HTLV-1.\n\nSecond, the integrated provirus is crucial for Kumediated transcriptional\nregulation of HIV-1 and HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors. Although HIV-1\ntranscription can occur from circular DNA, it is clear that Ku is not involved\nin its regulation. This can be explained by the fact that the heterodimer is\nrecruited to the provirus either during integration or immediately after it.\n\nLet us mention once again that there remain many questions concerning the\nmechanism of involvement of Ku in the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1. Even\nif the incorporation of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer or the entire DNA-PK into the\ntranscription complex is considered to be an established fact, the mechanism\nthrough which they influence HIV-1 gene expression has not been elucidated yet\nand it is important to clarify their role in HIV-1 transcription.\n\nRole of HMGA1 in HIV-1 transcription\n\nHMGA1 (high-mobility group protein A1, previously known as HMG I[Y]), the\nDNA-binding non-histone chromatin protein, is another cellular protein whose\nrole in the HIV-1 life cycle has not been studied sufficiently. HMGA1 carries\nthree DNA-binding motifs that preferentially bind to the DNA minor groove in\nATrich regions (A/T hook) [61]. However,\nHMGA1 is more likely to recognize the spatial structure of DNA than the\nnucleotide sequence: it prefers to interact with bent and supercoiled DNA, with\nDNA that has a structure different from the classical B-form. The free protein\nhas an unordered spatial structure. When interacting with DNA, it undergoes\nconformational changes, thus facilitating ATP-independent DNA unwinding,\nsupercoiling, and bending [62, 63]. This ability to change the chromatin\nstructure determines the broad range of functions performed by HMGA1 in the\ncell nucleus.\n\nActually, all the high-mobility group proteins are capable of binding both DNA\nand proteins, which allows them to get involved in a large number of processes\n[64]. Alteration in the chromatin\nstructure induced by HMGA binding either stimulates or represses such\nDNA-dependent processes as transcription, replication, and DNA-repair. HMGA1 is\nconsidered to be an architectural transcription factor, and this emphasizes its\nrole in the organization of multiprotein complexes bound to the promoter\n[62-64].\nThe ability of HMGA1 to interact with core histones and displace the linker\nhistone H1 from DNA results in chromatin reorganization and exposure of\ntranscription factor binding sites\n(Fig. 6). HMGA1\nplays a crucial role in the regulation of enhanceosome assembly or disassembly, thus\naffecting transcription. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that HMGA1\ndirectly interacts with other chromatin-re-modeling proteins and transcription\nfactors (Sp1, TFIID, NF-\u03baB, ATF-2, SRF, Oct2, and c-Rel)\n[62, 63].\nThe ability of HMGA1 to bend DNA upon binding probably facilitates spatial proximity\nof the enhancer and promoter regions of the genes.\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 6\nThe putative model of HMGA1-mediated activation of transcription.

Binding of CRC to chromatin increases\nwhen it interacts with HMGA1. C \u2013 release of DNA for\nbinding to transcription factors. D \u2013 initiation of\ntranscription: HMGA1 can interact with transcription factors (TFs) by\nrecruiting them to the promoter [62].\n\nInvolvement of HMGA1 in the life cycle of HIV-1 has been demonstrated in many\nstudies. This protein was detected within the pre-integration complex\n[65]. HMGA1 was found to stimulate the\nintegration of HIV-1 DNA into the cellular genome [66, 67]. It is assumed\nthat HMGA1 binds to and bends viral DNA, pulling the ends together and\nfacilitating their binding to integrase. Meanwhile, no direct interaction\nbetween HMGA1 and HIV-1 integrase has been observed. However, other authors\nhave been critical of the idea that HMGA1 is involved in retroviral\nintegration, since the absence of HMGA1 in infected cells had no effect on the\nintegration of the viral genome [68].\n\nSome rather ambiguous evidence in support of the involvement of HMGA1 in HIV-1\ntranscription has been obtained to date.\n\nPutative HMGA1 binding sites have been detected by DNase I footprinting in the\n-187/+230 region within HIV-1 LTR (R1\u2013R5\nin Fig. 7)\n[69]. The interplay between HMGA1 and\nthe transcription factor AP-1 has also been studied: they were found to share a\nbinding site (R5\nin Fig. 7).\nThis site resides at the border\nof the repressive nucleosome nuc-1, which exists in the provirus near the\ntranscription initiation site in the latent phase and degrades after\ntranscription of the viral genome is activated\n(Fig. 7). HMGA1\nwas found to facilitate binding of AP-1, an important inducible HIV- 1\ntranscription activator, to viral DNA in response to external stimuli\nactivating viral expression. HMGA1 is possibly involved in the reorganization\nof nuc-1 by competing for this site and making it free for AP-1. Hence, it has\nbeen suggested that HMGA1 can positively regulate HIV-1 transcription\n[69].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 7\nPositions of the predicted HMGA1 binding sites at HIV-1 5\u2019-LTR. Positions\nof the 5\u2019-LTR regions are specified: U3 (nucleotides 1\u2013455), R\n(456\u2013552), and U5 (553\u2013634). Nucleotides are counted from the\nbeginning of the genome. The major regulatory regions of 5\u2019-LTR are\nshown. +1 \u2013 counting from the transcription initiation site denoted by an\narrow. HMGA1 binding sites determined in [69] are shown. The positions of nucleosomes on the HIV-1\npromoter are shown below; three sites of binding to the AP-1 transcription\nfactor are specified.\n\nThe role of HMGA1 as an architectural transcription factor involved in the\nreorganization of nucleosome nuc-1 has been confirmed\n[70]. HMGA1 was found to facilitate binding\nof the ATF-3 subunit of the transcription factor AP-1 to site R3 at the border of\nnuc-1 in response to induction of viral transcription by PMA (phorbol myristate acetate\n\u2013 NF-\u03baB activator)\n(Fig. 7).\nThis makes it possible to recruit the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex\nSWI/SNF to the repressive nucleosome: a process required for efficient activation\nof viral transcription.\n\nAnother possible mechanism via which HMGA1 can be involved in transcription\nregulation has recently been proposed [71].\nIt turns out that HMGA1 binds to loop 2 of RNA in 7SK\nsnNRP (7SK L2 RNA). As mentioned above, the key function of 7SK RNA is to\nregulate the level of the free P-TEFb factor activating transcription\nelongation [17]. This factor interacts\nwith loop 1 and the HEXIM1 protein within 7SK snRNP. As a result, the HMGA1\ncomplex with 7SK snRNP and P-TEFb can be formed. The role of this complex in\ntranscription regulation can be a dual one\n(Fig. 8)\n[72]. First, HMGA1 can bind directly to DNA or\na transcription factor located on the promoter region and recruit P-TEFb to the\npaused RNAP II elongation complex\n(Fig. 8A). Secondly,\nbinding of 7SK to HMGA1 regulates the amount of free HMGA1 that can interact\nwith DNA and functions in various processes\n(Fig. 8B).\nThe mechanism is believed to depend on the nature of the particular gene.\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 8\nMechanism of transcriptional regulation by the HMGA1\u20137SK\u2013P-TEFb\ncomplex. A \u2013 HMGA1 can recruit P-TEFb/ 7SK snRNP complex\nto the paused transcription complex by interacting with DNA or a certain\ntranscription factor. B \u2013 the level of free HMGA1 in the nucleus is\nregulated by its binding to 7SK snRNP. Dissociation of HMGA1 from its complex\nwith 7SK snRNP can be caused by a factor that has not been identified yet\n[4, 72].\n\nIn the case of HIV-1 transcription regulation, Sp1 can be a factor that\ninteracts with HMGA1 and, thus, is recruited to the elongation complex. On one\nhand, this factor is known to be involved in HIV-1 transcription\n[1, 13],\nwhile on the other hand it directly interacts with HMGA1 [62].\nHence, upon transcription from HIV-1 LTR, HMGA1 may be involved in P-TEFb-dependent\nactivation of elongation via the scheme shown in\nFig. 8A\n[72] and, therefore, have a stimulating effect.\n\nAnother mechanism via which HMGA1 influences HIV-1 transcription was uncovered\nwhile studying the expression of a reporter gene under the control of viral\n5\u2019-LTR from a plasmid [4]. In this\ncase, HMGA1 had a repressive effect. A detailed study of the mechanism of HMGA1\naction has shown that it can bind to TAR RNA due to the similarity between its\nstructure and 7SK L2 RNA\n(Fig. 9);\nHMGA1 may compete with\nviral protein Tat for binding to TAR RNA. This results in a negative effect of\nHMGA1 on HIV-1 transcription both in the presence and absence of Tat. The\ninfluence of overexpression and knockdown of the HMGA1 gene\nand 7SK L2 RNA on transcription from the HIV-1 promoter was studied in the\npresence and absence of Tat. HMGA1 was found to reduce both the basal and\nTat-activated transcription from the HIV-1 promoter, which is partially\nrecovered upon 7SK L2 RNA overexpression. Based on this experiment, the model\nof HMGA1- mediated repression has been proposed\n(Fig. 10)\n[4]. According to this model, HMGA1\nimpedes binding of TAR RNA with Tat, or, in the absence of Tat, with a cellular\ncofactor of viral transcription that has not been described yet. 7SK L2 RNA\ncompetes with TAR for HMGA1, destroys their complex, and takes away the HMGA1\nprotein from the HIV-1 promoter. This facilitates transcription activation.\nHowever, the existence and nature of the putative cellular cofactor involved in\nthis process still remains open.\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 9\nStructures of the 7SK L2 and TAR RNA regions interacting with HMGA1. The HMGA1\nbinding site in both RNAs is shown in green. The TAR region responsible for the\ninteraction with Tat and CycT1 is shown in gray [4].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 10\nModel of HMGA-1-mediated repression of HIV-1 transcription. A\n\u2013 competition between HMGA1 and Tat for TAR reduces the activity\nof the viral promoter. Tat releases 7SK from its complex with P-TEFb bound to\nthe promoter. 7SK binds to HMGA1 to release TAR for subsequent interaction with\nTat-P-TEFb. B \u2013 in the absence of Tat, HMGA1 impedes\nbinding of a certain cellular cofactor, which is required for TAR-mediated\nHIV-1 transcription, to TAR RNA. 7SK binds to HMGA1, thus releasing TAR for\nsubsequent interaction with this cofactor [4].\n\nA different model of the repressive effect of HMGA1 on transcription from the\nHIV-1 promoter has also been proposed [5]. Factors associated with chromatin reorganization play a\ncrucial role in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription; the CTIP2 protein is\namong these factors. The presence of CTIP2 at the promoter represses\ntranscription of the integrated HIV-1 genome and is typical for the latent\nstate of the virus. CTIP2 recruits histone deacetylases and histone\nmethyltransferases, thus being involved in chromatin condensation [73]. In addition, CTIP2 interacts with the Sp1\nand COUP-TF factors by repressing the initial stages of HIV-1 transcription\n[74] and is involved in delocalization\nof Tat and its binding to heterochromatin-associated protein HP1 [75]. CTIP2 has recently been shown to interact\nwith 7SK snRNP by binding to loop L2 and the HEXIM1 protein. Within this\ncomplex, CTIP2 participates 7SK-L2 HIV-1\nTAR Fig. 9\nStructures of the 7SK L2\nand TAR RNA regions interacting with HMGA1. The HMGA1 binding site in both RNAs\nis shown in green. The TAR region responsible for the interaction with Tat and\nCycT1 is shown in gray [4]. in the\nrepression of Cdk9 kinase that is a component of P-TEFb [76].\nIt has been discovered that HMGA1 can bind to CTIP2\n[5]. Moreover, transcription of a number\nof cellular genes is negatively regulated by both proteins; some of these genes\nare transcribed via the P-TEFb/7SK-dependent mechanism [5].\nA model of joint transcriptional regulation of these genes\nby the HMGA1 and CTIP2 proteins has been proposed. It is assumed that HMGA1 can\nrecruit either CTIP2 or the CTIP2/P-TEFb/7SK snRNP complex to the promoters of\nregulated genes\n(Fig. 11)\n[5].\nOpen in a separate windowFig. 11\nThe model of cooperative transcription regulation by HMGA1 and CTIP2. The\nCTIP2-repressed 7SK/P-TEFb complex is recruited to the promoter through 7SK L2\nbound HMGA1 via its interaction with DNA, or with a transcription factor\nresiding in the promoter region [5].\n\nIt has been demonstrated that when interacting with the HIV-1 promoter, HMGA1\nand CTIP2 synergistically repress basal transcription [5].\nKnockdown of the HMGA1 gene significantly\nreduces the levels of CTIP2 and P-TEFb/7SK snRNP recruited to the viral\npromoter and consequently recovers the level of transcription from it. Hence,\nit is assumed that a mechanism of HMGA1-mediated negative transcriptional\nregulation similar to that shown\nin Fig. 11 may\nbe realized on the viral LTR. Nevertheless, in the case of HIV-1 it remains\nunclear which DNA region or the LTR-bound factor is involved in recruitment of\nthe HMGA1/CTIP2/7SK snRNP complex. The role of HMGA1 binding to TAR in the\nHMGA1/CTIP2-mediated repression of basal transcription is also unclear. Neither\nhas it been studied whether HMGA1 has a direct effect on the binding of CTIP2\nto viral DNA, similar to what happens with the transcription activator AP-1\n[69].\n\nHence, HMGA1 can both activate and repress HIV- 1 transcription. Its positive\neffect was seen in induced transcription, while a negative influence was shown\nfor basal transcription. Possibly, some external factors trigger the switch of\nprotein partners of HMGA1 and subsequent alteration in the mechanism of HMGA1-\nmediated transcriptional regulation.\n CONCLUSIONS\nAlthough the features of HIV-1 transcription have been extensively studied,\nmany aspects still have not been fully elucidated. It is well known that\nelongation of transcription of the viral genome takes place after the viral\nregulatory protein Tat binds to TAR RNA, which interacts with the multiprotein\ntranscription elongation factor P-TEFb for its recruitment to the viral\npromoter. Cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk9 within P-TEFb performs phosphorylation\nof RNAP II that is required for elongation. However, a question arises: how is\nthe transcription of the latent provirus activated in the absence of Tat\nprotein? It was assumed that the phosphorylation of RNAP II, which is required\nfor eliminating transcription block and transition to the elongation stage, can\nbe activated by cellular factors. Some cellular factors may recruit P-TEFb to\nthe promoter.\n\nRegulation of HIV-1 transcription is a process that involves many cellular\nproteins; however, the role of some of them is not fully clear. Two cellular\nproteins described in this review, Ku and HMGA1, are among these \u201cunclear\nfactors.\u201d Data attesting to both the stimulative and repressive effects\nof these proteins on the expression of HIV-1 genes has been obtained. Their\nrole is often particularly prominent upon basal transcription.\n\nThe majority of studies performed on human cells demonstrate that the Ku\nheterodimer activates transcription from the HIV-1 promoter. The importance of\nthe DNA-PK catalytic subunit for the activation of transcription has been\nreported in a number of studies. A hypothesis has been put forward that DNA-PK\nis involved in the transcription elongation stage [10]. Let us mention that the ability of DNA-PK to\nphosphorylate RNAP II makes this kinase a promising candidate for a protein\nfactor that activates elongation of transcription of viral genes in the absence\nof Tat.\n\nThe architectural factor HMGA1 may influence the chromatin composition upon\nHIV-1 transcription regulation. In this case, HMGA1 has a positive effect. On\nthe other hand, the interplay between HMGA1 and TAR demonstrated in\nvitro seems to suppress the basal transcription of the HIV-1 genes and\nis important for maintaining latency [4].\nRecruitment of a repressive transcription factor within 7SK snRNP, which HMGA1\ncan bind to, may be another mechanism of HMGA1-mediated suppression of\ntranscription. There probably is no single mechanism for the involvement of\nHMGA1 in the regulation of HIV-1 genes transcription; the role of this protein\ndepends on the phase of infection and activity of other cellular proteins.\nElucidation of the mechanisms of the influence of Ku and HMGA1 on HIV-1\ntranscription may result in new approaches for the regulation of the\nreplication of this dangerous virus.\n Acknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant \u2116\n14-24-00061).\n GlossaryAbbreviationsHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus type IAIDSacquired immune deficiency syndromeTARtrans-activation response elementTattrans-activator of transcriptionHMGA1high-mobility group protein A1DNA-RKDNA-dependent protein kinaseDNA-PKcsDNA-PK catalytic subunitLTRlong terminal repeatRNAP IIDNA-dependent RNA polymerase IICTD RNAP IIC-terminal domain of RNAP IIP-TEFbpositive transcription elongation factor bHTLV-1human T-lymphotropic virusMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusNRE-1negative regulatory element 1TFtranscription factor References1. van Lint C., Bouchat S., Marcello A..
