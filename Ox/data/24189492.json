This developmental feat is achieved through spatially and temporally specified gene expression, which requires tremendous regulation. Studies of genome regulation and organization have long recognized the propensity for eukaryotic chromosomes to reside in distinct sub-nuclear territories, a feature conserved from S. cerevisiae to humans [Reviewed in 1]. Recently developed molecular techniques have allowed higher-resolution mapping of chromosomal domains, which confirmed a long-held hypothesis that units smaller than a single chromosome are non-randomly organized into functional domains. While the mechanisms underlying three-dimensional genome organization are not yet well understood, a key role for chromatin insulator proteins has emerged in defining chromatin domains both in a local chromosome environment as well as in long-range chromosomal interactions.Chromatin insulator sequences, or boundary elements, were initially defined genetically as DNA elements that possess two key properties indicative of the capacity to define a chromatin domain. The first is termed enhancer blocking, the ability to interfere with enhancer-promoter communication only when placed between the two elements. The second feature is termed barrier activity, the ability to protect a flanked transgene from position-dependent silencing. For many years, insulator sequences, along with the specific effector proteins associated with these sequences, were predominantly studied at only a few model loci or within artificial contexts. These technical limitations permitted only a restricted view, leading to a certain set of predictions about where insulator complexes would be located throughout the genome as well as their functions within these contexts. With the advent of whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) approaches, in addition to application of genome-wide transcriptome analyses, some of these predictions have been realized while others require re-evaluation. This review will examine the mechanisms and regulation of the main classes of chromatin insulator complexes present in Drosophila and attempt to reconcile their classically defined functional properties considering examples from other organisms as well as new insights from recent genome-wide studies. Core components and mechanisms of chromatin insulator activityConservation of chromatin insulators between Drosophila and vertebrates In Drosophila, multiple classes of insulator complexes have been identified, and these can be classified based on the specific DNA-binding component of the complex. Each category of insulator complexes displays enhancer blocking and/or barrier activities and also contains the common Centrosomal Protein 190 (CP190) protein. Only the CTCF insulator protein is known to be conserved in vertebrates, and CTCF is the only vertebrate insulator protein that has been identified thus far. Despite weak or no homology outside of the DNA-binding region, many functions of vertebrate CTCF mirror either that of its Drosophila counterpart or of other insulator proteins. One notable exception is the interaction of vertebrate CTCF with cohesin during interphase [2] (reviewed in this issue [Ball, Chen, and Yokomori]); this functional partnership does not exist in Drosophila, in which cohesin influences gene expression during interphase in an insulator-independent manner [3]. An important common feature of all insulator proteins is the capacity to mediate long-range interactions between distant genomic sites, which likely requires attachment to some type of scaffold within the nucleus.Interpreting ChIP data with caution Many of the studies discussed here analyze occupancy information derived from ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq experiments often performed in different laboratories. Methods used by different groups vary somewhat with respect to the particular antibodies and other technical parameters pertaining to ChIP, such as the extent of shearing. Earlier studies used microarray technology, and a variety of platforms were used in this phase. Later studies utilize high throughput sequencing, which yields higher resolution and greater dynamic range of signal, but computational methods for peak calling also vary widely across laboratories despite using the same sequencing platform. Another experimental consideration is that using formaldehyde crosslinking preserves both direct and indirect interactions, including looping-dependent interactions. Therefore, based on this method it is not possible to definitively determine whether a given ChIP signal corresponds to stable protein association with the DNA, either directly or as part of a protein complex. In one study, peak height was used a main factor to discriminate true binding sites [4], while another used the presence of preferred binding motifs [5]. Although it is reasonable to classify subsets of ChIP peaks based on some criteria, either of these approaches could be argued to be somewhat arbitrary, and careful consideration should be applied when interpreting these results. Despite these caveats, which are not easily addressable, ChIP studies remain valuable tools for investigating genome-wide patterns.The gypsy insulatorNuclear organization and partitioning of the genome by the gypsy insulator The gypsy insulator is the best defined of the three known classes of Drosophila insulator complexes. Its sequence specificity is dependent on the 12 zinc-finger DNA binding protein Suppressor of Hairy wing (Su(Hw)), which was first identified as binding an AT-rich 26 bp sequence element repeated twelve times in the 5\u2032 UTR region of the gypsy retrotransposon [6, 7]. Naturally occurring or endogenous Su(Hw) binding sites similar to those in the gypsy element are present as a single binding site or clusters of 2\u20136 repeats with variable spacing between them [8, 9]. Su(Hw) is required for both enhancer blocking and barrier activity at gypsy as well as the handful of tested endogenous genomic binding sites [6\u201314]. Bound directly to Su(Hw) are the Modifier of mdg4 2.2 isoform (Mod(mdg4)2.2) and CP190, which together form a tripartite complex that makes up the \u2018core\u2019 gypsy insulator complex required for gypsy enhancer blocking activity [10, 15\u201319]. While neither are known to interact directly with DNA in vivo, both Mod(mdg4)2.2 and CP190 contain broad complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac (BTB) dimerization domains that can interact with each other and possibly promote multimerization of insulator complexes [19\u201321]. This capacity for inter-complex interaction is consistent with the revealing discovery of the insulator bypass phenomenon, in which two tandem copies of the gypsy insulator cancel one another in an enhancer blocking assay, presumably by pairing and looping out of the intervening DNA [22, 23]. Together with the finding that the AT-rich binding sites for Su(Hw) resemble nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) [8, 24], these observations led to the hypothesis that gypsy insulator complexes could act as scaffolds to organize chromatin into higher order domains.Although distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, gypsy insulator proteins coalesce at a small number of higher intensity foci in diploid nuclei, termed insulator bodies, which are found at both the nuclear periphery as well as the nuclear interior. These structures have been shown to colocalize with gypsy insulator sequences in vivo [20] and also tether to the nuclear matrix [25]. Disruption of Lamin (Drosophila Lamin B) results in diffusion and mislocalization of insulator bodies as well as loss of gypsy enhancer blocking activity [26]. However, association of insulator sites with the nuclear periphery is not a requisite for enhancer blocking activity [27]. Interaction between the gypsy insulator complex and Lamin appears to be mediated by the dTopors protein, which interacts directly with Mod(mdg4)2.2 (discussed in more detail later). Furthermore, a large number of mutations in gypsy insulator core components and regulatory factors that disrupt insulator body localization also display defects in gypsy enhancer blocking activity, indicating a tight correlation between the proper formation of these structures and robust insulator activity [19, 20, 26, 28\u201338]. Nevertheless, proper localization of insulator bodies is not sufficient for gypsy insulator activity, as certain mutations in Mod(mdg4)2.2 disrupt enhancer blocking activity but do not perturb insulator body localization [34, 39]. Recent work proposes the non-exclusive concept that insulator bodies could serve as storage sites for insulator proteins, protecting them from degradation or aiding in maturation of complexes [30]. Continued mechanistic studies as well as ultrastructural analyses of insulator bodies will provide additional insight into these intriguing nuclear structures.Genome-wide profiling of Su(Hw) binding sites met many expectations for a protein believed to be involved in demarcation of transcriptional domains. Early cytological studies on highly replicated salivary gland polytene chromosomes showed that Su(Hw) and Mod(mdg4)2.2 colocalize extensively at DAPI band-interband boundaries, indicating enrichment at borders between condensed and decondensed chromatin [17, 29]. Similar to vertebrate CTCF [40, 41], the majority of Su(Hw) binding sites correspond to intergenic regions and introns, while a smaller fraction of Su(Hw) sites are found at transcription start sites (TSS) and within exonic sequences [31, 42\u201344]. Consistent with interaction with Lamin and MARs, Su(Hw) binding occurs frequently at the borders of, as well as within, Lamin associated domains (LADs) [45], which tend to be gene poor and correspond to regions of low gene expression [46]. Furthermore, Su(Hw) binding is not correlated with any particular histone modifications profiled thus far; it is mainly associated with \u2018undefined\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019 chromatin in comprehensive genome-wide analyses of chromatin states [47, 48]. Finally, Su(Hw) occupancy appears to be fairly static across various tissues and cell types [42, 44], suggesting that its ability to interact with DNA is not widely regulated and also that Su(Hw) itself does not drive cell-type specific differences in gene expression.Searching for endogenous functions of the gypsy insulator Depletion and mutant studies have, unfortunately, yielded limited insight into endogenous Su(Hw) function. Supposing that the basic function of insulator proteins is to promote chromatin looping, configurations created or maintained by insulator activity could either promote or prevent gene expression depending on the specific context. If each Su(Hw) binding site were functioning independently and actively engaging in either enhancer blocking or barrier activity at all times, one would expect loss of Su(Hw) at a particular site to have an effect on gene expression in the immediate or at least general vicinity. However, several studies suggest that the relationship between Su(Hw) binding across the genome and gene expression is a complex one. Expression analysis of whole larvae or wing imaginal discs of su(Hw) null mutants showed widespread significant changes in gene expression in both positive and negative directions, but these alterations do not correlate with the genes in close proximity to Su(Hw) binding sites [49]. Given that su(Hw) null mutant flies are completely viable, this finding is not likely due to widespread indirect effects on gene expression caused by major disruption of development or differentiation [4, 49, 50]. Knockdown of su(Hw) in CNS-derived cell culture results in only a handful of changes in gene expression, some of which are hypothesized to be due to direct transcriptional repressor activity [4]. It has been suggested that binding of Su(Hw) in the absence of other insulator proteins could lead to direct transcriptional repression [4, 17], and whether spatial nuclear organization is a factor with respect to this putative function is unknown.An important study that deleted a single endogenous Su(Hw) binding site in vivo led to initially surprising findings. Removal of the endogenous 1A-2 Su(Hw) binding site located between the well-studied yellow and achaete genes resulted in no apparent change in expression of these genes [51]. Instead, deletion of 1A-2 reduces the expression of the nearby newly identified yar noncoding RNA, which is also situated between yellow and achaete. However, there is no known functional connection between yar expression and insulator activity. Loss-of-function mutation of su(Hw) also results in a decrease of yar expression; therefore, Su(Hw) was suggested to play a role in transcriptional activation of this noncoding RNA. Taken together, these results argue against the possibility that each and every Su(Hw) binding site functions to demarcate a transcriptional domain. Despite the fact that the majority of endogenous sites tested in artificial transgene assays do possess robust enhancer blocking activity [9, 14], harboring this capacity may not reflect their actual function in the natural context.Although there is not a clear understanding of how Su(Hw) binding affects local gene expression, several studies show that Su(Hw) is required for proper genome organization. Female su(Hw) null mutants are sterile due to oogenesis defects [11, 52, 53], and su(Hw) mutants display chromosome maturation defects in nurse germ cells [54]. However, this abnormality is genetically separable from the sterility phenotype, and the precise cause of the oogenesis defect remains to be determined. Additionally, it has been shown that su(Hw) null flies exhibit homolog pairing defects in wing imaginal discs [55], suggesting that chromatin organization defects are not limited to the ovary. Indeed, depletion studies in cultured hemocyte cells indicate that Su(Hw) also affects Lamin interaction with LADs [45]. However, in contrast to the expectation that Su(Hw) possesses barrier activity, Su(Hw) depletion does not affect the location or sharpness of LAD-interLAD borders and actually increases Lamin interaction within LADs that are normally associated with Su(Hw) [45]. These results suggest that Su(Hw) is not required for maintenance of LAD borders but could perhaps function to prevent spurious contacts between the nuclear lamina and LADs. Further work is required to elucidate the in vivo function(s) of Su(Hw).BEAF-32 and Zw5Heterotypic interactions between insulator proteins can mediate looping Early studies of the chromatin structure surrounding the Drosophila 87A7 heat shock locus identified two of the first endogenous insulator elements. Nuclease hypersensitivity studies delineated flanking sequences termed specialized chromatin structure (scs) and scs\u2019 positioned downstream of the coding regions of the Hsp70Aa and Hsp70Ab loci, respectively, which are oriented head-to-head [56]. The scs and scs\u2019 elements were shown to be able to protect against insertion position effects and confer enhancer blocking activity in transgenic assays [57, 58]. The scs and scs\u2019 boundary elements are associated with two sequence-specific DNA binding proteins Zeste white 5 (Zw5, also called DWG) [59] and Boundary Element Associated Factor of 32 kDa (BEAF-32) [60], respectively, both of which are required for enhancer blocking activity of the associated sequence [59, 61, 62]. While the original rationale to study scs and scs\u2019 was motivated by a desire to identify the putative boundary elements delineating a decondensed heat shock puff [56], these sites do not actually define the puff region, at least in polytene chromosomes of the larval salivary gland, and may harbor a different function at these loci [63]. It should be noted that both scs and scs\u2019 actually correspond to divergent promoters, and scs also contains sequences distinct from the Zw5 binding site that appear capable of promoting polyadenylation and/or transcription termination, at least in the context of a transgene [64].It remains unclear whether Zw5 is a general insulator factor or what its in vivo function may be at the hsp70 locus. Zw5 contains eight evenly spaced C2H2 zinc fingers, and mutation of either the zinc finger or N-terminal regions disrupt enhancer blocking activity, suggesting that DNA binding activity and possibly interaction with another factor may be required for insulator activity [59]. Zw5 is essential for viability, and zw5 mutants display pleiotropic effects on development [59]. It is unknown whether its essential functions are related to insulator activity. Genome-wide profiling of Zw5 chromatin association indicates robust association with only a small number of sites as well as little to no substantial overlap with other classes of insulator proteins [4, 45]. Furthermore, two endogenous Zw5 binding sites do not display enhancer blocking activity in a transgenic assay, although actual insulator protein association with these regions was not verified in this study [4]. This result raises the possibility that Zw5 does not harbor general insulator activity, but additional work is required to address this outstanding question.BEAF-32 appears to function as an insulator cofactor Better studied than zw5 with respect to its role in insulator function is the BEAF-32 locus, which produces two isoforms, A and B, that differ by their N-termini. These regions contain two slightly different atypical C2H2 zinc-fingers, termed BED fingers [65]. Based on ChIP studies both isoforms bind specifically to scs\u2019 as well as many other sites in the genome, with BEAF-32B apparently associating with more sites than BEAF-32A [66]. Multiple BEAF-32 binding sites have been shown to harbor enhancer blocking activity [4, 67, 68], supporting the notion that BEAF-32 is a general insulator factor. BEAF-32 preferentially associates with a simple CGATA motif, which is also bound by the DREF transcription factor proposed to compete with BEAF-32 for chromatin binding [69]. Comparison of the genome-wide binding profile of BEAF-32 and its preferred binding motif suggest that a subset of BEAF-32 binding sites correspond to \u201cdual cores\u201d, which are comprised of two clusters containing two or three individual binding sites, totaling five or six sites, spaced by a 200 bp central AT-rich region [66, 70]. These dual cores as well as the majority of BEAF-32 binding sites correspond to certain transcription start sites [66], with a distinct bias toward cell cycle genes [70]. Furthermore, BEAF-32 binds preferentially at genes oriented head-to-head, which frequently contain the dual core signature [66]. An intriguing hypothesis is that BEAF-32 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in preventing undesired transcriptional regulatory crosstalk between the individual genes forming the pair [71].In addition to DREF, BEAF-32 also overlaps considerably with other insulator proteins, particularly CP190. Despite the prediction that BEAF-32 serves as a DNA-binding factor to recruit CP190 [42], knockdown of BEAF-32 does not affect CP190 recruitment to chromatin [4, 72]. Nonetheless, sites bound by both BEAF-32 and CP190 have been shown to possess robust enhancer-blocking activity, while sites known to bind only BEAF-32 are less active in the same transgenic assay [4]. Regions containing BEAF-32, Su(Hw), and CTCF, termed \u201caligned\u201d sites, frequently correspond to borders of H3K27me3 domains [5] (discussed in more detail later), but not with H3K9me3 [48]. Finally, BEAF-32 and Zw5 interact directly in vitro and mediate a looping interaction observed between the scs and scs\u2019 elements in vivo as assayed by 3C [73]. Based on these studies, it appears likely that BEAF-32 functions as an insulator protein mainly in concert with other components but may not be a central player in the formation of topological domains. Important future studies include biochemical purification and identification of components of BEAF-32 insulator complexes.BEAF-32 functions in tissue growth and organismal development Knockdown studies of BEAF-32 in cell culture have provided insight into its role in regulation of gene expression. Depletion from cells results in few changes in gene expression [4, 5] and no apparent growth arrest despite efficient depletion [72]. However, after longer time periods, loss of BEAF-32 causes growth arrest, an increase in cellular DNA content, and chromosome segregation defects [70]. Additional evidence in this study suggested that these effects may partially result from relief of competitive binding with DREF, which activates a subset of cell cycle control genes. Curiously, global H3K9me3 rises in BEAF-32 knockdown cells, and this histone mark also increases at several dual cores tested. In contrast, BEAF-32 knockdown does not affect global H3K27me3 levels or gene expression in the vicinity of or within H3K27me3 islands bordered by aligned CTCF sites [5].Genetic analyses have uncovered general roles for BEAF-32 in growth and development. Homologous recombination to eliminate both the A and B isoforms results only in mild developmental defects including a rough eye phenotype, oogenesis defects, and altered polytene chromosome morphology, as well as defective scs\u2019 enhancer blocking [62]. In contrast, a recessive lethal BEAF-32NP6377 mutant lacking both isoforms displays overgrowth and altered cellular morphology as well as widespread gene expression changes apparent at larval stages [74]. Consistent with an important role in development, overexpression of a dominant negative form of BEAF-32 that interferes with both isoforms is lethal in embryos [61] and causes a rough eye phenotype when expressed in only this tissue [61, 75]. Finally, ectopic overexpression of BEAF-32A in the eye causes rough eyes characterized by extensive apoptosis and inhibition of photoreceptor differentiation but no apparent defects in cell cycle [76]. Discrepancies in observed phenotypes could be due to differences in genetic backgrounds and/or differences in the nature of the genetic manipulation utilized. Together these results indicate that BEAF-32 plays an important role in regulating growth and organismal development, but whether these phenotypes reflect its role as an insulator protein is not yet known.CTCF/CP190Demarcation of cis-regulatory regions at Hox genes Although the CTCF protein was first identified as an insulator protein in vertebrates more than a decade ago, a Drosophila homolog was not discovered until relatively recently. Homology searches of both the zinc-finger region of vertebrate CTCF as well as its consensus binding site identified an eleven zinc-finger Drosophila protein, homologous only in that region, that binds to and is required for the function of the Frontabdominal 8 (Fab-8) insulator [77]. The Fab-8 insulator defines the boundary between the intra-abdominal 7 (iab-7) and iab-8 enhancer regions of the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B), which is required for proper posterior development [for detailed reviews, see: 78, 79]. In this complicated cis-regulatory region, the boundary elements (Mcp, Fab-6, Fab-7, and Fab-8) are situated in between and are needed to maintain the autonomy of the various enhancer regions (iab-5, iab-6, iab-7, and iab-8), which control spatial and temporal expression of Abd-B. Each enhancer region is paired with a Polycomb Group Response Element (PRE), which maintains the established expression pattern in an on or off state through recruitment of trithorax Group (trxG) or Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins, respectively. In addition to constraining the effect of the PREs to their respective enhancer regions, these boundary elements appear to play a role in overriding the inherent respective posterior dominance of the enhancers within the appropriate cell types. Genome-wide studies have shown that both CTCF and CP190 bind to the majority of Abd-B boundary elements as well as additional known boundaries within the Drosophila Hox gene clusters, Antennapedia (ANT-C) and bithorax (BX-C) [42, 43, 80\u201382]. Both CTCF and CP190 have been shown to be required for both Fab-6 and Fab-8 enhancer blocking activities [34, 83\u201385] and likely mediate the effects of additional boundary elements within these loci.Insulators may also function as enhancer facilitators Evidence suggests that the three dimensional configuration of Abd-B is central in determining its expression state in different cell types and that insulators play a key role in establishing and maintaining these higher order structures. Two different approaches, the first study utilizing site-specific DamID and the second employing 3C, demonstrated that different looping configurations are observed in cells either activated or silent for Abd-B expression [86, 87]. In cultured cells not expressing Abd-B, 3C interactions across this locus require the activity of PcG, which coats and represses expression over a large domain encompassing BX-C [87]. Furthermore, in diploid brain and imaginal disc tissue, which contains a mixture of cells both expressing and not expressing Abd-B, 3C interaction is observed between Fab-8 and the Abd-B RB promoter, which also harbors a nearby CTCF/CP190 binding site [32]. This looping interaction requires CTCF, CP190, as well as a regulatory protein AGO2 that interacts with CTCF and CP190. (Regulatory factors are discussed in more detail later.) It should be noted that the resolution of 3C cannot distinguish the precise interaction points and that Fab-8 resides in close proximity to multiple cis-regulatory elements such as the Fab-8 PRE as well as the nearby promoter targeting sequence (PTS), which together with the insulator is involved in strengthening specific enhancer-promoter communication by an unknown mechanism [88]. Consistent with 3C results, CTCF binding motifs at the insulator and promoter were found to be necessary for interaction with one another as monitored in a transgenic assay [85]. Since reduction of CTCF levels reduces Abd-B expression in vivo and in cultured cells [32, 83], it would appear that in this context CTCF, and likely CP190, functions as an enhancer facilitator through loop formation and actually promotes gene expression rather than preventing cis-regulatory interactions needed for transcription to occur.The observation that many insulator classes are found at TSSs supports the possibility that one of the natural functions of insulator proteins, which could be considered looping factors, is to act as enhancer facilitators. At least half of CP190 but a lower fraction of CTCF binding sites in the genome correspond to TSSs, and insulator proteins preferentially occupy actively transcribed genes suggesting a positive role [42, 43, 82]. Similar to Su(Hw), depletion studies of CTCF or CP190 in cultured cells resulted in both positive and negative effects on gene expression but low correlation with binding to affected genes [4, 82]. However, Bartkuhn et al. found a statistically significant fraction of respective insulator protein occupancy at the TSS for the genes most changed in expression in either the positive or negative direction. Expression profiles of either CTCF or CP190 knockdowns differ considerably, increasing the difficulty in determining direct effects on gene expression. Interestingly, recent studies showed that mouse CTCF controls promoter choice at the Pcdh\u03b1 gene cluster in neuroblastoma cells, resulting in expression of particular isoforms [89, 90]. Changes in isoform expression have not yet been explicitly explored in any studies in Drosophila. It would be worthwhile to examine the role of CTCF and CP190 in promoter choice at the Abd-B locus given that both proteins bind in the vicinity of most isoform promoters and that Abd-B protein function is itself regulated by a repressive isoform [91]. Although seemingly contrary to their definition as enhancer blockers, these results suggest that insulators may act as enhancer facilitators by promoting looping in certain contexts.Insulators act as barriers to PcG repression Consistent with their function as PcG barriers in the Abd-B cis-regulatory region, CTCF and CP190 are associated with PcG domains throughout the genome. Genome-wide ChIP studies of CTCF in both Drosophila and mammals show a strong correlation between CTCF binding and the borders of H3K27me3 domains, a hallmark of PcG repression activity [5, 40, 92]. In Drosophila, H3K27me3 domain borders correspond to CTCF sites co-bound by additional factors such as CP190 but not to standalone CTCF sites [4]. As mentioned previously, many of these border sites can be further classified as \u201caligned\u201d sites, which also feature Su(Hw) and BEAF-32 binding [5]. One such endogenous aligned site between the eve and TER94 loci, termed Homie, was previously identified as a sequence that promotes transgene homing [93], a phenomenon in which a transgene displays preferential insertion in the vicinity (~300 kb) of a particular locus [94, 95]. Homing is dependent on a copy of Homie, but not the nearby PRE, being present in the transgene. Moreover, the presence of Homie in a transgene as far as 3.3 Mb away facilitates long range communication between endogenous eve enhancers located near Homie and a promoter placed on the transgene. These two results suggest that insulator complexes bound to Homie on the transgene and at the endogenous site physically pair. Nevertheless, at short range in an artificial assay, Homie confers classic, robust enhancer blocking activity. These results suggest that an endogenous insulator complex could in fact normally function to facilitate enhancer promoter communication as opposed to, or in addition to, either enhancer blocking or functioning as a barrier. Since much early insight into insulator activity was gained by analysis of boundary deletions in the far more complex Abd-B locus [96\u201398], it would be of high interest to examine the in vivo effect of Homie deletion on both enhancer promoter communication and PcG repression. Results from such a study may be easier to interpret since the eve cis-regulatory elements are fairly well mapped and lack extensive crosstalk, while TER94 is ubiquitously expressed.Several groups have performed knockdown analyses of CTCF or CP190 in cell culture and assessed changes in local gene expression in an attempt to determine whether these proteins actually function as barriers to PcG repression in vivo. The main limitation of this approach is that these studies can only address maintenance but not establishment of borders. Nevertheless, knockdown of CTCF or CP190 results in spreading of an H3K27me3 island but only when the island is not flanked by an actively transcribed region [4]. This result is consistent with the previous finding that active transcription is sufficient to inhibit PcG activity and prevent the spread of H3K27me3 in vitro [99], and a recent study of ectopic PcG repression corroborates these findings [100]. Apparently, these insulator proteins are only needed for maintenance of boundaries in transcriptionally inert regions. This situation is likely most relevant in the early embryo, a period during which spatial patterns of gene expression as well as PcG repression are established. Not surprisingly, few overall changes of gene expression were observed after CTCF or CP190 knockdown in cultured cells [4, 5]. Functional redundancy of insulator proteins may explain the lack of effects observed, although at least certain double knockdown combinations of CTCF/Su(Hw)/CP190/BEAF-32 insulator proteins does not further alter gene expression in the vicinity of H3K27me3 domains [5].Finally, a more limited study using flies mutant for CTCF or Cp190 did observe substantial spreading of H3K27me3 islands [82]. Larger effects were likely observed compared to cell culture knockdown assays because these experiments were performed in the context of a developing fly. Both CTCF and Cp190 are essential for viability, underscoring the importance of chromatin insulators in development and differentiation. Strong loss of function mutation of Cp190 results in lethality at early stages, consistent with CP190 being a component of all known insulator complexes in Drosophila. In contrast, reduced zygotic levels of CTCF result in a variety of homeotic transformations as might be expected based on its known functions at BX-C [34, 83]. It seems likely that more extensive phenotypic effects would be observed in flies also depleted for maternally deposited insulator proteins; this is an important future experiment.Insulators can promote PcG-dependent interactions in trans A close relationship between insulator proteins and PREs was noted in the early literature, and recent work shows that insulators can not only counteract the spread of PcG silencing but promote PcG-dependent long-range interactions. A seminal transgenic study determined that the insulators gypsy, scs, and scs\u2019 (to a lesser extent) could block PRE-dependent silencing much like the manner in which these insulators interfere with enhancer promoter interactions [101]. If two copies of gypsy are inserted next to a PRE, bypass through looping occurs as it would for an enhancer-promoter interaction, and PcG repression spreads to the domain on the other side of the insulator [102, 103]. Furthermore, when flanking a PRE, these insulators do not interfere with PcG-dependent pairing sensitive silencing [101], a phenomenon in which two homologous copies of a PRE-containing transgene display increased repression [104]. On the other hand, insulator activity is required for increased repression, and presumably physical interaction, between two PRE-containing transgenes in two distant genomic locations [101]. Recent work extended these initial observations and showed that long range interaction between the Mcp and Fab-7 cis-regulatory elements actually depends on the insulator sequences and not the PREs [105] as was originally presumed from studies of long range interactions between PRE containing sites [106\u2013108]. In this case, increased repression due to long range interaction is still dependent on PcG activity, but it is the presence of the nearby insulator that is responsible for mediating the interaction. In addition, these long range pairing interactions between transgenes harboring a PRE and insulator are dependent on relative expression status in that both transgenes must be either repressed or actively transcribed in order to pair, leading to the intriguing suggestion that insulators could target PcG-repressed genes to PcG bodies or possibly promote localization of active genes to putative transcription factories [Figure 1; 109].Open in a separate windowFigure 1Chromatin insulators promote trans interactions between PcG silenced domainsThe interplay between chromatin insulators and PcG-mediated silencing is illustrated as two related possibilities. First, insulators demarcate active and silent domains. Second, insulators promote long-range interactions between distal, silent domains even when located on different chromosomes.Nucleosome free regionsBased on work first performed in S. cerevisiae at the HMR mating type locus, creation of a nucleosome free region has been hypothesized to be a mechanism sufficient to maintain borders between active and silenced chromatin domains. Simple models to explain the spread of repressive chromatin invoke modification of the neighboring nucleosome with a posttranslational modification to which the enzymatic machinery of the repressive complex has a high affinity. Therefore, the presence of a nucleosome free region would interrupt the ability of the repressive complex to spread [110]. Globally, it has been shown that the lower stability H2A. Z/H3.3 variant nucleosomes mark regions of high nucleosome turnover and include CTCF binding sites in human cells [111, 112]. Furthermore, boundary elements of the Drosophila BX-C undergo active histone replacement [113] as do insulator protein binding sites across the genome, with the exception of those corresponding to Su(Hw) [43]. Interestingly, in Drosophila, existing evidence supports the conclusion that high nucleosome turnover is important for enhancer blocking activity while barrier activity has not been examined. For example, knockdown of certain SWI/SNF remodeling factors reduce the enhancer blocking activity of Fab-7 and SF1 insulators in Drosophila cells [114]. Consistent with this result is the finding that GAGA factor (GAF), which is capable of creating a nucleosome free region, binds to the Fab-7 boundary element and is required for its enhancer blocking activity [115]. Moreover, an increase of both total H3 as well as H3K27me3 at CTCF binding sites flanking H3K27me3 domains is observed after CTCF depletion, consistent with insulator proteins creating nucleosome free regions [82]. Intriguingly, certain promoters harboring promoter-proximal paused polymerase, which correspond to regions of low nucleosome density [116], were shown to display classic enhancer blocking activity in transgenic assays performed in Drosophila embryos [117]. While it is more difficult to envision exactly how general nucleosome depletion in between an enhancer and promoter would reduce or prevent their communication, it has been shown in vitro that constrained freedom of movement increases the ability of two DNA elements to interact within a single domain, presumably by reducing available search space [118]. Therefore, it is plausible that introduction of an intervening nucleosome free region could increase overall chromatin flexibility and thereby reduce the likelihood of enhancer promoter interaction. Chromatin insulators in three-dimensional genome organizationThe ability to understand the relationship between two-dimensional epigenetic maps and higher order chromatin organization presents a major challenge to the study and understanding of gene expression regulation. Hi-C mapping in kilobase resolution of long-range interactions in the Drosophila genome in both embryos and Kc cells has revealed a subset of sites across the genome that function as domain boundaries [119, 120]. Long-range interactions occur mainly within a localized region along the same chromosome arm with the exception of distant interactions between PcG repressed domains, such as ANT-C and BX-C, as well as clustering of centromeres and telomeres. Comparison of Hi-C domains and domain boundaries with linear domains [47, 48, 121] revealed partitioning of domains corresponding to a particular chromatin state and the enriched presence of insulator proteins at domain boundaries. These insulator proteins include CP190, CTCF, BEAF-32, Mod(mdg4)2.2 but not Su(Hw); additionally, Chromator, which was not previously known to act as an insulator protein, was identified at domain boundaries [119, 120]. Domain boundaries are also enriched for highly expressed genes, consistent with observations that active genes can act as boundaries to the spread of PcG silencing. Many aspects of genome organization reported in these studies appear to be conserved in metazoans. Similar conclusions have been derived regarding the partitioning of mammalian chromatin domains and the relative position of CTCF based on genome wide 3C studies performed in mammals [92, 122\u2013125]. These concepts are discussed in more detail in this issue [Wood, Garza-Gongora, and Kosak]. Mechanisms of insulator regulationRegulatory factors are likely critical for insulator-dependent control of gene expressionMounting evidence indicates that insulator complexes can be regulated temporally and spatially by a variety of mechanisms. Like the genes and cis-regulatory elements that they control, insulators are almost certainly highly regulated throughout development and differentiation. While insulator activity has been observed in a wide range of eukaryotes including yeast, plants, sea urchin, insects, and vertebrates; insulator proteins themselves are not well conserved [126, 127]. Although a precise molecular understanding of insulator activity is still lacking, it is plausible that the main purpose of an insulator protein is simply to promote stable DNA looping. In this scenario, the only requirements for such a factor would be a DNA-binding domain, an interaction domain for another insulator protein, and possibly a surface for interaction with a nuclear scaffold. Using these criteria, the actual positioning of the insulator proteins is important, but the choice of specific looping interactions between the available interaction points would be critical to regulate gene expression. Consistent with this possibility is the finding that genome-wide distribution of insulator proteins is mainly consistent across different cell types [41, 42]. As previously discussed for Drosophila Abd-B, the three-dimensional conformation of chromatin has been shown to be dynamic over developmental time and across cell types, correlated with expression status for a variety of mammalian loci [128\u2013130]. Furthermore, insulator-dependent looping configurations appear to be altered in response to extracellular stimuli, which may result in changes in gene expression [36]. Therefore, mechanisms must exist to regulate the specificity of looping interactions, and identification of the factors involved in modifying insulator activity are of as high interest as the insulator proteins themselves. Below we discuss the steadily growing number of insulator-associated regulatory factors and the mechanisms by which these factors are proposed to alter insulator activity.Posttranslational modification of insulator proteinsThe earliest examples of insulator protein regulation came with the identification of posttranslational modifications that alter their activity or ability to interact with other proteins. Mammalian CTCF was first shown to be poly ADP-ribosylated at specific loci, and in at least one case, in an allele specific manner, although the precise effect of this modification on CTCF function is still not understood [131]. In Drosophila, ADP-ribosylation was recently detected on CP190, Su(Hw), and Mod(mdg4)2.2 [132]. The site of modification was mapped to lysine 566 of CP190, and a K566A mutant of CP190 unable to be ADP-ribosylated is incapable of supporting either gypsy or Fab-8 enhancer blocking activity. This mutant form of CP190 is also reduced in its ability to interact with CTCF. Furthermore, mutation of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp) also reduces gypsy and Fab-8 enhancer blocking activity and disrupts the localization of insulator bodies. Finally, treatment of cell lines with the Parp inhibitor 3AB leads to loss of insulator proteins from only a small number of locations across the genome but substantial changes in looping interactions at a variety of sites tested. The majority of 3AB-sensitive interactions are located within topological domains and not at aligned sites, leading to speculation that this modification may regulate more dynamic looping interactions.In addition to ADP-ribosylation, SUMOylation also plays a role in gypsy insulator activity. Both CP190 and Mod(mdg4)2.2 were shown to be SUMOylated in vivo and in vitro [33], and two SUMOylation sites were mapped on Mod(mdg4)2.2 that are outside of interaction domains for either Su(Hw) or CP190 [30]. Overexpression studies suggest that SUMOylation of Mod(mdg4)2.2 promotes its localization, as well as that of Su(Hw), to insulator bodies. Moreover, mutation of these SUMOylation sites reduces Mod(mdg4)2.2 insulator activity and ability to stabilize Su(Hw) binding to chromatin at certain sites. In contrast to this study, genetic disruption of the SUMO conjugation pathway, including the SUMOylation E2 enzyme Ubc9 and/or SUMO itself, improves gypsy insulator activity and insulator body localization [33]. Opposite conclusions derived from these two studies could be due to technical issues that affect the respective interpretation, or alternatively, differential results obtained for a mutated target protein versus an entire modification pathway affecting numerous targets. Consistent with the possibility that SUMOylation of Mod(mdg4)2.2 or CP190 counteracts insulator activity, it was shown that the ubiquitin E3 ligase Topors, which generally antagonizes SUMO conjugation, improves insulator activity [26]. In addition, Topors also bridges direct interaction between insulator complexes and Lamin, providing a dual effect. More detailed analysis of Topors mutants indicated that the proper dose is needed for efficient insulator activity, and the authors suggested that dual roles of Topors with respect to insulator activity as well as its general role in ubiquitination could result in a need for a fine balance of this factor [133]. Taken together, these studies present a mechanistic link between gypsy insulator function with its localization to insulator bodies as well as its ability to associate with the nuclear matrix and suggest a potential regulatory role for posttranslational modification.Another factor that was found to influence gypsy insulator activity is Topoisomerase II (Topo II), a factor needed for proper gene expression as well as genome integrity. Topo II interacts directly with Mod(mdg4)2.2, and knockdown of top2 results in reduction of enhancer blocking activity as well as the ability of Su(Hw) or Mod(mdg4)2.2 to localize to insulator bodies [37]. These effects are likely due to the fact that reduction of Topo II levels results in a decrease of Mod(mdg4)2.2 protein, which is mediated by proteasome-mediated degradation. Further work is required to elucidate why loss of Topo II reduces Mod(mdg4)2.2 stability and if there is any causal relationship with its capacity to localize to either chromatin or insulator bodies.Transience of insulator activity in developmental timeStudy of the Fab-7 boundary element has revealed restricted insulator activity with respect to developmental stage based on the transience of the associated insulator factor. Early mapping studies identified a DNase hypersensitive site within Fab-7 that corresponds to a series of GAF binding sites, and detailed study showed that the 236 bp pHS1 subregion confers enhancer blocking activity only in early embryos but not later in development [115]. A complicated affinity chromatography approach identified the responsible complex termed the Early Boundary Activity (Elba), which consists of Elba 1, 2, and 3, three proteins each of approximately 40 kDa [134, 135]. Elba recognizes a specific 8-bp sequence through a newly described DNA-interacting BEN domain [136] present in both Elba 1 and 2 [134] and is responsible for enhancer blocking activity during the early embryonic developmental stages when the entire complex is present. Interestingly, two of the GAF binding sites are also needed for the early boundary activity of pHS1, but these sites are not sufficient for activity, suggesting that GAF helps create a nucleosome free region needed for Elba function or acts as a scaffold for Elba recruitment. Factors that mediate the Fab-7 boundary activity later in development still remain elusive; however, CP190 is present at this site in mixed embryos and various cell lines [42, 43]. It is unclear as to the significance of the transience of Elba activity; however, Abd-B expression in the posterior is highly regulated temporally during embryonic development and is later activated in the larval central nervous system (CNS) under the control of the same boundary elements, which may be influenced by factors expressed at later stages of development and/or in different cell types.Tissue-specific regulation of insulator activityIn addition to temporal regulation of insulator activity, recent work shows that insulator complexes can be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The RNA-binding protein Alan Shepard (Shep) was identified as a direct interactor of Mod(mdg4)2.2 and Su(Hw). Unlike all known insulator proteins, which are ubiquitously expressed, Shep displays a tissue-specific expression pattern and is present at high levels in the CNS [31]. Using a novel in vivo barrier assay apparently dependent on PcG repression, it was shown that Shep antagonizes gypsy insulator activity in the CNS but not in the muscle. Loss of Shep also improves insulator body localization in the absence of Mod(mdg4)2.2 specifically in the brain but not non-CNS tissues. Based on genome-wide colocalization of Shep with either Su(Hw) or Mod(mdg4)2.2 but much less frequently with both factors, it was hypothesized that the association of Shep may compete with formation of a functional gypsy insulator complex. Future biochemical studies are needed to test this possibility as well as the potential role of the RNA-binding ability of Shep. A potential purpose for expressing a tissue-specific antagonist of insulator activity would be to protect a specific set of genes, such as ones specifically expressed in the CNS, from an insulator-dependent conformation that prevents expression in non-CNS tissue (Figure 2). In actuality, Shep is expressed at lower levels in non-CNS tissues, and reduction of Shep levels improves enhancer-blocking activity in non-CNS derived cell types of the wing. Overexpression of Shep in muscle tissue can reduce barrier activity, suggesting that there exists a certain threshold of Shep that is sufficient to antagonize insulator activity, but the relevant factors influencing this capacity are still unknown.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Model for tissue-specific insulator activityDepiction of insulator restricted enhancer-promoter interactions of a CNS gene. Outside of CNS tissue (left region), insulator activity prevents enhancer activation. In CNS tissue (right region), Shep bound to RNA targets insulator complexes affecting the CNS gene locus. Shep disrupts insulator-insulator interactions to relieve topological constraints, thereby permitting enhancer-promoter communication and gene expression.Although not apparently related to the gypsy insulator, L(3)mbt has also been implicated in insulator activity in the CNS. This factor contains three MBT domains, which have been shown to bind mono- or dimethylated lysine residues in histone tails [137, 138]. L(3)mbt is expressed in tissues other than the CNS but clearly plays an important role in the larval optic lobe neuroepithelia as mutation of l(3)mbt causes overproliferation of these cells, resulting in brain tumor formation [139]. Evidence suggests that certain proliferation genes are repressed by L(3)mbt, dependent on the activity of the Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) and possibly other signaling pathways. Intriguingly, genome-wide mapping of L(3)mbt in brain and imaginal disc cells revealed high overlap with CP190, as well as CTCF and BEAF-32 to a lesser extent, based on mapping performed in mixed stage whole embryos [43, 139]. L(3)mbt also localizes to all known boundary elements of BX-C, and Abd-B expression is reduced in the larval CNS of l(3)mbt mutants, suggesting a possible role in CTCF/CP190 chromatin insulator activity [139]. Curiously, only mild overlap is observed between L(3)mbt binding sites and either Shep or binding sites for any known insulator protein in a larval CNS-derived cell line [31], suggesting that functional interaction between L(3)mbt and insulator proteins may only occur in a limited set of cell types. In the future, direct tests to examine whether L(3)mbt associates physically with insulator complexes or possesses either enhancer-blocking or barrier activities will elucidate this intriguing but only putative functional relationship.Emerging evidence for RNA-dependent regulation of insulator complexesMultiple lines of evidence suggest that RNA can serve as an important regulator of insulator activity in both Drosophila and mammals. The first evidence for RNA-dependent regulation of an insulator complex was the identification of an RNA-dependent interaction between the gypsy insulator and the putative Rm62 RNA helicase [38]. Mutation of Rm62 improves enhancer blocking and insulator body formation in a mod(mdg4)2.2 null mutant, suggesting that Rm62 acts as an antagonist of gypsy insulator activity. Rm62 has been implicated in several different pathways including heterochromatin formation [140], alternative mRNA splicing [141], and RNA interference (RNAi) [142]. Intriguingly, the mammalian homolog, p68, along with its associated noncoding RNA (ncRNA), SRA, interacts with the CTCF insulator protein and promotes its activity by facilitating interactions with cohesin subunits [143]. Although the insulator complexes in these two studies are not homologous and the functional consequence of helicase interaction appears to be opposite in the two cases, these results suggest conservation of an RNA-based regulation mechanism at least on some level.A second study regarding mammalian CTCF found a negative role for an ncRNA in regulation of CTCF function in dosage compensation. The Jpx ncRNA is expressed at the onset of X chromosome inactivation and triggers loss of CTCF binding to the promoter of Xist [144], which encodes a second ncRNA required for silencing of the X chromosome (reviewed in this issue [Cherry and Larschan]). Jpx can bind CTCF directly in vitro; thus, it was suggested that Jpx titrates CTCF away from its DNA binding site by direct competition [144]. How the presence of Jpx competes only with local CTCF DNA-binding and the mechanism by which CTCF represses Xist expression are not yet clear.In contrast to mammalian studies focusing on the roles of ncRNAs, recent work in Drosophila indicates a direct role for certain mRNAs in regulation of insulator activity. Highly specific immunoaffinity purification of gypsy insulator complexes revealed the stable association of su(Hw) and Cp190 mRNAs [145]. In order to study the functional significance of their interaction with insulator complexes, untranslatable versions of these transcripts were expressed in vivo using T7 polymerase. Intriguingly, expression of these transcripts promotes enhancer-blocking activity and results in ectopic formation of insulator bodies. Given that additional mRNAs encoding chromatin-associated proteins were also recovered in these purifications, the possibility exists that other mRNAs may also harbor noncoding functions, perhaps acting as a scaffold for complex formation. Considering the growing list of candidate factors, it appears more likely that insulator-mRNA interactions are mediated by a dedicated RNA-binding protein rather than through direct contact.Additional RNA silencing factors have also been implicated in gypsy insulator regulation. The Piwi-associated RNA (piRNA) pathway Argonaute proteins Piwi and Aubergine, which are mainly if not exclusively expressed in the gonad, act as positive regulators of gypsy insulator activity [38]. Furthermore, Piwi has been demonstrated to be physically associated with CP190 insulator complexes [32]; however the mechanistic significance of these genetic and physical interactions is still unclear. Changes in gypsy insulator activity in either piwi or aubergine mutants are apparent in adult somatic tissue and correspond to mislocalization of insulator bodies [38], structures that may be established in the early embryo and persist throughout development. This possibility is consistent with the observation that these insulator phenotypes are subject to strong maternal effects, suggesting that the maternal contribution of Argonaute proteins and/or associated RNAs are important for insulator activity later in development. In this study, functional analysis of gypsy insulator activity relied on gypsy retrotransposon-dependent phenotypic reporters, raising the possibility that changes in insulator activity in piRNA pathway mutants could be due to upregulation of the gypsy retrotransposon. However, mutation of flam, which leads to massive gypsy derepression similar to piwi mutants [146], has no effect on gypsy insulator activity (E. Lei, unpublished results). Future insight into the role of RNA silencing factors in establishing gypsy insulator activity may be gained by examining the composition of the insulator complex and associated factors in the early embryo.In contrast, the CTCF/CP190 insulator complex appears to function independently of small RNA pathways but does rely on the endogenous small interfering (siRNA) pathway Argonaute2 (AGO2) protein. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis showed that AGO2 colocalizes extensively with CP190 and CTCF, including at BX-C boundaries [32]. Biochemical purifications demonstrated highly stable physical interaction between AGO2 and CP190 as well as CTCF, and AGO2 is entirely dependent on CP190 and CTCF for chromatin association. Its role at Abd-B appears to be to promote or stabilize CTCF/CP190-dependent looping, which correlates with expression status of the locus. Knockdown of AGO2 also decreases Abd-B expression, suggesting that at least in this instance, AGO2 may also participate in enhancer facilitator activity of insulator complexes. Importantly, a mutation in AGO2 that renders the protein catalytically inactive for RNAi has no effect on insulator activity, demonstrating that the insulator function of AGO2 is independent of its role in RNAi. However, it remains an important unresolved question as to whether its RNA-binding activity contributes to insulator function.In addition to AGO2, the RNA exosome was recently demonstrated to colocalize extensively with the BEAF-32 and CTCF class of insulators. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis showed that at least two components of the major 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 RNA degradation machinery associate primarily with these insulator proteins at the promoters of certain active genes but also at well-characterized boundary elements [72]. Exosome components associate physically with CP190 insulator complexes, and chromatin association of the exosome is dependent on CTCF at certain sites such as Mcp and Fab-8. RNA-seq analysis of exosome mutants was unable to identify a relevant substrate for these insulator or promoter-associated exosome complexes, thus it remains a mystery as to the functional significance of this occupancy profile. However, RNAs shorter than 90 nt were not sampled in this study; an interesting future study would be to examine this putative size class. One possibility is that the exosome degrades short RNAs produced by paused and subsequently disassociated RNA polymerase II, but this possibility would not easily explain its relationship with insulator proteins.The catalog of insulator-associated factors is still likely incompleteThe e(y)2 gene was identified along with mod(mdg4)2.2 in a screen intended to isolate genes that influence gypsy-dependent effects on gene expression. This screen searched for genetic modifiers of the now well-characterized y2 allele, which contains a naturally occurring gypsy insertion in between the wing and body enhancers and promoter of y [147]. Like mutation of su(Hw), a null mutation in mod(mdg4)2.2 suppresses the y2 phenotype manifest in the wing and body due to eliminated or reduced insulator activity, respectively, resulting in increased ability of enhancers to interact with the promoter and drive greater expression. In contrast, e(y)2 enhances the y2 phenotype, but this is effect is not specific for a gypsy-dependent allele of y. Therefore, E(y)2 likely affects gene expression in a more direct manner. Consistent with this result, subsequent work found that E(y)2 encodes a 101 amino acid protein that interacts with TATA binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated factors, and components of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex [148, 149]. E(y)2 can stimulate transcription activation in the presence of a coactivator but does not alter overall chromatin structure or nucleosome positioning [148].E(y)2 interacts directly with several zinc-fingers of Su(Hw) and colocalizes with Su(Hw) at numerous but not all of its binding sites in the genome [150]. In this study, the authors provide evidence that E(y)2 does not affect enhancer blocking activity of Su(Hw) insulators but their ability to function as barriers to the spread of PcG repression. However, a complex variety of artificial transgene insertions located in various genomic positions was used, such as within BX-C, in order to study the effect of e(y)2 on gypsy or the 1A-2 Su(Hw)-dependent insulators. It would be of great interest to examine the effect of E(y)2 on Su(Hw) barrier activity in a newly developed quantitative tissue-specific barrier assay. Using this approach, essentially any factor of interest can be assayed for effects on barrier activity of Su(Hw) binding sites flanking a quantitative reporter that is inserted into a specific location subject to PcG repression in many tissues [31]. Kurshakova et al. showed that 1A-2, like gypsy, can block the spread of PcG repression emanating from a PRE and found that reduction of E(y)2 levels strongly affects 1A-2 barrier activity with less of an effect on gypsy. Since E(y)2 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, it is feasible that E(y)2 actually stimulates gene expression in the vicinity of 1A-2, which would appear to increase barrier activity of the element but do so by a parallel mechanism.Moreover, Su(Hw) appears to recruit some chromatin remodeling factors to certain sites, which may result in creation of a nucleosome free region, possibly serving a purpose outside of insulator activity. Starting with the rationale that Su(Hw) interacts with E(y)2, Vorobyeva et al. found that Su(Hw) is responsible for recruiting certain SAGA components and Brahma chromatin remodeling complexes, generally associated with transcriptional activation, to specific insulator binding sites including gypsy and 1A-2 [151]. Furthermore, the authors provide evidence that Su(Hw) also recruits origin recognition complex (ORC) components and speculate that association of chromatin remodelers creates a nucleosome free region to which ORC can load. However, these are only a minority of overall ORC sites [48, 151], and an earlier study showed that Su(Hw) binding sites actually constitute the lowest nucleosome turnover compared to other insulator classes [43]. Finally, a recent study showed that Su(Hw), CTCF, CP190, and to some extent BEAF-32 colocalize with Orc2 and the transcription factor Myc during mitosis [152]. The relevance of this mitotic colocalization pattern is unclear but suggests an additional layer of temporal regulation of insulator activity. ConclusionMuch new insight into insulator activity has recently been gleaned as a result of the advent of genome-wide approaches; however, many questions remain as to how these complexes function precisely on a mechanistic level. High throughput 3C studies have provided an additional level of insight into the relationship between insulators and overall genome organization. As sequencing methods improve with respect to throughput and cost, increased resolution of these assays will allow better understanding of insulator activity at a particular locus of interest, which can be manipulated and interrogated in detail. It is apparent that blunt instruments such as knockdown of insulator proteins in cell culture or analysis of loss-of-function mutants in the context of the entire fly often yields results that are difficult to interpret due to pleiotropic effects and/or redundancies. More precise analyses, such as deletion of a single insulator site should become easier to achieve with the development of new targeting techniques in Drosophila. One glaring deficiency in the insulator field is the lack of structural information about these proteins, which has been hampered due to their large size and tendency to be insoluble when purified. Nonetheless, this important task must be addressed, and other biochemical approaches should also be taken to obtain further insight into the mechanisms of insulator complex regulation. Utilization of a variety of biochemical, genetic, imaging, and high throughput molecular approaches will help answer the many remaining fundamental questions about how insulators organize the genome and contribute to the cell type specific gene expression programs needed for development and differentiation. \u200b\n                    HighlightsChromatin insulators mediate long-range interactions between chromosomesInsulators may positively or negatively affect gene expression depending on contextOrganismal regulation of insulator activity can occur spatially or temporallyPost-translational modification may alter insulator protein localization or activity AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank S.
