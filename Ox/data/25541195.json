INTRODUCTIONMessenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is a highly regulated process in which transcription factors and chromatin modifying factors coordinate with Pol II to produce a nascent strand of RNA. The nascent pre-mRNA is processed by 5\u2032 capping, 3\u2032 polyadenylation and pre-mRNA splicing\u2014the removal of non-coding introns. Complete splicing is necessary for proper mRNA export, stability and protein function. RNA processing steps can in principle be initiated and completed during the transcription process, i.e. co-transcriptionally, but may also occur post-transcriptionally (1\u20139). It is now well established that a large fraction of splicing occurs co-transcriptionally in metazoan genomes (9,10).Because of the constraints imposed on co-transcriptional splicing (CTS) by the parallel process of transcriptional elongation, an intron's fate may be dramatically affected by the elongation dynamics of Pol II. Indeed, a slower Pol II can result in increased use of a weak 5\u2032 splice site in reporter gene constructs (11,12) or alternative exon skipping by allowing a negative factor to bind (13). Splice site choice can be altered in human cell lines by removing downstream pausing sites (14) or pharmacologically slowing down Pol II (15), and Pol II pausing may cause an increase in CTS (5,6,16). Also, spliceosome recruitment may be coordinated with transcription (17\u201321), for example via the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II (22), and Pol II mutants lacking the CTD produce splicing defects (23). Further, CTS may regulate chromatin modifications to reinforce transcription initiation (24) or may facilitate rapid gene induction during the inflammatory response (25,26).However, splicing may also occur post-transcriptionally (27\u201329), and studies of how splice patterns of specific genes are achieved have generally identified trans-acting splicing factors, which may function both co- and post-transcriptionally, as key determinants. Indeed, statistical machine learning approaches are the basis for computational tools that predict splice patterns based on splice factor expression and cognate binding site sequences (30).Thus, whether the kinetic control implicit in co-transcriptional splicing is in general functionally important remains an open question. The answer determines (i) whether a kinetic modeling framework will be required to improve predictions of splice patterns. Indeed, no scalable mechanistic modeling framework amenable to genome-wide experimental testing has yet been established. It also determines (ii) whether the annotation of the genome itself may gain from applying kinetic considerations.Here, we examined how the kinetics of transcription and splicing may affect the control of CTS within the normal ranges of metazoan physiologies. We constructed a scalable mathematical model of splicing coupled to transcriptional elongation in order to identify genetic and epigenetic features that regulate CTS. Using this model we developed methods to extract kinetic information from next generation sequencing (NGS) data (29,31), thus allowing us to parameterize the kinetic CTS model in a species-specific manner. We reasoned that while splicing of specific introns may be critically determined by trans-acting splicing factors, the common kinetic basis of CTS may be apparent when considering cohorts of introns.Our analysis revealed a variety of gene features that contribute to CTS efficiency and that these are over-represented in specific cohorts of genes. By expanding the model we were able to simulate co-transcriptional outcomes of multi-intron genes genome-wide as a function of genomic and epigenomic determinants. Our results show that while genes may differ widely in their cis-determinants of CTS, the kinetic integration of transcription and splicing is an intrinsic feature of gene expression control, and that mechanistic mathematical models that account for these kinetic processes may form the basis for genome analysis tools that usefully complement statistical approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODSComputational modelingWe simulate the elongation of a single polymerase and the transformation of its associated transcript. The probability that an intron has spliced by the time that transcription has terminated is a function of the time it takes to cleave and polyadenylate the mRNA subsequent to the intron's synthesis, and the kinetic rate of splicing. Splicing can be modeled as a series of j sequential reactions (32). By assuming that the time of each reaction is an independent, exponentially distributed random variable with forward rate constant ks*j, we can model the probability of splicing at time t as a gamma-distributed random variable with shape j and mean 1/ks. Thus, the probability  that an intron i has spliced by time t is the cumulative distribution:\nFor a single-step reaction (j = 1), this simplifies to the exponential distribution:\nIf we assume a constant elongation rate kE, the total elongation time Ti downstream of intron I is proportional to the distance Di from intron I to the poly(A) site:\nSplicing rate constants are reported in the manuscript as kE/(ks*j).Multi-intron modelEach potential transcript for a gene with N introns and N + 1 exons can be represented as a string , where Si = 1 if intron i has been spliced out, and 0 if it is retained. Therefore the probability of each transcript S is:\nwhere I(x) is the indicator function. To predict the abundance of each transcript at the end of CTS, we calculate P(S) for all possible transcripts: co-transcriptional splicing efficiency was defined as the abundance of the transcript S whose introns have all been removed (all ). Therefore, CTS efficiency can be computed simply as:\nThis is an O(n) operation and is therefore extremely fast, making this model scalable to genes of any complexity. RESULTSA model of co-transcriptional constitutive splicingWe first modeled co-transcriptional splicing of individual introns using a one- or two-step splicing model (cf. (32)). An intron's probability of being spliced co-transcriptionally \u03c3 is determined by its splicing rate constant and the duration of the transcriptional phase following the synthesis of the 3\u2032 splice site but prior to mRNA polyadenylation (Supplementary Figure S1A). We next combined models of independent introns to generate a model of co-transcriptional constitutive splicing (CTCS). Our CTCS model enables simulations of multi-intron genes of any complexity and allows us to quantitatively assess the effects of genome structure and kinetic rates on genome-wide splicing outcomes (Figure \u200b(Figure1A).1A). Using parameters fit to RNA-seq data to simulate a test gene (see Supplemental Methods, and Supplementary Figure S1B), the CTCS model recapitulated a central point of the kinetic theory of CTS control (6,7,9): namely, that long genes (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, left), and specifically genes with long last exons (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, right) would favor CTS (because they provide more time for splicing), whereas the length of the penultimate exon (which has no influence on the splicing time of the last intron) would be less important (Figure \u200b(Figure1B1B\nmiddle). These conclusions are robust to specific splicing parameter values (data not shown).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Model of co-transcriptional constitutive splicing (CTCS). (A) Model schematic showing all possible reactions and species for a 3-intron gene. The eight possible isoforms that can exist when transcription is complete are color-coded at right. (B) Model simulations of the 3-intron gene. Each column represents the distribution of the eight species after each simulation.

(C) Distribution of exon lengths among last and internal exons in the human genome. (All error bars indicate SEM; P-values are the results of t-tests). (D) Average splicing acceptor scores in last and non-last introns genome-wide. (E) Nucleosome stability scores in the first 147 bp of last versus internal exons. (F) Average genome-wide MNase-seq signal in K562 cells and GM12878 cells over internal exon starts versus last exon starts. t-Test was performed by averaging the signal across the 147 bp and comparing this average in internal versus last exons.It has previously been suggested that long last exons may have evolved to optimize CTS (Figure \u200b(Figure1C,1C, Supplementary Figure S2A; (6)). We expected that if complex genomes evolved under pressure to maintain high CTS efficiency, other genomic signatures besides last exon length, that influence CTS, may be identifiable. Since our model predicted the excision of last introns to be the limiting step in determining the CTS efficiency, we compared acceptor splice site strengths across several genomes based on species-specific sequence motifs. Indeed, we found evidence for conservation of higher average acceptor scores in last introns compared to non-last introns in several vertebrate genomes (Figure \u200b(Figure1D,1D, Supplementary Figure S2B: ). Since the presence of nucleosomes can inhibit transcription elongation (33) and thus provide more time for CTS, we next tested whether nucleosome stability was enriched at 3\u2032 exons. We first evaluated nucleosome stability across several species using a simple algorithm based on biophysical considerations (34), and found that nucleosomes are indeed expected to be more stable at terminal exons than at internal exons (Figure \u200b(Figure1E,1E, Supplementary Figure S2C: ). Furthermore, analysis of human cell MNase-seq data (ENCODE Project 35) revealed that nucleosomes are enriched in the proximity of last exons compared to internal exons (Figure \u200b(Figure1F).1F). Interestingly, it was previously observed that nucleosomes are present in higher abundance in exons flanking weaker splice sites, both in internal and last exons (36), reinforcing the hypothesis that nucleosome occupancy and splice sites may balance each other to control CTS.Fitting the model to RNA-seq dataTo parameterize our model, we took advantage of existing RNA-seq measurements of purified cellular compartments in K562 cells (31) to estimate the steady-state spliced fraction (\u03a3) for each intron (17 266 introns in 2768 genes; see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). For this analysis, we restricted our set of genes to those that use their most downstream annotated poly(A) site, as determined by RNA-seq of the cytoplasmic fraction (13 650 introns in 2136 genes). Examining non-poly-adenylated nuclear transcripts, median \u03a3 strongly correlates with distance to the poly(A) site, in K562 cells, as reported previously (9), and in other cell types (Supplementary Figure S3). By fitting our model to the median \u03a3 of introns binned according to distance from poly(A) site, we obtained a ratio of splicing rate to elongation speed (see Supplemental Methods). We also examined RNA-seq data from the chromatin fraction of mouse macrophages (29), but this dataset contains many polyadenylated mRNAs that are post-transcriptionally associated with chromatin (Supplementary Figure S4, (26,29)).Fitting the CTCS model to the nuclear poly(A)-depleted K562 data resulted in a ratio of elongation rate to splicing rate of 615 bp/splicing event, equating to an intron half-life of 9 s if elongation is 3 kb/min (37). The fit was robust to the binning procedure used (Supplementary Figure S1B and C), and a two-step model did not improve the fit to the model (Supplementary Figure S1C). However, previous studies have derived estimates of co-transcriptional splicing rates in diverse organisms ranging from a 30 second half-life to a 5\u201310 min \u2018splicing completion time\u2019 (4,27,32,38).A close inspection of the poly(A)-depleted nuclear RNA-seq data revealed that the CTCS model underestimated the steady-state spliced fraction of introns proximal to the poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure2A,2A, Supplementary Figure S1B), similar to findings in yeast (6). This disconnect could be due in part to conditions that prolong association of nascent, un-polyadenylated RNA with the chromatin template beyond the time predicted by the poly(A) site (39), such as a transcriptional pause near 3\u2032 ends (6), or transcriptional read-through past the poly(A) site. We therefore modified our CTCS model to include a post-poly(A) site time delay (model CTCS + T), and fit this model to the chromatin-associated RNA-seq data.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Pol II read-through may contribute to delay time following transcription of the poly(A) site. (A) Deriving kinetic parameters by fitting CTCS model to median spliced fraction \u03a3 of 100 equally populated bins of introns. Green and blue lines are the fits to the CTCS or CTCS + TFIT models, respectively. TFIT refers to the average additional time after Pol II transcribes the poly(A) site, as determined by the model fit. (B) UCSC browser tracks showing GRO-seq traces in mouse macrophages for representative gene irf2bp2. Schematic boxes indicate the read-through lengths and transcription units determined computationally (40). (C) Distribution of transcriptional read-through as measured by GRO-seq in human MCF7 cells (top) and mouse macrophages (bottom). (D) Simulations of CTS in all human genes (left) and mouse genes (right). Genes were split into four evenly sized groups based on total gene length [short (<6444 bp), medium short (6444\u201320 252 bp), medium long (20 257\u201357 229 bp) and long (>57 229 bp)], and further subdivided by the number of introns. Boxplots of CTS efficiency for short and long groups are shown for simulations in three models: CTCS, CTCS + TFIT, and CTCS + TGRO. TGRO refers to the additional time after Pol II transcribes the poly(A) site if transcription proceeds to the termination sites identified by GRO-seq, in individual genes for which GRO-seq measurements are available. All boxes show the extent of the 50% inter-quartile range and the notches estimate a 95% confidence interval for the median.Remarkably, allowing for this additional time interval (TFIT) in our model dramatically improved the fit to the data (Figure \u200b(Figure2A,2A, Supplementary Figure S3). The best fit was obtained when the median time delay was equivalent to elongating 4.7 kb past the poly(A) site (see Supplemental Methods), and with a new value of 3.1 kb/splicing event for the elongation to splicing ratio. Assuming an elongation rate of 3 kb/min, these values equate to a median 3\u2032 delay of 94 s and a median intron half-life of 43 s. This second estimate of median splicing half-life is more consistent with, though still on the fast side of those previously reported (4,27,32,38). If elongation rates turned out to be slower, those half-life estimates would proportionally increase.To investigate whether transcriptional read-through could account for the extra time observed in CTCS + TFIT, we measured the extent of active transcription associated with each gene using a novel software tool (40) to analyze GRO-seq (41) data. We used our GRO-seq dataset (42) in mouse macrophages (Figure \u200b(Figure2B),2B), and an existing dataset of human MCF7 cells (43) to measure how far pol II activity extends. As cleavage and polyadenylation may occur prior to termination of pol II activity, these measurements put an upper limit on the pre-cleavage read-through distance.Most genes showed pol II activity well beyond the annotated poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure2B)2B) indicating median read-through distances in macrophages and MCF7 of 3.2 and 3.8 kb (equivalent to 68 and 76 s), respectively (Figure \u200b(Figure2C).2C). These data suggest that transcriptional read-through may contribute but does not fully account for the estimated delay in polyadenylation after traversing the poly(A) site.To investigate the effect of the 3\u2032 delay T on CTS, we calculated the CTS efficiency of all human and mouse genes using the CTCS and CTCS + T models and a splicing rate of 3.1 kb/splice (Figure \u200b(Figure2D).2D). CTS efficiency was defined as the fraction of transcripts in which all introns are removed prior to cleavage and polyadenylation (see Supplemental Methods), though some level of co-transcriptional splicing may be occurring even for transcripts that are scored as incompletely spliced. With no 3\u2032 delay T, <50% of transcripts were predicted to be completely spliced upon polyadenylation. Genes with many introns, especially short genes, showed even lower CTS efficiency. With the 3\u2032 delay equated to either the median fitted delay time (+TFIT), or to the time equivalent of GRO-seq-measured read-through distances in individual genes (+TGRO), resulted in an increase in CTS efficiency. However, CTS efficiency remained dependent on gene length and the number of introns, such that even these time delays are not sufficient to ensure that all introns are spliced in short genes, especially those with many introns.Predicting selective Pol II pausing at 3\u2032 endsOur model revealed that some genes\u2019 structures predispose their transcripts for inefficient CTS. However, if efficient CTS were selected for during the evolution of complex genomes, we would expect to find compensatory signatures of other CTS determinants. Indeed, we found that nucleosome stability of genes is markedly higher in short genes than long genes in vertebrate genomes (Figure \u200b(Figure3A,3A, Supplementary Figure S5A). This trend could explain the finding that Pol II elongation rate is positively correlated with gene length (44). Furthermore, among short genes, those with high numbers of introns had very high average nucleosome stability scores. No similar compensatory signatures were observed for splice site scores (Supplementary Figure S5B), which correlate with intron length and are universally stronger in last introns (Supplementary Figures S2C and S5C). We examined nucleosome occupancy in K562 and GM12878 cells using the MNase-seq data. Within short genes, nucleosome density increased with increasing numbers of introns (Figure \u200b(Figure3B3B).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Variable Pol II elongation kinetics favor CTS. (A) Boxplots (50% inter-quartile range and 95% confidence interval of the median) of the nucleosome stability score of each gene in indicated gene categories based on gene length and intron numbers. Nucleosome scores were averaged over the region of the gene that encompassed the second through final exon. Stability scores of exons in genes with 1\u20134 introns are significantly lower (P < 10e\u221210, indicated by **), or higher (P < 0.005, indicated by \u2021) than stability scores of exons in genes with 8+ introns (t-tests). (B) Average MNase-seq signal over all exon starts in K562 (left) and GM12878 cells (right) in short and long genes, split up by intron number. (C) Average PolS2 ChIP-seq signal in the 1 kb upstream of the poly(A) site (left), and gene expression (right) for short and long genes split up by number of introns, in K562 cells. PolS2 ChIP-seq signal in genes with 1\u20134 introns is significantly lower (P < 0.005 indicated by *) than PolS2 ChIP-seq signal in genes with 8+ introns (t-tests). FPKM stands for fragments per kb per million reads sequenced. (D) Average PolS2 signal downstream of the poly(A) site. Traces are normalized to the average of the 1 kb upstream of the poly(A) site for each category. (E) Simulations of CTS efficiency in short and long human genes using model CTCS + TFIT. Boxplots of simulations in four separate modeling conditions (see Supplemental Methods) are shown: TFIT: same as Figure \u200bFigure2D;2D; + \u0394elong: elongation rate of each gene was modulated as an inverse function of nucleosome stability. + \u0394splice: kinetic splicing rate was modulated so that last introns had a rate twice the speed of other introns. + \u0394both: both elongation and splicing rates were modulated.We next tested whether we could find evidence of differential Pol II dynamics in long and short genes by examining Pol II CTD SerineS2 phosphorylation (PolS2) in K562 cells in the vicinity of poly(A) sites that were not within 1 kb of any other genes\u2019 starts or ends. In the 1 kb upstream of the poly(A) site, PolS2 read densities were higher for short genes than long genes (Figure \u200b(Figure3C)3C) (though PolS2 read densities also correlate with gene expression levels), and genes with more introns have disproportionately high PolS2 densities. Furthermore, short genes generally had prominent peaks of PolS2 signal after the poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure3D),3D), whereas long genes had lower and broader peaks. These data indicate that differential regulation of Pol II elongation could be sufficient to confer high CTS efficiency to all genes, regardless of gene structure.To test this hypothesis we simulated all human genes (Figure \u200b(Figure3E)3E) and mouse genes (Supplementary Figure S5E) with our CTCS + TFIT model using variable elongation parameters. Using experimentally determined elongation rates of long genes in K562 cells (44), we tested that elongation rates were negatively correlated with nucleosome stability (Supplementary Figure S5D), and we used this correlation to extrapolate elongation rates for each gene based on the nucleosome stability scores shown in Figure \u200bFigure3A3A (see Supplemental Methods). Allowing for a variable elongation parameter (+ \u0394elong) resulted in preferentially marked increases in CTS efficiency for short genes with many introns (Figure \u200b(Figure3E).3E). Next, we tested the effect of having stronger splice sites in last introns (+ \u0394splice). This change increased CTS efficiency in most gene categories, but exacerbated the differences between genes with many or few introns. When we took into account both variable elongation and splicing rates (+ \u0394both), there was an increase in CTS efficiency across all categories. These modeling results are consistent with a central role for elongation control in the regulation of CTS efficiency. Moreover, these data illustrate the power of modeling to elucidate the combined contributions of several factors, such as elongation, nucleosome stability, and splice site strength, for regulating co-transcriptional splicing.Distinct genomic CTS-determinants of housekeeping genesSince CTS efficiency depends on Pol II dynamics, we hypothesized that differentially regulated gene groups would show distinct signatures of CTS. We compared constitutively-expressed housekeeping (HK) genes with genes whose expression is more variable across cell types (non-HK; 45). Nascent RNA-seq revealed that HK genes have overall higher steady-state intron spliced fraction \u03a3 than non-HK genes, especially for introns close to the poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). The CTCS + TFIT model, when fit to this data, predicts a significantly longer post-poly(A) site delay for HK genes (equivalent to 7.3 kb) compared to non-HK genes (3.8 kb). Interestingly, our mouse GRO-seq data, indicates that the average read-through is significantly longer in HK genes than non-HK genes (4.4 versus 3.6 kb, respectively: Figure \u200bFigure4B:4B: ).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.Housekeeping genes have distinct CTS determinants.

(E) Normalized PolS2 ChIP-seq signal at the poly(A) site of HK and non-HK genes, for long and short genes.Next, we analyzed how the combination of other CTS determinants could contribute to the higher CTS efficiency of HK genes. The model fit resulted in a higher elongation/splicing ratio in HK genes: 3.5 kb/splice compared 3.0 kb/splice in non-HK genes (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). Interestingly, introns throughout HK genes in fact have stronger splice sites than non-HK gene introns (Figure \u200b(Figure4C,4C, Supplementary Figure S6A: ): therefore the elongation/splicing ratio in HK genes is consistent with a faster elongation rate instead of a slower splicing rate. In support of this hypothesis, HK genes have on average lower nucleosome stability than non-HK genes (Figure \u200b(Figure4D,4D, Supplementary Figure S6B: ). This faster elongation/splicing ratio implies that HK genes would have lower CTS efficiency were it not for a longer post-poly(A) site delay time. As transcriptional read-through measured by GRO-seq (4.4 kb) does not account for the expected delay (equivalent to 7.3 kb), we hypothesized that transcriptional pause sites may provide additional time. Strikingly, in support of this hypothesis, HK genes have much stronger PolS2 peaks downstream of their poly(A) sites in K562 cells than non-HK genes (Figure \u200b(Figure4E4E). DISCUSSIONIn this study, we constructed a scalable computational model of CTS to identify and interpret the biological significance of genetic, sequence, and epigenetic features in vertebrate genomes. We found that distinct combinations of genetic and epigenetic determinants apply to different cohorts of genes; regulated genes appear to have evolved to rely more on nucleosomal control of pol II elongation to achieve high CTS efficiency than housekeeping genes, which contain more introns (46) but have higher splice site scores and exhibit longer Pol II read-through. As nucleosome density is a component of the regulated chromatin landscape, our observation suggests that splice patterns of non-HK genes are an integral part of their gene expression regulation.Model simulations further suggested that many transcripts remain incompletely spliced when Pol II reaches the poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure2D),2D), but that several mechanisms may contribute to ensuring completed splicing prior to transcript release. Indeed, our analysis estimates an average interval of \u223c1.5 min between transcription of the poly(A) site and cleavage of the pre-mRNA (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). One mechanism may involve transcriptional read-through by which Pol II terminates well past the poly(A) site (Figure \u200b(Figure2C).2C). A second may involve increased PolS2 occupancy indicative of pausing at the 3\u2032 end of shorter genes. And third, several studies have shown that even cleaved and polyadenylated but incompletely spliced mRNAs are retained on the chromatin (26,29,47). The delay in transcript release could result from the complex requirements of termination (48), or perhaps reflects a checkpoint that prevents release of pre-mRNA transcripts (5). Even if the ultimate catalytic steps of splicing occur post-transcriptionally, the recruitment and assembly of splicing complexes likely occur co-transcriptionally (7,8,27,47), and are therefore subject to the kinetic considerations addressed here. Indeed, a detailed quantitative delineation of post-transcriptional events will require refinement of the current model so that the chemical reaction of splicing is delineated starting with the recruitment of splicing factors (cf. (49)). Similarly, the quantitative impact on CTS of other mechanisms such as splicing enhancers or suppressors and associated trans-acting factors (30,50), the chromatin-mediated recruitment of splicing factors, or alternative splicing may be studied by extending the current model formulation.The present work suggests that mathematical modeling frameworks of splicing must include a kinetic component, and that kinetic considerations encoded in such models lead to new insights about the organization of the genome and epigenome, as well as the patterns of gene expression observed in RNAseq datasets. As such, the present work illustrates that simple kinetic considerations of gene expression processes can be brought to bear on the analysis of genome-wide datasets produced by Next Gen Sequencing approaches, revealing novel insights by mechanistically connecting measurements of gene structure, sequence elements, chromatin modification, and the abundance of mRNA isoforms.
