These findings support the latter hypothesis, that CK2 selectively affects LTP by selective modification of synaptic NMDA receptors in a receptor-location-specific manner. Activity-dependent functional and structural alterations of synapses are important for learning and memory, and the processes are called synaptic plasticity. In 1949, Hebb proposed that the synapse linking two cells is strengthened if the cells are active at the same time (Bliss & Collingridge, 1993). In 1973, Bliss and L\u00f8mo first reported evidence that repetitive activation of excitatory synapses in hippocampus increases synaptic strength over a long period of time, a process termed long-term potentiation (LTP) (Bliss & L\u00f8mo, 1973). In addition, long-lasting synaptic decline, known as long-term depression (LTD), also participates in synaptic plasticity (Dudek & Bear, 1992). LTP and LTD, particularly those at Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapses in hippocampus, the locus of episodic and spatial memory (Burgess et al. 2002; Squire et al. 2004), have been actively investigated. A number of studies have revealed that many functional molecules are involved in the mechanism of synaptic plasticity (Sanes & Lichtman, 1999). However the process of synaptic plasticity is still not completely understood.The protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase 2) is expressed in almost all organisms and cells, and is widely distributed. CK2 has high catalytic activity and phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in many types of proteins (Blanquet, 2000; Litchfield, 2003). In the central nervous system, CK2 is specifically enriched in postsynaptic densities, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity (Soto et al. 2004). Although CK2 activity is known to be high at basal levels (Girault et al. 1990), a transient increase in CK2 activity occurs 5 min after high-frequency electrical stimulation during the induction of hippocampal LTP (Charriaut-Marlangue et al. 1991). In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is released in an activity-dependent manner and important for synaptic plasticity, activates CK2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Blanquet, 1998). The activity of CK2 is thus controlled in a synaptic activity-dependent manner.CK2 participation in learning and memory is suggested by a previous report that the CK2 inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) reduces fear-motivated learning (Igaz et al. 2002), although a finding inconsistent with this, that transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of CK2 enhances spatial learning, has been reported (Chao et al. 2007). Substrate proteins for CK2 are known to be associated with synaptic plasticity (Blanquet, 2000), including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA; Kosuge et al. 2003), protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A; Perez & Avila, 1999), nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (NIPP-1; Van Eynde et al. 1994), and cAMP-responsive enhancer binding protein (CREB; Lee et al. 1990). CK2 also modifies the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (Lieberman & Mody, 1999; Soto et al. 2004; Chung et al. 2004), which plays important roles in synaptic plasticity (Morris et al. 1986; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Bliss & Collingridge, 1993; Perkel et al. 1993; Malenka & Nicoll, 1999).However, whether these modifications are causes of synaptic plasticity has not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the roles played by CK2 in the plasticity of Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapses in rat hippocampal slices using the CK2 inhibitors DRB and 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB). Our findings suggest that CK2 plays an important role in the induction of LTP through selective regulation of synaptic NMDA receptors but not extrasynaptic ones, a novel mechanism of modulation of synaptic plasticity. MethodsHippocampal slice preparationsAll the animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the University of Tokyo guidelines concerning the care and use of animals for minimizing the number of animals used and their suffering. About 80 postnatal Wistar/ST rats (4\u20135 weeks old, SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were deeply anaesthetized with ether and immediately decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and horizontal slices of the hippocampus (400 \u03bcm) were prepared using a ZERO-Z Vibratome (Vibratome, St Louis, MO, USA) in ice-cold modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (modified ACSF) consisting of (mm): 222 Sucrose, 27 NaHCO3, 1.4 NaH2PO4\u00b72H2O, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 ascorbic acid, 1 CaCl2\u00b72H2O and 7 MgSO4\u00b77H2O, continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.Hippocampal primary cell cultureWhole brains were isolated from Wistar/ST rats (SLC) at embryonic day 18. About 10 maternal rats were deeply anaesthetized by inhalation of ether, and the embryonic rats were immediately removed. The hippocampi were dissected out and treated with 0.25% trypsin (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) and 0.01% deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The cells were suspended in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest, Miami, FL, USA) and l-glutamine (0.5 mm) and were plated at a density of 25 000 cells cm\u22122 on 0.02% (v/v) polyethyleneimine (Sigma)-coated 9 mm diameter glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) placed in 48-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was changed to serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in this medium, and every 3\u20134 days half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Electrophysiological recordings were performed after 14\u201318 days in culture.Extracellular recordings of hippocampal slicesHippocampal slices were preincubated for at least 2 h at 32\u00b0C in 95% O2 and 5% CO2-saturated ACSF (mm): 127 NaCl, 1.6 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 2.4 CaCl2\u00b72H2O, 26 NaHCO3 and 10 glucose. Slices were placed in a recording chamber and perfused with ACSF. Test stimuli (50 \u03bcs duration) were delivered to Schaffer collaterals at 0.033 Hz through bipolar tungsten electrodes positioned on the CA1 stratum radiatum, and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated fEPSP was recorded from the CA1 stratum radiatum using a glass microelectrode filled with 0.15 m NaCl (resistance 1\u20133 M\u03a9). The stimulus intensity was set to produce half-maximal fEPSP. For recording of NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSP, MgSO4 was omitted from ACSF in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt (CNQX, 20 \u03bcm; Sigma). In this condition, the fEPSP was completely blocked in the presence of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 50 \u03bcm; Sigma). Baseline fEPSP was recorded for at least 10 min to ensure the stability of the responses. In some experiments, picrotoxin (Sigma) was applied to inhibit \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and a cut was made between CA1 and CA3 to avoid activation of recurrent networks. Normal synaptic responses were evaluated by measuring changes in the maximal slopes, and the NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSP was evaluated by measuring peak amplitudes. Unless otherwise noted, the magnitude of average fEPSP 50\u201360 min after the end of tetanic stimulation was compared with that for 10 min before the onset of tetanic stimulation. All drugs tested were added to the perfusion solution. DRB (100 \u03bcm in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) and TBB (1 \u03bcm in 0.005% DMSO; Calbiochem) were used as CK2 inhibitors.Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of cultured hippocampal cellsWhole-cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDA receptor currents were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA, USA). Signals were low-pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analysed with pCLAMP 8.0 software (Molecular Devices). Micropipettes (4\u20138 M\u03a9) made from glass capillaries (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) were filled with an intracellular solution (mm): 120 CsMeSO4, 20 CsCl, 0.1 CaCl2\u00b72H2O, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 5 QX-314 (Sigma), and 3.4 MgATP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. Cells were continuously perfused with extracellular solution (mm): 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2\u00b72H2O, 10 glucose and 10 Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and supplemented with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcm; Wako, Osaka, Japan), the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (100 \u03bcm), and the ionotropic glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (1 \u03bcm; Wako) and DRB (100 \u03bcm) or 0.1% DMSO. The AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded for 3 min at least 30 min after all drugs were applied to the perfusion solution. Holding potential was \u201360 mV.Downward signals larger than 10 pA were extracted as mEPSCs from recorded traces by using custom-written software in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). Although AMPA receptor-mediated responses are easily detected, the small size and slow kinetics of NMDA receptor-mediated responses make it extremely difficult to distinguish them from background noise. We therefore used a technique that measures NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs indirectly (Lu et al. 2001; Carpenter-Hyland et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2004). After recording mEPSCs containing both AMPA and NMDA receptor components in Mg2+-free ACSF, AMPA receptor mEPSCs were recorded for 3 min starting 10 min after the initiating perfusion with NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (50 \u03bcm). mEPSCs larger than 10 pA were extracted for 150 or 50 ms from recorded traces and averaged in the absence or presence of AP5. Using the averaged mEPSC, the NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSC was obtained by subtracting the AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC in the presence of AP5 from the control mEPSC in the absence of AP5. The synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated average mEPSC was evaluated as area, since the response is small and the time to reach the maximal response is long, whereas AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC was evaluated as amplitude since the time to reach maximal response is short.To measure NMDA-induced extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents, NMDA was applied for 10 s through a thin tube placed adjacent to the cells after the selective blockade of synaptic NMDA receptors, in the presence of TTX, picrotoxin and strychnine. To selectively block synaptic NMDA receptors, neurons were first perfused with a solution containing 5 \u03bcm (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) and 10 \u03bcm glycine (Sigma) for 5 min, followed by washout for 10 min with glycine-free solution in the absence of MK-801. Both glycine-containing and glycine-free solutions contained TTX, picrotoxin, and strychnine. Since binding of MK-801 to synaptic NMDA receptors is irreversible, this drug continues to block synaptic NMDA receptors even after washout.Data analysisAll results are reported as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). The statistical significance of differences in mean values between two populations was assessed with Student's t test if variances were equal as determined by an F test, and otherwise with Welch's t test. The statistical significance of differences among three populations was assessed with one-way ANOVA if variances were equal as determined by Bartlett's test, and otherwise with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. In experiments evaluating extrasynaptic NMDA receptor responses, outliers were eliminated (P < 0.05; Smirnov\u2013Grubbs outlier test), since difficulties with technique often result in artificial fluctuations in data. ResultsCK2 inhibitors blocked LTP at Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapsesWe recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) evoked in CA1 stratum radiatum in rat hippocampal slices by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, the axons of CA3 pyramidal cells, at 0.033 Hz. Application of CK2 inhibitor, TBB (1 \u03bcm) or DRB (100 \u03bcm), for 50 min did not alter basal synaptic transmission as measured by fEPSP (P = 0.19 for TBB, n = 7, versus ACSF, n = 4; P = 0.87 for DRB, n = 4 versus 0.1% DMSO, n = 3) (Fig. 1B).Open in a separate windowFigure 1CK2 plays an important role in the early stage of induction of hippocampal LTPAa, high-frequency stimulation (100 pulses at 100 Hz; arrowhead) to Schaffer collaterals induced LTP. This LTP was inhibited by CK2 inhibitors, 1 \u03bcm TBB or 100 \u03bcm DRB (the horizontal open bar), applied from 30 min before to 20 min after high-frequency stimulation. Representative fEPSPs were averaged from five consecutive responses just before and 60 min after the high-frequency stimulation (inset). Ab, summary of the effects of TBB and DRB in the experiment shown in Aa (n = 5\u20139 slices; *P < 0.05 for TBB versus ACSF and **P < 0.01 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). The ordinate shows the ratio of average fEPSP from 50 to 60 min after high-frequency stimulation to basal response measured for 10 min before the stimulation. B, CK2 inhibitors applied for 50 min did not affect basal fEPSPs at Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapses (n = 3\u20137 slices). C, CK2 inhibitors applied for 20 min just after high-frequency stimulation did not affect LTP (n = 6\u20137 slices). Plots and vertical bars represent means \u00b1 s.e.m.High-frequency stimulation (100 pulses at 100 Hz) was applied to Schaffer collaterals to induce LTP. The average slope of fEPSP 50\u201360 min after tetanic stimulation was 137 \u00b1 8.0% (n = 8) of baseline in the ACSF control and 140 \u00b1 2.8% (n = 9) in the 0.1% DMSO control (Fig. 1A). This LTP was significantly inhibited by application of TBB (1 \u03bcm) or DRB (100 \u03bcm) between 30 min before and 20 min after the tetanic stimulation (P = 0.043 for TBB versus ACSF; P = 0.00024 for DRB versus DMSO), and potentiation was 108 \u00b1 9.4% (n = 5) in TBB and 108 \u00b1 6.7% (n = 7) in DRB (Fig. 1A). These findings suggest the involvement of CK2 in LTP.Furthermore, in the presence of a lower concentration of picrotoxin (7 \u03bcm), which partially antagonizes GABAA receptors, DRB also decreased LTP (P = 0.047 for 117 \u00b1 5.6%, n = 6, DRB versus 149 \u00b1 12%, n = 8, DMSO) (data not shown). CK2 inhibitors thus probably affect LTP without the involvement of inhibitory neurons.We next examined the effect of changing in onset of drug perfusion (Fig. 1C). DRB applied immediately after high-frequency stimulation did not affect LTP (P = 0.83 for 127 \u00b1 5.0%, n = 6, DRB versus 128 \u00b1 4.0%, n = 7, DMSO), suggesting that CK2 inhibitors probably block LTP induction but not LTP expression.CK2 inhibitors prevented LTP by reducing NMDA receptor activityInduction of LTP by high-frequency stimulation (Fig. 1A) is known to be dependent on activation of NMDA receptors (Morris et al. 1986; Bliss & Collingridge, 1993; Perkel et al. 1993; Malenka & Nicoll, 1999). Postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal neurons are depolarized by high-frequency stimulation, which releases magnesium ions (Mg2+) from NMDA receptors, allowing the influx of Ca2+. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ triggers LTP (Malenka & Nicoll, 1999). NMDA receptors thus function in the first step during induction of LTP. We therefore speculated that NMDA receptors are the targets of CK2 (Lieberman & Mody, 1999; Soto et al. 2004; Chung et al. 2004).We first explored how NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission is affected by CK2 inhibitors (Fig. 2A) by replacing normal ACSF with Mg2+-free ACSF in the presence of CNQX (20 \u03bcm). Compared with the average basal responses for 10 min before drug perfusion, the average amplitude of the NMDA receptor responses 40\u201350 min after the onset of drug perfusion was 66.4 \u00b1 5.5% (n = 8) in the presence of DRB and 96.8 \u00b1 3.8% (n = 8) in the DMSO control. DRB thus significantly decreased NMDA receptor-dependent responses (P = 0.00044 for DRB versus DMSO), and this decrease was reversible. Take together, our findings suggest the possibility that CK2 increases NMDA receptor activity, and thereby promotes LTP.Open in a separate windowFigure 2CK2 plays a role in LTP by modifying NMDA receptorsA, the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX (20 \u03bcm) was applied in the absence of Mg2+ to isolate NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. The CK2 inhibitor DRB (100 \u03bcm) applied for 50 min inhibited the responses reversibly. The ordinate shows the ratio of the average amplitude of fEPSP 40\u201350 min after the onset of drug application to the average fEPSP for 10 min before the application of DRB or DMSO. Representative fEPSPs were averaged from five consecutive responses just before and 50 min after the onset of drug application (n = 8 slices; **P < 0.01 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test; inset). B, in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (50 \u03bcm), NMDA receptor-independent LTP was induced by stronger stimulation (10 sets of 200 ms stimulation at 200 Hz every 5 s at the intensity producing a 75% maximal response). Application of DRB from 30 min before to 20 min after high-frequency stimulation did not affect NMDA receptor-independent LTP (n = 6\u20137 slices). Vertical bars and plots represent means \u00b1 s.e.m.We next examined the effects of CK2 inhibitors on a type of NMDA receptor-independent LTP which probably depends on activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels induced by stronger stimulation (10 sets of 40 pulses at 200 Hz at a stimulus intensity which produced a 75% maximal response), in the presence of AP5 (50 \u03bcm) and picrotoxin (50 \u03bcm) (Zakharenko et al. 2001) (Fig. 2B). The average fEPSPs between 50 and 60 min after the stronger stimulation were 140 \u00b1 5.4% (n = 6) in DRB and 145 \u00b1 6.8% (n = 7) in DMSO, and did not differ significantly (P = 0.62). It thus appeared that the reduction of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP by CK2 inhibitors was due to inhibition of NMDA receptor activity.CK2 inhibitors affected synaptic plasticity in an activity-dependent mannerMany types of plasticity are observed at Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapses. Low-frequency stimulation (900 pulses at 1 Hz) induced LTD (Fig. 3A), while mid-range frequency stimulation (900 pulses at 10 Hz) induced short-term depression (STD, Fig. 3B) and strong tetanus (four sets of 100 pulses at 100 Hz separated by 5 min intervals) induced saturated LTP (Fig. 3C). These findings yielded a frequency\u2013response curve of synaptic plasticity (Fig. 3D), the \u2018BCM\u2019 curve derived from Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro shows that modification of excitatory synaptic weight proceeds as the product of the input activity and the function of the postsynaptic response, perhaps the integrated postsynaptic depolarization or Ca2+ level (Bienenstock et al. 1982). Effects of CK2 inhibitors varied according to tetanic stimulation, or level of plasticity. CK2 inhibitors did not affect LTD (Fig. 3A), converted STD to LTD (Fig. 3B) and reduced saturated LTP (Fig. 3C). CK2 inhibitors thus shifted the curve to the lower right (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that CK2 regulates plasticity in a synaptic activity-dependent manner, and suggest that it may participate in learning and memory in vivo by adjusting the balance between LTP and LTD.Open in a separate windowFigure 3CK2 affects synaptic plasticity in an activity-dependent manner without affecting LTDA\u2013D, drugs were applied from 30 min before to 20 min after high- or low-frequency stimulation. In the absence of tetanic stimulation, drugs were applied for 50 min during test stimulation at 0.033 Hz. A, Low-frequency stimulation with 900 pulses at 1 Hz delivered to Schaffer collaterals induced LTD, which was not affected by CK2 inhibitors (n = 3\u20137 slices). B, STD was induced by applying 900 pulses at 10 Hz to Schaffer collaterals. DRB depressed STD to LTD (n = 5, 6 slices). C, four sets of high-frequency stimulation with 100 pulses at 100 Hz every 5 min induced saturated LTP. DRB partially inhibited LTP (n = 8, 11 slices). D, to elucidate the roles of CK2 in various types of synaptic plasticity, rates of synaptic plasticity were plotted on a frequency\u2013response curve of synaptic plasticity, the \u2018BCM\u2019 curve. CK2 inhibitors shifted the curve to the lower right, leaving LTD unaffected (n = 3\u201311 slices; #P < 0.05 for TBB versus ACSF and **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). Plots represent means \u00b1 s.e.m.Mechanism by which CK2 inhibitors modify LTP but not LTDBoth LTD and LTP depend on activation of NMDA receptors (Morris et al. 1986; Dudek & Bear, 1992; Bliss & Collingridge, 1993; Perkel et al. 1993; Malenka & Nicoll, 1999). CK2 inhibitors, however, decrease LTP but not LTD by reducing NMDA receptor activity. Recent studies have shown that LTP is dependent on NR2A-containing NMDA receptors, whereas LTD requires NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (Liu et al. 2004; Massey et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2005), though there are inconsistent findings regarding this (see Discussion). Therefore, we postulated that CK2 modulates selective subunits of NMDA receptors. In addition, because it has been reported that LTD is induced by the influx of Ca2+ through extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (Lu et al. 2001; Massey et al. 2004), we speculated that CK2 modulates NMDA receptors at a specific synaptic rather than extrasynaptic site.The inhibition of NMDA receptor activity by CK2 inhibitors was not NMDA receptor-subunit specificTo examine whether CK2 modulates selective subunits of NMDA receptors, we examined whether CK2 inhibitors affect NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission after selective blocking of NR2B subunits with ifenprodil (3 \u03bcm) or NR2A subunits with a low concentration of AP5 (5 \u03bcm) with CNQX (20 \u03bcm) in the absence of Mg2+, as in Fig. 2A (Fig. 4). In the presence of ifenprodil, NMDA receptor-dependent fEPSP 40\u201350 min after the onset of drug perfusion was 60.6 \u00b1 3.6% (n = 6) of baseline in DRB and 88.0 \u00b1 1.5% (n = 5) in DMSO. On the other hand, in the presence of a low concentration of AP5, NMDA receptor-dependent fEPSP was 58.5 \u00b1 6.2% (n = 5) in DRB and 99.4 \u00b1 1.4% (n = 3) in DMSO. The rate of inhibition of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission by DRB thus did not change significantly in the presence of subunit-specific NMDA receptor antagonists, and modification of NMDA receptors by CK2 was not NMDA receptor-subunit specific.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Modification of NMDA receptors by CK2 is not NMDA receptor subunit-selectiveCNQX (20 \u03bcm) was applied in the absence of Mg2+ to isolate NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission using the same method as in Fig. 2A. The effect of 100 \u03bcm DRB on NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapses was examined in the presence or absence of NR2A or NR2B subunit-selective antagonist. The NR2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil (3 \u03bcm) and a relatively selective antagonist of NR2A, low-concentration AP5 (5 \u03bcm), had little effect on the extent of inhibition of the NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission by DRB (n = 3\u20138 slices; **P < 0.01 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). Bars represent means \u00b1 s.e.m.CK2 inhibitors affected synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDA receptorsWe next examined whether CK2 modulates NMDA receptors at a specific location, synaptic or extrasynaptic. Here, we define the synaptic site as the region containing receptors that respond to just one or two quanta of glutamate released spontaneously and independently of the action potential of presynaptic neurons, and the remaining area as extrasynaptic. To more precisely evaluate the currents induced by local application of NMDA, cultured hippocampal neurons were used and whole-cell voltage-clamp was applied. Cultured neurons form stable synapses when they are cultured for a relatively long period of time (14\u201318 days) (Hardingham & Bading, 2002; Li et al. 2003).Prior to examining synaptic or extrasynaptic responses, we confirmed NMDA receptor-dependent inhibition of CK2 inhibitors by measuring mEPSCs in cultured neurons as well as slice preparations, for which the parameter was field EPSP. The mEPSCs are the responses of glutamate receptors at the synaptic site as defined above. DRB or DMSO was added for more than 30 min to extracellular solution in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcm), picrotoxin (100 \u03bcm), and strychnine (1 \u03bcm) in the absence of Mg2+, and synaptic NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated mixed mEPSCs were recorded at a holding membrane potential of \u221260 mV (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we isolated AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs by adding the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (50 \u03bcm) (Fig. 5A). Using the averaged mEPSC, we calculated the NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSC indirectly by subtracting the AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSC from the NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated mixed mEPSC.Open in a separate windowFigure 5CK2 modifies synaptic NMDA receptorsA, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons. The mEPSCs caused by spontaneous and action potential-independent release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons, which is mediated by synaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors, were recorded in the absence of Mg2+ and in the presence of tetrodotoxin, picrotoxin and strychnine (upper traces). The AMPA receptor-mediated response was isolated by addition of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 (50 \u03bcm) (lower traces). The mEPSCs were recorded after at least 30 min following the onset of application of DRB (100 \u03bcm) or DMSO. B, mEPSCs extracted from the traces in Fig. 5A were averaged. The shaded area, representing the synaptic NMDA receptor component, was obtained by subtraction of the area of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs from the area of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated mixed mEPSCs in the absence of AP5. C, DRB did not affect synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs (n = 16, 14 neurons; n.sP > 0.05 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). D, DRB significantly decreased synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs (n = 16, 14 neurons; *P < 0.05 for DRB versus DMSO by Welch's t test). Bars represent means \u00b1 s.e.m.The amplitudes of the AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs were 16.5 \u00b1 0.78 pA (n = 16) in the presence of DRB and 17.5 \u00b1 0.89 pA (n = 14) in DMSO (Fig. 5C), and did not differ significantly (P = 0.38 for DRB versus DMSO). The area of the NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs was 146 \u00b1 33 pA ms (n = 16) in the presence of DRB and 244 \u00b1 19 pA ms (n = 14) in DMSO (Fig. 5D). DRB thus significantly reduced the NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs (P = 0.017 for DRB versus DMSO). These findings showed that NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSCs but not AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs are inhibited by DRB. Inhibition of synaptic NMDA receptor responses by DRB was thus also observed in cultured hippocampal neurons.We then further examined whether CK2 inhibitor affects extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. First, we selectively blocked synaptic NMDA receptors by applying the irreversible NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (5 \u03bcm), together with glycine (10 \u03bcm) and tetrodotoxin (1 \u03bcm) (Lu et al. 2001). As noted above, MK-801 binds to synaptic sites of NMDA receptors irreversibly. Excess amounts of MK-801 and glycine that did not bind the receptors were washed out. We confirmed that MK-801 actually blocked the synaptic NMDA receptors that mediate the late component by comparing the averaged mEPSCs before and after blockade of synaptic NMDA receptors (Fig. 6A inset). We then applied NMDA (5 or 10 \u03bcm) through a thin tube placed adjacent to the recorded neuron and observed only extrasynaptic NMDA receptor responses. The extrasynaptic NMDA receptor responses in the presence of DRB or DMSO were examined using different neurons over exactly the same experimental time course in order to eliminate possible experimental artifacts, e.g. run-down of NMDA currents. The average amplitudes of 5 and 10 \u03bcm NMDA-induced currents were not significantly different in the presence of DRB (Fig. 6) (NMDA 5 \u03bcm, P = 0.95 for 350 \u00b1 72 pA, n = 5, DRB versus 343 \u00b1 61 pA, n = 5, DMSO; NMDA 10 \u03bcm, P = 0.49 for 588 \u00b1 93 pA, n = 5, DRB and 680 \u00b1 81 pA, n = 9, DMSO). Currents induced by a high concentration of NMDA (50 \u03bcm) were not affected by DRB, either (n = 6, 7; P = 0.14 for DRB versus DMSO) (data not shown). These findings showed that CK2 inhibitor did not affect extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.Open in a separate windowFigure 6CK2 does not modify extrasynaptic NMDA receptorsA, after selectively blocking synaptic NMDA receptors, NMDA (5 \u03bcm) was applied for 10 s through a thin tube placed adjacent to the recorded neuron. The NMDA-induced current is thought to be dependent on extrasynaptic and not synaptic NMDA receptors. These currents were not affected by 100 \u03bcm DRB (n = 5 neurons; n.sP > 0.05 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). Average currents during the application of NMDA are indicated (left). The synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated mEPSC, which was blocked by MK-801, was observed for 8 s just before the local application of NMDA in DMSO with the same indirect method as in Fig. 5 (inset, shaded area, the average of difference between mEPSCs before and after MK-801, n = 21). B, NMDA (10 \u03bcm)-induced current, which is dependent on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, was not affected by DRB (100 \u03bcm) either (n = 5, 9 neurons; n.sP > 0.05 for DRB versus DMSO by Student's t test). Bars represent means \u00b1 s.e.m. DiscussionIn summary, our study yielded two new findings: (1) CK2 plays a role in synaptic plasticity, and (2) location-specific modification of NMDA receptors modulates synaptic plasticity.CK2 appears to play an important role in LTP by modifying NMDA receptorsCK2 inhibitors significantly inhibited NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, suggesting that CK2 plays an important role in the induction of LTP. Although the blockade by CK2 inhibitors was complete in the case of LTP caused by 100 pulses at 100 Hz, it was not complete against the saturated level of LTP induced by stronger tetanus. CK2 is thus not absolutely required for and is instead a modulator of LTP.Although DRB and TBB are both selective inhibitors of CK2 that competitively inhibit binding of ATP and GTP as phosphate donors (Sarno et al. 2001, 2002), DRB is also an inhibitor of transcription (Yamaguchi et al. 1999). In the present study, however, considering the drug-application period or observation time, the effects of DRB probably do not involve changes in transcription. CK2 inhibitors can block both basally activated (Girault et al. 1990) and temporarily activated CK2 (Charriaut-Marlangue et al. 1991). Given the inability of DRB to affect LTP when applied just after high-frequency stimulation, CK2 inhibitors probably attenuated LTP by inhibiting basally activated CK2. In addition, the concentration of DRB employed in the current study (100 \u03bcm) has been shown to inhibit CK2 activities in rat acute hippocampal slices (Lieberman & Mody, 1999). At 60 \u03bcm, more than 80% of CK2 is inhibited. We also used TBB at 1 \u03bcm to confirm the effects on CK2, since the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 0.9 \u03bcm (Sarno et al. 2001, 2002).We focused on NMDA receptors, which probably function in the first step among many possible targets of CK2. Previous studies revealed inconsistent effects on NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (Lieberman & Mody, 1999; Soto et al. 2004; Chung et al. 2004): activation of NMDA receptors by indirect phosphorylation of PSD-95/SAP 90 (Lieberman & Mody, 1999; Soto et al. 2004), and reduction of expression of NMDA receptors on the membrane surface by direct phosphorylation of NR2B subunits (Chung et al. 2004). We thus confirmed that CK2 inhibitor attenuates NMDA receptor-mediated transmission in our experimental conditions. Furthermore, we have shown that CK2 inhibitor does not affect NMDA receptor-independent LTP. These findings suggest that CK2 acts on NMDA receptors to modulate LTP.The modification of NMDA receptors by CK2 is not subunit specific and is instead location specificCK2 inhibitors suppressed LTP without affecting LTD, although both are dependent on activation of NMDA receptors. Since LTP requires a larger amount of Ca2+ influx than LTD, activation of more NMDA receptors may be required for it (Hrabetova et al. 2000). If the inhibition of NMDA receptors is partial and small, CK2 inhibitors will inhibit LTP but not LTD. However CK2 inhibitors almost completely blocked LTP induced by 100 pulses at 100 Hz and reduced saturated LTP strongly. These results suggest that CK2 inhibitors have large effects on NMDA receptors. The amount of activation of NMDA receptors thus cannot account for the differential effects of CK2 inhibitors on LTP and LTD.It was recently reported in a pharmacological study that LTP is dependent on NR2A subunits, whereas LTD appears to be mediated by NR2B subunits (Liu et al. 2004; Massey et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2005), although there are opposing arguments that NR2B subunits also mediate LTP (Kiyama et al. 1998; Tang et al. 1999; Wong et al. 2002; K\u00f6hr et al. 2003; Barria & Malinow, 2005) and that NR2B subunits are not an absolute requirement for the induction of LTD (Morishita et al. 2007), and the subunit selectivity of the NR2A-specific antagonists has been questioned (Berberich et al. 2005; Weitlauf et al. 2005). We tested the hypothesis that CK2 selectively modulates NMDA receptors containing NR2A subunits possibly related to LTP, but not NR2B subunits possibly related to LTD; however, our findings were not consistent. Another possibility is that the selective effects of CK2 inhibitors on LTP depend on selective effects on synaptic NMDA receptors, not extrasynaptic ones. Our findings in fact suggested location-specific modulation of NMDA receptors. Selective synaptic NMDA receptor modification can explain the lack of effects of CK2 inhibitors on LTD. We have identified for the first time the protein kinase that selectively modulates synaptic NMDA receptors and LTP as endogenous proteins, though some exogenous substances have been reported to mediate the location-specific modification of NMDA receptors (Li et al. 2004; Carpenter-Hyland et al. 2004).Although the mechanism by which CK2 selectively modifies synaptic NMDA receptors is not yet clear, we suspect that indirect modification of NMDA receptors occurs via phosphorylation of proteins localized at synaptic sites, considering the widespread distribution of CK2 (Soto et al. 2004; Fig. 7B).Open in a separate windowFigure 7Hypothesized mechanism of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity and selective modification of synaptic NMDA receptors by CK2A, the balance between local (synaptic sites) and global (synaptic and extrasynaptic sites) increase in Ca2+ is hypothesized to determine the direction of synaptic plasticity. B, the indirect modulation of NMDA receptors by phosphorylation of proteins localized at synaptic sites (e.g. PSD-95/SAP90; Soto et al. 2004) yields modification in a receptor-location-specific manner by basally activated CK2. This selective modification affects the mechanism of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity.Physiological significance of the location-specific modification of NMDA receptorsAlthough the physiological significance of the location-specific modification of NMDA receptors is also uncertain, we speculate that synaptic site-specific modification is important for maintaining input specificity. Because the synaptic site contains many glutamate transporters which withdraw glutamate and NR2B containing receptors mainly at extrasynaptic sites have higher affinity for glutamate, glutamate leaked into neighbouring spines probably activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (Massey et al. 2004; Rusakov et al. 2004). This glutamate may induce heterosynaptic plasticity. However, CK2 should not increase the likelihood of this heterosynaptic plasticity, since it does not activate extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.In addition, it has been reported that synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are involved in cell survival and death, respectively (Hardingham et al. 2002; Hardingham & Bading, 2002, 2003; Vanhoutte & Bading, 2003). These differences provide additional significance to the location-specific modification of NMDA receptors by CK2.Mechanism of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTDIn our research, CK2 inhibitors suppress LTP but not LTD, probably by inhibiting synaptic NMDA receptor responses, and the inhibitors convert STD to LTD.These findings yield the important suggestions regarding the mechanism of NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD in the context of previous findings as follows: (i) large local increase in Ca2+ is related to LTP, while persistent moderate increase in Ca2+ is related to LTD (Lisman, 1989, 1994; Bear & Malenka, 1994; Winder & Sweatt, 2001); (ii) influx of Ca2+ through extrasynaptic NMDA receptors can induce LTD (Lu et al. 2001; Massey et al. 2004); (iii) LTP is inhibited by selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (Li et al. 2004); (iv) bath application of NMDA can induce LTD (Lee et al. 1998); (v) LTP is dependent on NR2A mainly at synaptic sites, whereas LTD is dependent on NR2B mainly at extrasynaptic sites (Stocca & Vicini, 1998; Tovar & Westbrook, 1999; Steigerwald et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2004); (vi) inhibition of Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum results in LTP in the presence of LTD-inducing stimulation (Nishiyama et al. 2000); and (vii) larger dendritic spines permit large amounts of Ca2+ to be released into the dendritic shaft, whereas smaller spines, which are preferred for the induction of LTP, permit a larger local increase in Ca2+ within spines (Noguchi et al. 2005).These findings suggest that the balance between local synaptic increase in Ca2+ through synaptic NMDA receptors and the more global increase in Ca2+ through extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (possibly including synaptic receptors) determines the polarity of synaptic plasticity, i.e. LTP or LTD (Fig. 7A). Thus, when the concentration of synaptically localized Ca2+ is higher than global Ca2+, LTP is induced, but when global Ca2+ concentration is higher, LTD is induced. CK2 thus plays important roles in determining the direction of synaptic plasticity and promotion of LTP.
