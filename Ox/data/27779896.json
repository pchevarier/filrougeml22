In 2010, the ARDS et Curarisation Systematique\n(ACURASYS) trial reported that early neuromuscular blockade improved adjusted survival\nfor moderate to severe ARDS in a 340-patient trial conducted in 20 French intensive care\nunits (ICUs) (2). Although intriguing, this\napproach has not been widely adopted (3).\nReasons include physician reticence to accept a single study, given lack of\nreplicability of prior ICU trials, small sample size, unclear mechanism, and lack of\nlong-term follow up for paresis and other outcomes (2, 4). In addition, the ACURASYS\ncontrol group received deep sedation, inconsistent with current clinical practice (5\u20138). As a result, many have recommended a definitive phase III trial (4, 9).In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) launched the Prevention\nand Early Treatment of Acute Lung injury (PETAL) Network to conduct phase III trials to\ntest treatments with the potential to improve clinical outcomes of patients with or at\nrisk of developing ARDS. PETAL succeeds and builds on the NHLBI ARDS Clinical Trial\nNetwork (ARDSNet), with a new focus on early treatment and prevention through\nmultidisciplinary collaboration among pulmonologists/intensivists, emergency physicians,\ntrauma and sepsis experts, and other acute care specialists.In January 2016, PETAL launched the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade\n(ROSE) trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02509078\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02509078\"}}NCT02509078). The objective is to assess\nthe efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade in reducing mortality and\nmorbidity in patients with moderate to severe ARDS in comparison to a control group with\nno routine early neuromuscular blockade. We hypothesize that early neuromuscular\nblockade will improve mortality before discharge home before Day 90. Here, we describe\nthe process by which ROSE was chosen as the inaugural PETAL trial, provide the trial\nmethodology using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) framework\n(10, 11), and discuss key design challenges and their resolution. Our goal is to\nprovide background for interpretation of ROSE results, and highlight unique design\napproaches that may inform future trials of acute illness. MethodsPETAL NetworkThe PETAL Network is comprised of 12 clinical centers\nand one PETAL Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), all in the United States\n(Figure 1). The PETAL steering\ncommittee is composed of a chairperson, an ICU investigator, and a second\ninvestigator from a different acute care specialty (e.g., emergency medicine,\nsurgery, anesthesiology) from each clinical center, the CCC, and NHLBI project\nofficers (Appendix 1). Each clinical center consists of a lead academic medical\ncenter, with one or more affiliated satellite recruiting institutions, for a\ntotal of 48 hospitals. The NHLBI chose centers based on intensivist and\nemergency physician (or other acute care specialist) collaboration, ability to\nscreen and enroll, including pre-ICU and at satellite institutions, and strength\nof submitted trial proposals.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.The Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Network.\nEach of the 12 clinical centers is comprised of a lead academic medical\ncenter, with one or more affiliated satellite recruiting institutions,\nfor a total of 48 Network hospitals, and are overseen by one Clinical\nCoordinating Center (CCC). The PETAL Steering Committee is composed of a\nchairperson, an intensive care unit investigator, and a second\ninvestigator from a different acute care specialty (e.g., emergency\nmedicine, surgery, anesthesiology) from each clinical center, the CCC,\nand NHLBI project officers (map courtesy of Dr. David J. Wallace,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA).Trial Selection ProcessEach clinical center submitted two trial proposals with\ntheir Network application. After centers were chosen, the PETAL steering\ncommittee developed selection criteria (evidence of potential therapeutic value,\npreliminary data in humans, feasibility, probability of changing clinical\npractice, relevance to the most patients), and selected six proposals for\nin-person discussion. The Pittsburgh and Denver centers both proposed an early\nneuromuscular blockade trial in their applications, and jointly presented ROSE.\nFour prevention (granulocyte-macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor,\nvitamin C, checklist implementation, no sedation) and one other early treatment\n(prone positioning) trial were also proposed. After two voting rounds by the\nPETAL steering committee, ROSE was selected as its first trial in September\n2014. The Network then formed a ROSE protocol committee consisting of several\nsteering committee members, which developed a protocol. After multiple rounds of\nreview and revision, an NHLBI-appointed Protocol Review Committee, Data and\nSafety Monitoring Board, and central Institutional Review Board approved the\nprotocol. In January 2016, ROSE began enrollment.Trial Methodology and RationaleWe summarize trial methods in Tables 1\u20135. The following CONSORT methods sections provide additional context\n(10), and the complete protocol is\nprovided in Appendix 5.

To\nfacilitate early enrollment, our goal is to screen every newly intubated,\nacutely ill, or postoperative patient. We recruit from all acute care areas,\nincluding emergency departments (EDs), inpatient floors, and ICUs.ParticipantsInclusion criteria We seek to enroll adult patients with ARDS with a\nconfirmed and established ratio of\nPaO2/FiO2 less\nthan 150, following the threshold in ACURASYS (2) (Table\n1).Confirmed and established hypoxemia There is no consensus on how long and under what conditions hypoxemia is\nconsidered confirmed and established. Hypoxemia can be transient due to\natelectasis, suctioning, and other factors. Past ARDS trials have used\nvarious criteria, ranging from a single\nPaO2/FiO2 on any\nventilator settings (12, 13) to requiring a second,\nconfirmatory PaO2/FiO2\non specific ventilator settings after a set interval (14, 15).We chose two criteria to ensure persistent hypoxemia. First, we require the\nPaO2/FiO2\nmeasured on at least 8 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure\n(PEEP). Initial postintubation PEEP is typically less than 8 cm\nH2O. Thus, this inclusion criterion ensures hypoxemia that\npersists despite increased PEEP and time. Second, as detailed under\nExclusion criteria, we exclude patients\nwhose oxygenation substantially improves after initially meeting inclusion\ncriteria.Pulse oximetry The Berlin ARDS definition requires a\nPaO2/FiO2.\nHowever, arterial blood gas use is declining in ED and ICU practice (16\u201320), which may result in missed or delayed diagnosis\nof ARDS. We therefore use oxyhemoglobin percent saturation measured with\npulse oximetry (SpO2) to impute\nPaO2 (21,\n22) (Appendix 2), with several\ncriteria to ensure confirmed and established hypoxemia. First, imputation of\nPaO2/FiO2 from\nSpO2/FiO2 is\nonly used if a blood gas is unavailable. Second, SpO2\nmust be 80\u201396%, as the Ellis-Severinghaus equation becomes inaccurate\noutside this range (23). Third, we\nstipulate that SpO2 must be measured at least 10\nminutes after an FiO2 change. Fourth, we\nrequire signed investigator attestation to pulse oximeter waveform adequacy.\nLast, we require a second, confirmatory\nSpO2/FiO2\n1\u20136 hours after the initial qualifying\nSpO2/FiO2. The goal\nof these steps is to enhance recruitment without diluting the study\npopulation with participants less ill than intended.Exclusion criteria We use exclusion criteria similar to ACURASYS and past ARDSNet trials (Table 1). We exclude patients with\nARDS for greater than 48 hours or on mechanical ventilation for greater than\n120 hours as PETAL is charged to test early treatment. Oxygenation may\nimprove during the 48-hour enrollment window. We therefore exclude patients\nwith an available, clinically measured,\nPaO2/FiO2 greater\nthan 200 after meeting inclusion criteria and before randomization. This\nexclusion criterion ensures that patients with mild ARDS are not enrolled.\nWe also exclude patients not expected to survive 24 hours. In patients who\nunderwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), this short-term survival\nassessment is made 6 hours or longer from CPR conclusion.InterventionsStudy arms: intervention\u2014early neuromuscular blockade Study staff ensure deep sedation to a Ramsay score\nof 5\u20136 (RASS [Richmond Agitation\u2013Sedation Scale] \u22124 to\n\u22125; Riker 1\u20132) occurs and is documented before neuromuscular\nblockade initiation (Table 2). The\ndose required to achieve this sedation target continues while the\nparticipant is under blockade. We do not mandate sedative type.Table 2.InterventionsCONSORTROSEStudy\narms\u00a0\u2003InterventionEarly neuromuscular\nblockade group\u00a0i.

We chose this fixed dose based on ACURASYS, which\nfound it safe and effective for achieving blockade without the need for\nmonitoring (e.g., train of four) (2). Train-of-four monitoring is imperfect, supported by limited\nevidence (24\u201326), and may lead to underdosing. We\nchose cisatracurium for its excellent safety profile, hepatic and renal\nfunction\u2013independent metabolism, and to replicate ACURASYS.We recommend routine safety plans that include eye care, positioning, and\npressure ulcer monitoring.Neuromuscular blockade can be stopped early if ventilator weaning criteria\nare met with FiO2 of 0.40 or less and PEEP of\n8 cm or less, and maintained for at least 12 hours. If oxygenation\nsignificantly worsens (\u22652 rightward steps on\nPEEP/FiO2 table; Appendix 3), we\nrecommend that blockade resume. Blockade can also be stopped for safety\nconcerns. Treating clinicians are informed when the 48-hour intervention\nperiod ends and that cisatracurium will be stopped as a study intervention.\nAfter the 48-hour period, further blockade is per treating clinicians. These\nsteps balance trial intervention fidelity and individual patient clinical\nneed.Study arms: control\u2014no routine early neuromuscular\nblockade All control group care is per the treating clinicians, except for aspects\noutlined in Common strategies for both groups.We recommend light sedation to Ramsay 2\u20133 (RASS 0 to \u22121, Riker\n3\u20134) or absence of respiratory distress, and/or daily sedation breaks\nif no contraindication. We document reasons sedation is given if RASS is\nless than \u22121 (or equivalent). When control participants receive\nneuromuscular blockade, we recommend the same deep-sedation approach as in\nthe intervention group.We encourage sites to minimize early neuromuscular blockade. Our goal is to\nrespect clinician autonomy and protect patient safety, while preserving\nseparation of treatment between arms. For refractory high plateau pressure,\nwe offer the same recommendation used in ACURASYS. If plateau pressure\nexceeds 32 cm H2O for 10 minutes or longer, we recommend\nincreasing sedation and decreasing tidal volume and PEEP before considering\na 20-mg cisatracurium bolus. If this bolus decreases plateau pressure less\nthan 2 cm H2O, a second 20-mg cisatracurium bolus is allowed. If\nthe second bolus is also ineffective, we recommend no further cisatracurium\nfor 24 hours.Common strategies for both groups In both groups, we protocolize study startup and ventilator procedures, and\nprovide recommendations for key cointerventions.We follow standardized, step-wise startup procedures to compare hemodynamics\nduring startup between groups, and to avoid simultaneous PEEP and sedation\ntitration, which would render interpretation of hypotensive episodes\nchallenging. Study initiation oversight is provided by an intensivist and/or\ndesignee. First, low tidal volume ventilation is initiated following the\nARDSNet lung-protective ventilation strategy (27\u201329). Any controlled ventilation mode capable of delivering the\nprescribed volume (6 ml/kg predicted body weight) may be used. Second,\nsedation is adjusted to target sedation score. Third, in the intervention\ngroup, cisatracurium is started. Fourth, a PETAL investigator or designee\ndetermines hemodynamic appropriateness for PEEP increase, and, if deemed\nappropriate, PEEP is gradually uptitrated to a high-PEEP strategy based on\npreviously implemented protocols (Appendix 3) (13, 14,\n28, 30). We require the high-PEEP protocol for 5 days\nafter randomization.We allow protocol deviation for worsening of oxygenation after PEEP increase,\npneumothorax, or high barotrauma risk (e.g., pulmonary bullae), similar to\nthe Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treated Early trial\n(14). We also allow protocol\ndeviation if hypotension, plateau pressure greater than 30 cm\nH2O, and/or severe acidemia (pH\u2009<\u20097.15) are\npresent despite tidal volume reduction, fluid boluses, and/or respiratory\nrate increase. In these situations, with the high-PEEP protocol as the\nstarting point, PEEP is reduced gradually until the physiologic parameters\nof concern improve. Later, we attempt to return to high PEEP, at least daily\nthrough Study Day 5 (Appendix 5).We recommend that clinicians wait at least 12 hours before proning, as per\nthe Proning Severe ARDS Patients trial (15), conservative fluid management using a simplification of the\nARDSNet Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial algorithm (31), and glycemic control with a\ntarget upper blood glucose level less than or equal to 180 mg/dl (32). Rescue procedures for refractory\nhypoxemia are per clinician discretion.StandardizationTo standardize protocol delivery, the PETAL CCC provides\nstandardized training and materials and continuous support to the clinical\ncenters. The CCC conducts twice-yearly, in-person meetings, holds regular\nconference calls, maintains a website with multiple resources, and reviews\ndetailed, monthly \u201con target\u201d performance reports (33). The CCC and protocol leaders train\neach center\u2019s principal investigators and coordinators in the rationale\nand steps of study interventions, who then train their coinvestigators and other\npersonnel.AdherenceProtocol adherence is promoted by frequent monitoring of\nintervention delivery conduct and feedback. The CCC and protocol leaders field\nquestions regarding protocol specifics, such as patient eligibility and protocol\ndelivery, and conduct monthly calls with centers to identify and solve\nchallenges with protocol adherence.OutcomesPrimary The primary outcome is all-cause mortality before\ndischarge home before Day 90 (Table\n3, Appendix 5). Home is defined as the level of residence or\nhealthcare facility where the patient was residing before hospital\nadmission. Participants still in a healthcare facility at Day 91 are\nconsidered alive.Table 3.OutcomesCONSORTROSEOutcomes\u00a0\u2003PrimaryAll-cause mortality\nbefore discharge home before Day 90.

We chose this outcome to increase\npatient centeredness, as death after hospital discharge, but before\nreturning home, is common for critically ill patients (e.g., long-term acute\ncare hospitals) (34), and to\naccount for mortality attributable to ARDS and ARDS risk factors months\nafter the acute event (35).Secondary Key secondary outcomes (Table 3,\nAppendix 5) are: (1) process and safety measures;\n(2) physiologic measures; (3) early\noutcomes; and (4) long-term outcomes.Process and safety measures include hemodynamic monitoring during study\ninitiation, rescue procedures, achieved mobility level (36), and paralysis recall (37, 38). Physiologic measures include weekly manual muscle strength\ntesting on participants who pass a safety and attention screen (until\nhospital discharge or Day 28, whichever comes first), and respiratory\nphysiology assessments. We measure plasma IL-6 at study entry and 48 hours,\nand collect a biorepository of plasma and urine at multiple time points. The\nbiorepository and clinical database will be made available to the scientific\ncommunity through the NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repository\nInformation Coordinating Center after the trial ends (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/).For early outcomes, we measure survival and days without various supports\n(e.g., ventilator-free days) at Day 28. For long-term outcomes, we will\nquery federal databases (e.g., National Death Index), and perform telephone\ninterview assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months. We assess vital status and\nseveral domains, including disability, quality of life, and cognition.\nInterviews are conducted in English or Spanish from a central call center,\nfirst with participants, and, if unavailable, a proxy respondent. We chose\nsurvey instruments based on robustness, comparability with past work, power\nto detect outcome differences, and brevity (target interview time 20 min or\nless).Data quality methods The CCC safeguards data quality monitoring via web-based data collection,\nmonthly query reports, and site visits, and provides structured data\ncollection training to centers before study initiation.Sample SizeDetermination Sample size is based on a comparison of binomial\nproportions, with an overall two-sided \u03b1 of 0.05 and power of 0.90, to\ndetect an absolute mortality difference half that assumed by ACURASYS. With\na 35% mortality rate in control and a 27% rate in intervention, the maximum\nrequired sample size is 1,408 participants. (Table 4, Appendix 5). The presumed 35% control\nmortality rate is based on the control mortality rates in the ACURASYS (41%)\nand Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treated Early (35%)\ntrials of moderate to severe ARDS (2, 14), and the observed\nmortality (32%) for moderate ARDS in the Berlin ARDS definition validation\ncohort (39). Though the most recent\nARDSNet trials reported lower mortality in their primary outcome (Early\nVersus Delayed Enteral Nutrition [EDEN], \u223c23%; Statins for Acutely\nInjured Lungs from Sepsis [SAILS], \u223c27%), these trials enrolled less\nseverely ill patients\n(PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u2009300)\nand used a shorter-duration mortality outcome (60 d) (12, 40).Table 4.Sample size determination and interim analysesCONSORTROSESample size*1,408DeterminationHypothesis: early\nneuromuscular blockade will improve mortality before\ndischarge home before Day 90 (primary outcome) in patients\nwith moderate to severe ARDS\u2020\u00a08% absolute risk\nreduction of primary outcome rate\u00a0Assumes 35% primary\noutcome rate in control group\u00a0\u226590% power,\ntwo-sided \u03b1 of 0.05Interim analyses and\nstopping rulesTwo interim analyses\nand one final look, approximately evenly\nspaced\u00a0Symmetric group\nsequential flexible stopping boundaries, Lan and DeMets\ndesignOpen in a separate windowDefinition of abbreviations:\nARDS\u2009=\u2009acute respiratory distress syndrome;\nCONSORT\u2009=\u2009Consolidated Standards of Reporting\nTrials; ROSE\u2009=\u2009Reevaluation of Systemic Early\nNeuromuscular Blockade.*The trial will enroll a maximum of 1,408 participants, and may stop\nearly, per statistical stopping rules and Data Safety Monitoring\nBoard recommendations.\u2020Participants who are discharged home (defined as the level of\nresidence or healthcare facility where the patient was residing\nbefore hospital admission) before Day 90 will be assumed to be alive\nand censored at Day 91.Interim analyses and stopping rules We will submit data to the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board\n(DSMB) for two interim analyses and one final look with a\npriori stopping rules. ROSE will stop for superiority of either\ngroup, and is designed with symmetric group sequential flexible stopping\nboundaries as per Lan and DeMets (41). The boundaries specify that, at each data look, the\ncumulative probability of exceeding the upper or lower boundary on that look\nor previous looks will be 0.025 t4 under the null hypothesis of\nno difference between groups, where t is the information time, defined as\nthe ratio of the effective sample size at the time of the look to the\neventual sample size. Before trial completion, only the DSMB and designated\nstudy statisticians will see outcome data per arm; the DSMB may recommend\nstopping enrollment for efficacy, harm, or futility. Pre-established\nstatistical plans and oversight committee charters mitigate concerns of\nspurious early cessation (42).RandomizationSequence generation ROSE randomizes at the patient level, with 1:1 study\narm allocation using a computer-generated permuted block design, and\nstratification by institution (Table\n5). The CCC and protocol leaders provide continuous access for\nrandomization backup.Allocation concealment We assure concealment via an automated, centralized assignment system. Only\nafter enrollment does the system assign a study arm.Implementation Each coordinator has a unique personal identification number to access the\nCCC web-based randomization system. Each participant receives a\ncomputer-generated study identification number and study arm assignment. An\ne-mailed confirmation is automatically generated and sent to the study\nsite.BlindingWe chose to not blind cisatracurium administration, as\npatients under neuromuscular blockade have easily identifiable clinical\ncharacteristics, such as absence of movement. PETAL investigators are familiar\nwith unblinded trials, including the recent ARDSNet enteral feeding trial (40). The potential for clinician\nknowledge of randomization assignment to bias treatment is real, but modest.\nRisk of assessment bias is low, as the primary outcome is objective (mortality),\nand statistical analysis and long-term outcome assessment staff are blinded to\nstudy arm. We restrict access to unblinded data to designated study\nstatisticians and oversight committees.Statistical MethodsWe will conduct an intention-to-treat analysis, with\ntwo-tailed significance testing at an \u03b1 of 0.05, with no adjustment for\nmultiple comparisons. We will analyze adverse events using weighted Poisson\nregression with nonserious events weighted by one, and serious events weighted\nby two. Events will be the unit of analysis, and will be grouped by Medical\nDictionary for Regulatory Activities organ classes. We will report results in\naccordance with CONSORT. We will use standard analytic methods based on all\navailable data with no imputation, with two exceptions.For the primary outcome, participants not discharged home before Day 90 are\nfollowed for 90 days, and the primary mortality outcome is analyzed using\nPearson\u2019s chi-square test to compare the proportion deceased before\nhospital discharge. However, at each interim analysis, it is necessary to\naccount for patients still in hospital with less than 90 days follow up. This\nwill be accomplished using the Kaplan-Meier Day 90 mortality point estimates\nwith all patients who are discharged home or still alive at Day 90 censored at\nDay 91, which is beyond the last possible day of death. We will then compare Day\n90 mortality estimates in the two study arms using a Z test with\nGreenwood\u2019s standard error (43).\nIn the absence of censoring (before Day 90), this Z test is equivalent to\nPearson\u2019s chi-square test.Randomized treatment comparisons for endpoints defined only for survivors (e.g.,\nquality of life) cannot be performed, because these endpoints are only defined\nin the nonrandom subgroup of survivors. We will therefore analyze long-term\noutcomes among survivors using a method that corrects for covariate imbalance\ndue to differential causes of mortality in each study arm. This potential bias\nwill be corrected by estimating the survivor average causal effect, as per\nHayden and colleagues (44), which\nweights each participant\u2019s outcome by the estimated probability of\nsurvival on the other treatment. These probabilities are estimated from the\nobserved covariates using logistic regression under the assumption that all\nrelevant confounders have been measured. DiscussionWe wrestled with four key design challenges. We made\ndecisions based on previous research, an iterative consensus model when data were\nless rigorous, and internal surveys of existing practice to assess feasibility and\ninform design. We detail these challenges and decisions subsequently here.First, we sought to develop a protocol that would both fulfill our study objectives\nand be feasible to deploy. In November 2014, we surveyed PETAL hospitals to\ndetermine neuromuscular blockade and sedation practices, their ability to randomize\ninto ROSE, and proning use. Only one reported routinely (80\u2013100% of patients)\nusing neuromuscular blockade as per ACURASYS. All but two reported ability to\nrandomize a majority of qualifying patients, and all reported ability to follow a\nspecific neuromuscular blockade and sedation protocol in an intervention group.\nRegarding control group design, respondents expected baseline low neuromuscular\nblockade use in control, and that they could encourage low use of such. Regarding\nproning, half reported almost never doing so, and only two reported routine use,\nwith the remainder reporting intermittent use with wide variation. Hospitals also\nreported commonly waiting 12\u201324 hours to prone, and the feasibility of\nproning without neuromuscular blockade. Based on these results, we believed our\ndesign feasible, would result in separation of neuromuscular blockade use between\narms, and that proning would minimally confound results.Second, choice of sedation depth in control was challenging. Deep sedation is\nclinically entrained with neuromuscular blockade to prevent paralysis recall.\nHowever, ACURASYS protocolized deep sedation in both groups. We considered this\napproach, which would have eliminated sedation as a potential confounder. However,\nexcess sedation has been associated with harm (5), and our internal survey found that, in the absence of neuromuscular\nblockade, 75% of PETAL hospitals titrated to light sedation or to avoid ventilator\ndyssynchrony, with only five providing deep sedation as a usual goal. Moreover,\nlight sedation is universally recommended when neuromuscular blockade is not used\nand ventilator dyssynchrony, respiratory distress, or other specific indications are\nabsent (6\u20138). We therefore chose a control arm design consistent with\ncurrent thinking and practice for sedation\u2014light sedation in the absence of\nspecific indications in control, and entrained deep sedation while under\nneuromuscular blockade in intervention.Third, emphasizing early treatment creates complexities in both enrollment criteria\nand protocol execution, not seen in past ARDSNet and other ICU-based trials, but\ncommon in ED-based trials. Defining confirmed and established hypoxemia early in a\npatient\u2019s course was complicated by less-frequent arterial blood gas use in\nthe ED versus most ICUs (17\u201319), and potentially transient hypoxemia\nimmediately after intubation. However, our overarching hypothesis as a Network is\nthat early intervention improves outcomes, and our charge is to test this\nhypothesis. We therefore crafted criteria to allow early enrollment while ensuring\ntrue hypoxemia.For protocol execution, initiating deep sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and high\nPEEP can cause hypotension, and many patients with moderate to severe ARDS will have\nhemodynamic instability, especially early in their course. As our goal is to provide\ndefinitive guidance in exactly such patients, we chose not to exclude or\nsignificantly delay enrollment of hemodynamically unstable patients, as doing so\nwould diminish the clinical relevance of our results, and challenge our Network\ncharge to test early treatment. Furthermore, in routine clinical use, neuromuscular\nblockade is not delayed for hemodynamic instability. Its use is instead often\naccelerated in the sickest patients to facilitate acute control of pathophysiology.\nTherefore, with the DSMB, we took several measures to both mitigate risk and\nfacilitate early protocol execution. We protocolize step-wise initiation of startup\nprocedures and gradual PEEP uptitration, wait at least 6 hours after CPR before\nconsidering enrollment, mandate PETAL investigator or designee determination of\nhemodynamic appropriateness for high PEEP, and allow for delay in high-PEEP\nadministration for hypotension and other physiologic concerns.Lastly, we chose to protocolize high PEEP in all participants for the following\nreasons. First, to mitigate the possibility of differential PEEP use between arms.\nSecond, a presumptive physiologic benefit of neuromuscular blockade is reduction of\natelectrauma, barotrauma, volutrauma, and alveolar expansion heterogeneity. High\nPEEP also reduces atelectrauma and alveolar expansion heterogeneity. It is unknown\nif neuromuscular blockade adds additional protection over high PEEP alone. Third,\ntrials should test novel interventions on a background of \u201cbest care.\u201d\nSecondary analyses, including a patient-level meta-analysis of three trials, suggest\nthat high PEEP improves survival in patients with ARDS with greater hypoxemia (45).ConclusionsROSE will provide definitive early neuromuscular\nblockade data for future patients with ARDS by providing a CONSORT-adherent\ndesign with large sample size, background care consistent with current best\npractice, and extensive long-term outcomes. Our multidisciplinary approach to\ntrial design may be of use to other trials of acute illness.
