Graphical Abstract 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONIn 1973 the world\u2019s first mobile phone call was made, giving birth to the era of cellular phones. Gradually, features such as text messaging, cameras, games, and music were added to the devices, but until recently these additions were considered extras with respect to the original main purpose of voice calling. During the past few decades, the integration of novel technologies and unprecedented connectivity into mobile phones catalyzed the paradigm shift from \u201ccellular\u201d to \u201csmart\u201d phones. Smartphones completely transformed consumer perception of their mobile devices, gradually becoming a virtual toolbox with a solution for almost every need.A similar shift in perception has occurred within the scientific community during the last 60 years, surpassing the original view of RNA in Crick\u2019s \u201ccentral dogma\u201d as solely the messenger of genetic information. Initial discoveries of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) having a biological function independent from protein coding included tRNA (tRNA), rRNA (rRNA), and spliceosomal RNA. Since then, the list of additional roles assigned to transcripts has grown exponentially. Although the vast majority of the genome is transcribed,1 current estimates indicate that only about 1.5% of it codes for proteins. It is now becoming evident that this nucleic acid is an extremely versatile molecule implicated in many different cellular processes, from structural support, to epigenetic modulation of gene expression, to maintenance of genome integrity. Consequently, numerous links between defects in noncoding RNA and human diseases have been described.2 Thus, RNA has broken free from its original confined role of subordinate messenger for DNA to emerge as an indispensable smart tool for a multitude of cellular needs.In this review, we cover the very topical notion that RNA, both coding and noncoding, is involved in the maintenance of genomic stability as an example of \u201csmart RNA\u201d. We begin with a historical perspective on the emergence of the noncoding functions of RNA and of the RNA interference machinery. We discuss novel aspects of a recently discovered class of RNAs involved in DNA damage signaling and DNA repair,3-7 as well as RNAs that guide genomic rearrangements8,9 and maintain telomere homeostasis.10-12 We then highlight the importance of using cutting-edge, single-molecule resolution techniques to study the location and biology of low-abundance, highly specialized RNA molecules. Finally, we discuss the exciting potential of targeting such RNAs with antisense tools as a viable therapeutic option. Throughout the article, we guide the reader to additional reviews that describe certain aspects in greater detail that, due to spatial constraints, we only mention.Unlike the case of smartphones, the multiple functions of RNA are innate. In this respect, cellular RNA has always been smart, we just had to realize it. 2.\u2003LIVING IN AN RNA WORLD2.1. Gene Hunting during the Genome RevolutionThe way we study biology has dramatically changed in the past 20 years due to the genome revolution. Genome sequencing efforts have been paralleled by efforts to identify encoded genes. Although the scientific community has long been aware of the many different functions of RNA (ranging from ribozymes to splicing), the search for novel genes was strongly biased toward the identification of protein-coding elements because of the assumption that they would be the main components of the newly sequenced genomes. Dogmas, such as \u201cone gene, one enzyme\u201d13 or \u201cone gene, one polypeptide\u201d, have influenced the community far beyond their original message, long reinforcing a narrow protein-centric view of genetic information.The quest for genes ended with the surprising finding that the human genome, as well as the genome of other vertebrates, encodes for only slightly more than 20,000 protein-coding genes.14,15 This small number was a big surprise due to previous estimates suggesting that the human genome would contain more than 100,000 genes,16 commensurate with the expectation for organisms such as humans that have a complex developmental body plan and central nervous system. For instance, the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans contains 19,000 protein-coding genes,17 while the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster genome has 14,000.18 Thus, the number of protein-coding genes is similar in invertebrate and mammalian genomes. Next, the scientific community postulated that alternative splicing and combinatorial transcriptional control by transcription factors may contribute to human body complexity. However, these two phenomena are not sufficient to explain differences in complexity as they are also found in invertebrates.19 Nonetheless, mainstream genome analysis has continued to focus on protein-coding genes for years, mostly for practical reasons: they are relatively easy to identify given their high expression, long open reading frames, and defined start and termination points.20,212.2. Discovery of RNA Dark MatterIn the quest for protein-coding genes, efforts have been conducted to identify expressed polyadenylated RNAs.21,22 In retrospect, the selection of cDNA that showed an open reading frame as evidence of protein-coding genes has caused a long delay in the discovery of human non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nt, named long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)\u2014this classification simply comes from experimental restrictions inherent to sequencing library preparation.The concept that the genomes of organisms with high complexity are largely transcribed and that the main output is comprised of ncRNAs derives from analysis of mouse full-length cDNA collections and whole genome high-density tiling arrays, with a series of parallel studies identifying mounting evidence of widespread transcription. In 2002 (Figure 1), the FANTOM2 project found the first evidence of lncRNA transcription and also identified ~2500 antisense RNAs.20 Subsequently, it became clear that nuclear, nonpolyadenylated lncRNAs are the major output of the genome.23,24 In 2005 (Figure 1), the FANTOM3 project reached the conclusion that at least 63% of the genome is transcribed, most of which is comprised of ncRNAs.1 Additionally, by cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) technology,25,26 it has been shown that at least 73% of loci encoding for protein-coding genes are also transcribed from the antisense strand. This antisense transcription often results in products that regulate the activity of their respective sense mRNAs.27 Furthermore, one of the many early high-throughput RNA sequencing techniques, which are collectively named next generation sequencing, unexpectedly found that even retrotransposon element (RE) expression is tightly regulated in mammalian cells and tissues, producing lncRNAs28 which may in turn contribute to regulate RE expression. These and other studies also suggest that lncRNAs are somehow expressed at lower levels than protein-coding mRNAs, are often localized in the nucleus, and generally display time-, tissue-, or even cell-specific expression.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Timeline of the major breakthroughs in the \u201csmart\u201d RNA world, as discussed in this review.Despite initially being met with a large amount of healthy skepticism, the findings that pervasive transcription is one of the most abundant products of the genome have been supported by several prominent studies.29 For instance, in the ENCODE project (Figure 1), next generation CAGE RNA-sequencing confirmed that 62% of the human genome is transcribed and that the main output is noncoding RNAs.30,31 While experimental approaches clearly demonstrated that lncRNAs are indeed transcribed and display specific functions, the interpretation of their biological significance has proven difficult due to their low expression, stability, and conservation, relative to protein-coding RNAs.32 Future studies will be required to disentangle the multiple functions of RNA, which therefore deserves the title \u201csmart\u201d as proposed in our review.Interestingly, the early identification of functional small RNAs, or those less than 200 nt long, was readily accepted by the community. This acceptance was so easily given likely due to the previous discovery of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (see section 3).The discovery of siRNA and miRNA spurred the identification of numerous other classes of small RNAs featuring defined lengths and functions. piRNAs, for example, are 28\u201329 nt long sncRNAs that associate with Miwi, Mili, and Piwi proteins and function to repress the transcription and mobilization of RE, thus contributing to preserve genome integrity in the germline.89 While there is broad acceptance that piRNAs have a fundamental role in the repression of transposable elements, it is unclear why RE expression is not uniformly silenced, allowing for regulated RE activity during embryonic development,90 in embryonic stem cells, and in induced pluripotent stem cells.91Among the vast landscape of small RNAs, some of them do not show a specific length and their interacting partners are less characterized. For example, small RNAs that overlap with transcription starting sites (TSSs), known as promoter associated RNAs (PASRs), and transcription termination sites (TTSs), named termination associated RNAs (TASRs), have been identified but poorly characterized. Some of them have been implicated in regulation of transcription, but much remains to be learned about their biology.92 One standing question regarding PASRs is to which extent they overlap with PROMPTs, a class of unstable RNA degraded by the exosome machinery.93A large fraction of the small ncRNAs derives from processing of lncRNA precursors; thus, the regulation of lncRNA transcription and processing plays an important role in many aspects of small RNA biology. A good example is a novel class of small ncRNAs named DNA damage response RNAs, or DDRNAs, involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and in DNA repair (Figure 1).61,94 DDRNAs are DROSHA- and DICER-dependent products of damage-induced lncRNAs, or dilncRNAs, transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) at the site of DNA damage95 (see section 4.2.2 for details).Due to space constraints, not all known classes of short and long noncoding RNAs could have been discussed here, as the field has dramatically expanded in recent years.2.3. Function Does Not Always Mean Protein-CodingThe concept that the protein-coding-centric view cannot explain vertebrate/mammalian complexity came from the pioneering insights of John Mattick (Garvan Institute of Medical Resarch, Australia). By analyzing the noncoding content of all available genomes, Mattick noticed that the fraction of noncoding DNA in a genome increases progressively from ~30% in prokaryotes to a staggering 98.5% in humans. This observation is in line with a role for many noncoding regions, that are in fact largely transcribed, in fine-tuning protein production during development and in participating in tissue homeostasis maintenance in higher eukaryotes and in particular in mammals.19In parallel, genetic studies also established that a large fraction of the genetic information falls outside the boundaries of the exons of protein-coding genes. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a plethora of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) associated with a large variety of human non-Mendelian diseases, the majority of which falls outside protein-coding regions, often mapping to novel promoter elements and enhancers.96 Enhancer regions are sources of another class of lncRNAs called enhancers RNAs (eRNAs). Although their functions are not fully known, in some cases eRNAs are involved in transcription activation through chromatin looping.97 Further, recent studies have identified lncRNAs putatively involved with the molecular cause of some human diseases.98 Altogether, genetic evidence, together with sequence conservation at promoter or exons of lncRNAs, suggests that at least 19,000 human lncRNAs may be functional. A very recent study supports a cell-type specific role for lncRNAs in transcriptional activation.99 In contrast with many small RNAs, such as miRNAs, lncRNAs lack a common, unified function, therefore requiring more intensive investigations to address their activity.Many lncRNAs are restricted to the nucleus, where some have structural roles, as in the case of paraspeckles, subnuclear bodies constituted by ncRNAs and proteins.100 Other nuclear lncRNAs are associated with chromatin where they contribute to regulation of the epigenome. A few examples include HOTAIR,101\nXIST,102 and lncRNAs associated with imprinted loci. Novel technologies will be essential to map specific RNA-chromatin interactions and to dissect all the functions of chromatin-bound lncRNAs.Antisense transcription is another essential source of ncRNA, impacting either positively or negatively on canonical gene expression.103 When antisense RNAs are exported to the cytoplasm, they can also regulate RNA stability27 as well as protein translation. For example, one peculiar class of antisense RNAs that act as translation regulators, SINEUPs, enhance the translation of the mRNAs they overlap through a SINE element embedded in the nonoverlapping part of the antisense.104,105 Curiously, various lncRNAs may act as SINEUPs, independent of their origin, suggesting that RNA structure, rather than its primary sequence, is most important.106It is therefore becoming apparent that ncRNAs play diverse and important functions in the cell. An additional layer of complexity is given by the unexpected engagement of ncRNAs, and components of their pathways, in other fundamental mechanisms of the cell, such as the response to DNA damage. 3.\u2003RNA INTERFERENCE PATHWAYRNAi, the process by which RNAs inhibit gene expression by sequence-specifically base-pairing with other RNAs, was initially described in plants and fungi as a peculiar yet effective mechanism to preserve genome integrity and protect against viruses and transposons.33,34 Later, RNAi was detected in a broad variety of other eukaryotic organisms35-39 and acknowledged as a more general strategy through which cells finely tune gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. By now, RNAi has been used for over two decades as a tool to study and manipulate gene function.The first evidence that a long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was responsible for triggering sequence-specific silencing of a target gene was provided in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, who coined the term RNA interference.35 Shortly after, other groups proposed a different model for this phenomenon in which small RNAs, released by cleavage of long dsRNA precursors, were the actual effectors of the post-transcriptional gene silencing; hence, they named them short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).40-43siRNAs are double-stranded RNA molecules, 20\u201325 base pairs in length, known to cause the degradation of the perfect complementary target RNA. siRNAs can be produced from RNA transcribed in the nucleus (endogenous siRNAs), or they can be virally derived or experimentally introduced as chemically synthesized dsRNA (exogenous siRNAs). Endogenous siRNAs have been described in plants and in C. elegans, and they can originate from overlapping sense and antisense transcripts44 or from repeat-associated genomic regions.45 To exert their function, siRNAs must be unwound and loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC complex contains Argonaute (AGO) proteins, which display the endonucleolytic activity responsible for cleavage of the target RNA. In mammals, there are four AGO proteins (1\u20134) that can participate to the RISC complex, but only AGO2 is catalytically active and functions for the direct degradation of the target mRNA.46 Only one of the two strands of the siRNA duplex (the guide strand) is loaded into the RISC complex, whereas the other strand, known as the passenger strand, is released and degraded.47 Endogenous siRNAs are thought to play an important role in defending genomes against transposable elements, as well as foreign nucleic acids, such as viruses.Another class of endogenous small RNAs also capable of eliciting RNAi was discovered by Victor Ambros and colleagues in 1993, and they were later named microRNAs (miRNAs).48-51 miRNAs have been revealed to play important roles in almost every cellular process investigated.52 The biogenesis of most miRNAs requires the RNase III DICER and the Microprocessor complex, which is composed of the other RNase III DROSHA and the dsRNA binding protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8).53 In the canonical pathway for miRNA biogenesis, an RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) dependent, single stranded, and capped primary RNA (pri-miRNA) is first processed by the Microprocessor complex in the nucleus, transforming it into a ~70-nucleotide hairpin-structured precursor RNA (pre-miRNA), which is then exported to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, some pre-miRNAs are produced from very short introns, called mirtrons, as a result of splicing and debranching,54 thereby bypassing the requirement of the Microprocessor complex. In the cytoplasm, cleavage by DICER, that works together with TRBP (transactivation-responsive RNA binding protein) and PACT (protein activator of PKR),55 results in a 20\u201323 nt miRNA duplex.56 Differently from siRNAs, miRNAs can exert their function either by triggering the degradation of the cognate mRNAs or by preventing their translation. Efficient mRNA targeting requires base-pairing of nucleotides 2 to 8 at the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA, the so-called \u201cseed region\u201d, with the target mRNA. The degree of complementarity between the seed region and target mRNA determines if silencing is induced through translational repression, the potential results of imperfect complementarity, or through cleavage, the result of perfect complementarity. As for siRNAs, the guide strand is preferentially incorporated into the RISC complex, which came to be known as \u201cmiRISC\u201d following the discovery of its association with miRNA. In some cases, the passenger strand (designated as miRNA*) can also enter the miRISC complex to guide gene silencing. The miRISC complex also contains members of the GW182 (glycine-tryptophan protein of 182 kDa) family, which coordinate translational inhibition and the consequent mRNApoly(A)-tail shortening.57Components of RISC are thought to localize and function just in the cytoplasm. However, in human cells RNAi has been demonstrated to mediate repression of target RNAs in the nucleus as well.583.1. DICER, DROSHA, and DGCR8: Emerging New Roles in Transcription RegulationA growing body of evidence has unveiled novel miRNA-independent functions for DICER and the Microprocessor complex, ranging from the maintenance of genome integrity to the modulation of alternative splicing.59-64 Here, we focus on the unanticipated roles played by the Microprocessor complex and DICER in the regulation of transcription with important implications in controlling genome stability, sometimes independently from small RNA generation.The function of eukaryotic RNAP II is not limited to faithful copy of the information encoded in the genome, but it takes part in crosstalk with a myriad of other factors involved in the excision, addition, and editing of ribonucleotides in the nascent transcript.65 Among these factors, the Microprocessor complex and DICER turned out to be talkative interlocutors of the RNAP II machinery.Microprocessor, initially found to be cotranscriptionally recruited to miRNA-encoding genomic loci,66 has been lately shown to localize at many different non-miRNA genes, including at superenhancers.67-70 In addition, the affinity of Microprocessor for hairpin structures in nascent RNA was demonstrated to be exploited by the cell to promote premature transcription termination of endogenous retroviral genes via stem-loop excision, a process independent from mature miRNA production.70 This Microprocessor-mediated cut inevitably generates an additional 3\u2032-end in the nascent transcript, consequently providing an early potential alternative transcription termination site and thus inhibiting retroviral gene expression. Interestingly, accurate transcription termination of many miRNA-containing lncRNAs relies on Microprocessor endonucleolytic activity rather than the canonical cleavage-and-polyadenylation pathway.71 Moreover, human DROSHA has also been shown to enhance the expression of a subset of coding genes. Intriguingly, while transcriptional regulation exerted at these loci depends on DROSHA ability to interact with RNAP II, its catalytic activity is instead dispensable.67It is now well established that many RNAi factors are not relegated to the cytoplasm, as initially proposed, but they are functionally active also in the nucleus of different eukaryotes, whereby they guide transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) through the deposition of repressive chromatin marks at silenced loci.58,72 In recent years, a number of reports revealed that Dicer also plays direct roles in nuclear transcriptional regulation. For example, it has been shown that S. pombe mutants lacking Dicer (Dcr1) failed to remove stalled RNAP II at sites of collision between transcription and DNA replication, resulting in accumulation of recombinogenic DNA\u2013RNA hybrids 73-77 and consequent genome instability. Interestingly, the catalytic-dead Dcr-1 mutant was still able to release RNAP II from these loci, suggesting that in this system the ability of Dicer to promote transcriptional termination is independent from the biogenesis of sncRNAs, similarly to the nuclease-independent function of Drosha in transcriptional regulation described above. Nevertheless, Dcr1-mediated sncRNAs could be detected at these loci in wild type strains, though their physiological role remains elusive.78 The presence of Dicer in the nucleus of mammalian cells is instead a subject of debate. While murine DICER seems to be circumscribed to the cytoplasm,79 several reports demonstrated its presence in the nuclei of human cells.80-87 Hence, the functions played by DICER in human nuclei have started to be elucidated only recently. For example, human nuclear DICER was reported to localize to chromosomal regions with paused RNAP II, specifically in the proximity of transcription start sites and polyadenylation signals (PASs).84-86 Occasionally, these sites were found to be associated with R-loops\u2014three-stranded nucleic acid structures composed of a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid and the displaced single-stranded DNA\u2014that triggered the transcription of antisense RNAs.85 The resulting dsRNA formation in turn could lead to the recruitment of DICER, together with other RNAi factors, and the consequent formation of heterochromatin at RNAP II-paused sites, ultimately enforcing TGS.85,86 The presence of DICER at specific PASs, besides its role in transcriptional repression, suggests it may also control alternative transcription termination since DICER-dependent deposition of repressive chromatin marks surrounding such PASs may decrease RNAP II speed, ultimately imposing altered transcription termination at these sites and the production of alternative RNA variants.84The Microprocessor complex and DICER are versatile factors, acting, in addition to their canonical roles, as nuclear transcriptional fine-tuners. Importantly, the ability of DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER to slow down the transcription rate and mitigate DNA\u2013RNA hybrid accumulation, which represents an intrinsic threat for genome integrity,88 suggests a fail-safe mechanism in genome maintenance. 4.\u2003CROSSTALK BETWEEN ncRNA, RNAi, AND THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO DNA DAMAGE4.1. DNA Damage Response (DDR) Cascade and the Moonlighting Functions of DDR Factors as RNA Binding ProteinsThe integrity of our genome is constantly threatened by endogenous and exogenous agents.107 Cells have evolved a coordinated set of events to recognize the damage and promptly fix it, thus avoiding the replication and perpetuation of a compromised template. The DNA damage response (DDR) cascade is dependent on a broad variety of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, poly(ADP-ribosylation), acetylation, and methylation.107-110 These modifications are recognized by specific protein domains, thereby orchestrating the recruitment of DDR factors to the DNA damage sites and ultimately the spreading of the signal throughout the cell. If the lesion cannot be repaired, persistent DDR activation may induce cell death by apoptosis or a permanent cell-cycle arrest called cellular senescence, both of which are known cellular intrinsic barriers to tumorigenesis.111Until recently, the DDR signaling cascade was thought to consist entirely of proteins. The discovery of novel species of small ncRNAs directly implicated in upstream activation of the DDR in 201261,94 and of long ncRNAs induced at the site of DNA breaks in 201795 has radically changed this perspective (see section 4.2 for details). Moreover, other noncoding RNAs have been shown to serve as templates for DNA repair (see section 6 for details) or to guide genomic rearrangements (see section 7 for details). Interestingly, during the past decade, large-scale proteomic analyses and genome-wide screens have revealed that an unexpected proportion of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and proteins involved in transcription are involved in the DDR112 and that, conversely, factors originally discovered as guardians of genomic integrity show an affinity for RNA.113 Indeed the number of dual DNA- and RNA-binding proteins has surprisingly grown.114Thus, the unexpected relationship between proteins involved in the DNA damage response and RNA may be important for the maintenance of genome stability.4.1.1.  DNA Damage Response to DNA Double-Strand Breaks. Among the different types of lesions that may threaten our genome, DSBs are the most dangerous since they may lead to loss of genetic materials and chromosomal rearrangements, predisposing cells to malignant transformation. The repair of a DSB relies on either homology-dependent or -independent mechanisms.115,116 Homologous recombination (HR) is a homology-dependent and error-free mechanism that requires a homologous template, usually a sister chromatid, which allows accurate repair of postreplicative DSBs during S and G2 phases of the cell-cycle.117 In contrast, classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) is a homology-independent mechanism active throughout the entire cell-cycle; although highly efficient, its very simple mechanism of basic religation, without proof-reading, makes NHEJ amenable to errors and thus to introduce mutations.118 NHEJ involves no or limited processing of DNA ends, while HR requires the formation of 3\u2032 single-stranded overhangs. Thus, a critical step for the cellular choice between the two pathways is the DNA end resection.DSBs are powerful activators of two large serine/threonine phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIIKKs): ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)119). Exposure of single-stranded DNA is instead recognized by a third PIKK named ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR).119 The recruitment of these apical kinases to the lesions leads to the local phosphorylation in cis of the histone variant H2AX at serine 139 (named \u03b3H2AX), a key step in the nucleation of the DDR. Following the first burst of H2AX phosphorylation, the ATM kinase phosphorylates many substrates, including mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). These phosphorylation events fuel a positive feedback loop that facilitates the recruitment of additional ATM molecules to the DSB site120,121 and the spreading of \u03b3H2AX up to megabases away from the lesion. This signal amplification results in the accumulation of numerous copies of various DDR factors at and flanking the DSB, forming cytologically visible foci.The localization of DDR factors to DSBs has been described as a two-phase process in which the initial recruitment occurs by the direct recognition of the DNA lesion in a \u03b3H2AX-independent manner, followed by accumulation of DDR proteins at the damaged site in a \u03b3H2AX-dependent manner.122,123 During the first phase, the DNA ends are promptly recognized by specialized factors: the KU70/KU80 heterodimer (or KU), the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). A precise distinction of instances in which different DSB sensors are individually engaged, the timing of their recruitment, and whether they cooperate or compete with each other for the same DNA end are all issues that are only now becoming clearer. Likely, the nature of the break, the chromatin environment, the cell-cycle phase during the damaging event, and the cell type are all elements to take into account when attempting to answer these open questions.4.1.1.1.  KU. The KU70/KU80 heterodimer (KU) is a ring-shaped complex that encloses the DNA ends and recruits the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which phosphorylates itself, H2AX, and other targets, thereby initiating the classical nonhomologous end joining (C-NHEJ) repair pathway.119 It has been reported that KU binds to the RNA component of telomerase both in yeast124-126 and in human cells127 (see section 8.1 for details about KU and telomere maintenance). KU has been found at promoter regions regulating gene expression128,129 and also in a complex with elongating RNAP II.130 Finally, it has been shown that treating pre-extracted cells with RNase A increases the detection by immunofluorescence of KU and other NHEJ factors at DSBs, indicating that a large fraction of these proteins are bound to RNA in the cell.1314.1.1.2.  MRN. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) heterotrimeric complex plays important roles in detection and signaling of DSBs, as well as in initial processing of DNA ends prior to repair. The cohesin-like RAD50 protein interacts with MRE11 via its ATPase domains forming the globular head of the complex, and by dimerizing it ensures stable clamping and tethering of the complex to DNA ends.132 NBS1 interacts with MRE11 and is instead responsible for the nuclear localization of the complex and for the local recruitment of ATM to DSBs where it gets activated. MRE11 possesses 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease and 5\u2032 overhang endonuclease activities, which, together with the auxiliary endonuclease C-terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP), are essential for the initial steps of DNA end resection. In mammalian cells, the MRN complex has not been involved in the C-NHEJ; however, together with CtIP, it regulates alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ), which utilizes short microhomologies to direct repair.132Given the distinct pathways in which they act, MRN and KU were considered mutually exclusive at DNA ends. However, by high resolution microscopy a certain degree of colocalization between KU and MRN at individual DNA ends was observed.131 Very recently, it has been shown that MRN can indeed access KU-blocked DNA ends by diffusion onto nucleosome-coated DNA.133 Excitingly, two independent studies reported that KU functions as a protein block stimulating yeast MRN-CtIP endonuclease cleavage in vitro.134,135So far, there is no evidence suggesting that MRN is capable of binding RNA. However, MRN does appear to be involved in RNAP II transcription following DNA damage. Indeed, RAD50 has been found to interact with RNAP II upon UV-irradiation.136 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that all three components of the complex bind to RNAP II upon ionizing radiations and are important for damage-induced transcription at DSBs95 (see section 4.2.2 for details).4.1.1.3.  PAR. PARylation is the process by which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) covalently attach (poly)ADP-ribose (PAR) units to Glu, Lys, or Asp residues of acceptor proteins or PARP itself. The activity of the three major PARPs, PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3, is induced by DNA damage: PARP1 is activated by single-strand breaks, DNA cross-links, stalled replication forks, and DSBs; PARP2 recognizes gaps and flap structures; PARP3 selectively responds to DSBs.137,138 PARPs are efficiently and transiently recruited to DSBs, for example during the first 5 min of laser microirradiation, where they have been proposed to orchestrate chromatin decondensation and the subsequent accessibility to the damage sites of a variety of factors, ranging from chromatin remodelers to transcription factors.139 Indeed PARPs are known to promote chromatin decompaction at promoters and to facilitate the loading of RNAP II machinery at transcription start sites.140PAR is a nucleic acid-like molecule, and it can be recognized by RNA-binding domains such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the RGG motifs, regions rich in arginines (R) and glycines (G) present in several RNA-binding proteins. Thus, it is not surprising that PAR and RNA can compete for the same RBPs; an example of this is the case of the RNA-binding protein NONO which is recruited to DSBs in a PAR-dependent manner.141 Therefore, changes in the local concentration of either of these molecules may dynamically alter the assembly of protein complexes, which, in turn, may affect cellular processes including the DDR.142A good example of a factor involved in the DDR that can promiscuously bind to PAR chains and to RNA molecules is the heterochromatin protein HP1.143,144 HP1 has been shown to rapidly localize to sites of DNA damage in a PAR-dependent manner, subsequently being displaced and then slowly recruited again.145 Interestingly, HP1 requires an RNA component to bind to pericentric heterochromatin,146 and its hinge domain can bind both DNA and RNA.147Another example is FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma), a member of the FET family of RNA/DNA binding proteins,148 which is a multifunctional factor with reported roles in splicing, transcription, mRNA export and translation, and the DDR. Initially identified as a fusion oncoprotein, FUS was later implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.149 In response to DNA damage, FUS is rapidly and transiently recruited to DSBs, likely through the interaction between its RGG domain and PAR.150-152 Interestingly, the same domain mediates the recruitment of FET proteins to paraspeckles by direct binding to the lncRNA NEAT1.153 In the absence of FUS, the localization of some DDR factors, such as 53BP1, to the site of damage is reduced and the efficiency of both HR and NHEJ is compromised.150,154 It has been shown that DSBs trigger local ncRNA transcription95 (see sections 4.2.2 for details). Given the ability of FUS to bind RNA, an exciting possibility is that FUS accumulation at DSBs could be modulated by RNA, in synergy or in competition with PAR chains.The PAR-dependent localization to sites of DNA damage of several RNA binding factors occurs in two steps: beginning with a transient recruitment and ending with exclusion.141,150,155 It is therefore tempting to speculate that such dynamic behavior can also be mediated by the damage-induced lncRNAs (see section 4.2.2 for details), possibly due to waves of transcription correlating with the bimodal dynamics of chromatin relaxation and compaction at the site of break.4.1.1.4.  DNA Damage Mediators: MDC1, 53BP1. MDC1, which directly binds \u03b3H2AX, has surprisingly been found in an RNA interactome capture screen, an unbiased approach to identify protein\u2013polyA RNA direct interactions.156 Interestingly, MOF (orthologue of Drosophila males absent on the first, or MYST1), a histone acetyltransferase shown to be important for MDC1 localization to DSBs, can also bind to ncRNA.157 Moreover, it has been observed that irradiation-induced MDC1 foci are reduced upon treatment with RNase A or in the absence of DICER or DROSHA61,158 (see section 4.2.1 for details).Recruitment of 53BP1 to damaged DNA requires the presence of both monoubiquitinated H2A on lysine 15 (H2AK15ub) and dimethylated histone H4 on lysine 20 (H4K20me2).110 53BP1 associates with methylated histones through its tandem Tudor domain, which is usually found in RNA-binding proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that 53BP1 can be immunoprecipitated together with RNA molecules from cell lysates, and RNase A treatment in permeabilized living cells dissociates 53BP1 from IR-induced foci, which can reassemble in an RNA-dependent manner.61,158,159 Moreover, 53BP1, together with components of the C-NHEJ pathway, has been found in a complex with RNAP II in human cells160 (see section 6.3 for details). More recently, 53BP1 has been demonstrated to immunoprecipitate selectively with dilncRNAs and DDRNAs generated at sites of DSBs, in a manner dependent on its tandem Tudor domain95-(see section 4.2.2 for details).These examples, though not an exhaustive list, are those that best point to the emerging evidence of an intimate and complex relationship between the DDR factors and RNA, and likely more is yet to come.4.2. Discovery of Damage-Induced Transcription at the Site of DNA Breaks4.2.1.  DNA Damage Response Small ncRNA (DDRNA). Emerging evidence suggests that noncanonical transcription, in the form of damage-induced small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), occurs at DNA damage sites.3-5,7,73,75 The existence of ncRNA species induced upon DNA damage and the involvement of RNA in DNA repair processes were originally reported in lower organisms such as yeast and fungi. For example, in Neurospora crassa, quelling and DNA damage-induced small RNAs (qiRNAs) are produced upon treatment with DNA damaging agents. qiRNA biogenesis involves a single-stranded precursor, called aberrant RNA (aRNA),161 which is converted into double-stranded RNA by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity and processed into small RNA through the same mechanisms that generate RNAi. qiRNA generation shares the same genetic requirements of the HR pathway; indeed, it depends on on replication protein A (RPA)161 and DNA replication.162 Mutations of genes involved in qiRNA biogenesis sensitize Neurospora strains to DNA damage.163qiRNA seem to be mainly induced from repetitive or foreign sequences. Indeed they are transcribed from rDNA, but also of multiple copies of transgenes, acting as transgene-specific endogenous siRNA counteracting the expansion of selfish genetic elements.164 A similar phenomenon has also been described in rice where rDNA exposed to DNA damage locally generates high levels of RecQ DNA helicase- and RdRP-dependent double-stranded sncRNAs, which are required for cell viability after DNA damage exposure.165Interestingly, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which lacks RNAi machinery,166 pre-existing RNA can serve as the template for DNA synthesis during repair of a chromosomal DSB and thereby mediate recombination167-169 (see section 6 for additional details). Another link that connects RNA to maintenance of genome integrity in S. cerevisiae lies in the RNA exonucleases Xrn1, Rrp6, and Trf4. These exonucleases were previously implicated in protecting genome stability from DNA\u2013RNA hybrids and transcription-associated hyper-recombination170 but have more recently been shown to control also the activation of Mec1/ATR during DSB-induced DDR.171 While Xrn1 appears to be required for DNA end resection at the initial steps of HR, Rrp6 and Trf4 are dispensable for the resection process itself but are essential for replication protein A (RPA), a ubiquitous single-strand DNA binding protein, loading onto ssDNA.171 RPA affinity for ssDNA is very high; thus, it is interesting that factors related to RNA processing are important for this interaction. However, differently from factors involved in qiRNA production in Neurospora, yeast Xrn1, Rrp6, and Trf4 are not required for completion of later steps of HR repair.171In D. melanogaster, it has been shown that although exposed DNA ends of a plasmid are sufficient to induce the generation of sncRNAs,172 they function to repress transcription of adjacent genes, rather than play a role in the DNA repair process.173 However, it was recently proposed that splicing factors may stimulate sncRNA generation at a DSB generated by CRISPR-Cas9 downstream of an intron in cultured Drosophila cells.174 Interestingly, the authors suggest that when RNAP II reaches the DNA end, the cotranscriptional spliceosome triggers a signal for the generation of an antisense transcript, potentially also stimulated by the formation of an R-loop, which then pairs with the sense transcript generating the dsRNA long precursor of the sncRNAs. They also hypothesize that a modification of the RNA polymerase complex may enable a strand switch and therefore allow for synthesis of a long RNA hairpin.174Excitingly, different groups have established a direct link between DNA damage and the local generation of sncRNAs in mammalian cells. DDRNAs have the sequence of the damaged locus and are processed by the RNAi (see section 3.1 for details) machinery factors DROSHA and DICER61 (Figure 2). The key difference between DDRNAs and canonical miRNAs is that DDRNAs can carry virtually any genomic sequence, as they are generated where DNA damage occurs. DDRNAs appear to be required for the full activation of DDR signaling158 by mediating DDR foci assembly. In brief, DROSHA or DICER knockdown, but not the silencing of downstream RNAi effectors, impairs MDC1, the activated form of ATM and 53BP1 focal accumulation without affecting phosphorylation of H2AX.158 In agreement with these findings, it has been shown that DICER gets phosphorylated upon DNA damage and translocates to the nucleus where it associates with DSB sites, being necessary for full recruitment of 53BP1 and MDC1.87 A very recent work also confirmed that DROSHA and DICER, but not the silencing of downstream RNAi effectors, are necessary for 53BP1 focal accumulation and that DROSHA is involved in DNA repair by both HR and NHEJ.175Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Proposed model for dilncRNA and DDRNA generation and activity at sites of DNA damage. Upon DSB induction, MRN recruits RNAP II to DNA ends triggering the bidirectional synthesis of dilncRNA-from (blue) and, less abundantly, of dilncRNA-to (light blue). DROSHA and DICER process the long double-stranded RNA, likely the outcome of paired or folded dilncRNAs, generating DDRNAs which, in turn, pair with nascent unprocessed single-stranded dilncRNAs. Together, DDRNAs and dilncRNAs bind to DDR factors and fuel DDR focus formation. Interfering with the interaction between dilncRNAs and DDRNAs through antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) allows site-specific inhibition of DDR. Adapted from Michelini et al., Nature Cell Biology 2017.These results suggest that the focal concentration of diffusible DDR proteins can be regulated by sncRNAs. Indeed, the degradation of RNA by transient treatment with RNase A in a permeabilized living cell dissociates 53BP1, MDC1, and pATM from DNA damage sites.61,158,159 In a system in which a single DSB can be introduced in a traceable locus, RNase A treatment was sufficient to disassemble 53BP1 focus. Strikingly, upon incubation with RNA purified from cells damaged in parallel, but not from parental cells lacking the cleavable site, the 53BP1 focus reassembled. Similarly, incubation with total RNA extracted from cells in which DICER or DROSHA were silenced, or genetically inactivated, did not allow for DDR foci reformation following RNase A treatment.61,158 Together, these data indicate that DDRNAs contain the sequence of the damaged site and that their generation depends on DROSHA and DICER. Indeed, NGS approaches confirmed the DSB-induced production of sequence-specific DDRNAs, displaying a size consistent with DICER and DROSHA products. When chemically synthesized and reintroduced into RNaseA-treated cells, DDRNAs allowed site-specific DDR focus formation, demonstrating that they can function in trans and in the absence of mRNAs.61,158 Notably, DDRNAs are not required for the direct recognition of the DNA lesion, being instead stimulators of DDR foci assembly on \u03b3H2AX-decorated chromatin.158 It makes sense, then, that the early DDR step of NBS1 association to sites of DNA damage is not sensitive to global RNA degradation,158 similar to what has been described for the DNA damage sensor KU.131 It thus seems that the modification of chromatin (\u03b3H2AX) and the local synthesis of DDRNA are the two events required to form the large structures known as DDR foci.Other studies have confirmed the requirement of DICER- and DROSHA-dependent sncRNAs for the recruitment of DDR factors involved in DNA repair, such as RAD51 and BRCA1, together with histone modifier enzymes such as methyltransferase MMSET (WHSC1) and the acetyltransferase Tip60/KAT5.176 Thus, sequence-specific sncRNAs may act as guiding molecules for the localization to and/or the activation of different utilities, such as for instance chromatin remodelers, at broken DNA ends.75The existence of a class of similar 21 nt-long small RNAs, named DSB-induced RNAs (diRNAs), has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and in mammalian cells.94 diRNAs are induced by DSBs in an ATR-dependent manner, are transcribed from the vicinity of the DSBs by plant RNA polymerase IV, and play a role in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway.94 Differently from mammalian DDRNAs, diRNA biogenesis in plants requires not only DICER-like protein but also the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, as well as AGO2.94 In human cells, diRNAs generated from the sequence surrounding the DSB were shown to control recruitment of RAD51 to damaged sites via a direct interaction between the diRNA-AGO2 complex and RAD51, thus promoting HR-mediated DNA repair events.177 In the proposed model, the diRNA-AGO2 complex anneals either to homologous broken DNA or to chromatin-bound transcripts originating from the target locus, suggesting that a homing mechanism via DNA:RNA or RNA:RNA paring may mediate the activity of diRNA in trans and influence DNA repair pathway choice. Another study in A. thaliana suggests that diRNAs do not act exclusively in HR-mediated repair but also play a role in NHEJ.178 Consistent with a direct role played by local transcripts in the process of NHEJ, it has been shown that RNAP II and nascent mRNA associate with factors of classical NHEJ and that RNA can serve as template for error-free DNA repair in mammalian cells160 (see section 6.3 for details).Recently, the role of diRNAs and AGO2 in DNA repair has been challenged. By the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN technologies, it was shown that diRNAs are poorly induced upon DSB induction at endogenous genomic regions and that AGO2 inactivation does not affect HR in A. thaliana and in rice.179 These controversial observations indicate that we are far from fully understanding the biogenesis and functions of DNA damage-associated sncRNAs.Although they appear to be part of the same phenomenon, DDRNA and diRNA present essential differences both in the process of their biogenesis and in their function. A first difference is that sequencing of diRNAs reveals that they are generated starting from a few hundred bases away from the DNA break.94 Given their above-mentioned involvement in DNA repair by HR, diRNAs might be produced starting where resection stops and dsDNA is left intact. On the other hand, sequencing showed that DDRNAs map very close to DNA ends.61 This difference may also suggest that diRNAs are in fact generated after the initial steps of DDR signaling. Another peculiarity of diRNA biogenesis is the dependency on ATR, which primarily responds to the exposure of single-strand DNA. Because these ATR-activating events occur mainly during resection or replicative stress, a model where diRNAs might be generated after or concomitantly to resection is also supported.The abundance of diRNAs in plants appears to be significantly higher than in mammalian cells, possibly due to the presence of RdRP activity.94 Interestingly, high levels of pre-existing transcription of a transgene correlate with the generation of abundant diRNAs upon CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs.179 However, these highly abundant diRNAs seem to be dispensable for HR. A possible reconciliation model proposed by the authors is that \u201cprimary diRNAs\u201d are low abundant and play a role in DSB repair, while \u201csecondary diRNAs\u201d are more abundant, require active transcription, are not directly involved in DSB repair, but may trigger post transcriptional gene silencing. Indeed, secondary diRNAs may be amplified via a \u201cping-pong\u201d-like mechanism, where primary diRNAs cleave their complementary long transcripts, which, in turn, are converted by RdRPs into double-stranded RNAs and processed by DICER-like proteins to generate a new pool of diRNAs.A similar ping-pong mechanism, by which small RNAs suppress neighboring gene expression, has been proposed in D. melanogaster. According to these findings, endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) are produced from a transfected linearized plasmid, mimicking DNA ends of a genomic DSB.172,173 These data are in line with a role for break-derived sncRNAs in RNA quality control rather than DNA repair.Whether these small RNAs originate from processing of pre-existing transcripts or from de novo transcription at sites of break in mammalian cells has been recently addressed and is discussed in depth in the next section.4.2.2.  Damage-Induced Long ncRNA (dilncRNA). Prompted by the discovery of DDRNAs (see section 4.2.1 for details), the group of d\u2019Adda di Fagagna (IFOM, Italy) in collaboration with the group of Nils Walter (University of Michigan, USA) has more recently probed the transcriptional landscape around a DSB in search of DDRNA precursors. By single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH, see section 9.1 for details) and reverse transcription followed by quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) techniques, a novel class of lncRNAs named damage-induced lncRNAs (dilncRNAs) transcribed by RNAP II upon damage from and toward the DNA ends was uncovered.95,180 Induction of de novo transcription from DSBs was demonstrated in various mammalian cellular systems. For these experiments, multiple endonucleases were used to generate DSBs at exogenous integrated constructs as well as endogenous genomic loci, in both transcribed and non-transcribed regions. dilncRNAs were generated regardless of transcription state, suggesting independence from pre-existing transcription or canonical promoter and enhancer elements. In a similar study by the same team, dilncRNA induction was also shown at dysfunctional telomeres181 (see section 8.3 for details). In light of these observations, it is tempting to speculate that DSBs can themselves act as promoters; additional experiments, however, are needed to understand if the machinery needed for canonical RNAP II transcription, such as the preinitiation complex,182 is required also for dilncRNA generation.The apical DNA damage sensor MRN (see section 4.1.1 for details) has been shown to be required for RNAP II localization to the damaged site and for subsequent dilncRNA transcription.95 Indeed, RNAP II immunoprecipitates with all three components of the MRN complex upon irradiation, although additional studies are needed to understand if the interaction is direct and through which domains and possibly modifications it is mediated. The role of MRN in the production of DDRNA/dilncRNA has been studied by knockdown experiments and by treatment with the small molecule mirin.95 Inhibition of MRN activity by mirin reduces DDR focus reformation when DDRNAs were exogenously added to RNaseA-treated cells.61 This could be because treatment with mirin inhibits dilncRNA synthesis,95 thus reducing the localization of DDRNAs to the site of damage. RNAP II transcription is known to be stimulated by nicks or, more strongly, by a DSB with a 3\u2032-overhang.183,184 Since mirin inhibits both endo- and exonuclease activities of MRN,185 it is tempting to speculate that either, or both, activities are required for RNAP II transcription from the DNA ends. Another possibility is that the reported ability of MRN to unwind DNA ends186 is the step necessary to initiate RNAP II transcription from the DNA ends.As discussed above (see section 4.1.1 for details), KU can bind RNA and RNAP II. Given the newly discovered role of MRN in damage-induced transcription, as well as the possibility of KU and MRN coexisting on the same DNA end131,133 and of KU to stimulate MRN activity,134,135 it will be interesting to determine the contribution, if any, of KU and its crosstalk with MRN in the production of ncRNAs at the site of DNA breaks.In the proposed model (Figure 2), dilncRNAs divergent from and convergent to the DNA ends have the potential to pair and form a double-stranded RNA, which is processed by DROSHA, and then DICER, to generate DDRNAs. Accordingly, Michelini et al. demonstrated by qRT-PCR analyses that dilncRNAs accumulate in DROSHA-depleted damaged cells, while the products of DROSHA processing, called pre-DDRNAs, accumulate in the absence of DICER.95 In the same samples, DDRNAs are induced upon DNA damage and decrease when DROSHA or DICER are silenced. The latter result is also consistent with the characterization of telomeric DDRNAs181 (see section 8.3 for details).The relevance of these ncRNA species in DDR signaling and in DNA repair comes from experiments preventing their transcription or their function. Indeed, a transient inhibition of RNAP II by small molecules, such as alpha-amanitin, prevents global DDR activation downstream of \u03b3H2AX and inhibits DNA repair.95 Excitingly, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (see section 10 for details) against dilncRNAs and DDRNAs (Figure 2) are able to reduce 53BP1 accumulation and DNA repair at individual genomic loci with an unprecedented degree of specificity.95By intracellular single molecule high resolution localization and counting (iSHiRLoC, see section 9.4 for details), fluorescently labeled DDRNAs localize to the damaged site through base-pairing with unprocessed dilncRNAs emerging from the DSB, and this interaction is fundamental to fully activate the DDR.95These events are not unprecedented. Indeed in S. pombe, small RNAs generated by DICER bind to a nascent transcript, which is also their precursor, and together maintain the epigenetic and genetic stability of the centromeric locus.166 According to this so-called \u201cnascent transcript\u201d model, the unstable 2kb-long nascent transcript, synthesized by RNAP II preferably from one strand of the centromeric region,187,188 is converted to dsRNA by RdRPs or by pairing to an antisense transcript. This double-stranded RNA is then processed either by an RNAi pathway-dependent mechanism involving DICER or by RNAi pathway-independent mechanisms, such as the RNA degradation pathway of the Trf4/Air2/Mtr4 (TRAMP), and the exosome complexes.189 The resulting siRNA is loaded into the RITS (RNA-induced transcriptional silencing) complex, where the release of one of the two strands takes place generating mature Ago1-bound single-stranded siRNA.45 The base pairings between the mature small RNAs component of the RITS complex and the nascent transcripts, but not the underlying DNA, are central for the recruitment of enzymes responsible for H3K9 methylation, a repressive histone mark, of the centromeric locus, and enforcement of transcriptional gene silencing.190 Moreover, Ago1 slicing activity may contribute to the production of additional siRNAs and to the exhaustion of pericentromeric RNA in a self-sustaining loop. In this scenario, chromatin-associated nascent transcripts are not just the precursors of siRNAs, but they also act as local platforms for the coordinated assembly of chromatin remodelers guided by the siRNAs to the complementary target regions. A similar \u201cnascent transcript\u201d mechanism may also take place during the formation of a DDR focus. Michelini et al. showed that 53BP1 associates with in situ generated DDRNAs and dilncRNAs in a manner dependent on its Tudor domain.95 The localization of DDRNAs to the damaged site through base-pairing with nascent dilncRNAs may represent one of the mechanisms by which 53BP1 is selectively recruited to DSBs, and potentially a common mechanism for the recruitment of other DDR proteins. However, it will be important to investigate whether this interaction is direct, as well as to assess the possible role of Argonaute proteins in the DDR version of the \u201cnascent transcript\u201d model.Several reports have shown that DSBs within a transcriptional unit suppress canonical gene expression,74,191 thus avoiding the transcription of a damaged template. This appears to be in contrast with the observed de novo transcription at DSBs. Once again, the literature on the S. pombe centromeric locus comes in handy. The apparent paradox of yeast cotranscriptional gene silencing, requiring a certain level of transcription to shut down transcription of specific genomic loci, has been recently solved. Indeed, the RNAi-mediated local concentration of chromatin remodelers and their residence time on the target sequence need to be above a certain threshold in order to switch off transcription and maintain the epigenetic marks.190,192 It is therefore possible that damage-induced ncRNA transcription is a similarly tightly regulated mechanism shaping the chromatin surrounding a DSB to induce the suppression of pre-existing gene expression. In S. pombe, it has been demonstrated that de novo transcription is induced at sites of DNA damage and that these newly synthesized RNA molecules anneal with their DNA templates resulting in transient DNA\u2013RNA hybrids required for efficient DSB repair via HR.193 Notably, two very recent studies, exploiting the same endonuclease-based model system, acknowledged the presence of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids at DBSs also in mammalian cells.175,194 In particular, it has been proposed that DROSHA is involved in the accumulation of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids at DSBs175 and that Senataxin, a well characterized R-loop helicase, is recruited at DSBs induced in transcribed genomic regions, where it removes such DNA\u2013RNA hybrids, promotes RAD51 loading, and prevents translocations.194 Future studies on this topic will have to take into account the existence of additional layers of complexity such as the kinetics of the events starting from DNA damage induction in a given cell type and cell-cycle phase. Indeed, the demand for novel approaches taking into account any heterogeneity in the cell population, such as single-cell resolution techniques (see section 9 for details), has become necessary among scientists that deal with quantitative analysis of siRNA-mediated epigenetic silencing.190The discovery that each DDR focus relies not only on a common set of shared proteins but also on a set of RNA molecules generated in situ, that individually mark DDR events at distinct genomic loci, represents a leap forward in the understanding of the DDR pathways that may, in the future, be exploited for therapeutic purposes. 5.\u2003RNA SPLICING AND DNA DAMAGE5.1. Splicing, a Brief OverviewSplicing is a complex mechanism by which noncoding intronic sequences are precisely removed from the primary gene transcript (pre-mRNA) to generate a mature mRNA molecule, and its regulation is key in all aspects of cell physiology and pathology. Intron removal is carried out by a large molecular machine, the spliceosome, which is assembled on the pre-mRNA in a stepwise manner and is composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoparticles, named snRNPs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and a large number of proteins.199 The spliceosome recognizes short sequence elements with a loose consensus at exon\u2013intron boundaries (5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites) as well as the branch point located near the 3\u2032 splice site.200The weak and dynamic interactions between the spliceosome and the pre-mRNA can be modulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which associate to splicing regulatory sequence elements. These elements are particularly relevant for the selection of splice sites that deviate from the consensus sequences (weak sites) and either stimulate (intronic and exonic enhancers) or repress (intronic and exonic silencers) their recognition, thus affecting the splicing outcome. The list of RBPs involved in this regulation is continuously expanding and includes, but is not limited to, the serine/arginine (SR) family of splicing factors and a group of proteins that bind to heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNP proteins). The partial degeneration of splice site sequences and the possibility to modulate their recognition through protein complexes assembled on enhancers and silencers allow for numerous events of alternative splicing to occur for each transcript. By using various combinations of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites, and the respective regulatory proteins that bind them, alternative splicing (AS) is capable of generating different mRNAs from a single pre-mRNA.201 The vast majority (>90%) of human genes display AS events,202 which are modulated not only during development in a cell-type dependent manner but also in response to a wide range of stimuli or stressing conditions, including DNA damage.203-206Splicing decisions may be modulated by chromatin organization, in particular nucleosome positioning207 and histone modifications,208-210 and by the elongation rate of RNAP II.201,211 The influence of this latter factor on splicing decisions stems from the fact that the assembly of the spliceosome occurs cotranscriptionally;212 thus, the elongation rate of RNAP II determines the time window available for a weak upstream splice site to interact with splicing factors before a competing stronger downstream splice site is transcribed.213 A key player in coordinating transcription with splicing is the CTD (C-terminal domain) of RNAP II that acts as landing pad for numerous splicing factors.214 The recruitment coupling model suggests that the phosphorylation status of the CTD, which is controlled by numerous factors, including DNA damage, determines the set of RBPs recruited to the transcriptional apparatus.215By integrating different levels of regulatory events (chromatin organization, abundance of RBPs, post-translational modifications of RBPs and RNAP II), alternative splicing represents an ideal mechanism to finely tune gene expression in response to cell growth or stressing conditions, including DNA lesions.5.2. Reciprocal Interaction between DNA Damage and SplicingIt is now becoming apparent that a reciprocal interaction exists between DNA damage generation and the regulation of alternative splicing. The impact of DNA damage on splicing profiles has been addressed in detail in several excellent reviews.203-206,216 We will briefly discuss here only a few recent examples to illustrate how complex the interplay between DNA damage and regulation of AS can be.A novel link between AS and the DDR has recently been discovered: detained introns (DIs), a new class of introns that exhibit delayed splicing.217 DI-containing transcripts are usually retained in the cell nucleus and form a reservoir of ready-to-use molecules, that, for example, can be called upon under conditions of impaired transcription. Notably, a subset of DIs, waiting in the nucleus for a signal, is spliced in response to DNA damage. Following DNA damage, a coordinated expression of specific splicing variants occurs, among which it is worth mentioning MDM4 and BCLAF1 that, respectively, control p53 and BRCA1 functions. The impact that DNA damage has on the splicing profile of BCLAF1 transcripts has important biological consequences. Indeed, in response to doxorubicin the pool of nuclear BCLAF1 transcripts containing DIs is halved while the level of protein-coding mRNA is up-regulated.217 Moreover, BCLAF1 protein is excluded, along with the splicing factor THRAP3 and RNAP II, from DNA damage sites in a process that depends on ATM activity.218 As a consequence, BCLAF1 protein is available to form a complex with BRCA1 phosphorylated by ATM. This complex recruits a number of splicing proteins, including Prp8, U2AF65, U2AF35, and SF3B, to a set of genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair, thus connecting DDR signaling activation with cotranscriptional splicing and mRNA stability.219Since DNA damage can control the splicing profile of genes involved in the DDR, it would be expected that splicing inhibition may play a role in the response to DNA damage. This hypothesis has been recently verified by showing that a short period of splicing inhibition prior to irradiation impairs IR-induced DNA damage foci formation.220,221 Furthermore, two natural compounds that affect the assembly of the spliceosome, namely the macrolide pladienolide B, which targets the splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) of the U2 snRNP,222 and the biflavonoid isoginkgetin, which prevents the recruitment of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP,223 reduce ubiquitylation of damaged chromatin which is required for the assembly of DNA repair complexes. In particular, splicing inhibition impairs the recruitment to damaged sites of WRAP53\u03b2, RNF168, 53BP1, BRCA1, and RAD51, without affecting \u03b3H2AX and MDC1 signals, which are known to be recruited in a ubiquitin independent manner. This effect is due to the reduced expression of the short-lived E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8,220 rather than a direct effect on DNA damage foci stability. Interestingly, the decreased expression of RNF8 partially explains the defective DNA repair observed after depletion of various splicing factors, thereby demonstrating the importance of splicing factors to genome stability.224One of the best characterized examples of a splicing factor with a role in the DDR is the ubiquitin ligase PRP19, also known as Pso4 for Psoralen 4 gene, which is part of a large multiprotein complex comprising six additional subunits.225 PRP19/Pso4 acts at several levels of RNA metabolism (Figure 3): it modifies PRP3, a component of U4 snRNP, with a nonproteolytic ubiquitin chain that enhances protein\u2013protein interactions and stabilizes the U4/U6.U5 complex;226 it interacts with RNAP II and recruits the TREX complex, which is involved in mRNA export, to transcribed genes;227 it forms a complex with U2AF65, which participates in the CTD-dependent coupling of splicing to transcription.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.PRP19/Pso4 as an example of a splicing factor involved in the DNA damage response and repair. PRP19/Pso4 is a ubiquitin ligase involved in RNA splicing and mRNA export. It is also implicated in DNA repair: it colocalizes with the replication clamp PCNA, and its downregulation increases spontaneous DSBs; it interacts with Werner DNA helicase participating to the interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair; it associates to Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) protein playing a role in the transcription-coupled DNA repair; it participates to homologous recombination by regulating BRCA1 protein levels, binding to RPA-coated single-strand DNA, stimulating RPA ubiquitylation, and consequently ATRIP recruitment to stalled replication forks.A large body of data implicates PRP19/Pso4 in the DDR (Figure 3). The PRP19/Pso4 was initially identified as an essential DNA repair factor in S. cerevisiae229 and it is one of the numerous human RBPs implicated in DNA repair.230 Accordingly, its down-regulation increases the sensitivity of human cells to spontaneous DSBs as well as to hydroxyurea or PARP inhibitor treatments. This may be related to the fact that PRP19/Pso4 colocalizes with the replication clamp PCNA both during unperturbed cell-cycle and in response to replication stress inducers such as hydroxyurea or camptothecin.231,232 In addition, PRP19/Pso4 participates in the interstand cross-link DNA repair pathway by interacting with Werner DNA helicase233 and in the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway through association with Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) protein.234 PRP19/Pso4 also plays a role in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway by regulating the protein levels of BRCA1 and the generation of single-stranded DNA at DSBs.231 This latter function most likely involves the ability of PRP19/Pso4 to bind RPA-coated single-stranded DNA.232,235 Binding to RPA is required for PRP19/Pso4 localization to sites of DNA damage and for the ensuing RPA ubiquitylation, which facilitates the recruitment of ATRIP and the recovery of stalled replication forks. This mechanism shows strong similarities to what was previously described for DSB repair where ubiquitylation is required for \u03b3H2AX to act as a platform for the assembly of DDR complexes.236PRP19/Pso4 may be one of the better characterized splicing factors that also plays a role in the DDR, but it is surely not the only one. Indeed, several proteins directly or indirectly involved in splicing associate with sites of DNA damage in a PAR-dependent manner, as mentioned above (see section 4.1.1 for details). In spite of this common feature, these RBPs participate in different DNA repair pathways. Thus, for instance SFPQ and NONO are two multifunctional DNA- and RNA-binding proteins involved in the catalytic step of the splicing reaction, in nuclear retention of defective RNAs and in DNA repair, stimulating NHEJ and repressing HR.141 Another RBP, RBMX/hnRNPG, implicated in tissue-specific regulation of gene transcription and alternative splicing, is a positive regulator of HR.224 However, the involvement of RBMX/hnRNPG in HR does not depend on its recruitment to sites of DNA damage but instead on its ability to control BRCA2 expression. Remarkably, some RBPs influence different steps of the assembly of repair foci. An example is FUS (see section 4.1.1 for details), whose depletion impairs the formation of DNA repair foci after treatment with topoisomerase II poison etoposide.154 Depletion of RBM14, another RBP, stabilizes \u03b3H2AX foci237 by reducing the recruitment of the NHEJ factors XRCC4 and XLF to damaged chromatin.238 The transient recruitment of the RBP hnRNPUL1 to DNA damage sites requires both the MRN complex239 and PARP1240 and is necessary for the full activation of the ATR signaling pathway. Moreover, hnRNPUL1 stimulates DSB resection and HR by promoting the association of the BLM helicase to DNA breaks.239 Transient association of RBPs with damaged areas appears to be a common theme. Indeed RBPs, including THRAP3, BCLAF1,218 hnRNPC, and hnRNPK,224 exhibit a prolonged exclusion from irradiated areas. Redistribution of these proteins requires both active transcription and the activity of PIKKs.155 Interestingly, inhibition of PIKK prevents displacement of RBPs from sites of damage and favors the formation of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids, suggesting that the displacement is part of a general mechanism to prevent unwanted DNA\u2013RNA hybrids.155Overall, these examples reveal the existence of tight connections between splicing regulation, the assembly of DNA repair complexes, and the activation of checkpoint pathways. RBPs appear to have a central role in the coordination of all these events. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still a matter of investigation, and in particular it is unclear whether or not RNA molecules are involved in these dynamic processes. 6.\u2003RNA-TEMPLATED DNA REPAIR IN YEAST AND MAMMALSRNA molecules synthesized during transcription are complementary to the DNA strand that served as their template. Early work demonstrated that RNA could play an indirect role in genome modification and DSB repair if converted into a DNA copy (cDNA) and stitched into damaged sites via NHEJ in yeast and mammalian cells.241-244 Not only can these cDNA molecules be inserted in a nonhomologous manner at sites of DSBs, but cDNA can also function as a homologous donor template to accurately repair DSBs via homologous recombination (HR) in budding yeast.169 However, can an RNA molecule serve directly as a template for repairing/modifying DNA without the need of being converted into cDNA?245,246 Indeed, RNA-containing DNA oligonucleotides can serve as templates for gene editing on plasmid or chromosomal DNA in Escherichia coli.247-249 Similarly, RNA-containing and RNA-only oligonucleotides can serve as RNA donor templates for DSB repair, a phenomenon observed in yeast and human cells.168,248 In addition, artificial long RNA templates injected in ciliate cells can guide genomic rearrangements250 (see section 7 for details). RNA-templated DNA modifications have been proposed to explain the high-frequency non-Mendelian loss of heterozygosity in rice.251 Moreover, cis- and trans-splicing mechanisms of chromosomal translocation suggest that chimeric RNAs generated by intergenic splicing may play a direct role to guide chromosomal rearrangements.252-256 A proof of concept that RNA transcripts are recombinogenic and can directly alter the genetic information in chromosomal DNA derives from experiments performed in budding yeast.169 Given these observations, the importance of RNA-templated repair becomes apparent.6.1. Molecular MechanismsKeskin et al. demonstrated that in S. cerevisiae an endogenous transcript can serve as template for repair of a chromosomal DSB in cis.169 The genetic assay was based on the antisense RNA-dependent repair of a nonfunctional histidine auxotrophic marker gene (his3). Briefly, an artificial intron (AI) is inserted in reverse orientation relative to his3, and antisense transcription is induced (Figure 4). While the AI cannot be spliced out of the sense his3 transcript, it can be spliced out of antisense transcript. Following the generation of a DSB inside the AI, the pre-existing his3 antisense transcripts is used as a template for HR, resulting in a functional HIS3 gene lacking the intronic sequence (Figure 4). While accurate DSB repair of his3 is seen in wild-type yeast cells by the formation of histidine prototrophic (His+) colonies, it is dependent on the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of yeast retrotransposons, indicating that repair in wild-type cells proceeds through a cDNA intermediate. However, the inability to detect direct RNA-templated DSB repair in wild-type yeast cells may be due to a limitation of the assay used. Indeed, direct RNA-templated DSB repair in wild-type yeast cells is blocked by the function of ribonucleases H (RNase H1 and H2) that cleave the RNA strand of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids. Once the activity of RNase H enzymes is removed, DSB repair is detectable even in the absence of the reverse transcriptase.169 These results demonstrate the existence of direct RNA-templated DSB repair.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.Diagram of the system to detect RNA-templated DSB repair. The his3 gene is transcribed in the antisense orientation under an inducible promoter and contains an artificial intron that can only be spliced out from the antisense his3 transcript. Splicing of the antisense RNA and DSB repair by the spliced RNA results in removal of the intron and restoration of a functional HIS3 gene, which generates His+ cells. Deletion of the 5\u2032-splice site within the intron sequence is indicated.Support for a direct RNA-templated DSB repair mechanism mediated by transcript RNA in cis is provided by the dependence on splicing of the antisense RNA. In fact, removal of the 5\u2032-splice site (Figure 4) eliminates the formation of His+ colonies. Furthermore, sequencing data and Southern blot analysis support the accurate repair by cis-acting RNA, rather than ectopic integration of cDNA transcript from other regions of the yeast genome.169 Interestingly, even in the absence of the DSB, His+ colonies are still detectable.169 This finding suggests that the antisense RNA transcript can even modify DNA without induction of damage, possibly through spontaneous DSBs or nicks in the DNA. Overall, these results demonstrate that RNA can directly transfer genetic information to chromosomal DNA in cis with or without the induction of a DSB, revealing the existence of a mechanism in which genetic information can flow back from RNA to DNA, beyond the special case of reverse transcription postulated by the \u201ccentral dogma\u201d of molecular biology.2436.2. How Does RNA-Templated DSB Repair Work?Since RNA functions in cis as a donor template in DSB repair of his3 in the assay described above, the mechanism of DSB repair by RNA is HR. Instead, the sensitivity to RNase H activity indicates that DNA\u2013RNA hybrids must form to transfer information from RNA to DNA. Previous work showed that the RecA recombinase of Escherichia coli can promote formation of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids.257,258 Yeast RNA-templated DSB repair is strongly dependent on the recombinase Rad52, a fundamental protein in DNA repair by HR.169,259 However, knockout of the RAD52 gene, while reducing the frequency of DSB repair by RNA by a factor of 10, does not eliminate DSB repair by RNA, indicating that Rad52-independent RNA-templated DSB repair mechanisms do exist. These results in yeast are supported by in vitro experiments corroborating the ability of the Rad52 protein to catalyze the annealing of RNA to DNA.169 Recently, it was shown that purified yeast or human Rad52 protein can catalyze an inverse strand-exchange reaction with DNA or with RNA in vitro, a property not observed using the RecA homologue Rad51 recombinase or yeast Rad59, which is important for strand annealing.259 While RPA inhibits inverse strand exchange between two DNA molecules, it stimulates Rad52-mediated inverse strand exchange between DNA and RNA, possibly via protein\u2013protein interaction with Rad52.259 Rad52 also promotes inverse RNA strand exchange with short-tailed or even blunt-ended double-stranded DNA. These results parallel in vivo studies demonstrating that RNA-templated DSB repair is stimulated by the overexpression of either yeast or human Rad52 N-terminal domain (NTD).259 Rad52 NTD retains the catalytic ability to promote inverse RNA strand exchange but lacks the Rad51 and RPA binding domains.259 Furthermore, null mutations of the RAD51 or RAD59 genes increased the frequency of DSB repair by RNA in yeast.169,259 This outcome is thought to occur by curbing the ability of DNA ends to recombine with sister chromatids, funneling repair to an RNA-templated pathway.169 Moreover, impairment of DNA end processing by defects in SAE2, EXO1, or MRE11 genes, which are important for DNA end resection following DSB, either increased or had no change in the frequency of DSB repair by RNA.259 These data support a model in which Rad52 catalyzes inverse strand exchange between RNA and a nonresected, or little-resected end of DNA at the DSB. RNA then guides break repair by bridging the broken DNA ends and is used as a template for DNA synthesis to fill the gap, a mechanism that could be mediated by cellular DNApolymerases.169,259 If resection is long, RNA-templated DNA repair may require reverse transcriptase for more extensive polymerization.6.3. Involvement of NHEJ MechanismsRecently, it has been found that C-NHEJ may play a role in RNA-mediated DSB repair. Following DSBs introduction via bleomycin or ionizing radiation (IR), RNAP II immunoprecipitated with various C-NHEJ and recombination proteins, including LigIV, XRCC4, KU-70, Pol\u03bc, DNA-PK, Rad51, and Rad52.160 Differently, alt-NHEJ proteins were absent or far less abundant in RNAP II complexes.160 The authors reasoned that C-NHEJ proteins may have a role in DSB repair in actively transcribed genes and explored this further. However, in this study, little information is provided on the roles of recombination proteins, which have previously been documented to function at DSBs in active genes.260 ChIP and quantitative PCR do indeed support the presence of C-NHEJ proteins (53BP1 and LigIV) at sites of DSBs in actively transcribed genes.160 Importantly, C-NHEJ components were found associated with nascent RNA transcripts by RNA-ChIP and this association significantly decreased following treatment of permeabilized cells with RNase H prior to RNA-ChIP,160 indicating the formation of DNA\u2013RNA hybrids at DSB sites. This led the authors to suggest that C-NHEJ proteins may aid in an RNA-templated DNA repair mechanism. While RNA-donor oligonucleotides could repair a DSB in human cells in trans248 and an actively transcribed DNA could increase the frequency of end joining ligation of a linearized plasmid in human cells either directly or via RNA sequences in trans, it would be important to determine whether nascent pre-mRNA can template DSB repair in cis in mammalian cells. Following up on this possibility, in search of RNA-templated DNA polymerase activity, nuclear extracts of HEK-293 cells strikingly had the capability to copy an RNA template in vitro, independently of the major mammalian retrotransposon long interspersed elements (LINE1).160 This result highlights the possibility that cellular DNA polymerases may have some RT activity, as shown for yeast replicative polymerases,168 bacterial and archaeal polymerases,261 and some mammalian polymerases.2626.4. Models of DSB Repair Mediated by RNAOverall, these studies unveil an unexpected direct role of RNA in the DSB repair process: RNA may act as a template in repair of DSBs occurring in transcribed DNA.160,169,243,259,263,264 An HR model based on the results of experiments in S. cerevisiae suggests that a DSB occurring in an actively transcribed gene can be repaired in cis by the transcribed RNA as a bridging template for DNA repair. This process is aided by the inverse strand-exchange activity of Rad52 on dsDNA ends that have limited end resection (Figure 5A).Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Models of DSB repair guided by RNA. (A) Model of RNA-templated DSB repair via Rad52-mediated inverse RNA strand exchange. The RNA transcript generated from a genomic region that experiences a DNA DSB can anneal with broken DNA ends with the aid of Rad52 in an inverse strand-exchange reaction forming an DNA\u2013RNA hybrid that bridges the broken DNA ends and enables transfer of genetic information from RNA to DNA and accurate repair of the DSB. (B) Hypothetical model of RNA-mediated NHEJ repair of DSB. The RNA transcript forms an R-loop before the DSB occurs. Via a bridging mechanism, likely without the need of a gap-filling step, RNA guides the C-NHEJ protein complex to perform accurate DSB repair.In cases of extensive resection, RNA-templated DSB repair could proceed with the aid of an RT. In addition, the RNA transcript can mediate DNA modifications in the absence of Rad52.169,264 Remarkably, RNA retains some ability to modify its DNA gene in cis even in the absence of an induced DSB. In this scenario, the RNA partially hybridized to DNA may form an R-loop structure with the intact dsDNA. The failure to remove R-loops from the DNA duplex leads to increase in DNA damage, recombination rates, mutation frequencies, and loss of heterozygosity.76,265 It is generally thought that the majority of R-loop-induced genomic instability stems from encounters between the DNA replication machinery and the altered chromatin environment in the vicinity of an R-loop.266,267 If a spontaneous or induced DSB occurs near the R-loop site, repair by C-NHEJ may occur, with the RNA facilitating end ligation by C-NHEJ proteins through end-bridging (Figure 5B). Thus, the RNA transcript could be a donor in DSB repair either to allow HR or to guide C-NHEJ, possibly depending on the cell-cycle phase, the types of DSB lesions, and the extent of DNA end resection. 7.\u2003GENOMIC REARRANGEMENTS AND RNA: LESSONS FROM CILIATESProbably the most striking evidence for a physiological role of RNA in controlling genome stability is in ciliates. This is because in the ciliated protozoans sncRNAs have been shown to be involved in the epigenetic transmission of information between maternal nuclei and their derivatives, mediating large-scale genomic rearrangements and elimination or retention of specific DNA sequences.87.1. OxytrichaAll ciliates, including the stichotrich Oxytricha trifallax, are characterized by nuclear dimorphism. These large unicellular ciliated protists contain two separate sources of genetic information: a transcriptionally silent germline micronucleus that is exchanged during matings, and a transcriptionally active somatic macronucleus containing tens of thousands of amplified gene-sized DNA molecules called \u201cnanochromosomes\u201d that are transcribed during asexual growth of the cells.268 These macronuclear nanochromosomes are the smallest known genomic DNA molecules in nature, with an average size of 3.2 kb, and are present at 100\u2013100,000 copies per macronucleus.269,270 The micronuclear genome closely resembles that of a canonical eukaryotic genome with many genes organized on long chromosomes. However, micronuclear genes are typically interrupted by many short nongenic DNA sequences called internally eliminated sequences (IESs). For approximately 3,500 of these genes (~20% of genes in the Oxytricha genome), the macronuclear destined sequences (MDSs) that are connected upon IES removal exist in a nonlinear, scrambled order.271 When a mating occurs under the desired environmental conditions, two ciliates fuse and the process of macronuclear development from a newly acquired diploid micronucleus begins. At this point ciliates undergo a polytene chromosome stage (repeated rounds of micronuclear DNA replication without nuclear division, leading to large, banded chromosomes), eliminate more than 90% of their noncoding micronuclear germline genome (transposable elements, repetitive satellite sequences and IESs), fragment their chromosomes, and then sort and reorder the many thousands of nonlinear macronuclear destined sequences (MDSs) that will form functional genes. Ligation of MDSs, de novo telomere addition, and amplification of macronuclear nanochromosomes to the appropriate high copy number completes the development of a new, functional macronucleus (For general reviews of the process of macronuclear development in ciliates see refs 272-275).Previous work has illustrated the roles of RNAs in mediating IES recognition/removal and the unscrambling events that ultimately take place during Oxytricha macronuclear development. Although the junctions of MDSs and IESs contain short direct repeat sequences that are likely involved (so-called \u201cpointers\u201d), they seem to act more as a structural requirement for unscrambling and DNA splicing, rather than for recognition by the necessary protein machinery.276 Instead, maternal guide RNA templates that are transcribed in the maternal macronucleus from the nanochromosomes have been hypothesized to mediate this massive genomic rearrangement process.277, Long noncoding sense and antisense RNA transcripts, corresponding to entire macronuclear DNA molecules, can be detected, peaking at 12\u201324 h postconjugation, and these are transported to the newly developing macronucleus to provide guide templates for the correct rearrangement, deletion, and sometimes inversion of the micronuclear DNA sequences250 (Figure 6). Microinjection of synthetic double-stranded DNA or RNA versions of alternatively rearranged nanochromosomes into the macronucleus of mating cells leads to changes in the reordering of MDSs, not only in the injected cells, but in offspring as well, suggesting epigenetic inheritance through these RNA templates.250Open in a separate windowFigure 6.RNA-mediated genome unscrambling in Oxytricha. (1) Macronuclear nanochromosomes are transcribed bidirectionally in the maternal macronucleus, giving rise to template guide RNAs. Twenty-seven nt piRNAs are depicted as wavy green lines and play a protective role during DNA elimination in this process. (2) Template guide RNAs are transported to the developing macronucleus where they mediate the rearrangement of macronuclear destined sequences (MDSs). (3) Internally eliminated sequences (IESs) are removed from developing macronuclear nanochromosomes. (4) Development of the new macronucleus is complete after de novo telomere addition and several rounds of nanochromosome amplification.Recently, it has also been reported that Oxytricha produce and store RNA copies of whole somatic nanochromosomes during macronuclear development, which are derived from the maternal macronucleus before degradation. More than 60% of Oxytricha nanochromosomes have a corresponding RNA-cached copy, whose levels fluctuate throughout development, suggesting that not all developing macronuclear chromosomes undergo DNA rearrangements simultaneously.278 While extensive studies of the gene expression program during macronuclear development in Oxytricha have implicated hundreds of proteins playing roles during these developmental processes, much remains to be elucidated when it comes to biogenesis, processing, and function of sncRNAs.270,279A novel class of macronuclear-derived 27 nt small RNAs, called 27macRNAs, that are highly upregulated after Oxytricha conjugation, peak at 24 h postmixing of complementary mating types.280,281 These 27mers are derived from the parental macronucleus as opposed to the micronucleus, have a strong 5\u2032 U bias, and do not possess a 2\u2032-O-CH3 group modification at their 3\u2032 end, typical of certain classes of small RNAs in other ciliates.280-282 These 27macRNAs have been shown to associate with a PIWI homologue called Otiwi1 and specify which segments of micronuclear DNA will remain protected from degradation throughout macronuclear development. It has been suggested that this may occur through methylation and hydroxymethylation of cytosine residues within the DNA sequences to be eliminated.280,283 Indeed, microinjection experiments of 27 nt RNAs containing a 5\u2032 U, corresponding to IES regions of the genome to be eliminated, lead to their retention after the completion of the macronuclear development program. However, the relationship between the PIWI-associated 27macRNAs and the long noncoding dsRNA \u201cguide templates\u201d implicated in MDS rearrangements remains unknown.Ciliates have evolved two extraordinary genomes that demonstrate the complexity of epigenetic inheritance and DNA manipulation in eukaryotes. To date, although the general timing of events involved in macronuclear development has been fairly well characterized, the molecular mechanisms underlying many of these processing events remain poorly understood. Genome-wide studies and high throughput sequencing of mRNAs expressed throughout ciliate macronuclear development have allowed the identification of many factors likely playing roles in the numerous RNA-mediated processes occurring during this time. A disproportionate number of the genes identified as upregulated encode proteins that are involved in DNA and RNA metabolism processes, with the majority of these genes encoding evolutionarily conserved proteins in higher level eukaryotes. A recent study in Oxytricha shows that a striking number of differentially expressed macronuclear development genes in ciliates are preferentially expressed in animal germline cells, illustrating that ciliates possess a highly conserved and primordial set of factors involved in germline and stem cell maintenance.279 Thus, ciliates offer a unique and convenient system to study the influence of noncoding RNAs on genome integrity and transgenerational inheritance.7.2. Paramecium and TetrahymenaMacronuclear development has been more extensively studied in the distantly related ciliates Tetrahymena and Paramecium, where it has also been shown that epigenetic information from the parental macronucleus guides the elimination and retention of DNA sequences in the developing macronucleus. During the sexual life cycle of these ciliates, the entire parental micronuclear genome is transcribed bidirectionally to produce long, double-stranded RNAs early on in macronuclear development.284 In Paramecium, these double-stranded RNA precursors are cleaved by DICER-like enzymes DCL2 and DCL3, to produce a class of 25 nt small RNAs, called scan RNAs (scnRNAs),285-288 which are transported to the parental macronucleus where those with homologous macronuclear sequence are degraded. The remaining scnRNAs corresponding to micronuclear-specific sequences survive this filtering step and are transported to the developing macronucleus where, in association with PIWI proteins Ptiwi1/9, they \u201cscan\u201d the genome and mark IESs for excision and elimination.288,289 Notably, this is the opposite of Oxytricha, where PIWI-associated 27 nt piRNAs mark DNA sequences for retention. Although the mechanism of DNA excision and elimination requires further investigation, it has been shown to depend on a \u201cdomesticated\u201d piggyBac transposase called PiggyMac.290-293 When IESs are excised from the developing macronuclear chromosomes, they have been shown to circularize, or concatamerize before circularization, depending on their size, to act as templates for the transcription of a second class of small RNAs called iesRNAs.293-295 Precursors of iesRNAs are processed by the DICER-like enzyme DCL5, to produce 22\u201331 nt small RNAs complementary to the sequence of excised IESs with a bias toward IES ends.288 A second class of sRNAs are also produced later in macronuclear development in Tetrahymena, but it remains unclear whether or not these late-scnRNAs play the same role as iesRNAs in Paramecium.296 While iesRNAs have more variation in length than scnRNAs and peak in expression much later during macronuclear development, both species possess a strong 5\u2032 U bias. IesRNAs have been implicated in genome quality control and help to ensure the complete and precise removal of all remaining IESs matching these sequences from the amplified chromosomes (approximately 800n) in Paramecium, leading to a new, functional macronucleus288 (Figure 7). The general events of this \u201cscnRNA model\u201d also occur during Tetrahymena macronuclear development, although the specific details and associated factors may vary. It is worth noting that while Tetrahymena and Paramecium eliminate IESs during macronuclear development, these ciliates do not possess scrambled micronuclear genes such as the stichotrichs. In addition, their macronuclear chromosomes are much larger, coding for hundreds of genes instead of just one or two, typical of Oxytricha nanochromosomes.268,270Open in a separate windowFigure 7.The scnRNA model for genomic rearrangements in Paramecium. (1) The micronculear genome is transcribed bidirectionally to produce long dsRNAs, which are processed by DICER-like enzymes DLC2/3 to produce 25 nt long scnRNAs. (2) scnRNAs are transported to the maternal macronucleus where they \u201cscan\u201d the macronculear genome via interaction with RNA transcripts of somatic DNA. scnRNAs pairing to homologous MDS sequences are filtered out and degraded, leaving only those corresponding to micronuclear-specific sequence or IESs. (3) Selected scnRNAs are transported to the developing macronucleus where they target the excision of IESs by the excisase PiggyMac. Excised IESs circularize and are transcribed to dsRNAs that are processed by the DICER-like enzyme DCL5 to produce iesRNAs. iesRNAs then ensure the precise and efficient excision of all remaining IESs from the developing macronuclear genome. (4) Development of the new macronucleus is complete, with the newly formed macronuclear genome matching that of the maternal macronucleus. The maternal macronucleus is degraded during the last steps of macronuclear development.7.3. Epigenetic Inheritance in Ciliates, a Lesson from PlantsAlthough epigenetic inheritance has been well characterized and studied in ciliates, many questions still remain in the field. It is still poorly understood how the precursors to the different sRNA classes are initially transcribed and the processing machinery used to target particular genomic regions for either retention or elimination. Using the model organism A. thaliana for comparison, which displays another well studied system of epigenetic inheritance, some inferences can be drawn, although significant differences exist. In addition to the canonical RNAP II, A. thaliana possesses two additional nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases, named RNA polymerase IV and RNA polymerase V, which play nonredundant roles in RNA-mediated gene-silencing.297 RNA polymerase IV is used to transcribe the precursors to siRNAs, while RNApolymerase V is responsible for transcribing nascent transcripts necessary for AGO-associated siRNA targeting. Like plants, ciliates have undergone whole genome duplications that have led to paralogous transcription subunits and machinery, including paralogs of the first and second largest subunits of RNAP II (RPB1 and RPB2), reminiscent of plant Pol IV and Pol V. In Oxytricha it has been shown that the RNAP II machinery paralogs play a role in development independent from transcribing sRNA precursors, but it is unclear if these separate paralogous RNAP II subunits, also upregulated in Paramecium and Tetrahymena, are associated with general transcriptional machinery.298 In addition, it is unknown how regions of the developing macronuclear genome are targeted for elimination or retention. In the field, this has been hypothesized to depend on production of nascent RNA transcripts at particular loci, but this has not been shown directly. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for genome rearrangements in ciliates, but with the power of next generation sequencing (NGS) of entire genomes and epigenomes, along with reverse genetic approaches, it will be possible to fill in the remaining gaps in our knowledge of these processes. 8.\u2003INVOLVEMENT OF RNA IN TELOMERE MAINTENANCE8.1. Consequences of Dysfunctional TelomeresTelomeres are the distal tips of linear chromosomes, composed of short, guanosine-rich hexameric tandem repeats. In humans the 5\u2032-TTAGGG-3\u2032/3\u2032-CCCTAA-5\u2032 sequence is repeated approximately 2000 times to generate a telomere length between 10 and 15 kb pairs. Telomeres pose a particular conundrum for the cell due to the fact that they resemble the DNA end structure typically present at DSBs.299,300 Unlike DSBs, which must be repaired to ensure cell survival, telomeres actively inhibit DNA repair and DDR signaling. This is achieved by the recruitment of a specific set of proteins, collectively called \u201cShelterin\u201d, which directly inhibit DDR at telomeres, and by assuming a secondary structure, reinforced by Shelterin, called the t-loop, in which the tip of the telomere loops back on itself, thereby hiding the end.10-12,301-303Despite the fact that telomeres are refractory to DNA repair activities, KU (see section 4.1.1 for details) is associated with normal telomeres. While C-NHEJ inhibition is achieved by the Shelterin component TRF2 that prevents the recruitment of Ligase IV from telomeres,301,304 the presence of KU seems to be important as a second line of inhibition of HR and alt-NHEJ pathways, in a Shelterin-free environment.305 Beyond DNA repair inhibition, localization of KU to telomeres could also be important for telomere length regulation through its binding to the RNA component of telomerase, TERC.127 This is an additional example of functional RNAs interacting with DNA repair proteins.Telomeric \u201crepair\u201d\u2014for instance a fusion of a telomeric chromosome end to another telomere or to an interstitial telomere repeat-containing region\u2014can lead to genomic rearrangements, with consequent potential changes in ploidy, and eventually may contribute to cell transformation.306-309 Proliferating cells not expressing telomerase, or using other mechanisms of telomere elongation, eventually accumulates telomeres that are critically short, or \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. Dysfunctional telomeres are akin to exposed DNA ends of DSBs and are promptly recognized by the DDR machinery.111,306,310,311 Telomere shortening can occur gradually over multiple population doublings as a result of the so-called \u201cend-replication problem\u201d, in which the cell is unable to replicate all the way to the end of the telomere lagging strand. Shortening can also be due to the abrupt loss of telomeric material via DSB formation, potentially as a consequence of DNA replication stress. Critically short telomeres, as well as DSBs within telomeric repeats, trigger a DNA damage response that cannot support efficient DNA repair,301 provoking a protracted, likely permanent, DNA damage induced-checkpoint that arrests cell-cycle progression. The permanent cell-cycle arrest associated with the protracted DDR caused by unrepaired DNA ends312 is referred to as cellular senescence.111,313Some cells can respond to telomeric shortening by de novo telomere elongation through telomerase via catalytic extension of the telomere, or HR, using other sources of telomeric material as templates for extension. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (TERT) that carries its own RNA template (TERC), and it is preferentially recruited to the shortest telomeres, presumably due to the absence of telomerase inhibitory proteins, to maintain their length and hence avert senescence.314-316 Telomerase is the primary means of telomere lengthening in stem cells, where it is expressed at low, but detectable, levels.317 Telomerase is also responsible for the maintenance of telomeres in approximately 85\u201390% of human malignancies.318 In most of the remaining tumor types, the HR-based Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism is activated, which relies on a form of HR between a chromosomal telomere and other telomeric material for elongation. However, some reports have recently challenged the idea that an essential feature of cancer is the acquisition of a telomere maintenance mechanism. Some patient-derived melanoma and neuroblastoma cells do not express telomerase nor activate the ALT mechanism, and indeed, their telomeres shorten during serial passages in culture. The phenotype associated with these cancer cells has been referred to as ever-shorter telomeres.319,320 In support of this notion, bioinformatics analysis of a large cohort of human tumors (18,430 samples) has recently reported that approximately a fifth of the analyzed samples neither expressed telomerase nor harbored alterations in ATRX or DAXX genes, which are commonly mutated in ALT.321 These new findings add an additional layer of complexity for cancer treatment because they suggest that, at least in some cases, prevention of telomere shortening is not required for oncogenesis nor for cancer progression, thus potentially blunting therapeutic approaches targeting telomere maintenance mechanisms.Recent studies from multiple laboratories have shown that the regulation of ncRNA transcribed from telomeric regions plays an important role at damaged/shortened telomeres to promote activation of the DDR and, hence, their repair.181,322-326 In addition to chromosome ends, telomeric ncRNA associates with multiple nontelomeric loci to stimulate transcription.327 Therefore, the regulation of ncRNA at telomeres may be a critical determinant with regard to the rate at which a cell enters a state of replicative senescence.8.2. Telomere Repeat-Containing RNATelomere Repeat-Containing RNA (TERRA) is one example of a lncRNA harboring telomeric repeat sequences.12,328 TERRA transcription is initiated in the subtelomeric region and continues into the telomeric repeats, although it is unlikely to reach chromosome ends.329-332 Recently, there have been important observations describing how TERRA is regulated at different telomeric states.12 TERRA levels are tightly regulated with respect to cell-cycle. In G1 the levels are maintained low, but at the G1/S transition TERRA is transiently upregulated and then subsequently degraded as the cells progress through the S phase and into G2.326,333,334 In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the degradation throughout the S phase is carried out by the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 RNA exonuclease Rat1 so that TERRA is removed at approximately the time when telomeres are replicated by DNApolymerase and/or extended by telomerase. When telomeres become short, this precise regulation is altered due to the inability of Rat1 to associate with short telomeres326 (Figure 8).Open in a separate windowFigure 8.Roles of TERRA in telomere elongation. At normal length telomeres, TERRA is transcribed and forms R-loops. To allow unperturbed replication, TERRA and its R-loops are degraded by Rat1 and RNase H2, respectively. Due to the absence of Rat1 at shortened telomeres, TERRA becomes stabilized and accumulates (bottom right). In telomerase positive cells, TERRA from a short telomere can colocalize in the nucleoplasm with telomerase and then reassociate specifically with the shortened telomere. This type of regulation may facilitate telomerase in finding the correct telomere to elongate. Although R-loops also accumulate at short telomeres, it is not clear how they affect the regulation or telomerase. R-loops accumulate at shortened telomeres due to the mislocalization of Rif2 and hence RNase H2. In telomerase negative cells telomeric R-loops promote the recruitment of the HR machinery (Rad51) to critically short telomeres and contribute to DDR activation. This may be due to an encounter between R-loops and the DNA replication machinery and eventually the generation of a DSB. HR promotes length maintenance by using a homologous telomere as a template to elongate from. It is not understood if stable TERRA (not in an DNA\u2013RNA hybrid) also contributes to HR at short telomeres. Adapted from Graf et al., Cell 2017.In S. cerevisiae, TERRA produced from a critically short telomere has the ability to associate with telomerase in the nucleoplasm, which is then recruited specifically to the shortened telomere where the TERRA molecule was produced, presumably to promote telomerase-mediated elongation.324 Consistently, in S. pombe it was demonstrated that polyadenylated TERRA levels increase upon telomere shortening, and these TERRA molecules, in turn, associate with the telomerase enzyme.323 Moreover, in S. pombe experimentally induced expression of TERRA from a single telomere results in telomerase-mediated elongation exclusively at the telomere overproducing TERRA. Similar experiments performed in human cells have also demonstrated that TERRA and telomerase interact in cell extracts.327,335 Taken together it appears that TERRA may function as a S.O.S. signal of sorts at short telomeres, to fetch and direct telomerase to the telomere in need of elongation336 (Figure 8, bottom right).Since TERRA degradation is impaired specifically at short telomeres in late S phase (when telomerase acts), this may increase the chances that a productive TERRA-telomerase interaction occurs to facilitate elongation of the short telomere. In future studies, it will be important to interrogate the relationship between TERRA cell-cycle regulation, telomere replication, and telomerase in more depth. Furthermore, it remains unresolved as to how TERRA may help to direct telomerase to the \u201cright\u201d telomere. Is it the subtelomeric sequence information that is important to form DNA\u2013RNA hybrids, or are RNA\u2013protein interactions the key? There are also inconsistencies that remain to be addressed, such as the observation that the overexpression of TERRA in S. pombe leads to telomere elongation323 while in S. cerevisiae this leads to telomere shortening,331,337 although the discrepancy may be due to different expression levels in the different model systems. It is also not understood why the impairment of the RNA exonuclease Rat1 or the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2, in budding yeast, does not lead to telomere lengthening, despite high TERRA levels in these mutants. Although these open questions remain, there is ample evidence implicating TERRA as an important intermediate to promote the telomerase-mediated repair of shortened telomeres.Another important feature of TERRA is that it can form DNA\u2013RNA hybrids, which likely lead to the formation of R-loops.322,325,338,339 Similar to TERRA levels, telomeric R-loops are regulated in an identical cell-cycle dependent manner. RNase H2, which degrades the RNA moiety of an DNA\u2013RNA hybrid, gets recruited to telomeres, approximately at the time of telomere replication, and promotes R-loop removal.326 In a manner once again reminiscent of the regulation of TERRA levels, TERRA R-loops are no longer degraded in a timely manner when telomeres become critically short, due to the inability of RNase H2 to properly localize to shortened telomeres (Figure 8). This delay in R-loop resolution likely results in an encounter between the replication machinery and R-loops, an event that triggers HR.326 The persistence of TERRA R-loops is an important feature of critically short telomeres in the absence of telomerase. If R-loops are removed, through RNase H1 overexpression, cells enter replicative senescence at an accelerated rate and the HR machinery fails to associate with short telomeres.325,326 In contrast, when R-loops are allowed to accumulate at telomeres, through RNase H2 deletion, the rate of senescence is significantly reduced. Therefore, at normal length telomeres, TERRA and its R-loops are produced at each cell-cycle at the G1/S transition, only to be degraded, which likely facilitates replication passage and does not promote elongation by telomerase or HR. When a telomere is damaged/shortened, the G1/S up-regulation of TERRA occurs in a timely manner but the subsequent degradation is rendered defective, so that TERRA and R-loops persist into late S phase and promote telomerase and HR-mediated elongation, respectively (Figure 8). It will be interesting to determine the significance of G1/S-specific TERRA up-regulation, as it may occur as a precautionary measure in the case of telomere shortening, to regulate telomeric replication origins or to regulate gene expression elsewhere in the genome.327 In human cells TERRA R-loops may perform similar functions, as DNA\u2013RNA hybrids are enriched at telomeres in human Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies (ICF) patient cells, which have extremely short telomeres and are largely responsible for DDR activation at chromosome ends.322Telomeric R-loops are also important beyond their role during replicative senescence. Cancer cells that employ the HR-based ALT mechanism show increased TERRA levels and telomeric R-loops. The overexpression of RNase H1 impedes telomere maintenance in these cells, while its depletion causes rapid telomere loss.339,340 It will be important to understand how RNase H1 contributes to HR in ALT cells as well as during replicative senescence. Similarly, the overexpression of RNase H1 in yeast cells prevents the generation of type II survivors, which are considered the yeast ALT equivalent.341 The microbial pathogen Trypanosoma brucei uses telomeric TERRA R-loops to induce HR-dependent antigen switching to evade immune detection and increase pathogenesis.342 Therefore, the use of TERRA R-loops at telomeres to stimulate HR is evolutionary conserved, although exploited for different means.In human cells, telomere dysfunction induced by removal of TRF2 leads to increased TERRA levels at all transcribed telomeres.332,343 Furthermore, the TRF2 homodimerization domain, which induces chromatin compaction344 and prevents DDR activation,345 represses TERRA transcription independently of p53 and does not rely on ATM-dependent DDR signaling.332 The UUAGGG-repeat array of TERRA transcripts directly bind to SUV39H1 H3K9 histone methyltransferase, sustaining the accumulation of the heterochromatic mark H3K9me3 at dysfunctional telomeres.332 Similarly, TERRA has been reported to accumulate H3K9me3 at telomeres,346 indicating a functional role of TERRA in heterochromatin reorganization at telomeres. In contrast to the idea of TERRA transcription arising from several individual subtelomeres,332 recent reports propose that TERRA transcription is restricted to one, or two at most, subtelomeres in mouse and human cells.347,348 Further studies are needed to clarify these apparent inconsistencies.Although much effort has been focused on understanding TERRA\u2019s function at telomeres, it has recently been shown that TERRA also has nontelomeric functions.327 TERRA physically associates with thousands of nontelomeric loci where it frequently positively regulates transcription. TERRA binding sites overlap strikingly with those of ATRX\u2014a chromatin-remodeling protein known to aid deposition of H3K9me3 at telomeres\u2014and the two appear to compete at genomic sites. Indeed, TERRA and ATRX physically interact, and TERRA can displace ATRX from DNA templates, suggesting that it may remove ATRX from chromatin. In agreement, upon TERRA depletion, ATRX foci accumulate in the nucleus, both at telomeres and elsewhere. It is noteworthy that TERRA is upregulated in ALT cancers where ATRX is frequently mutated. In such a scenario, TERRA would be potentially unleashed to activate transcription via removal of ATRX, thereby inhibiting deposition of repressive H3K9me3 chromatin modifications; it will be interesting to determine how R-loops, ATRX, and TERRA-regulated transcription are coordinated. Moreover, gapmer oligonucleotides (see section 10 for details) targeting telomeric repeats have been used to fully deplete TERRA in mouse cells,327 leading to an increase of telomere dysfunction as well as a greater occurrence of other multiple telomeric pathologies, such as loss or duplication of the telomeric repeats and fusions between sister chromatids.These findings, together, indicate a functional role for TERRA transcripts in the maintenance of telomere integrity in both mouse and human cells.8.3. Other Noncoding Telomeric TranscriptsTERRA is not the only ncRNA transcript produced from telomeric DNA. In S. pombe a C-rich telomeric transcript (transcribed in a telomere to centromere direction) referred to as ARIA has been reported. Unlike TERRA, ARIA is composed purely of telomeric repeats and does not harbor subtelomeric sequences.349,350 Similar to TERRA, ARIA levels increase when telomeres are rendered dysfunctional by deleting components of the telomere specific Shelterin-like complex in fission yeast. This behavior is reminiscent of the transcriptional induction of both dilncRNA-from and dilncRNA-to species upon DNA damage.95An interesting observation comes from mouse embryonic stem cells, where a positive correlation has been found between the heterochromatin status of telomeres and the level of telomere specific small RNAs (tel-sRNAs), that seem not to be TERRA degradation products nor DICER products.351 It has been hypothesized that tel-sRNAs belong to the piRNA family as the chemical features, the size, the resistance to \u03b2-elimination treatment, are conserved. tel-sRNA may be involved in the establishment of the heterochromatic state at telomeres. Consistently, they are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, and their levels are positively correlated with the telomeric heterochromatin status.351 It remains to be determined whether TERRA serves as the precursor molecule for the generation of tel-sRNA.As has been demonstrated for DSBs95 (see section 4.2.2 for details), mammalian dysfunctional telomeres, induced via TRF2 removal or functional impairment, also produce dilncRNAs181 (Figure 9). Telomeric dilncRNAs (t-dilncRNAs) arise from the transcription of both G-rich and C-rich strands of deprotected telomeres in mammalian cells. If, as canonical dilncRNAs, t-dilncRNAs are transcribed from the DNA end, they are unlikely to contain subtelomeric elements; thus, they are different from TERRA. Also, t-dilncRNAs are processed by DROSHA and DICER to produce short RNAs, called telomeric DNA damage response RNAs (t-DDRNAs). These sncRNAs are essential to ensure full activation of DDR signaling at dysfunctional telomeres and repair in the form of NHEJ-mediated fusions. It will be interesting to determine whether t-DDRNAs also play a role in the repair of telomeres by HR or in the maintenance of ALT telomeres. Moreover, the interplay between TERRA and t-DDRNAs has not been investigated. Similar to what has been demonstrated for endonuclease-driven DSBs95 (see section 4.2.2 for details), the use of ASOs (see section 10 for more detail) inhibiting the functions of t-dilncRNAs and t-DDRNAs efficiently reduces DDR activation at dysfunctional telomeres both in cultured cells and in mouse models. This suggests that telomeric DDR is amenable to specific control by exogenous agents, that have the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents.Open in a separate windowFigure 9.Proposed model for the generation of telomeric dilncRNAs and DDRNAs at dysfunctional telomeres. Upon TRF2 loss, C-rich t-dilncRNA-from (purple) and the G-rich t-dilncRNA-to (light blue) are induced. DROSHA and DICER process the long double-stranded RNA, likely the outcome of paired or folded t-dilncRNAs, generating t-DDRNAs. Antisense oligonucleotides containing telomeric sequences t-ASOs interfere with t-dilncRNA and t-DDRNA functions and allow inhibition of DDR at dysfunctional telomeres. 9.\u2003SINGLE MOLECULE FLUORESCENCE METHODS FOR RNA DETECTION9.1. Importance of Intracellular RNA Detection in the DNA Damage Response FieldWith numerous lines of evidence pointing to RNA\u2019s diverse noncoding functions, the imperative to study cellular RNAs in their native context has never been greater. Recently, single molecule fluorescence techniques have been successfully applied to understand and enumerate the intracellular functions and properties of various RNAs and RNA\u2013protein complexes.352-355 Furthermore, the involvement of both long and short noncoding RNAs in guiding the DDR machinery to sites of DNA damage was discovered in part using observations from single molecule fluorescence microscopy95 (see section 4.2.2). Rapid progress in intracellular single molecule detection methods to study RNAs and their binding partners has been driven by their inherent advantages over ensemble-averaging techniques. Most salient among these advantages are their abilities to detect, with great sensitivity, concentrations as low as those of most endogenous pathway components (eliminating the need for artificial overexpression, which bears the risk of overwhelming said pathway) and to reveal critical heterogeneities in the maturation, functionality, and spatiotemporal distribution of macromolecules. For a full historical perspective of the field of single molecule fluorescence-based RNA detection, we refer the reader to Pitchiaya et al. 2014.353 Here we present an overview of key advances in fluorescence-based intracellular RNA detection methods of relevance to the study of the DDR (Figure 10).Open in a separate windowFigure 10.Illustrations of recent major developments in intracellular RNA detection methods.9.2. Detecting RNA in Fixed CellsIn situ hybridization (ISH) techniques localize nucleic acids in fixed tissue samples by detecting bound oligonucleotide probes with sequence complementarity to the target transcript. Since the first demonstration of the technique by Gall et al. in 1969,356 many versions of their protocol, varying in probing strategy and detection method, have been proposed over the years, with the objective of increasing spatial resolution, detection sensitivity, and throughput of RNA transcripts.357While fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has been used for the detection of nucleic acids for more than 30 years, its application for single transcript detection and counting has become possible only in the past decade. The premise of single molecule FISH (smFISH) is that multiple fluorophore-labeled nucleic acid probes bind over the length of a target transcript, allowing individual transcripts to be detected as bright spots against a dark background. Automated imaging and counting of these spots then yields information about the subcellular localization of transcripts and cell-to-cell variability in transcript number. Unlike many sequencing technologies, these intracellular transcriptomics methods are not limited to poly adenylated RNAs and are well suited for the study of noncoding RNAs. The sensitivity and ability of these technologies to detect even single transcripts make them particularly suited to studying RNAs involved in the DDR. For example dilncRNAs were detected using smFISH95 (see section 4.2.2).9.2.1.  Multiplexed Detection. A major challenge for intracellular RNA detection in the past has been the limited number of species that can be probed simultaneously. In this context, multiplexing refers to the process of detecting multiple significantly distinct molecular species in a biological sample. As with protein detection, multiplexing RNA detection can be achieved by multicolor labeling so that each target species (or probe) is tagged with a fluorophore of different emission maximum.358,359 However, multicolor detection today is limited by the number of colors that can be simultaneously imaged using conventional, single molecule sensitive light microscopy, to at most 7 distinct colors.An alternative approach to multiplex RNA detection is sequential barcoding. With this strategy, the same diverse transcripts are repeatedly probed using different probe sequences. Individual transcripts are detected in multiple rounds as fluorescent spots, allowing high confidence detection of each molecule over multiple rounds of probing, without the need for multiple colors. To reprobe the same transcript using a different sequence, hybridized RNA probes can be degraded and washed away between successive rounds of hybridization (seqFISH),360 or the fluorophores on the hybridized probes can be photobleached, allowing the same wavelengths to be used for subsequent rounds of imaging (MERFISH).361 The sequence of hybridization rounds in which a single spot was detected then allows detection errors to be corrected and false positives to be eliminated, thereby increasing the sensitivity of detection (Figure 10A). Finally, suitable image registration and spot detection algorithms allow seqFISH/MERFISH to theoretically detect and locate hundreds of different transcript sequences at the single molecule level, making them powerful tools to study single cell transcriptomes with spatial information. A complementary technique, FISSEQ, employs rolling circle cDNA amplification to sequence transcripts in situ, providing added nucleotide-level resolution to transcripts in cells.362 These tools are poised to transform the field of RNA quantification and sequencing and are well positioned to aid the discovery of novel, rare, noncoding RNA species, such as dilncRNAs.9.2.2.  Advances in Signal Amplification. The primary challenge for single molecule detection is the need for a sufficiently bright spot signal, to enable super-resolution (~10\u201320 nm) localization of single transcripts. Common smFISH strategies aim to solve this issue by using multiple (>10) labeled probes to decorate the length of the transcript, and/or the use of illumination strategies such as confocal or HILO illumination to decrease background fluorescence.One method that has gained attention recently, termed hybridization chain reaction (HCR), achieves signal amplification via self-complementary fluorescent probes that allow single molecule resolution even without specialized illumination schemes. HCR uses fluorescent probes that can self-assemble into long chains or branched structures, where each link is a probe that is bound to two others (Figure 10B). Increased interest in HCR for single transcript detection has led to improved HCR protocols that have been applied to demonstrate RNA detection in whole zebrafish embryos.363 These advances promise to make single molecule methods more accessible to the general research community by reducing the need for specialized microscopy equipment.9.2.3.  Detecting RNA in Living Cells. Cellular responses to changes in the environment often involve physiological adaptations that occur over time-scales of seconds to minutes. Here, live-cell analysis becomes necessary in order to capture rapid and dynamic physiological processes in real-time. The primary requirements for successful live-cell, real-time RNA visualization strategies are the ability to label transcripts for observation in living cells while retaining their biological functionality, the delivery of labeled RNAs into the cell, and the ability to image the labeled RNAs with high spatial and temporal resolution. The generally lower cellular abundance of RNA transcripts compared to proteins helps to discern closely spaced single molecules, making them easier to study than proteins using these methods.Strategies for fluorescently labeling RNAs can be broadly classified into methods that label RNA secondary structures and those that label specific nucleotides within the sequence.9.3. Strategies for RNA Secondary Structure-Based LabelingThe most widely adopted RNA labeling strategy to detect transcripts in living cells has been the use of RNA-binding viral coat proteins (VCPs).364 This method, first demonstrated by Robert Singer\u2019s group, exploits the high specificity and affinity with which VCPs such as the MS2- or PP7-coat proteins bind with their cognate RNA stem-loop structures. These stem-loop sequences are inserted within untranslated regions (usually the 3\u2032UTR) of the transcript of interest, typically in multiple copies (8 to 96). These modified transcripts are then expressed along with fluorescently tagged VCPs (usually expressed as fusions with GFP or mCherry). The fluorescent signal from multiply bound VCPs allows individual RNA molecules to be visualized as single transcripts even without super-resolution techniques (Figure 10C).A number of groups have independently developed live-cell single molecule translation reporter systems by combining VCP-based mRNA labeling strategies with intracellular protein immunolabeling methods.365-368 In these methods, intracellular, fluorescent, typically single-chain antibodies (scAb) bind to antigenic sites present on the protein of interest, thereby serving as fluorescent probes for the protein. Classical fluorescent protein tags are of limited utility to study fast processes such as translation elongation when genetically encoded along with the peptide under study, because the maturation of a protein tag itself occurs over longer time scales than those of translation (the fastest maturing GFP variants fold in ~10 min whereas translation occurs over seconds to minutes).369,370 However, moving the tag from the protein under study to an antipeptide scAb probe in these immonolabeling methods allows rapid processes such as peptide elongation to now be studied in real-time at single molecule resolution, where the detection is only limited by diffusion of the probes and antibody\u2013antigen affinity.371,372 Because the binding of each fluorescent antibody is reversible, these detection methods are robust against loss of signal from photobleaching of individual fluorescent tags, making them suitable for time-lapse imaging of proteins, albeit with the caveat of substantial fluorescence background from unbound probe. It is conceivable that these live-cell immunolabeling methods can be used to detect sites of DNA damage or monitor recruitment of protein components with greater ease than classical fluorescent protein tags.Another development in the field of protein detection has arisen from work on protein appendages such as Halo-, CLIP-, and SNAP-tags that can be labeled with specific suicide substrates.373 These protein tags are genetically encoded, thereby retaining the specificity of fluorescent proteins, but are more versatile, as they can covalently couple to specific membrane-permeable fluorescent ligands (Figure 10F). The advantage of using these small chemical ligands for labeling in cell culture is that they can be easily added, and the unbound probe easily washed away, making fluorescent labeling amenable to pulse-chase experiments. This technology has been applied to study various aspects of telomere biology374 and protein translation,368,375 and it is a powerful technology for studying single proteins.A complementary RNA-detection method using fluorescently tagged, inactivated RNA guided-Cas9 enzyme for intracellular RNA tracking was reported recently,376 further extending the fluorescent toolset using an extant ribonucleoparticle.9.4. Strategies for Direct RNA LabelingSome of the major disadvantages of endogenous labeling\u2014the need for significant sequence modification and protein overexpression\u2014can be overcome by site-specific incorporation of modifiable nucleotides directly into the transcript. Commercial availability of fluorophores with improved photostability and pH tolerance, and development of chemical RNA synthesis and covalent conjugation technologies, allow RNA transcripts to be conveniently labeled in vitro for in vivo visualization.377-379NTPs conjugated with fluorescent dyes can be used for sequence-specific or nonspecific cotranscriptional labeling (Figure 10E). The ability to control the number of fluorophores incorporated into a transcript further offers the opportunity of stepwise photobleaching analysis, in which the number of fluorophores, and hence labeled molecules, present in individual fluorescent spots can be counted. The intensity traces from individual spots, representing photobleaching curves, can be analyzed to reveal >10 fluorophores per spot.379The primary challenge of labeling by chemical modifications is the delivery of covalently modified RNAs into cells. Diverse delivery strategies in use today range from variable-dosage methods such as vesicle endocytosis (e.g., lipid-based transfection) or delivery via membrane permeabilization (e.g., electroporation, permeabilization by detergents and bacterial pore-forming toxins), to defined-dosage methods such as microinjection, which have been reviewed recently.380 Microinjection-based, defined-dosage iSHiRLoC (intracellular single molecule high resolution localization and counting) has been successfully applied to understand the temporal evolution of miRNA maturation, target-binding, turnover, and subcellular localization in the cell.352,354,381iSHiRLoC was applied recently to study the localization of the small DDRNA cleavage products of DROSHA and DICER. In addition to being used to observe localization of DDRNAs to sites of DNA damage, this tool has been used to investigate the functional role of these RNAs in DDR focus formation by virtue of its ability for controlled RNA delivery95 (see section 4.2.2). Together, live-cell single-RNA and -protein visualization technologies present a formidable toolbox that allows novel molecular functions in DDR to be probed in situ, in real-time.9.5. Other Strategies for RNA DetectionAnother class of RNA detection methods relies on the ability of a small molecule ligand, such as a GFP-fluorophore mimic\u2014difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone\u2014to emit enhanced fluorescence upon binding to an RNA aptamer, such as the prototypical \u201cSpinach\u201d aptamer355 (Figure 10D). Such aptamer sequences can be inserted into transcripts, and the enhanced fluorophore intensity of the ligand upon binding both reduces background and can be used to read out the concentration level of these RNAs. These aptamer-based methods have been applied to detect toxic RNA aggregates,382 to detect RNA modification activity,383 and as metabolite-sensors.384 Orthogonal to the protein-based RNA detection strategies discussed above, these methods hold great promise for intracellular RNA detection. The discovery of brighter turn-on and higher-affinity dye-aptamer combinations385,386 suggests that this technology may find broader applicability for single molecule detection in the future.Multiple developments in the field of fluorescence-based intracellular RNA/ribonucleoprotein detection over the past decade are a testament to the growing awareness of the great importance of spatial and temporal information for understanding cellular RNA biology. The discoveries enabled by the technical advances discussed here continue to underscore the importance of RNA in cellular physiology, ultimately reaffirming the rise of smart RNAs, including in the DDR. 10.\u2003ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES AS LAB TOOLS AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTSGiven the emerging role of several distinct RNAs in multiple physiological processes often of clinical relevance, interfering with RNA functions can be exploited as therapeutic strategies. One of the most powerful sets of tools to achieve this are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) which bind to their RNA target directly through Watson\u2013Crick base pairing.Based on their mechanism of action, ASOs can be divided into two classes. Gapmers have a central DNA region of 8\u201312 nucleotides, flanked by 2\u20133 chemically modified nucleotides on each side. These modifications are designed to increase affinity and stability of binding (see below). When bound to their RNA target, the central part forms a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid, generating a substrate for the activity of cellular RNase H enzymes that degrades the RNA strand.387Blockers do not require a specific position of the modified nucleotides and are often referred as \u201cmixmers\u201d. Typically modified nucleotides are present every 2\u20133 deoxynucleotides. Very short ASOs (8 nucleotide-long) containing only modified nucleotides have also been described and shown to be effective.388 Blockers do not activate degradation by nucleases, but they instead impose a steric block, preventing the interaction between their targets and other molecules, such as other nucleic acids or proteins.In particular if an impact in vivo is desired, ASOs require chemical modifications which improve their stability, boost their binding to the target, reduce off-target effects, and decrease toxicity.389 The phosphorothioate (PS) backbone is widely used to improve nuclease stability and pharmacokinetics mainly through its increased hydrophobicity (thus increased cell membranes permeability) compared to the natural phosphate group and through its capacity to avidly bind serum proteins such as albumin, thus avoiding clearance by kidneys.390 As alternatives to the PS backbone, two uncharged chemistries are also used: the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)391 and the peptide nucleic acid (PNA)392 backbone. These modifications increase the stability and the binding affinity to their target; however, differently from the PS modification, they are not suitable for the RNase H-mediated degradation of the target RNA.To further increase the binding affinity and nuclease resistance, sugar modifications have been developed, which are typically inserted at the 2\u2032 position.387 The most commonly used are the 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-OMe), 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl (2\u2032-MOE), and 2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F) modifications of RNA. Other sugar modifications include conformationally constrained nucleotides, such as locked nucleic acid (LNA), constrained ethyl (cEt), and tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA). These nucleotide analogues have an extra bridge arising from the 2\u2032 position, reducing the torsional flexibility of the sugar backbone and the entropy of duplex formation, strongly increasing the affinity and the specificity to the target. However, the introduced chirality of the backbone associated with these chemistries remains an unresolved issue.Compared to small molecule drugs, ASOs are easier and faster to design, since the only information needed for their development is the sequence of the target RNA. In this regard they are prototypically regarded as the ideal tool to inhibit the functions of \u201cundruggable\u201d targets, typically cell factors lacking an enzymatic activity. In addition, biodistribution, toxicity, and stability are defined mainly by chemical and structural architecture, such as chemical modifications of sugars, bases, and backbone. It is therefore possible to predict to some extent the behavior of different drugs against different targets on the bases of previous studies of similar molecules with different sequences. However, in some cases the sequence itself can influence ASO toxicity, mainly caused by off-target effects, which can also be hybridization-independent. These toxic effects include pro-inflammatory events, immunostimulation, and liver and kidney toxicity.393 This sequence-specific toxicity is in most cases unpredictable; however, it can be reduced by altering the ASO length and/or the position of the chemically modified nucleotides.Perhaps the most important challenge for ASO-based therapeutics is the delivery to its target.394 Differently from most drugs, which are small (less than 500 Da) and hydrophobic, ASOs typically weigh a few kDa and contain many negative charges.389To be effective in vivo ASOs must first escape circulation and reach the target tissue. Their biodistribution is different in various organs;394 for example, in the liver, endothelium is characterized by fenestrations between the cells, allowing for a more efficient delivery. Some organs are instead completely inaccessible, like the brain. Indeed, ASOs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. To overcome this issue, ASOs can be administered locally, in the case of brain target by intrathecal injection into the cerebrospinal fluid.395 An extra benefit of this strategy is that the blood brain barrier prevents ASOs to enter the bloodstream and be cleared by kidneys.A second obstacle to overcome is the subcellular localization of ASO.396 Unconjugated ASOs are taken up into cells by endocytosis and pinocytosis, in the absence of a delivery agent. But in order to reach their target, ASOs must escape from the endosomes to get into the cytoplasm or the nucleus. This is a slow process, and the efficiency can vary in different cell types.Many ASO-based therapies target mature mRNAs to induce gene silencing. This can be achieved through RNase H-mediated mRNA degradation, or translation inhibition. Other ASOs are instead complementary to pre-mRNAs, blocking the donor or the acceptor splice site, thereby preventing the binding of splice factors.397 Both of these strategies can be applied to pathologies caused by overexpression, or a gain of function mutation, of a specific gene, or to correct an irregular splicing event, thus modulating the biosynthesis of different protein isoforms with a possible therapeutic function. Beyond affecting gene expression levels, ASOs targeting mRNA sequences can also prevent the formation of detrimental nuclear structures associated with mutated RNA. For example, in repeat expansion diseases, such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias, triplets or hexanucleotides with a high GC content in the transcribed portion of a gene are expanded. The mutated transcript, through multivalent base-pairing forms RNA foci by phase separation that have been proposed to disrupt cellular homeostasis by sequestering various RNA binding proteins.398-400 These aberrant nuclear structures have recently been shown to be effectively disrupted by complementary ASOs.401In the last few decades our knowledge about ncRNAs has dramatically increased, and their role in many pathologies has been unveiled. Novel therapeutic approaches based on the use of ASOs could exploit the targeting of ncRNAs, which are virtually undruggable by small molecule inhibitors. Anti-miRs are ASOs complementary to the mature miRNA sequence; blocking a single miRNA could lead to transcription derepression of many different genes,402 while targeting a common seed sequence allows a single ASO to block a family of miRNAs.388 miRNAs have a role in many different diseases, including cancer, diabetes, infections, and cardiovascular diseases.403 In the past years, promising anti-miRs have been designed and successfully tested in vivo in animal models, and some have reached the clinical trials stage. One example is Mirvirasen, an ASO targeting the liver miR-122, which shows a strong antiviral activity in chronic hepatitis C infection.404ASO-based therapy may be the best inhibitory method when a target ncRNA acts in the nucleus because, differently from siRNA-driven knock down, ASOs do not require the RISC complex acting in the cytoplasm. This is the case of many lncRNAs. The Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a very abundant nuclear lncRNA, which is upregulated in numerous cancers. ASO-mediated MALAT1 downregulation can reduce tumor progression and metastasis formation in mouse mammary or lung carcinoma models.405,406 Although these results are promising, special attention should be dedicated to the specificity issue and to control experiments for off target effects.407A recent example of a novel species of ncRNA targeted by ASOs is the inhibition of dilncRNA and DDRNA functions (as described in sections 4.2.2 and 8.3). In a model of telomere deprotection, DDR signaling and repair at telomeres are suppressed by using ASOs complementary to t-DDRNA sequences.181 Silencing DDR activation at the telomeres could have the potential to treat some pathologies associated with telomere dysfunctions.408 Excitingly, ASOs complementary to dilncRNA and DDRNA transcripts generated at a specific damaged genomic locus inhibit local 53BP1 focus formation, without affecting the DDR activation in other genomic locations within the same cell95 (as already described in section 4.2.2). These data reveal that ASOs can be a suitable tool to interfere with the DNA damage signaling and repair events in a sequence-specific manner, potentially inducing genome instability and cell death specifically only in cells bearing a particular damaged DNA sequence.However, despite their simple design and almost 40 years of research and development efforts since the first example of an ASO-based approach was proposed,409 only a few ASO drugs have been approved for use in clinics. The first one was Fomivirsen (Vitravene, Isis Pharmaecuticals/Novartis Ophthalmics), a 21-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, which was approved by the FDA in 1998 to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis by intraocular administration. It targets the viral mRNA encoding for immediate-early (IE)-2 protein, inhibiting its translation.410 Another ASO approved for use in clinics is Mipomersen (Kynamro, Kastle Therapeutics/Ionis Pharmaceuticals). Mipomersen is systemically delivered411 and has been approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which is characterized by high plasma concentrations of low-density lipoproteins. It is a 20-mer phosphorothioate 2\u2032-methoxyethoxy (MOE) gapmer that induces RNase H1-mediated degradation of apoB mRNA. Eteplirsen, also known as Exondys 51 (Sarepta Therapeutics), is a 30-mer phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.412 It is designed to induce skipping of exon 51 of the dystrophin protein, generating a shorter mRNA that encodes for a partially active isoform.Very recently Nusinersen (Spinraza, Ionis Pharmaceuticals) has been approved. This is a 18-mer phosphorothioate 2\u2032-O-methoxyethoxy oligonucleotide with all cytidines methyl-modified at the 5\u2032-position.413 It is indicated for types 1, 2, and 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and acts by blocking a splice site in the SMN1 and SMN2 mRNA, causing the inclusion of exon 7.The above-reported examples illustrate that RNA molecules are quite promising therapeutic targets and highlight how critical our continuous efforts in understanding RNA systems biology are. 11.\u2003CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVESIn the introduction to this review we provocatively proposed a comparison between smartphones, objects that have transformed our daily lives with their diverse functions, and RNA molecules, which have increased the complexity of cellular processes as we know them. The obvious caveat is that while cellular phones evolved into smartphones by acquiring novel uses and functions, the multiple activities ascribed to RNA have always been intrinsic to its nature, just awaiting to be discovered.The very concept of functionality can be a challenge when referring to an RNA molecule: a fixed length or sequence and interacting protein partners may not be sufficient to separate what is \u201cjunk\u201d from what is functional. Essential mechanisms can thus seem invisible even to the eye of skilled and insightful scientists. Indeed, more collaborative research together with the advancement of cutting-edge technologies will help us reveal additional functions of RNA that contribute to the complexity of human life.414 Importantly, this knowledge will be essential to develop novel effective antisense-based therapeutic approaches.Developments in the field of fluorescence-based detection of RNA and RNA binding proteins over the past few years are a testament to the growing interest in incorporating spatial and temporal information into the study of RNA and cell biology. These advances are bringing us closer to understanding the numerous protein-coding and noncoding functions played by RNAs in normal and disease physiology. In the future, combinations of the techniques outlined in this review are likely to further increase the amount of information that can be extracted from microscopic observations leading to a new era of fluorescent single molecule imaging in the life sciences.In this review, we have discussed how RNA molecules contribute to protecting and repairing the genome, guide genomic rearrangements, regulate telomere homeostasis, and mediate epigenetic transcriptional silencing. The nature of transcription at damaged chromatin is becoming increasingly apparent with emerging evidence involving transcription, splicing, and RNA processing factors and with RBPs being recruited to the sites of DNA damage and being necessary for full DDR activation. How local de novo transcription95 coexists with transcriptional repression of the surrounding chromatin remains unclear and requires further investigation.74,77 The ncRNAs generated at DSBs may be responsible for the transcriptional inhibition of surrounding canonical genes by recruiting chromatin remodeler complexes, a model that is reminiscent of nascent transcripts at centromeric regions in yeast.190To ensure efficient signaling and repair of DNA damage, DDR proteins must relocate to the right place at the right time, assembling at DSB sites in a coordinated manner. Although the DNA damage response is an extensively studied pathway, the precise mechanism by which a cell detects and shields DNA lesions is still under debate. An exciting hypothesis places RNA at the apical levels of the DDR cascade. Since RNA is capable of assembling and organizing a compartment in the cell by liquid phase separation,415,416 it is conceivable that it could be key to create a colloidal structure that holds and protects the DNA break and dynamically regulates access of DNA damage signaling and repair factors.As proposed by Thomas Kuhn,417 in science, bursts of discoveries on a particular subject are often followed by periods of relative slow, steady progress when every key question seems to have been answered, until a totally unexpected twist occurs. When it comes to smart RNA, the feeling is that the best is yet to come: the burst we are currently experiencing is likely to become a monumental explosion. \u200b\n                    Box 1.RNA Modifications upon DNA DamageThe epitranscriptome is the collection of the chemical modifications of RNA. More than 100\u2013150 different RNA modifications have been reported,195,196 suggesting that a novel code awaits to be fully deciphered. This array of RNA base chemical alterations can, in principle, have an impact on several aspects of RNA biology by affecting RNA secondary structure, processing, stability, and interactions with other RNAs and RNA binding proteins. Apart from the known abundant modification of 5\u2032-ends of mRNAs (e.g., 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap), the most commonly studied modifications are N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), inosine (I), and pseudouridine (\u03a8), with the latter being also termed the fifth base of RNA because of its large quantity in the cell. However, so far the detection of modifications has been restricted to abundant RNAs such as tRNA and rRNAs. The generation of novel tools, such as antibodies specific against some modifications, allowed the extension of their study to less abundant RNAs, including noncoding RNAs. This, combined with novel chemical treatments that react specifically with RNA modifications and make them detectable through high-throughput sequencing methods, has led to a boom of \u201cepitranscriptomics\u201d studies. The potential to directly detect modified RNA bases through new sequencing technologies that avoid reverse transcription and cDNA amplification promises to further expand these opportunities.197Recently, RNA modifications have been implicated in DNA damage repair.198 Xiang and colleagues reported that an antibody against adenosine methylated at position 6 (m6A) stains sites of laser-induced ultraviolet (UV) microirradiation. The signal is quickly but transiently (10 min) induced. This rapid kinetic is consistent with its dependency on PARP-1 activity, a response to single- and double-strand DNA breaks which is also very prompt and transient.m6A signals depend on methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), and its cofactor METTL14, and are removed by the fat mass and obesity-associated protein FTO, a demethylase, evidenced by inactivation of METTL3 and METTL14 preventing m6A signals detection, while their intensity and persistence increase upon knock down of FTO. All three of these factors have been observed to accumulate at laser-induced DNA damage stripes.198m6A seems necessary for efficient repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), a common UV-induced DNA lesion, since METTL3 inactivation delays CPD removal. Since the recruitment of DNA polymerase k (Pol k), a translesion DNA polymerase involved in UV-induced DNA damage, is impaired upon METTL3 and METTL14 inactivation, the authors suggested that m6A is involved in its recruitment.198 However, no m6A reader or direct binding of Pol k to m6A could be observed. Thus, the molecular mechanisms by which m6A engages Pol k remain unknown.Since m6A is among the most abundant modifications, it is possible that additional, albeit less common, ones await to be discovered and characterized.

Fabrizio is very patient with his postdocs. Fabrizio obtained his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) working at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering (ICGEB) in Trieste (Italy) under the supervision of Mauro Giacca and Arturo Falaschi on the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1. He then moved to Cambridge (UK) to work in the group of Steve Jackson at the now Gurdon Institute. Here, most notably, he demonstrated that replicative cellular senescence is the outcome of DDR activation caused by the direct recognition of critically short telomeres. Fabrizio set up his own research group at IFOM (FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology) in Milan (Italy) in 2003. Here, he demonstrated that oncogene activation is an intrinsically genotoxic event that causes DDR activation and cellular senescence establishment. More recently, he proposed a unifying model for cellular senescence establishment based on persistent DNA damage at telomeres. Fabrizio\u2019s most recent exciting finding is the discovery of an unanticipated role of noncoding RNAs in the direct activation of the DDR. This discovery fuels most of his present investigative efforts also with the aim of exploring the potential translation of these findings into interventions useful in cancer and aging-related diseases. In 2014, he was awarded a permanent position \u201cfor exceptional merits\u201d at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Pavia, where he runs a laboratory. Dr. Fabrizio d\u2019Adda di Fagagna is an EMBO member and received several awards including the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR) Young Cancer Researcher Award and the EMBO Young Investigator Award. He is a recipient of an ERC advanced grant.
