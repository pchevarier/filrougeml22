Serines 2, 5 and 7 are known to be phosphorylated, and these modifications help to orchestrate the interplay between transcription and processing of messenger RNA (mRNA) precursors. Here, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of CTD Thr4 residues is required specifically for histone mRNA 3\u2032 end processing, functioning to facilitate recruitment of 3\u2032 processing factors to histone genes. Like Ser2, Thr4 phosphorylation requires the CTD kinase CDK9 and is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. Our data thus illustrate how a CTD modification can play a highly specific role in facilitating efficient gene expression. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) largest subunit (Rpb1) consists of Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (YSPTSPS) consensus tandem repeats, conserved from yeast to human. The CTD, through phosphorylation on serine (ser) residues, links transcription to mRNA processing events (1-3). Ser5 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 7, CDK7, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH, and this modification functions to facilitate capping (4-5). During transcriptional elongation, Ser2 is phosphorylated by CDK9/P-TEFb, which helps to coordinate RNA 3\u2032 end processing and transcription termination (6-7). Ser7 phosphorylation has been implicated in transcription and 3\u2032 end processing of genes encoding certain small non-coding RNAs (8, 9). Tyr1 can also be phosphorylated, by the c-Abl kinase (10). While Thr4 has been reported to be phosphorylated in fission yeast (11), there is no evidence that this residue is modified in other species, or what might the function of Thr4 be.To investigate CTD function in a genetically tractable vertebrate cell system, we created an Rpb1 conditional knock-out chicken cell line, DT40-Rpb1, using methods developed previously to study other conserved proteins (12, 13; Fig. S1). These cells express, as the only source of Rpb1, a tetracycline (tet)-repressible cDNA encoding HA-tagged human Rpb1 (human and chicken Rpb1 are 97% identical, and the CTD is very highly conserved among vertebrates; Fig. S2). After addition of tet, Rpb1 became undetectable between 12 and 18 hours (Figs. 1A and S3), and DT40-Rpb1 cells stopped growing and began to die by 24 hours (Fig. 1B). An important use of DT40 derivatives such as DT40-Rpb1 is for genetic complementation (e.g., 14). Here, a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type (wt) Rpb1 was found to restore viability to DT40-Rpb1 cells in the presence of tet. Expression of an Rpb1 derivative (26r) containing 26 all-consensus repeats, plus the ten C-terminal most residues that confer stability (15), also restored viability. However, a comparable derivative containing 30 repeats with all Thr4 residues mutated to Val (T4V) was inviable. All three Rpb1 derivatives were expressed equivalently (Fig. 1C), and wt and 26r-expressing cells grew similarly following addition of tet, while T4V cells stopped growing and began dying by 24 hours (Fig. 1D).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Growth properties of DT40-Rpb1 cells and derivatives(A) Western blot of lysates from DT40, DT40 rpb1(+/\u2212) and DT40-Rpb1 cells treated with tet as indicated.

(D) Growth curves of wt, 26r and T4V cells grown in the presence of tet for 4 days. Cells were split after two days. N=3. Error bars indicate standard deviation.We next investigated the possible basis for T4V cell inviability. Comparison of overall transcription (by 3H pulse labeling) in wt, 26r and TV4 cells treated with tet for 40 hours (Fig. 2A) revealed only a modest decrease (20%) in polyadenylated [poly (A)+] and poly (A)\u2212 RNA fractions in T4V compared to 26r cells, indicating that total transcription and synthesis of poly (A)+ mRNA was not significantly affected by the T4V substitutions. A 20-min induction of the inducible Egr1 gene (16) in T4V and 26r cells, grown in tet for 24 hours, resulted in an equivalent ~300-fold mRNA increase in both (Fig. 2B). Additionally, no differences were observed in unspliced/spliced and uncleaved/total (a measure of 3\u2032 processing) Egr1 mRNA (Fig. S4) and 3\u2032 processing of several additional poly (A)+ mRNAs was similar in T4V and 26r cells (Fig. S5). Thus, transcription and processing of poly (A)+ mRNAs was not significantly affected in T4V cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 2T4V cells are defective in histone expression(A) Wt, 26r and T4V cells were treated with tet for 40 hours, RNA was labeled for 30 min, purified and poly (A)+ and poly (A)\u2212 fractions quantitated by scintillation counting.

Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting (top). Ratios of H3/actin and H3/GAPDH were determined and are displayed relative to values obtained with 26r. N=3. Error bars display standard deviation.We next measured accumulation of several types of RNAP II products in T4V and 26r cells treated with tet for 40 hours (Fig. 2C). Levels of U1 snRNA were unaffected, as were levels of two poly (A)+ mRNAs, RplPl and GAPDH. However, levels of all four non-poly (A)+ replication-dependent histone mRNAs were significantly reduced in two independent T4V cell lines, to ~15% the levels observed in 26r cells. Consistent with this, histone H3 protein levels were reduced in T4V cells ~50% after 30 or 40 hours tet treatment (Fig. 2D). Levels of other proteins tested were not significantly affected (Figs. 2D and S6).Decreased histone gene transcription could explain the defect in histone mRNA accumulation in T4V cells. However, nuclear run-on analysis showed no differences, or even a slight increase, with three histone genes in 26r and T4V cells after 24 or 40 hours tet treatment (Fig. S7A and B). We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with anti-Rpb1 antibodies (N20) in T4V and 26r cells treated with tet for 30 hours. RNAP II levels at the transcription start site (TSS) and 3\u2032 end of H2A, H2B and H3 genes were not reduced, and indeed slightly elevated at the TSS, in T4V cells (Fig. 3A, left). Similar results were observed along the length of the RPLP1 gene (Fig. 3A, right). We conclude that histone gene transcription was unaffected in T4V mutant cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 3T4V cells are defective in histone mRNA 3\u2032 end processing(A) Rpb1 CHIP.

Error bars indicate standard deviation.The role of the CTD in 3\u2032 end formation suggested that Thr4 might be required specifically in histone mRNA 3\u2032 formation, which uses a distinct mechanism from poly (A)+ mRNAs (17). When histone 3\u2032 processing is defective, cryptic downstream polyadenylation sites can be used, resulting in formation of poly (A)+ histone mRNAs (18). 26r and T4V cells were grown in the presence of tet for 40 hours, and for all four histone genes, ~two fold more poly (A)+ mRNA was recovered from T4V cells than from 26r cells (Fig. 3B, top), and the fraction of histone mRNA in these cells that was poly (A)+ increased 10-50 fold (Fig. 3B, bottom).Histone pre-mRNA 3\u2032 processing requires a complex set of evolutionarily conserved factors, only some of which are shared with the poly (A)+ mRNA 3\u2032 processing machinery (17). Using ChIP, we examined recruitment of one common (CPSF-100) and one histone-specific (SLBP) factor to several histone genes and to the RPLP1 gene. CPSF-100 levels on the RPLP1 gene peaked at the promoter, consistent with previous observations (e.g., 19), and were equivalent in 26r and T4V cells treated with tet for 30 hours (Fig. 3C, right). On the three histone genes tested, CPSF-100 levels were slightly reduced at the TSS in T4V cells but significantly lower at the 3\u2032 end (Fig. 3C, left), consistent with the defect in 3\u2032 processing. As expected, in 26r cells SLBP was detected at background levels on the RPLP1 gene (Fig. 3D), while significant levels were found associated with the two histone genes tested. However, SLBP levels were significantly reduced both at the TSS and at the 3\u2032 processing site in T4V cells (Fig. 3D). Total levels of SLBP, CPSF-100 and other 3\u2032 processing factors tested were equivalent in the two cell lines (Figs. 2D and S6).The Thr to Val mutation is a conservative change, and our results thus suggest that modification (e.g., phosphorylation) of Thr4 is important for its function. To investigate whether Thr4 is phosphorylated, we used an antibody raised against and specific for a Thr4-phosphorylated CTD heptad repeat (P-Thr4; fig. S8). IP-Westerns with extracts from 26r and T4V cells, using anti-FLAG for IP and P-Thr4 for Western (Fig. 4A) detected a band corresponding to a protein of the expected size in both input and IP from the 26r cells, but this species was detected only at most at very low levels in the T4V samples, indicating that Thr4 is phosphorylated in the 26r CTD. Thr4 is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, and Western analysis with P-Thr4 of lysates from yeast, fly (KC), 26r and human (HeLa) cells revealed a band the size expected for Thr4 phosphorylated Rpb1 in all samples (Fig. 4B).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Thr4 is phosphorylated throughout eukaryotes and requires CDK 9(A) T4V and 26r cells were treated with tet for 30 hours. Western blotting of input and Flag IP samples was done with P-Thr4 (right) and N20 (left) antibodies. (B) Total cell lysates from yeast, KC, 26r and Hela cells were prepared and used for Western blotting. Total Rpb1 was detected by 8WG16 (left) and Thr4-phosphorylated Rpb1 with P-Thr4 (right). Band indicated with asterisk is a cross-reacting protein. (C) DT40 cells were treated with tet for 24 hours, the indicated concentrations of flavopiridol were added and cells grown for an additional 6 hours. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. (D) Lysates from 26r and S2A cells treated with tet for 30 hours were analyzed by Western blotting.To identity the possible kinase responsible for Thr4 phosphorylation, we examined whether Thr4 phosphorylation in DT40 cells was sensitive to the CDK9/P-TEFb inhibitors DRB and flavopiridol (20), and found that it was strongly inhibited by both (Figs. 4C and S9). This did not reflect a requirement for prior Ser2 phosphorylation, as Thr4 phosphorylation was detected in DT40-Rpb1 cells expressing an Rpb1 derivative with all Ser2 residues mutated to Ala (S2A) (Fig. 4D). Linking this to the defect in histone mRNA processing in T4V cells, histone mRNA levels in flavopiridol-treated 26r cells were reduced to levels found in T4V cells (Fig. S10). Consistent with this, knockdown of CDK9 in HEK293 cells was previously shown to impair SLBP recruitment to histone genes and lead to accumulation of poly (A)+ histone mRNA (21).Our experiments have provided new insight into the intricate mechanisms used by cells to couple transcription by RNAP II to subsequent RNA processing. While our data provide evidence that histone mRNA 3\u2032 end formation specifically requires Thr4 phosphorylation, it is likely that this modification is important for other CTD functions. Although our experiments have not uncovered evidence for this, the fact that Thr4 is phosphorylated in yeast, which produces histone mRNA 3\u2032 ends by the same mechanism as other mRNAs, suggests the existence of additional functions in mRNA synthesis and/or processing.
