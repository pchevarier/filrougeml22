Mass spectrometry RAW data filesWe present 29 mass spectrometry RAW data files that correspond to our proteomic analysis of the human nuclear MCM9 interactome. These data files were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository [2] with the data set identifier PXD000212 (direct access: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD000212). Data files with names 24770.RAW to 24784.RAW correspond to N-terminally tagged MCM9; 24786.RAW to 24801.RAW correspond to C-terminally tagged MCM9.1.2. Protein interaction networkWe present a protein interaction network centered on MCM9, generated using the Cytoscape program (http://www.cytoscape.org; version 3.2.1) [3] (Fig. 1), based on our proteomic data. The diagram comprises MCM9 plus 22 interacting proteins (combined from the N-terminal and C-terminal FLAG-HA tagged purifications). Contaminant or background proteins have been removed.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Nuclear interactome network for human MCM9. The network diagram, generated with Cytoscape software, shows nuclear proteins (nodes), identified by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, that form a complex with human MCM9. Proteins are represented by their official gene symbols, and attributed a color code according to their associated biological processes or functions, as indicated. Note that connecting lines (edges) between proteins do not imply direct physical association, but merely that proteins are members of a shared interactome centered on MCM9. A \u201clive\u201d interactive version of this Cytoscape figure is available on the Data in Brief web page for this article. 2.\u2003Experimental design, materials and methodsFull and detailed methods are described in our recent paper [1]. Here we present a summary for each of the steps.2.1. Generation of cell lines expressing FLAG-HA-tagged MCM9Stable cell lines expressing double epitope (FLAG-HA; FH) tagged MCM9 at the N- or C-termini were generated using the pOZ retroviral vectors. Vector design ensures tight coupling between the expression of tagged MCM9 and the selection marker, the interleukin-2 receptor \u03b1 chain (IL2R\u03b1) expressed at the cell surface [4]. Generation of transduction-competent retroviruses was performed by transfecting the retroviral constructs into HEK-293 cells already expressing the retroviral structural gene products required to release retroviral particles. For transduction, HeLa S3 cells were incubated with viral particles containing pOZ-FH-MCM9, pOZ-MCM9-FH, or pOZ-FH (control). Transduced HeLa S3 cells were selected using magnetic affinity beads coupled to an anti-IL2R\u03b1 antibody. Following amplification, cell clones were selected and cultured, and the expression level of double-tagged MCM9 in each clone tested by immunoblotting.2.2. Tagged protein expression, and tandem affinity purificationFor tandem affinity purification, a pool of clones for each construct that showed tagged MCM9 expression levels comparable to those of endogenous MCM9 were used. HeLa S3 cells expressing FLAG-HA-tagged MCM9 at the N- or C-termini, or an empty vector expressing FLAG-HA alone, were grown in exponential culture, and used to prepare soluble extracts of nuclear proteins according to the Dignam method [5]. Isolation of tagged MCM9 and associated proteins was performed using a tandem affinity-purification procedure based on immunoprecipitation of the FLAG and HA tags, according to Nakatani and Ogryzko [4]. In step 1, the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody-conjugated agarose beads. Beads were then washed extensively with FLAG-IP buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013KCl, pH 7.5, 230\u00a0mM KCl, 0.03% NP40, 0.07% Tween-20, 1\u00a0mM ATP, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2), then bound proteins were eluted with two incubations in FLAG peptide. In step 2, the FLAG eluates were incubated with anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads. Beads were washed extensively with HA-IP buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013KCl, pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 0.05% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, 1\u00a0mM ATP, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2). Bound proteins were eluted with two incubations in HA peptide. MCM9-containing protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by silver staining.2.3. Proteomic analysisThe silver-stained gel was sent to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School (http://taplin.med.harvard.edu/) for proteomic analysis. Each SDS-PAGE gel lane was cut into slices, and each processed as a separate sample. Each gel slice was chopped into pieces of approximately 1\u00a0mm3, then in-gel trypsin digested using a modification of a standard procedure [6]. Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10\u00a0min, followed by removal of acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a SpeedVac centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Scientific). Gel pieces were rehydrated using a solution of 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0-8.2) containing 12.5\u00a0ng/\u03bcl modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After 45\u00a0min, excess trypsin was removed and replaced with 50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate, just covering the gel pieces, and samples incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. Extraction of peptides then proceeded by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by one wash with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. Extracts were then dried in a SpeedVac for approximately 1\u00a0h, then stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis. For analysis, samples were reconstituted in 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcl HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). A nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was prepared by packing 5\u00a0\u03bcm C18 spherical silica beads (Michrom Bioresources) into a fused silica capillary (125\u00a0\u03bcm inner diameter\u00d7~20\u00a0cm length) with a flame-drawn tip [7]. After column equilibration, each sample was loaded onto the column using a FAMOS autosampler (LC Packings, Dionex, Thermo Scientific). A gradient was formed and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Upon elution, peptides were directly subjected to electrospray ionization and injection into an LTQ Velos ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were detected, isolated and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide.2.4. Peptide and protein identificationIdentification of peptides and proteins was performed by the data analysis pipeline of the Taplin Facility. MS RAW data files were matched to entries in the human International Protein Index (IPI) database [8] using the Sequest algorithm [9]. All accepted peptides have a cross-correlation (Xcorr) score of at least 0.5. Identified peptides, Xcorr scores and corresponding protein identifiers (IDs) for each sample were presented as HTML tables accessible via a web browser.2.5. Data post-processing and data-miningPeptide data were copied from HTML tables and pasted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for further processing and analysis. Identified proteins were mapped from their IPI to equivalent Swiss-Prot [10] identifiers using the ID mapping functionality of the UniProt website (http://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/). Percentage sequence coverage, and numbers of non-distinct and distinct peptides were calculated using the Protein Coverage Summarizer program from the Pan-Omics Research division of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (http://omics.pnl.gov/software/protein-coverage-summarizer). UniProt IDs were used to generate a hyperlinked data table, as described [11]. A subset of identified proteins was classified as being \u201cbackground or contaminant\u201d (at the level of gene symbols) based on two reference sources: the set of \u201ccontaminant\u201d proteins published by the MitoCheck consortium [12], and the CRAPome database (http://www.crapome.org/) [13]. Protein entries classified as \u201cbackground or contaminants\u201d were assigned labels in separate columns in the data table, enabling them to be filtered from the dataset, as required. A table of identified proteins, and a spreadsheet containing all identified proteins and peptides for each sample are available as part of our previous publication [1].
