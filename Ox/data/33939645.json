INTRODUCTIONCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major threat worldwide, affecting more than 140 million people and resulting in more than 3 million deaths worldwide as of early April 2021.1 The clinical course of COVID-19 varies substantially among patients. Most infected individuals remain asymptomatic or exhibit only mild to moderate symptoms; approximately 15% progress to severe pneumonia, and up to 5% may eventually need admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, or multiple organ failure.2 A previous study suggested a scoring system (COVID-GRAM) predicting progress to critical illness, including admission to the ICU, requirement of invasive ventilation, and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.3 Including inflammatory mediators might improve the prognostic models because of their central role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Exuberant inflammation manifesting as elevated levels of cytokines, commonly referred as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d has been suggested to lead to critical conditions, such as ARDS, multiorgan failure, and eventually death.The plasma level of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), one of the damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), has been found to correlate with excessive cytokine storm and severity of tissue damage in patients with severe pneumonia or ARDS.4 HMGB1 initiates inflammation in COVID-19 patients via at least two separate pathways. The first pathway involves disulfide-HMGB1, triggering toll-like receptor-4, which causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). The second pathway involves exogenous HMGB1, which induces the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor (angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptor) in alveolar epithelial cells in an advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor dependent manner.5 In several murine models of pneumonia, targeting HMGB1 with monoclonal antibodies not only attenuates inflammatory lung injury but also decreases bacterial or viral burden in the lungs of mice.6,7 IL-6 is one of the main mediators of inflammatory and immune response initiated by infection or tissue injury, and increased plasma levels of IL-6 have been reported in more than half of COVID-19 patients.8 One recent randomized clinical trial showed that an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, can prevent the need for invasive ventilation and death in COVID-19 patients.9Early identification of inflammatory mediators predicting fatal or inferior outcomes may prompt early treatment interventions, potentially yielding better outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.2 In this study, we aimed to define the prognostic roles of HMGB1 and IL-6 in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODSDesign.The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the local ethics committees of Chonburi Hospital (129/63/S/h3) and Buddhasothorn Hospital (BSH-IRB 043/2563). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their first-line relative if the patient was too unwell to provide it under an emerging infectious disease provision.Patients were treated following the Thai national COVID-19 treatment guideline from the Department of Disease Control.10 As a healthy control group, we analyzed stored healthy blood donors collected at pre\u2013COVID-19 era with normal blood counts, normal values of liver enzymes, and a negative serology for viral hepatitis and HIV.Patients.Sixty-seven critically ill COVID-19 patients were assessed for eligibility at admission to one of the participating ICUs, the Chonburi Hospital (Chonburi Province, Thailand) or the Buddhasothorn Hospital (Chachoengsao Province, Thailand), from January 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021. COVID-19 was confirmed by means of a positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, or sputum samples. Patients were excluded if aged under 18 years or pregnant, or if admission was only for palliation. The remaining 60 COVID-19 patients were enrolled and included in the final analysis. Twelve patients (20%) died in the ICU.Blood sampling and measurements.Blood samples were prospectively collected at the time of ICU admission, before start of any antiviral treatment (including favipiravir, remdesivir, or lopinavir/ritonavir) or immunomodulators (which could be corticosteroids or IL-6 inhibitors). After centrifugation, plasma was stored at \u221280\u00b0C.Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels were determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (HMGB1 ELISA, cat. no. E-EL-H1554, Elabscience, Houston, TX; IL-6 ELISA, catalog number E-EL-H0102, Elabscience).Laboratory data assessed daily in ICU included white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count, arterial blood gas analysis, total bilirubin levels, serum creatinine, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lactate level .Definitions.Sepsis was defined according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)11 as an infection plus organ dysfunction identified by an increase in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more. Septic shock was clinically identified by sepsis patients requiring vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater together with serum lactate level \u2265 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia.ARDS was defined using the Berlin Definition12 in intubated COVID-19 patients or the Kigali Modification of the Berlin Definition13 in nonintubated COVID-19 patients.Metabolic acidosis was defined as a serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines.14 Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was defined as pneumonia that occurred 48 hours or more after admission and was not apparent at the time of admission. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined as pneumonia that presented more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation.Analysis plan.Values were expressed in numbers and proportions or means \u00b1 SD where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U test for nonnormal data distributions, and by independent t test for normal data distributions. Dichotomous variables were compared using Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test.Correlations between HMGB and IL-6 concentrations at ICU admission with peak laboratory data were estimated by Spearman\u2019s correlation. The ICU fatality prediction of HMGB levels, IL-6 levels, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer level, SOFA scores, and COVID-GRAM risk scores at ICU admission were further evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated. Youden Index was calculated on the basis of the ROC to help set the appropriate cutoff value as the best obtainable balance of sensitivity and specificity. Comparison of survival curves used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and differences were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for disparate baseline characteristics contributing to mortality.Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 18.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). RESULTSPatients.Demographic and clinical characteristics are described in Table 1. ICU mortality was 20%. Care for patients was not different for survivors versus nonsurvivors with regard to antiviral treatment; nonsurvivors received an IL-6 inhibitor more often.Table 1Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the ICU COVID-19 cohortCharacteristicsOverall cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a060)ICU nonsurvivors (n\u00a0=\u00a012)ICU survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a048)P valueVariables\u2003Age, years46.3 \u00b1 14.164.5 \u00b1 11.241.7 \u00b1 10.7< 0.001*\u2003Sex, male/female31/2911/120/280.003*\u2003BMI24.79 \u00b1 5.3625.94 \u00b1 6.7124.5 \u00b1 50.407Comorbidities, n (%)\u2003Chronic kidney disease15 (25)8 (66.7)7 (14.6)0.001*\u2003Hypertension15 (25)7 (58.3)8 (16.7)0.006*\u2003Diabetes mellitus11 (18.3)6 (50)5 (10.4)0.005*\u2003Stroke6 (10)3 (25)3 (6.3)0.088\u2003COPD/asthma2 (3.3)0 (0)2 (4.2)NACOVID19 test reason, n (%)\u2003Contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case40 (66.7%)12 (100%)28 (58.3%)0.005*\u2003Individual sought healthcare16 (26.7%)0 (0%)16 (33.3%)0.025\u2003Active surveillance3 (5%)0 (0%)3 (6.3%)NA\u2003Come back from other country1 (1.7%)0 (0%)1 (2.1%)NACOVID-19 treatment in ICU, n (%)\u2003Favipiravir55 (91.7%)10 (83.3%)45 (93.8%)0.259\u2003Remdesivir5 (8.3%)3 (25%)2 (4.2%)0.050\u2003Lopinavir/ritonavir49 (81.7%)12 (100%)37 (77.1%)0.099\u2003Hydroxychloroquine45 (75%)10 (83.3%)35 (72.9%)0.712\u2003Corticosteroid47 (78.3%)8 (66.7%)39 (81.3%)0.271\u2003IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab)9 (15%)5 (41.7%)4 (8.3%)0.012\u2003Time from onset of illness to ICU admission/ laboratory measurements, d9 \u00b1 2.868 + 4.719 + 2.70.87\u2003Length of ICU stay, d13.57 \u00b1 9.1820.25 \u00b1 13.3711.9 \u00b1 7.040.057Open in a separate windowBMI = body mass index; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; IL-6 = interleukin-6; ICU = intensive care unit; NA = not applicable.

The number of ventilator-free days was lower in nonsurvivors, and metabolic acidosis, shock, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and AKI was more often seen in nonsurvivors.HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission.HMGB1 and IL-6 levels were elevated in COVID-19 patients (n = 60) compared with healthy subjects (Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 1). HMGB1 levels (1065.2 \u00b1 142.79 versus 871.2 \u00b1 162.72 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and IL-6 levels (113.1 \u00b1 38.43 versus 82.5 \u00b1 39.84 pg/mL, P < 0.001) were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Plasma was obtained from healthy control subjects (control; N = 20), intensive care unit (ICU) nonsurvivors (death; N = 12), ICU survivors (survive; N = 48). (A, B) high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were elevated in death and survive group compared with control group, with an increase observed between death and survivor group.

The optimal cutoff for HMGB1 and IL-6 were 933.17 pg/mL and 97.83 pg/mL, respectively. Using these cutoffs, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with HMGB1 plasma levels \u2265 933.17 pg/mL or IL-6 plasma levels \u2265 97.83 pg/mL had higher ICU mortality (Figure 4).

Areas under curves (AUCs) for IL-6 levels, HMGB1 levels, D-dimer levels, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, SOFA score, and COVID-GRAM risk score were 0.915, 0.865, 0.817, 0.892, 0.841, and 0.885, respectively.

DISCUSSIONWithin this cohort of severe COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU, HMGB1, and IL-6 plasma concentrations measured at ICU admission were highest in patients with a fatal course of the disease. Plasma concentrations of these biomarkers were also higher in patients with a worse SOFA score (> 10), septic shock, or AKI and were also associated with poor respiratory outcomes, including longer times on invasive mechanical ventilator (> 7 days) and a worse PaO2/FiO2 (< 150). ROC curve analysis showed that HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma concentrations measured at ICU admission could predict subsequent death in ICU with high accuracy.HMGB1, an important DAMP, can be actively released by innate immune cells in response to exogenous pathogens or endogenous inflammatory stimuli and can be passively released from damaged lung parenchymal cells.15\u201318 However, in contrast to classical inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), in animal studies, HMGB1 is a late mediator of endotoxin lethality.19 Previous studies have shown increased HMGB1 plasma levels in critically ill patients20,21 but limited value as a prognosticator for death in the critically ill setting.20,22 This may have been caused by substantial heterogeneity in patient characteristics and inclusion of less severe patients compared with the present study. In COVID-19, it has been shown previously that HMGB1 plasma levels are elevated in severe disease,23,24 and are predictive of a fatal outcome, with an AUCs of 0.694.24 Our results are in accordance with these previous studies but show a substantial better accuracy for predicting a fatal outcome with an AUCs of 0.865. This better discrimination could be explained by the later time point of HMGB1 assessment at the moment of ICU admission (median 9 days from disease onset), rather than the moment of hospital admission in the previous study. In line with the experimental sepsis studies, HMGB1 would thus be a late mediator of a potentially fatal dysregulated host response in CVID-19. HMGB1 triggers toll-like receptor-4, generating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine including IL-6, which is one of pathophysiological hallmarks of the cytokine storm in critically ill COVID-19 patients.25\u201327IL-6 is well established as a biomarker for disease severity in COVID-1928\u201331 and as a predictor for adverse clinical outcomes including mortality,32\u201336 as well as for respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.37 IL-6 has been used as a prognostic biomarker in COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome.38 In agreement with these studies, our results showed that IL-6 plasma levels at ICU admission were associated with disease severity in COVID-19 and were predictive of worse respiratory outcomes and mortality in ICU. The prognostic accuracy for a fatal outcome was higher compared with HMGB1 or D-dimer plasma concentrations, the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio or SOFA or COVID-GRAM risk scores at admission to the ICU.There was a significant correlation between both HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels at ICU admission and other prognostic laboratory biomarkers. Higher IL-6 plasma levels were associated with higher peak D-dimer and peak CRP in ICU, which can be explained by IL\u20106 causing an increase acute phase reactants, such as C\u2010reactive protein, fibrinogen, and hepcidin.39 In addition, the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes was positively correlated with IL-6 plasma levels but not with HMGB1, suggesting IL-6 plays a more important role in the substantial reduction of the peripheral lymphocytes associated with immunoparalysis in patients with COVID-19.36Our results show that both HMGB1 and IL\u20106 are important biomarkers of disease severity in COVID-19 and could guide early recognition of the most severe patients at the moment of ICU admission. This could prompt increased monitoring and earlier treatment interventions, potentially yielding better disease outcomes.The present study has limitations. First, HMGB1 and IL-6 are known to be increased in patients with acute40,41 or chronic kidney disease42 and diabetes,43,44 which are also conditions associated with mortality from COVID-19. This partly explains that plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 at ICU admission were not independently associated with ICU mortality after adjusting for baseline characteristics in the multivariate logistic regression model. Second, the HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were prospectively measured at a single time point. A follow-up study with serial measurements and in a larger group of patients will be necessary to reevaluate the best prognostic cutoff values for HMGB1 and IL-6 and to confirm their prognostic value.In summary the study showed that plasma concentrations of HMGB1 and IL-6 assessed at ICU admission could accurately identify COVID-19 patients with a fatal outcome of the disease, with a predictive precision similar to or better than the SOFA or the COVID-GRAM risk scores. Future studies should particularly focus on the practical clinical value of HMGB1 and IL-6, including developing a scoring system with plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 as biomarkers for early recognition of COVID-19 patients at risk for developing severe disease. In addition to IL-6, HMGB1 might also be a potential therapeutic target in severe COVID-19.
