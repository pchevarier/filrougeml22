{"title": "Standardization of methods for sampling the distal airspace in mechanically ventilated patients using heat moisture exchange filter fluid", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1152/ajplung.00595.2020", "PMID": "33655765", "abstract": "Noninvasive sampling of the distal airspace in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has long eluded clinical and translational researchers. We recently reported that fluid collected from heat moisture exchange (HME) filters closely mirrors fluid directly aspirated from the distal airspace. In the current study, we sought to determine fluid yield from different HME types, optimal HME circuit dwell time, and reliability of HME fluid in reflecting the distal airspace. We studied fluid yield from four different filter types by loading increasing volumes of saline and measuring volumes of fluid recovered. We collected filters after 1, 2, and 4 h of dwell time for measurement of fluid volume and total protein from 13 subjects. After identifying 4 h as the optimal dwell time, we measured total protein and IgM in HME fluid from 42 subjects with ARDS and nine with hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HYDRO). We found that the fluid yield varies greatly by filter type. With timed sample collection, fluid recovery increased with increasing circuit dwell time with a median volume of 2.0 mL [interquartile range (IQR) 1.2-2.7] after 4 h. Total protein was higher in the 42 subjects with ARDS compared with nine with HYDRO [median 708 \u00b5g/mL (IQR 244-2017) vs. 364 \u00b5g/mL (IQR 136-578), P = 0.047], confirming that total protein concentration in HME is higher in ARDS compared with hydrostatic edema. These studies establish a standardized HME fluid collection protocol and confirm that HME fluid analysis is a novel noninvasive tool for the study of the distal airspace in ARDS.", "author": [{"author": "Julie A Bastarache", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.", "Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.", "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Bastarache+JA&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "J Brennan McNeil", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=McNeil+JB&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Erin J Plosa", "affiliation": ["Department of Neonatology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Plosa+EJ&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Jennifer S Sucre", "affiliation": ["Department of Neonatology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Sucre+JS&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "V Eric Kerchberger", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Kerchberger+VE&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Luke E Habegger", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Habegger+LE&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Elizabeth Weddle", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Weddle+E&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Briana Sullivan", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Sullivan+B&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Jamie E Meegan", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Meegan+JE&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Nancy E Wickersham", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Wickersham+NE&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Ciara M Shaver", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Shaver+CM&cauthor_id=33655765"}, {"author": "Lorraine B Ware", "affiliation": ["Division of Allergy, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.", "Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee."], "href": "/?term=Ware+LB&cauthor_id=33655765"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["33655765"], "body": ""}
