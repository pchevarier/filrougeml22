To investigate the mobility of co\u2010activator complexes and general transcription factors in live\u2010cell nuclei, we performed imaging experiments based on photobleaching. SAGA and ATAC, but also two general transcription factors (TFIID and TFIIB), were highly dynamic, exhibiting mainly transient associations with chromatin, contrary to Pol II, which formed more stable chromatin interactions. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analyses revealed that the mobile pool of the two co\u2010activators, as well as that of TFIID and TFIIB, can be subdivided into \u201cfast\u201d (free) and \u201cslow\u201d (chromatin\u2010interacting) populations. Inhibiting transcription elongation decreased H3K4 trimethylation and reduced the \u201cslow\u201d population of SAGA, ATAC, TFIIB and TFIID. In addition, inhibiting histone H3K4 trimethylation also reduced the \u201cslow\u201d populations of SAGA and ATAC. Thus, our results demonstrate that in the nuclei of live cells the equilibrium between fast and slow population of SAGA or ATAC complexes is regulated by active transcription via changes in the abundance of H3K4me3 on chromatin.Keywords: diffusion constant, FCS, FLIP, FRAP, tudor domainSubject Categories: Chromatin, Epigenetics, Genomics & Functional Genomics, Transcription IntroductionSAGA (Spt\u2010Ada\u2010Gcn5 acetyltransferase) is an evolutionary conserved, multifunctional co\u2010activator complex with modular organization (Spedale et\u00a0al, 2012). SAGA contains about 18\u201020 subunits, which are organized in histone acetyltransferase (HAT), histone H2Bub1 deubiquitinase (DUB) and TATA binding protein (TBP) regulatory and structural modules (Lee et\u00a0al, 2011; Spedale et\u00a0al, 2012). Metazoan GCN5 was also identified as a subunit of a second coactivator HAT complex in Drosophila and mammals, named ATAC (Ada Two A Containing; Guelman et\u00a0al, 2006; Wang et\u00a0al, 2008; Nagy et\u00a0al, 2010). ATAC contains 10 well\u2010characterized subunits. Three subunits of the HAT modules, GCN5 (or PCAF), SGF29 and ADA3, are shared between SAGA and ATAC complexes. Several SAGA and ATAC subunits have \u201creader\u201d domains that interact directly with chromatin by recognizing specific transcription\u2010associated histone modifications. For example, GCN5 (or PCAF) has a bromodomain that binds preferentially to acetylated H3 and H4 histone tail peptides (Dhalluin et\u00a0al, 1999; Hudson et\u00a0al, 2000), while SGF29 contains tandem tudor domains, which was shown to bind H3K4me3 (Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010; Bian et\u00a0al, 2011).The differences in subunit composition between the two distinct HAT complexes have been suggested to play regulatory roles for SAGA and ATAC (Nagy et\u00a0al, 2009, 2010). Genome\u2010wide association studies using ChIP\u2010seq against specific subunits of either SAGA or ATAC in different organisms revealed only a few hundred binding sites for these complexes (Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010; Bian et\u00a0al, 2011; Krebs et\u00a0al, 2011; Venters et\u00a0al, 2011; Weake et\u00a0al, 2011). In most cases, SAGA subunits were detected at a subset of promoters and at gene bodies of specific genes, while the overlap between SAGA and ATAC at mammalian promoters was limited (Govind et\u00a0al, 2007; Krebs et\u00a0al, 2011; Venters et\u00a0al, 2011). Those findings together with the fact that in yeast there was only a very weak overlap between SAGA\u2010bound and SAGA\u2010regulated genes, when analysed at the steady state mRNA level, raised questions about the detectability of these coactivators by ChIP (Lenstra & Holstege, 2012 and refs therein). Indeed, when the genome\u2010wide distribution of the SAGA co\u2010activator complex was tracked by following its two chromatin modifying activities (H3K9 acetylation or H2Bub1 deubiquitination), it was discovered that SAGA acetylates the promoters, and deubiquitinates the transcribed regions, of all expressed genes both in S.\u00a0cerevisiae and in human cells (Bonnet et\u00a0al, 2014). The latter study provided data suggesting that SAGA DUB interacts with chromatin in a Pol II transcription\u2010independent manner. Studies in different eukaryotes have suggested that the presence of SAGA at the promoters of genes is needed to facilitate Pol II recruitment and pre\u2010initiation complex (PIC) formation (Wyce et\u00a0al, 2007; Nagy et\u00a0al, 2009; Helmlinger et\u00a0al, 2011; Lang et\u00a0al, 2011). The recruitment of SAGA and ATAC coactivator complexes to genomic loci has been suggested to take place by several distinct mechanisms: (i) by activator mediated recruitment (McMahon et\u00a0al, 1998; Brown et\u00a0al, 2001; Fishburn et\u00a0al, 2005; Reeves & Hahn, 2005), (ii) by interactions with basal transcription machinery components (Larschan & Winston, 2001; Laprade et\u00a0al, 2007; Mohibullah & Hahn, 2008) and (iii) through chromatin\u2010interacting domains of SAGA and ATAC subunits (Hassan et\u00a0al, 2002; Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010; Bian et\u00a0al, 2011; Bonnet et\u00a0al, 2014). Nevertheless, the dynamics of SAGA and ATAC interactions with chromatin are not yet well understood, as there has been no direct and systematic monitoring of the nuclear mobility of these two co\u2010activator complexes in live cells.Through the application of various microscopy\u2010based techniques (Day & Schaufele, 2008), it has been well established that the function of proteins (or proteins complexes) involved in chromatin\u2010dependent processes is related to their mobility and their interactions with the nuclear environment (Kimura et\u00a0al, 1999, 2002; Dundr et\u00a0al, 2002; Kimura, 2005; Gorski et\u00a0al, 2008; van Royen et\u00a0al, 2011). Our current understanding of transcription regulation dynamics has been expanded by the application of imaging\u2010based live\u2010cell approaches, in which the equilibrium of fluorescently tagged factors within a region of interest (ROI) or a cellular compartment is altered, and subsequently, fluorescence redistribution is followed over time. Approaches like FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) and FLIP (Florescence Loss In Photobleaching), based on a single or repeated photobleaching of a ROI, respectively, have been successfully applied to characterize the interactions of a plethora of factors with chromatin in live cells and obtain information on their dynamics on a millisecond time scale (Snapp et\u00a0al, 2003; Hager et\u00a0al, 2009). Their application has been particularly advantageous in detecting the presence of free, transiently and, importantly, fully immobilized fractions of a given factor (Kimura, 2005; van Royen et\u00a0al, 2009) in a 50\u00a0ms to a few minutes time window. Nevertheless, the potential of such techniques for analysing multiple diffusing subpopulations can be limited by the fact that only the average fluorescence intensity of the given ROI, or cellular compartment (e.g. nucleus), is monitored over time. This is important when the mobility parameters (i.e. diffusion) of multiple components of a dynamic factor need to be characterized. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a fluorescence microscopy technique based on the detection and quantification of fluctuations of fluorescence intensity of molecules diffusing through a well\u2010defined (subfemtoliter) observation volume (Machan & Wohland, 2014). FCS is particularly useful for the analysis of diffusion properties of very mobile factors and can be used to gain more detailed information than those obtained by photobleaching approaches. The single\u2010molecule sensitivity and the microsecond to a few seconds time resolution of FCS have for example allowed the dynamic repartitioning of DNA\u2010binding factors driven by physiological epigenetic changes, provided quantitative insights into chromatin\u2010binding dynamics of the Polycomb complex or participated to characterizing protein network dynamics in live cells (Steffen et\u00a0al, 2013; Wachsmuth et\u00a0al, 2015; White et\u00a0al, 2016). Fluorescence intensity correlation analyses describe several physicochemical parameters of labelled factors, such as the total number of diffusing molecules (N\ntot), their apparent diffusion coefficient (D), and their apparent molecular weight (MWA). Importantly, the apparent diffusion coefficient provides an objective reference value to compare mobility properties between different factors.To obtain information on the mobility of human SAGA/ATAC co\u2010activator complexes at the subsecond range, and to investigate the presence of their immobile fractions, we performed FRAP and FLIP. Our measurements indicate that, in contrast to RPB1 (Pol II subunit), SAGA and ATAC subunits are highly dynamic and exhibit only transient interactions with chromatin with no detectable immobile fractions. Similar mobility was also found for the general Pol II transcription factors, TAF5 (TFIID subunit) and TFIIB. To characterize the diffusion of TFIIB, TFIID, SAGA, and ATAC complexes in the nuclei of living cells with high sensitivity, we performed live\u2010cell FCS experiments to study those factors. Our FCS analyses show that two distinct populations dominate the diffusion of coactivators (SAGA and ATAC) and GTFs (TFIIB and TFIID): a \u201cfast\u201d population (having the approximate size of the studied complexes) and a \u201cslow\u201d, probably chromatin\u2010interacting population (with a much higher MWA). Importantly, the slow fraction of SAGA and ATAC is reduced upon inhibition of transcription elongation or histone H3K4 trimethylation suggesting that association of SAGA and ATAC with chromatin in live cells is largely mediated by changes in the levels of transcription and the associated H3K4me3 histone mark. ResultsReal\u2010time chromatin association of SAGA and ATAC is comparable to highly dynamic PIC components, TAF5 and TFIIB, but different from Pol IITo analyse the mobility of SAGA and ATAC coactivators in the nuclei of living cells and to compare their dynamics with other key players of Pol II transcription machinery, we first used FRAP. To visualize subunits of transcription factors in living cells, we used an approach based on genetically encoded fluorescence labelling, whereby the coding sequences of several subunits of the different complexes were cloned in frame with eGFP (Materials and Methods) and the obtained plasmids were transiently transfected in human U2OS cells. All the generated plasmids expressed the fusion proteins with the expected sizes (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1A) and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that in contrast to unconjugated eGFP (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1B), the eGFP\u2010tagged subunits could incorporate into the corresponding complexes (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1C\u2013G). To ensure the incorporation of eGFP\u2010tagged proteins in the corresponding complexes for imaging experiments, they were weakly expressed. To be able to detect low levels of fluorescence signal in single cells, an EMCCD (Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device) camera was used. Moreover, the individual cells selected for photobleaching experiments expressed the different eGFP\u2010tagged proteins at similar levels (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2).First, we chose RPB1 (the largest subunit of Pol II) known to have stable interactions with chromatin (Kimura et\u00a0al, 2002; Hieda et\u00a0al, 2005; Boireau et\u00a0al, 2007; Darzacq et\u00a0al, 2007; Fromaget & Cook, 2007) and also highly dynamic nuclear factors, like the TFIID subunit TAF5 and the GTF TFIIB (Chen et\u00a0al, 2002; Sprouse et\u00a0al, 2008; de Graaf et\u00a0al, 2010; Ihalainen et\u00a0al, 2012). In addition, eGFP was used as a control for a freely diffusing protein that should exhibit no specific interactions with the nuclear environment. The raw fluorescence intensity in the ROI of the an eGFP\u2010expressing cell was quickly increased within 1 s after the bleach (Fig\u00a01A). The FRAP ROI of the GCN5\u2010expressing cell reached full recovery after the first 10 s (Fig\u00a01A), whereas raw fluorescence intensity in the ROI of the RPB1\u2010expressing cell did not (Fig\u00a0EV1A). FRAP kinetics of eGFP, RPB1, TAF5 and TFIIB were in good agreement with previously published data (Kimura et\u00a0al, 2002; Hieda et\u00a0al, 2005; de Graaf et\u00a0al, 2010; Fig\u00a0EV1B\u2013D).Open in a separate windowFigure 1FRAP analyses suggest that SAGA and ATAC subunits and GTFs, TFIIB and TAF5, are highly mobile in live\u2010cell nuclei\nA FRAP experiments performed on eGFP\u2010 and eGFP\u2010GCN5\u2010expressing human U2OS cells.

Only the first 35\u00a0s of recovery are shown to resolve better the initial time points which are more informative for proteins that recover fast.G\u2013J Comparison of FRAP curves between (G) SAGA subunit, SPT20, and ATAC subunit, ZZZ3; (H) TAF5 (TFIID subunit) and GCN5 (SAGA/ATAC subunit); (I) GCN5 (SAGA/ATAC subunit) and RPB1 (Pol II subunit); and (J) TAF5 (TFIID subunit) and RPB1 (Pol II subunit). In the graphs (I, and J), the post\u2010bleach time is extended to 90\u00a0s to better illustrate the differences between the recoveries of distinct factors having very different mobility.Data information: On the x\u2010axis, time is represented in seconds (s). n: number of cell nuclei analysed for each factor.

Scale bar is 20\u00a0\u03bcm, as shown in Figure \u200bFigure11A.B\u2013D Average normalized FRAP curve of eGFP was compared to (B) RPB1 (Pol II subunit); (C) TAF5 (TFIID subunit); (D) TFIIB.E, F Comparison of FRAP curves obtained from control and flavopiridol (FVP)\u2010treated cells corresponding to (E) eGFP; and (F) RPB1 are also shown.Data information: On the x\u2010axis, time is represented in seconds (s). n: number of cell nuclei analysed for each factor.Next, we used FRAP to compare for the first time the nuclear dynamics of common (GCN5, SGF29; Fig\u00a01B and C), SAGA (SPT20, USP22; Fig\u00a01D and E), and ATAC\u2010specific (ZZZ3; Fig\u00a01F) subunits in live cells. We observed that for every tested subunit fluorescence recovery after the bleach occurred within the order of 10\u00a0seconds with no detectable immobile fraction (as suggested by the full recovery of FRAP curves; Fig\u00a01B\u2013F and Appendix\u00a0Fig S3). Moreover, our FRAP measurements indicated that all SAGA and ATAC subunits show very similar recovery kinetics to each other (Fig\u00a01G), and to the highly mobile factor, TAF5 (Fig\u00a01H), which is known to interact only transiently with chromatin (de Graaf et\u00a0al, 2010; Ihalainen et\u00a0al, 2012). In contrast to the highly mobile behaviour of SAGA, ATAC, and TFIID subunits, fluorescence recovery of RPB1 occurred at a slower rate (Fig\u00a01I and J).The rapid and complete recovery of fluorescence observed for SAGA and ATAC subunits suggests that these factors associate in a very dynamic manner with chromatin without detectable immobile fraction. To exclude the possibility that the small size of ROI used in FRAP combined with low signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (S/N) might influence the FRAP measurements, we complemented our live\u2010cell analyses by performing FLIP. Importantly, the exposure time in FLIP is 500\u00a0ms, 10 times longer than that used for FRAP (50\u00a0ms), allowing the selection of cells that express the given GFP\u2010tagged factors at even lower levels than in FRAP, with a higher S/N ratio.A comparison between representative eGFP\u2010NLS\u2010, GCN5\u2010 and RPB1\u2010expressing cells subjected to FLIP is shown in Fig\u00a0EV2A. Raw nuclear fluorescence intensity of the eGFP\u2010NLS\u2010expressing cell was dramatically decreased after 30\u00a0s (10 bleach pulses). Signal in the nucleus of GCN5\u2010expressing cell was still visible after 60\u00a0s (20 pulses), whereas nuclear intensity of the RPB1\u2010expressing cell was reduced at much slower rate with the signal remaining visible even after 240\u00a0s (80 pulses). Normalized FLIP curves showed that the depletion of fluorescence in RPB1\u2010expressing cells was not complete even after 4\u00a0min (Fig\u00a0EV2B), in agreement with previous studies (Darzacq et\u00a0al, 2007; Fromaget & Cook, 2007). On the contrary, TAF5 and TFIIB FLIP curves showed a rapid loss of fluorescence intensity, which reached background levels after 4\u00a0min (Fig\u00a0EV2C, D and M). FLIP analyses of SAGA and ATAC subunits further demonstrated the absence of significant immobile fraction (Fig\u00a0EV2E\u2013I) and the similar mobility between SPT20/SAGA and ZZZ3/ATAC complex\u2010specific subunits (Fig\u00a0EV2G, I and J). The comparison of GCN5 (shared SAGA/ATAC subunit) and TAF5 showed also that these co\u2010activator complexes are as dynamic as the tested GTFs (Fig\u00a0EV2K). In contrast, comparison of GCN5 with RPB1 dynamics (Fig\u00a0EV2L), even at the whole nucleus scale, further demonstrated that SAGA and ATAC have very different behaviour in the nucleus when compared to Pol II. Thus, our FLIP and FRAP analyses together show that SAGA and ATAC are very\u00a0dynamic with no detectable chromatin bound (immobile) fractions.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2FLIP analyses indicate transient chromatin interaction of SAGA and ATAC and PIC components, TAF5 and TFIIB, over the whole nucleus\nA FLIP experiments performed on eGFP\u2010NLS\u2010, eGFP\u2010GCN5\u2010 and eGFP\u2010RPB1\u2010expressing cells.

On the x\u2010axis, time is represented in minutes (min). n: number of cells analysed for each factor.To test the above live\u2010cell imaging findings with an independent biochemical approach, we performed subcellular fractionation of human cells and verified the relative abundance of endogenous SAGA, ATAC and Pol II, subunits in the different cellular and nuclear compartments (Fig\u00a02). In agreement with our imaging experiments, we found that SAGA and ATAC subunits (common or complex\u2010specific) are predominantly present in the nuclear soluble fraction. On the contrary, transcribing Pol II, as exemplified by Ser2 phosphorylated C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of RPB1, was mainly detected in the chromatin bound fraction (Fig\u00a02; Hsin et\u00a0al, 2014). Thus, the absence of significant amounts of SAGA and ATAC subunits in the chromatin bound fraction supports our imaging data.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Subcellular distribution of endogenous SAGA and ATAC subunits in human cellsWestern blot analysis of the abundance of shared, and SAGA\u2010 or ATAC\u2010specific subunits in the cytoplasmic (Cyt), nuclear soluble (Nuc) and chromatin\u2010associated (Chr) fractions of human HEK 293 cells. Equivalent amounts of protein from each fraction (20\u00a0\u03bcg) were loaded as indicated. The fractions were tested with antibodies raised against either the non\u2010phosphorylated form of CTD of RPB1 subunit of Pol II, or raised against the Ser2 phosphorylated form of CTD (Ser2\u2010Pol II). Pol IIA and Pol IIO forms of RPB1, that correspond to hypo\u2010 (IIA) and hyper\u2010phosphorylated (IIO) CTDs of RBP1, respectively, are labelled. Distribution of SAGA and ATAC was analysed by probing the blots with antibodies raised against complex\u2010specific, SPT20 (SAGA) and ZZZ3 (ATAC), and shared, GCN5 and SGF29, subunits. Antibodies raised against \u03b1\u2010tubulin and histones (H3 or H2Bub1) were used as markers of the cytoplasmic or chromatin fractions, respectively. An antibody raised against lamin A was used as a common marker of nuclear soluble and chromatin fraction. Dotted lines indicate that the blots were cut. Source data are available online for this figure.\nFRAP and FLIP analyses detect no global changes in SAGA and ATAC dynamics upon transcription inhibitionOur FRAP and FLIP analyses strongly suggest that TFIIB, TFIID, SAGA and ATAC complexes have different dynamics compared to Pol II. However, it remained unclear to what extent, if any, active transcription may affect the dynamics of the complexes. To answer this question, we applied FRAP and FLIP measurements in cells treated with flavopiridol (FVP). FVP is a potent cyclin\u2010dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, which inhibits Pol II transcription elongation through the positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb; Chao et\u00a0al, 2000). To test the effect of FVP in transcription inhibition, we tracked changes in the phosphorylation levels of the CTD of RPB1 by Western blot analysis. After 1\u00a0h of treatment of the cells with 2\u00a0\u03bc\u039c FVP, phosphorylation levels of the CTD decreased dramatically, indicating the disappearance of Pol II elongating fraction (Fig\u00a03A). Cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the respective eGFP fusion proteins; 16\u201324\u00a0h later, cells were treated with FVP (2\u00a0\u03bc\u039c) and were subsequently subjected to FRAP or FLIP measurements 90\u2013120\u00a0min following the treatment. Importantly, cells selected for measurements in control or transcription elongation inhibition conditions were expressing the eGFP\u2010tagged proteins at similar levels (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2). We first tested whether FVP had an effect on the mobility of free eGFP due to potential indirect structural changes in the nuclear environment. The comparison of average normalized FRAP curves of eGFP between flavopiridol\u2010treated and control cells indicated that FVP does not influence the nuclear mobility of eGFP (Fig\u00a0EV1E). Next, we tested the effect of FVP treatment on RPB1 dynamics and found a dramatic increase in fluorescence recovery compared to control cells (Fig\u00a0EV1F) in agreement with previous studies (Fromaget & Cook, 2007; Missra & Gilmour, 2010). In contrast to RPB1, TAF5 and TFIIB FRAP kinetics are not affected by transcription inhibition (Fig\u00a03B and C). Similarly, to the behaviour of these highly mobile factors, the comparison of FRAP curves of SAGA and ATAC subunits obtained from control and FVP\u2010treated cells showed no detectable changes (Fig\u00a03D\u2013H). These FRAP measurements suggested that inhibition of transcription elongation does not significantly modify the mobility of SAGA and ATAC, as well as that of TAF5 and TFIIB.Open in a separate windowFigure 3FRAP analyses in control and flavopiridol\u2010treated cell show no significant change in the dynamics of TAF5, TFIIB, SAGA and ATAC subunits\nA Cells were treated with 2\u00a0\u03bcM of flavopiridol (FVP) for the indicated time (in minutes).

As for FRAP, after FVP treatment we detected the dramatic dissociation of Pol II from chromatin (Fig\u00a0EV3A), in agreement with previous observations (Kimura et\u00a0al, 2002; Hieda et\u00a0al, 2005). However, both in the case of the highly mobile PIC components, TAF5 and TFIIB (Fig\u00a0EV3B and C) and the tested SAGA and ATAC subunits (Fig\u00a0EV3D\u2013H), FLIP analyses detected no, or only minor deviations, from the average curves generated from non\u2010treated cells. Thus, by using two different photobleaching techniques, we observed no detectable changes in SAGA and ATAC, as well as TFIID and TFIIB, dynamics upon transcription inhibition.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Nuclear FLIP analysis in control and flavopiridol\u2010treated cell shows no significant change in the dynamics of TAF5, TFIIB, SAGA and ATAC subunits over the whole nucleus\nA\u2013H Average normalized FLIP curves from measurements in control and FVP\u2010treated cells corresponding to the following factors: (A) RPB1 (Pol II subunit); (B) TAF5; (C) TFIIB and (D) GCN5 and (E) SGF29 (shared SAGA and ATAC subunits); (F) SPT20 and (G) USP22 (SAGA subunits); (H) ZZZ3 (ATAC subunit).

We thus further assessed their mobility by FCS. To resolve fluorescence fluctuations at the single\u2010molecule level, we derived our measurements from very small (0.4\u00a0fl) observation volumes, where the total number of molecules (N\ntot) was lower than 200 (Materials and Methods and Appendix\u00a0Fig S4).As a control, we measured the diffusion of purified eGFP in aqueous buffer (eGFPaq). As expected, the average autocorrelation curve fits well with a one\u2010component free diffusion model (Fig\u00a04A). The single peak of the frequency distribution of diffusion constants, generated by the Maximum Entropy approach (Materials and Methods), was centred around 92\u00a0\u03bcm2/s (Fig\u00a04C), as previously described (Potma et\u00a0al, 2001). Next, we analysed transiently expressed eGFP in living cells, whose average autocorrelation curve also fitted a one\u2010component free diffusion model (Fig\u00a04B), as expected for a protein with no specific interactions with the nuclear environment. The peak of the frequency distribution of the eGFP apparent diffusion constant centred around 31\u00a0\u03bcm2/s (Fig\u00a04C), in good agreement with previous studies (Bancaud et\u00a0al, 2009; Kloster\u2010Landsberg et\u00a0al, 2012).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Representative fittings of average autocorrelation curves with one or two\u2010component free diffusion models\nAverage autocorrelation curve of purified eGFP diffusing in aqueous buffer (eGFPaq) is fitted with a one\u2010component free diffusion model.Average autocorrelation curve of free eGFP, from measurements obtained in the nuclei of U2OS cells, is fitted with a one\u2010component free diffusion model.Overlay of frequency distributions of apparent diffusion constants of eGFPaq and free eGFP obtained in the nuclear environment generated with the Maximum Entropy approach.Comparison of the fit of the average autocorrelation curve obtained for eGFP\u2010GCN5 in the nuclei of U2OS cells, with the one\u2010component (upper left panel), two\u2010component (upper middle panel) and three\u2010component free diffusion models (upper right panel).Data information: For each autocorrelation curve, the exactness of the fit with the respective model is shown by graphical analyses of the residuals (lower panels in A, B and D). G(\u03c4): autocorrelation function. On the x\u2010axis, time is represented in milliseconds (ms).Interestingly, for all the other factors used in this study, a high confidence fit required two components in the free diffusion model (a representative fit, of GCN5, is shown in Fig\u00a04D), suggesting that these particles can be classified into two populations. Moreover, the validity of the two populations model is supported by (i) the maximum entropy approach for which there is no a priori about the number of diffusing species and (ii) the low reduced chi square values obtained for all factors with the two\u2010population fit (Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S1). Note that the addition of a third component did not increase the goodness of the fit (Fig\u00a04D). Consistently, the unbiased fitting of FCS autocorrelation curves gave bi\u2010modal distribution (two peaks) of apparent diffusion constants for common (GCN5, SGF29), SAGA (SPT20)\u2010 and ATAC (ZZZ3, YEATS2)\u2010specific subunits, as well as the GTFs, TFIID/TAF5 and TFIIB (Fig\u00a05A\u2013G). Thus, these highly mobile proteins (as characterized by averaging photobleaching) can be further dissected into two populations: a fast one (with higher mean D, or D\nfast) and a slow one (with lower mean D, or D\nslow). These apparent D\nfast and D\nslow measures of individual SAGA or ATAC subunits showed comparable distributions to each other, as well as to the studied GTFs (Fig\u00a05H).Open in a separate windowFigure 5FCS measurements indicate that the mobile pool of SAGA and ATAC and PIC components, TAF5 and TFIIB, is dominated by a fast and a slow diffusing populations\nA\u2013G Bi\u2010modal distributions of apparent diffusion constants (Ds) of eGFP\u2010tagged proteins generated with the Maximum Entropy approach. In all frequency plots, the black line corresponds to the distribution of Ds of the indicated factor. In all graphs for direct comparison with distribution of the Ds of the respective eGFP fusion protein, the distribution of Ds of free eGFP (giving a single peak) is included (green line). The peaks corresponding to fast and slow diffusing species are indicated on each panel. Distribution of Ds of the following factors is shown: (A and B) GCN5 and SGF29 (common subunits of SAGA and ATAC); (C) SPT20 (SAGA subunit); (D and E) ZZZ3 and YEATS2 (ATAC subunits); (F) TAF5 (TFIID subunit); and (G) TFIIB.H Box\u2010and\u2010Whisker plot illustrating the comparison between the apparent diffusion constant values of the fast and slow component of each tested factor (black boxes) and the apparent diffusion constant of eGFP (green box). Values included in the box plots were calculated with the Maximum Entropy approach. The box represents values from the upper quartile (25% of data grater than this value) to the lower quartile (25% of data less than this value). The median (middle of the dataset) is indicated. Whiskers indicate maximum gratest value (top) and minimum least value (low) excluding outliers. The values included in the Box\u2010and\u2010Whisker plots include the pool of at least 3 independent experiments for each factor.\nWe were able to indirectly infer the nature of these different populations by calculating their apparent molecular weights (MWA) by comparing each factor's apparent D\nfast and D\nslow values with D\neGFP (Materials and Methods). The fast components of the tested SAGA and ATAC subunits all had MWA values in the MDa range (Table\u00a01), suggesting that the GFP\u2010fused factors incorporated into endogenous SAGA and ATAC complexes, whose biochemical purifications have similar sizes (2 and 0.7\u00a0MDa, respectively; Wang et\u00a0al, 2008; Nagy et\u00a0al. 2010). Thus, these subpopulations of SAGA and ATAC appear to move freely in the nuclear environment, with little to no association with chromatin. We noted that the fast population of the ATAC subunit ZZZ3 had a lower than expected MWA (0.32\u00a0MDa instead of ~0.7\u00a0MDa). For ZZZ3, we also observed a significant overlap between the distributions of diffusion coefficients of its fast population with that of eGFP (Fig\u00a05D). This suggests that a significant amount of ZZZ3\u2010eGFP may not incorporate into ATAC holocomplexes, and/or may exist in other smaller complexes, perhaps subassemblies of ATAC. Similar MWA measurements for the fast GTF subpopulations gave 1.99\u00a0MDa for TAF5, consistent with the size of the biochemically purified TFIID complex (~1.5\u00a0MDa, when calculating the TFIID core subunits twice; Bieniossek et\u00a0al, 2013), and 0.43\u00a0MDa for TFIIB. The latter is much larger than the expected 35\u00a0kDa size of this protein, implying that TFIIB interacts with other GTFs in the nucleoplasm, as has been previously suggested (Ossipow et\u00a0al, 1995).Table 1Summary of FCS derived mobility parameters of SAGA, ATAC, TFIID subunits and TFIIBApparent diffusion constant (\u03bcm2/s)MWA (MDa)\nn\n\nD\nfast (median)\nD\nfast (range)\nD\nslow (median)\nD\nslow (range)MWfast (median)MWfast (range)MWslow (median)MWslow (range)eGFP31.25\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013994GCN58.1913\u201340.941.4\u20130.51.550.38\u201313.31,027311\u20136,835910SGF297.5317\u201321.262\u20130.720.17\u2013106422106\u20132,4901.078SGF29_DEL4.528\u201320.691.2\u20130.39.251.7\u20131062,600495\u201331,6501.035SPT206.4210\u201330.560.8\u20130.33.210.85\u201331.64,6431,670\u201331,650756ZZZ313.8225\u201370.981.6\u20130.50.320.054\u20132.5885208\u20136,835641YEATS25.411\u201320.902\u20130.45.420.64\u20131061,141106\u201313,350824TAF57.5412\u20134.50.981.7\u20130.41.990.49\u20139.3904174\u201313,350840TFIIB12.5619\u201371.632.5\u201310.430.12\u20132.519554\u2013855605Open in a separate windowMobility parameters of free eGFP and eGFP\u2010tagged factors derived from the analysis of all the measurements with the Maximum Entropy approach (median values). The \u201crange values\u201d were obtained by using the full width at half maximum associated to each peak of the bi\u2010modal distribution. In each cell, FCS measurements were sequentially repeated, 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0s in one to two points per nucleus. Thus, n values represent ~15\u00d7 the number of total selected points and ~30\u00d7 the total number of cells.In contrast to the fast population, the apparent molecular weights of the slow subpopulations correspond to much bigger assemblies (in the order of 103\u00a0MDa; Table\u00a01), far larger than the size of any of the known complexes for these proteins. This slower population thus likely corresponds to complexes that are interacting transiently with chromatin. Overall, both averaging (FRAP/FLIP) and single\u2010molecule (FCS) techniques indicate that SAGA and ATAC, but also TFIID and TFIIB, have similar high mobility characteristics; and although the complexes are not stably immobilized on chromatin, a significant fraction of their mobile pool exhibits a transient association with chromatin.FCS reveals that coactivators, SAGA and ATAC, and GTFs, TFIID and TFIIB, exhibit reduced chromatin interactions upon inhibition of transcription elongationTo investigate with higher sensitivity, the effects of transcription inhibition on the fast and slow diffusing components of the co\u2010activator complexes and PIC components, we performed FCS measurements on cells treated with FVP and compared the obtained distributions of apparent diffusion constants with control cells. Importantly, the expression levels of proteins in control and FVP\u2010treated cells were at similar range, and expression level variability did not affect the precision of diffusion constant measurement (Appendix\u00a0Fig S4). As for control cells, FVP\u2010treated cells had bi\u2010modal distributions of apparent diffusion constants (Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S1), but in most cases the fraction of slow component was reduced and the fraction of fast component was increased (Fig\u00a06A\u2013F). In some cases, the peak of the slow component was shifted towards higher\u2010mobility values. Altogether, this suggests that when Pol II is not actively transcribing, SAGA and ATAC, as well as TAF5 and TFIIB, exhibit reduced association with chromatin.Open in a separate windowFigure 6FCS reveals that SAGA, ATAC and PIC components, TAF5 and TFIIB, exhibit reduced chromatin interactions upon inhibition of transcription elongation\nA\u2013F Frequency plots illustrating the changes observed in the bi\u2010modal distributions of apparent diffusion constants (Ds) of eGFP\u2010tagged proteins upon flavopiridol (FVP) treatment.

We hypothesized that such interactions may affect chromatin association and thus influence the mobility, or proportion of the chromatin\u2010associated slow population of SAGA and ATAC. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether FVP treatment induces changes in transcription\u2010related histone marks, and whether such changes could be linked to the reduction in the chromatin\u2010associated population of SAGA and ATAC. We prepared acidic extracts from FVP\u2010treated cells and analysed the global abundance of major transcription\u2010related histone modifications on bulk histones for up to 3\u00a0h upon addition of the drug (Fig\u00a07A). As expected, we observed a quick decrease in H2Bub levels, since the deposition of the H2Bub1 mark is Pol II transcription elongation\u2010dependent, coupled through RAD6/RNF20/RNF40 and PAF complexes (Kim et\u00a0al, 2009). On the other hand, we did not detect changes in the levels of H3K36me3 or H3K9ac (a mark read and deposited by the GCN5), in agreement with previous observations (Tjeertes et\u00a0al, 2009; Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014). In agreement with the cross\u2010talk between H2Bub1 deposition and H3K4 trimethylation machineries (Thornton et\u00a0al, 2014 and refs therein), we observed a reduction in the level of H3K4me3, a mark read by the tandem tudor domains of SGF29, present in both ATAC and SAGA.Open in a separate windowFigure 7FCS analysis supports the key role of H3K4me3 for SGF29\u2010mediated SAGA and ATAC chromatin interactions\nU2OS cells were treated with 2\u00a0\u03bcM of flavopiridol for the indicated time (in minutes).

Left part: When transcription is active, the abundance of histone marks with which SAGA/ATAC subunits interact (e.g. SGF29\u2010H3K4me3) and favour the association of the complexes with chromatin. As a result, a population of chromatin\u2010interacting complexes can be detected in living cells as a slow diffusing fraction. Right part: When transcription elongation is inhibited, and/or the abundance of transcription\u2010associated histone modifications is reduced (i.e. H3K4me3\u2010ion), the chromatin\u2010associated fraction of SAGA/ATAC complexes (slow component) is decreased. Thus, the majority of complexes become part of the \u201cfreely\u201d diffusing population (fast component). Yellow dots: H3K4me3 mark. Arrows indicate interactions of complexes with the chromatin.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nTo further analyse in live cells to what extent the H3K4me3\u2010SGF29 tudor domain interactions can affect chromatin binding of SAGA and ATAC, we deleted the tandem tudor domains from the eGFP\u2010SGF29 protein. This construct, SGF29_DEL, was transiently expressed in U2OS, and its diffusion properties were analysed by FCS. The dynamics of SGF29_DEL were different from wild\u2010type SGF29, with a pronounced reduction of the slow, chromatin\u2010associated population of the mutant protein (Fig\u00a07B). This result demonstrates, for the first time in living cells, that the tandem tudor domains of SGF29 mediate SAGA and ATAC interactions with chromatin.To elucidate further how the interplay between SGF29 and H3K4me3 may regulate the global recruitment and association of ATAC and SAGA with chromatin, we tested the effects of reduced H3K4me3 levels on SGF29 dynamics. We used siRNA to knock down ASHL2, a core subunit of the SET1/MLL/COMPASS\u2010like methyltransferase complexes (Shilatifard, 2012), causing efficient reduction in H3K4me3 levels (Fig\u00a07C; see also Steward et\u00a0al, 2006). We performed FCS for transiently expressed eGFP\u2010SGF29 in cells previously transfected with siRNA against ASH2L, and observed significantly reduced chromatin interactions (Fig\u00a07D). Interestingly, the reduction in H3K4me3 levels has very similar effects on SGF29 dynamics as the deletion of the tandem tudor domains (Fig\u00a07E). Thus, by using a quantitative, live\u2010cell readout, and two independent approaches, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 is important for the recruitment of SAGA and ATAC to chromatin in human cells. DiscussionThe highly dynamic SAGA and ATAC coactivators and the GTFs, TFIID and TFIIB, have a fast and a slow diffusing nuclear populationSAGA and ATAC have been studied mainly by genetic, biochemical and structural approaches. Numerous studies have investigated gene\u2010specific functions of the complexes and genome\u2010wide approaches have been applied to define their binding sites. However, it has been shown that transcription\u2010associated proteins exhibit a broad range of mobility in the nuclei of living cells, with the stability of transcription factor\u2010chromatin interactions linked to function (van Royen et\u00a0al, 2011), and this information was missing for SAGA and ATAC complexes. Our FRAP and FLIP analyses classified the two coactivators as highly mobile factors, with no detectable immobile fractions, suggesting transient chromatin associations for these complexes. This behaviour is very similar to the dynamic GTFs, TFIID and TFIIB, and distinct from Pol II, which has a significant immobile fraction forming stable interactions with chromatin (Kimura et\u00a0al, 2002; Hieda et\u00a0al, 2005). Consequently, we conclude that the recruitment and function of the complexes on their chromatin substrate do not depend on direct and stable interactions with transcribing Pol II. This finding is of particular interest for the SAGA complex, which is known to exhibit its DUB activity on the gene body of actively transcribed genes (Bonnet et\u00a0al, 2014). Our observations suggest that the removal of the ubiquitin moiety from H2Bub1 does not require SAGA to travel along the gene body together with elongating Pol II. Our data rather suggest that SAGA acts on H2Bub1 in a stochastic manner driven by the fast diffusion of the complex in the nuclear environment. These observations are also important as they explain the limited number of high\u2010confidence DNA binding sites obtained in anti\u2010subunit ChIP\u2010seq profiles (Krebs et\u00a0al, 2011; Lenstra & Holstege, 2012; Venters & Pugh, 2013). Our results suggest that in the case of complexes, which interact transiently with chromatin, monitoring their genomic sites of action by ChIP may not reveal their complete functional range. In addition, the rapid fluorescence recovery/loss described in FRAP/FLIP experiments is consistent with our previous observation that the genome\u2010wide DUB activity of SAGA can be performed in <\u00a010\u00a0min and in the absence of active transcription (Bonnet et\u00a0al, 2014). Only complexes with high mobility and transient interactions with their substrate could act globally in such a short time.The single\u2010molecule sensitivity of FCS allowed us to characterize quantitatively the mobility of SAGA and ATAC subunits in the nuclei of living cells. The bi\u2010modal distribution of apparent diffusion constants obtained for all of the tested subunits illustrates well that the pool of SAGA and ATAC complexes is not homogenous, in terms of mobility characteristics, but is rather dominated by two distinct populations: a fast and a slow. Molecules present in the fast population exhibit no or very few chromatin interactions, as indicated by their apparent molecular weight, which corresponds to complexes freely diffusing in the nuclear environment (Fig\u00a07F). The slow population represents complexes that are interacting with chromatin in more stable manner (Fig\u00a07F). However, it should be noted that in FCS only diffusing objects contribute to the fluctuations of fluorescence in the observation volume during the total time of each measurement (see Materials and Methods). Thus, the slow population obtained in our FCS experiments should not be interpreted as (or compared with) proteins that are stably bound (for dozens of seconds or several minutes) to chromatin, as identified by other imaging (e.g. FRAP/FLIP kinetics of RPB1), biochemical or ChIP approaches. The estimated apparent diffusion constant of the slow component (ranging from 0.56 to 1.26\u00a0\u03bcm2/s) is higher than what has been observed for transcription activators with high affinity for specific binding site motifs on the DNA sequence [e.g. D\nslow of eGFP\u2010RAR\u2010\u03b1 (retinoic acid receptor alpha) is 0.05\u20130.10\u00a0\u03bcm2/s (Brazda et\u00a0al, 2011)]. These observations together suggest that the \u201cslow\u201d population of histone\u2010modifying coactivators associates with chromatin in a more dynamic manner than bona fide DNA sequence\u2010specific binding transcription factors, such as nuclear receptors. Similarly, although the two GTFs, TFIID and TFIIB, have been described as highly mobile in human cell nuclei (Sprouse et\u00a0al, 2008; de Graaf et\u00a0al, 2010), our FCS results show that the diffusing pool of these factors can also be further dissected into two distinct populations, analogous to SAGA and ATAC. It should be noted that, according to our measurements, we would expect that the fast and the majority of the slow population of SAGA and ATAC coactivator complexes, as well as for the GTFs, would be present in the \u201cnon\u2010bound\u201d fraction of a ChIP experiment, due to the transient nature of their interactions with the nuclear environment. Such information has to be taken into consideration to design and interpret genome\u2010wide binding studies, as they may represent only a snapshot of the dynamic protein\u2010chromatin interactions that take place in the\u00a0nuclear environment. Overall, our quantitative analysis supports the notion that SAGA and ATAC interact transiently with chromatin (Fig\u00a07F).Imaging measurements suggest that SAGA and ATAC complexes exist in the nuclei as holocomplexesIt has been suggested that components of multisubunit transcription\u2010associated complexes may have very different mobility characteristics that can be resolved, either in the nucleoplasm or on the promoters where these complexes function. Such models have been put forward by measuring different recovery rates for distinct Pol I (Dundr et\u00a0al, 2002), or Pol II (Sprouse et\u00a0al, 2008) subunits, but also from observations regarding the inherent inefficiency of Pol I and II transcription (Darzacq et\u00a0al, 2007; Gorski et\u00a0al, 2008). On the contrary, other studies suggested that Pol II assembly occurs in the cytoplasm (Boulon et\u00a0al, 2010; Czeko et\u00a0al, 2011). With our FRAP/FLIP experiments, we did not detect any significant differences in the recovery rates among subunits of SAGA or among subunits of ATAC. In addition, comparison of FRAP/FLIP rates between SAGA\u2010 and ATAC\u2010specific components showed that subunits of the two complexes behave in a very similar way. Our FCS observations are also in agreement with the FRAP/FLIP results, as we do not find significant differences between the Ds of common or specific subunits of the complexes (Table\u00a01). At present, we have no indications that SAGA or ATAC subunits have significantly different nuclear mobility characteristics (with the exception of ZZZ3), which would otherwise suggest the existence of multiple nuclear subcomplexes/modules that are sequentially recruited to their sites of action. Thus, similar to Pol II, SAGA and ATAC complexes may be assembled as holocomplexes in the cytoplasm and imported in the nucleus, where they exhibit their function. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that SAGA and/or ATAC subcomplexes would exist in the nucleus, but that their assembly into holocomplexes is too fast for their detection with the methods applied in the current study.Dynamics of SAGA and ATAC mobility during transcriptionOur FRAP/FLIP experiments performed in normal conditions demonstrated that SAGA and ATAC mobility and recruitment is independent of interactions with elongating RNA polymerase II. However, since the two complexes have multiple subunits with chromatin\u2010interacting domains, we also investigated whether the chromatin state defined by active transcription affects the dynamics of the complexes. FRAP and FLIP analysis after FVP\u2010induced transcription elongation inhibition did not detect any significant changes for SAGA or ATAC subunits. On the contrary, FCS measurements performed under the same conditions revealed that indeed the chromatin\u2010interacting fraction of both complexes (slow component) is reduced and/or exhibits reduced association with chromatin (i.e. SPT20). These results suggest that the chromatin status (i.e. histone PTMs, nucleosome composition/positioning) when transcription is blocked is less favourable for the recruitment of the two complexes. In addition, we demonstrated that although FRAP/FLIP did not detect significant changes in the mobility of TAF5 and TFIIB, the analysis of their diffusion properties by FCS revealed that these GTFs exhibit reduced interactions with chromatin upon inhibition of transcription elongation. Interestingly, our live\u2010cell observations suggest that inhibition of Pol II elongation creates a chromatin environment which may increase the mobility of GTFs and coactivator complexes.We further investigated this hypothesis by testing the levels of transcription\u2010related histone modifications on bulk histones upon FVP treatment. The observed reduction in H3K4me3 levels prompted us to analyse the importance of the mark for the diffusion of SAGA and ATAC in living cells, both by deleting the tandem tudor domains of SGF29 and by reducing the global levels of H3K4me3 after down regulating the core subunit of HMT complexes. In both cases, we found a reduced association of SAGA and ATAC with chromatin, as indicated by the reduced proportion of the slow component of SGF29. The fact that we get similar, but not identical, FCS profiles for SGF29 with FVP treatment, siASH2L treatment or the tudor domain deletion (Fig\u00a07E) suggests that additional mechanisms, other than the abundance of H3K4me3, may also affect the diffusion of SAGA and ATAC during these three different cellular conditions.H3K4me3 is found around transcription start sites (TSSs) of transcribed and poised genes when analysed by ChIP\u2010seq (Barski et\u00a0al, 2007; Guenther et\u00a0al, 2007). Particularly, it has been suggested that the extent to which H3K4me3 protrudes in the gene body may positively correlate with transcription activity of the respective gene and that certain histone marks, which correlate with elongating Pol II, are required for the deposition of H3K4me3 (Okitsu et\u00a0al, 2010; Benayoun et\u00a0al, 2014; Chen et\u00a0al, 2015). Moreover, it has been hypothesized that variation in histone modifications may create alternative binding surfaces for potential histone tail readers, suggesting that histone modifications could function by creating molecular signalling gradients (Clouaire et\u00a0al, 2014). In agreement, our data support a model in which SAGA and ATAC would associate more with chromatin when H3K4me3 is retained above a given threshold at a genome\u2010wide level. It is expected that other reader domains of SAGA and/or ATAC subunits could also contribute to chromatin interactions. Upon transcription inhibition, the loss of these cumulative reader\u2010histone mark interactions would contribute to the reduction in the described slow population. Nevertheless, the combination of our live\u2010cell approaches confirms the importance of H3K4me3 mark for the global SAGA and ATAC recruitment and provides new evidence for the presence of a link between transcription\u2010competent chromatin state and the recruitment of highly mobile complexes (Fig\u00a07F). Interestingly, it has been shown in mouse embryonic stem cells that H3K9 acetylation, the mark known to be deposited by SAGA, is downstream of H3K4me3, pointing to a molecular function for H3K4me3 in targeting SAGA\u2010dependent H3K9 acetylation (Clouaire et\u00a0al, 2014). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in the nuclear environment, there is an equilibrium between fast (\u201cfree\u201d) and slow (\u201cchromatin\u2010associated/modifying\u201d) populations of SAGA and ATAC complexes that is regulated by the chromatin landscape, and which in turn is directly or indirectly dependent on active transcription.

Evaluation of transcription inhibition was tested by Western blot (WB) assays on whole cell extracts of U2OS cells using an antibody against the CTD of RPB1 (1PB 7C2). For imaging experiments (FRAP, FLIP, FCS), drug was added ~2\u00a0h before imaging. Each treated sample was then used for 1\u20132\u00a0h. To ensure homogenous distribution of the drug, the required amount was first diluted in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of medium, prewarmed at 37\u00b0C, which was vortexed and finally added on cells growing on Ibidi \u03bc (35\u00a0mm) high glass bottom dishes.MicroscopyFRAP and FLIP For all live\u2010cell imaging experiments in this study, U2OS cells were seeded on Ibidi \u03bc (35\u00a0mm) high glass bottom dishes in phenol red free medium. FRAP was performed using a Nikon Ti\u2010E inverted microscope (with Perfect Focus System, PFS) equipped with a CSU X1 Yokogawa confocal spinning disc and a 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CFI Plan Apo VC oil NA 1.40 (Nikon) objective. Fluorescence signal was detected with a Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera. During all FRAP measurements, cell was maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 using the Tokai Hit INUBG2E\u2010TIZ stage top incubator. Roper iLas2 FRAP unit was used to bleach a circular nuclear ROI of 6 pixels radius, corresponding to ~21.9\u00a0\u03bcm2. The selected ROI was monitored every 50\u00a0ms. After 5\u00a0s (100 prebleach collected frames), the circular ROI was quickly bleached at maximum laser power with a double pulse of 50\u00a0ms. Subsequently, recovery of fluorescence was monitored with the same frequency for a total of 100\u2013200\u00a0s. MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) image analysis software was used to process the raw images and obtain the average intensity of three ROIs, which were used for further normalization: the bleached ROI, the whole nucleus ROI and a ROI corresponding to background signal. EasyFRAP software (Rapsomaniki et\u00a0al, 2012) was used to normalize the obtained background\u2010subtracted fluorescence values. With the latter software, the signal of the bleached ROI was normalized to the average value of the last 50 prebleach frames, which was set to 1. Next, average fluorescence intensity of the whole nucleus at each time point was used to correct for signal loss in this ROI resulting from observational photobleaching and fluorescence loss during photobleaching. The obtained curves were normalized according to the full\u2010scale normalization method (Ellenberg et\u00a0al, 1997), in which the value of fluorescence intensity in the bleached ROI for the first post\u2010bleach frame is set to zero.FLIP was performed using the same hardware set\u2010up as for FRAP. For the experiments described in this manuscript, a circular nuclear ROI of 17.5\u2010pixel radius, corresponding to ~46.6\u00a0\u03bcm2, was bleached every 3\u00a0s at maximum laser power by a double bleach pulse for a minimum total period of 4\u00a0min. Like in FRAP, raw images were quantified by MetaMorph software. Average fluorescence values were extracted from three ROIs required for FLIP data normalization: the first corresponds to the whole nucleus, the second corresponds to a neighbouring cell that was always included to the field of view (used to normalize for observational photobleaching), and a third region corresponds to background signal. Normalization of FLIP data was done according to the formulas described in Nissim\u2010Rafinia and Meshorer (2011). In FLIP, the average corrected value of five prebleach frames of the whole nucleus region was normalized to 1.Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) FCS measurements were performed on a home\u2010build two\u2010photon system set\u2010up based on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope with an Olympus 60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.2NA water immersion objective as previously described (Azoulay et\u00a0al, 2003; Clamme et\u00a0al, 2003), at 37\u00b0C. Two\u2010photon excitation at 930\u00a0nm was provided by a tunable femtosecond laser (Insight DeepSee, Spectra Physics), and photons were collected using a set of two filters: a two\u2010photon short pass filter with a cut\u2010off wavelength of 680\u00a0nm (F75\u2010680, AHF, Germany), and a band\u2010pass filter of 520\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0nm (F37\u2010520, AHF, Germany). The fluorescence was directed to a fibre\u2010coupled APD (SPCM\u2010AQR\u201014\u2010FC, Perkin Elmer) connected to a hardware correlator (ALV5000, ALV GmbH, Germany) allowing online calculation of the normalized autocorrelation function. In living cells, there is no real steady state for the fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For this reason, FCS measurements were sequentially repeated, typically 15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0s with an excitation power adjusted to avoid photobleaching of the fluorophore within the excitation volume. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the cellular medium, it is difficult to use a model with a well\u2010defined number of diffusing species. To make no assumptions about this number, curves were first fitted by using a model that relies on the Maximum Entropy approach (Sengupta et\u00a0al, 2003). In this case, autocorrelation curves were analysed assuming a quasicontinuous distribution of diffusing components (D\ni with i\u00a0>>\u00a01). The algorithm provides as an output the distribution of the obtained apparent diffusion constants for a specific condition. To test the robustness of the algorithm, we used free eGFP diffusing in aqueous solution, for which we obtained a single peak distribution centred around 92\u00a0\u03bcm2/s, a value which is in agreement with previous studies (Potma et\u00a0al, 2001).The Maximum Entropy fitting also resulted in a single peak distribution for free eGFP diffusing in the nucleus of UO2S cells. For all the other factors studied in this work, bi\u2010modal distributions were obtained, demonstrating that the diffusion process was mainly dominated by the presence of two diffusing species with two different molecular weights. Thus, to determine in a quantitative manner the respective fraction of the two species, individual autocorrelation curves were fitted with the following model: G(\u03c4)=1N1\u2212F11+\u03c4\u03c4D111+\u03c4S2\u03c4D112+F11+\u03c4\u03c4D211+\u03c4S2\u03c4D212where N is the average number of fluorescent species in the focal volume, \u03c4 the lag time, \u03c4\nD1 and \u03c4\nD2 the average residence time in the focal volume of the two diffusing species, F the fraction of the high molecular weight diffusing species and S a structural parameter defined as the ratio between the axial and lateral radii of the beam waist. If F\u00a0=\u00a00, the equation\u00a0will account for the case where a single species diffuses within the observation volume.The two\u2010population fit was further used to test whether the measured parameters were showing any correlation with the expression level of cells used for our measurements. Particularly, to work in conditions where the diffusion time is independent of the expression level in the cells of interest, a threshold was used to filter out autocorrelation curves giving a number of molecules (N) above 200 in the observation volume of a given cell. The remaining cells, for which N\u00a0<\u00a0200 in the observation volume, were re\u2010analysed with the Maximum Entropy model to obtain the diffusion constant distributions.In the frame of the Stokes\u2010Einstein formalism, the diffusion constant of a sphere is related to its hydrodynamic radius according to: D=kBT6\u03c0\u03b7rHwhere k\nB is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature in K, \u03b7 the viscosity and r\nH the hydrodynamic radius of the sphere. In this case, the diffusion constant scales with the molecular weight of the sphere at the power one\u2010third. By taking as a reference the molecular weight of the free eGFP (MW\neGFP\u00a0=\u00a027\u00a0kD), it is possible to determine the apparent molecular mass (MW) of the labelled protein by using the following relation: MW=MWeGFPDeGFPD3where D\neGFP and D are the diffusion constants of the free eGFP and the eGFP\u2010tagged protein, respectively.Additional Materials and Methods are described in the Appendix\u00a0Supplementary Methods.
