Although the machinery controlling RNA export is highly conserved, there are many examples of selective RNA export. However, the regulatory processes controlling preferential export of some RNAs over others are not understood. One well studied example of selective RNA export in yeast concerns the generally distinct fate of mRNAs compared with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). Currently, the distinction between mRNAs and lncRNAs is believed to be made during 3\u2032 end formation of the transcript, following transcription elongation but prior to the acquisition of export competence, with the length of the poly(A) tail being a determinant for\u00a0this process (Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). The lncRNAs, and some 20% of mRNAs that behave like lncRNAs, are preferentially captured and retained by Mtr4-dependent surveillance. These transcripts are subsequently degraded in the nucleus by the nuclear exosome and are characterized by their reduced association with the conserved nuclear-cytoplasmic export factor Mex67/NXF1/TAP (tandem affinity purification) (Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). Efficient nuclear export of a transcript requires RNA binding proteins such as Nab2, controlling poly(A) tail length, and an adaptor protein such as Yra1/REF, linking the transcript to Mex67 and the nuclear pore complex (Baejen et\u00a0al., 2014, Hieronymus and Silver, 2003, Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). However, there are likely to be multiple parallel export pathways, with the export of particular mRNAs occurring at different rates in association with particular combinations of poly(A) binding proteins and adaptors. Mex67 links elongation to transcript export as co-transcriptionally deposited monoubiquitylation of lysine 123 on histone H2B (H2Bub) facilitates recruitment of Mex67 to the transcript (Vitaliano-Prunier et\u00a0al., 2012). The deposition of H2Bub requires the Paf1 complex (Paf1C), containing Paf1 (RNA polymerase II [Pol2]-associated factor 1), in the Pol2 transcription elongation complex (TEC) (Tomson and Arndt, 2013, Yang et\u00a0al., 2016). Paf1C was originally described as interacting with the TATA binding protein, the transcription elongation factors (TEFs) Spt4-Spt5, and facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT), and, in addition to controlling deposition of H2Bub, Paf1C has been implicated in many aspects of gene regulation (Kowalik et\u00a0al., 2015, Poli et\u00a0al., 2016, Tomson and Arndt, 2013, Yang et\u00a0al., 2016), including release of the promoter-proximal paused Pol2 into productive elongation (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015, Yu et\u00a0al., 2015) and transcription elongation on DNA or chromatin templates (Rond\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2004, Tous et\u00a0al., 2011). Consistent with a direct role in elongation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) reveals accumulation of Paf1 over the transcribed region of genes (Mayer et\u00a0al., 2010). Currently, our understanding of the relationship between TEFs such as Paf1 and elongating Pol2 is limited because ChIP, the technique used to capture TEF interactions in chromatin, cannot resolve the DNA strand involved (Mahony and Pugh, 2015). This problem is compounded by recent observations showing that budding yeast,\u00a0fly, and mammalian genomes are extensively transcribed, often on both strands of DNA (reviewed in Mellor et\u00a0al., 2016, and Murray and Mellor, 2016). To address exactly how Paf1 influences transcription elongation and transcript fate, we applied nucleotide resolution strand-specific techniques to map (1)\u00a0Pol2 on genes in the absence of Paf1 (by native elongating transcript sequencing [NET-seq]) and (2) Paf1 association with elongating Pol2 (by TEF-associated nascent elongating transcript sequencing [TEF-seq], an adaption of NET-seq). Here we show that Paf1 controls the differential nuclear export of mRNAs and preferential nuclear retention of the majority of lncRNAs and some mRNAs. Paf1 shows selective enrichment on, or depletion from, Pol2-transcribing RNAs that are also selectively enriched or depleted for 3\u2032 end processing and export factors. Paf1 enrichment/depletion on Pol2 is dynamic and controlled by environmental factors via promoters, suggesting that the fate of transcripts is equally dynamic and determined before their transcription. Paf1 also functions to control Pol2 distribution on genes during elongation, but this function is common to all genes and is distinct from its role in orchestrating differential nuclear export of specific transcripts. Together, our findings support distinct functions for Paf1C associated with Pol2, a core function in Pol2 elongation at all genes and a regulatory function determining differential transcript fate at selected genes. ResultsMapping Strand-Specific Paf1 Association with Pol2\u00a0Using TEF-SeqTo map the position of Paf1 on elongating Pol2, we immunoprecipitated) FLAG-tagged Paf1 and sequenced the nascent RNA, purified from the active site of co-immunoprecipitated Pol2, from the 3\u2032 end (Figure\u00a01A; Tables S1 and S2; Figures S1 and\u00a0S2). This technique, called TEF-seq, is related to NET-seq, which maps the position of the 3\u2032 nucleotide of the nascent RNA in transcriptionally engaged Pol2 (Churchman and Weissman, 2011). Alignment of reads shows the position of the final incorporated nucleotide, giving a strand-specific nucleotide resolution map of transcriptionally engaged Pol2 associated with Paf1. Replicates show that TEF-seq data are reproducible (Figure\u00a0S1H). To ensure that our map (Figure\u00a01B) reports only the signal from Pol2 associated with Paf1, we used two important controls. First, we removed the background signal that is not specific to tagged Paf1 using material present in an immunoprecipitation (IP) from a strain lacking a FLAG tag (no-tag control; STAR Methods; Figures S1E\u2013S1G). Second, to show that the RNA recovered is specifically associated with Pol2, we subjected Paf1 to single or sequential IP procedures (Paf1-FLAG or Rpb3-FLAG and then Paf1-HA) and normalized to levels of Pol2 also subjected to single or sequential IPs (Rpb2-FLAG or Rpb3-FLAG and then Rpb2-HA) by tagging the Rpb3 and/or Rpb2 components of Pol2 (Figure\u00a01; STAR Methods). The Pol2-normalized Paf1 metagene profiles for the single and sequential IPs are similar, suggesting that TEF-seq captures only Paf1 associated with elongating Pol2 and not from a Pol2-independent but direct association of the Paf1C with RNA. Thus, we are capturing Paf1 specifically associated with Pol2, although Paf1 could be associated with Pol2 via the transcript emanating from its active site (Dermody and Buratowski, 2010), via the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit, Rpb1 (Cust\u00f3dio and Carmo-Fonseca, 2016, Qiu et\u00a0al., 2012) or via another TEF (Tomson and Arndt, 2013).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Mapping Paf1 on Pol2\u00a0Using TEF-Seq(A) Schematic showing single or sequential immunoprecipitation of Pol2 (via the components Rpb3 or Rpb2, NET-seq) or TEF:Pol2 complexes (TEF-seq) via epitope tags from cryogenically lysed and DNase I-treated yeast extracts.(B) Examples of Rpb3 and Rpb2 NET-seq and Paf1 TEF-seq profiles on individual genes. Images in integrated genome viewer (IGV) (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et\u00a0al., 2013) show loci on the Watson (top, filled arrows) or Crick (bottom, open arrows) strands. Scales allow relative changes to be visualized and are proportional to each other across all IGV images.(C) Comparison of Rpb2-normalized Paf1 metagene profiles from single (blue) or sequential (black) IP procedures aligned at the TSS or PAS (dashed line, right). Pol2-normalized (using either Rpb2 or Rpb3 NET-seq data) TEF metagene profiles are calculated as follows. TEF/Pol2 (TEF-seq counts/NET-seq counts) ratios are calculated for each 10-nt bin across the specified region. For TSS-aligned plots, the final 200 nt of each gene before the TES is excluded. For PAS or TES-aligned plots, the initial 500 nt after the TSS of each gene is excluded. These ratios are multiplied by a TEF and Pol2 subunit-specific scaling factor to enable visualization on the same arbitrary linear scale. The mean (scaling factor \u00d7 TEF)/Pol2 ratios are then calculated for each 10-nt bin across all genes after first excluding the top 10% and bottom 10% of ratios to prevent single-nucleotide spikes from skewing the mean (see STAR Methods for details).See also Tables S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2.Paf1 Oscillates on Pol2 during Transcription through ChromatinThe association of Paf1 with elongating Pol2 is not uniform but\u00a0shows a remarkable periodicity (\u223c170 nt), reminiscent of phased positioned nucleosomes (Jiang and Pugh, 2009; Figures 1C and\u00a02A). To examine this in more detail, TEF-seq profiles were obtained for the Pol2-associated histone chaperones Spt6 and Spt16 (Tables S1 and S2; Figures S1 and S2). The Rpb3-normalized metagene profiles for Spt6, Spt16, and Paf1 revealed their dynamic behavior during transcription through chromatin (Figure\u00a02). Relative to the center point of nucleosomes\u00a0+2 to\u00a0+5, these factors oscillate around nucleosomes, with peaks and troughs separated by \u223c80 nt, offset for Spt6 compared with Spt16 and Paf1, which are known to interact (Krogan et\u00a0al., 2004, Squazzo et\u00a0al., 2002). The marked phasing offset between Spt6 and Spt16 oscillations may reflect their preferential affinities for H3 or H2A-H2B dimers, respectively (Bortvin and Winston, 1996, Hondele et\u00a0al., 2013). The ability to detect the dynamics of transcription through chromatin reflects the high resolution of the TEF-seq data.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Levels of Paf1 Oscillate on Pol2(A) Rpb3-normalized TEF metagene profiles for Paf1, Spt6, and Spt16 from the TSS to\u00a0+1400 nt averaged across mRNA genes (see Figure\u00a01C for details).(B) Rpb3-normalized TEF metagene profiles aligned to the center (dashed line) of nucleosomes\u00a0+2 to\u00a0+5\u00a0(relative to the TSS) averaged across mRNA genes.(C) p Values (one-tailed Student\u2019s t test) calculated to test whether there is a significant difference in the mean TEF/Rpb3 ratio at the center compared with the center\u00a0+50 nt of each nucleosome.(D) Schematic showing five stages of the oscillations between Pol2, Spt6, Spt16, Paf1, and nucleosomes (the green circle is Paf1 and Spt16, and purple is Spt6). The equivalent positions (1\u20135) are shown in (B).See also Tables S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2.Paf1 Is Enriched and Depleted on Pol2The high resolution of these data gives us the opportunity to study Paf1 levels on Pol2 transcribing different genes. TEF-seq reads for Paf1 from the transcript start site (TSS)\u00a0+ 400 nt to the transcript end site (TES) \u2212 200 nt were counted, thus excluding regions in which Paf1 shows large changes in its association with Pol2. Differential occupancy was assessed by comparing the Paf1-specific counts to counts for Rpb3 across the same regions of mRNA genes. Paf1 shows a large range in\u00a0relative occupancy levels, with 138 genes significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) Paf1-enriched and 153 Paf1-depleted (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S3; see STAR Methods for selection of gene groups for statistical analysis). Paf1 is also depleted from Pol2 on lncRNA genes regardless of whether they encode stable or unstable transcripts (Figures 3C and 3D). No significant difference in transcript levels between the Paf1-FLAG- and Rpb3-FLAG-tagged strains was evident for Paf1-enriched or -depleted genes (Figure\u00a0S3), showing that the Paf1 and Rpb3 epitope tags are not responsible for the differential levels observed. Finally, enrichment and depletion of Paf1 is also observed at the same sets of genes when the read counts for Paf1 in the single or sequential IPs are normalized to read counts for Rpb2 (instead of Rpb3) in single or sequential IPs, respectively (Figures 3B and 3D).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Differential Levels of Paf1 on Pol2 Are Determined by the Promoter and CTD Phosphorylation Status(A and B) Differential Paf1 occupancy at mRNA genes.(A) Scatterplot showing the base mean occupancy against the log2 relative Paf1-to-Rpb3 occupancy ratio for each gene.

Profiles are smoothed by calculating a running mean average using a moving window containing five 10-nt\u00a0bins. p Values (one-tailed Welch\u2019s t test) are calculated to test whether there is a significant difference in the ratios of the two groups at each 10-nt bin from 400\u2013700 nt (D and G) or 400\u20131,100 nt (B and H). The upper quartile of these is taken, meaning that 75% of p values are lower than that shown.See also Table S3.Genes with Paf1-Enriched Pol2 Share Regulatory FeaturesPaf1-enriched mRNA genes share distinctive features not seen\u00a0in Paf1-depleted mRNA genes. First, there is a significant enrichment (p\u00a0< 0.00023) for divergently expressed gene pairs, 100 pairs within the 1,200 most Paf1-enriched genes, selected by ordering the genes by their log2 relative Paf1-to-Rpb3 ratio. This suggests that the shared bi-directional promoter between these divergent pairs, which are often, but not always, co-regulated (Yan et\u00a0al., 2015), may be responsible for promoting Paf1 enrichment on both genes. This enrichment for divergent pairs\u00a0is also present within the original class of 138 significantly (p\u00a0< 0.05) Paf1-enriched genes (four pairs, p\u00a0< 0. 017). There is no significant enrichment for divergent pairs within the 1,200 most Paf1-depleted genes (70 pairs, p\u00a0= 0.73). Second, Paf1-enriched genes share regulatory features (Figure\u00a03E; Figure\u00a0S3). They are\u00a0regulated by transcription factors such as Sfp1, Haa1, and\u00a0Cbf1/Cpf1 (a MYC homolog) (Hu et\u00a0al., 2007, Keller et\u00a0al., 2001, Mellor et\u00a0al., 1990). Interestingly, degradation of promoter-bound MYC releases PAF1C for transfer onto Pol2 during elongation in mammalian cells (Jaenicke et\u00a0al., 2016). In addition, the promoters of significantly (p\u00a0< 0.1) Paf1-enriched genes are enriched with DNA sequence elements within 500 nt of the TSS, such as AAAATTTT/C (104 of 229, p\u00a0= 1.9\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22129) and CTCATCG/T (81 of 229, p\u00a0= 6.4\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22129), binding sites for Sfp1 and Dot6/Tod6, respectively, often present together in promoters (Jorgensen et\u00a0al., 2002). This supports a role for the promoter in determining Paf1 enrichment on Pol2. To validate this, we replaced the coding regions of Paf1-enriched CMK2 and Paf1-depleted SLC1 with URA3 and immunoprecipitated the transcripts associated with FLAG-tagged Rpb3 or FLAG-tagged Paf1. Assessment of levels of nascent transcripts immunoprecipitated from the hybrid genes revealed that the Pol2 transcribing URA3 from the promoter of the Paf1-enriched gene is more Paf1-enriched than when transcribing URA3 from the promoter of the Paf1-depleted gene (Figure\u00a03F). This further implicates the promoter in determining levels of Paf1 on Pol2. Next we asked how the promoter influences enrichment or depletion of Paf1 on Pol2 transcribing different genes.Differential Levels of Paf1 on Pol2 Reflect Levels of Serine 2 and 5 Phosphorylation of the Pol2 CTDOne feature of lncRNA genes, transcribed by Paf1-depleted Pol2, is that Pol2 shows reduced levels of Ser2-phosphorylated CTD on Rpb1 (Milligan et\u00a0al., 2016, Murray et\u00a0al., 2015). This is consistent with the documented role for Paf1C in determining levels of Ser2 phosphorylation on the Rpb1 CTD in Pol2 (Dronamraju and Strahl, 2014). Because Paf1C can also interact with Pol2 via its Ser2-phosphorylated CTD (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2012), this positive feedback provides a possible explanation for how differential recruitment, controlled by the promoter, is maintained during transcription. To relate enrichment or depletion from Pol2 to the phosphorylation status of the CTD, we used TEF-seq to assess levels of six additional TEFs on Pol2 (Tables S1 and S2). These include (1) Set2, the lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36) methyltransferase, and Pcf11, required for 3\u2032\u00a0end formation, both of which, like Paf1, show some dependence on Ser2-phosphorylated CTD for their association with Pol2; (2) Spt6 and Spt16, which are known to interact with Paf1; (3) Cet1, a capping enzyme that interacts with Ser5-phosphorylated CTD; and (4) Ssu72, a Ser5 phosphatase (Figures 3G and 3H; Table S2; Figure\u00a0S2). Set2, Spt6, and Spt16 show significantly decreased recruitment to Pol2 on lncRNA genes compared with mRNA genes and on the 1,000 most Paf1-depleted genes compared with the 1,000 most Paf1-enriched genes, whereas no significant decrease is observed for\u00a0Pcf11, Cet1, or Ssu72. Because Pcf11 and Cet1 interact with CTD repeats phosphorylated at Ser2 or Ser5 alone (Table\u00a0S2), respectively, differential levels of these modifications are unlikely to be related to levels of Paf1. By contrast, Set2 and Paf1 preferentially interact with the CTD when both Ser2 and Ser5 are phosphorylated within the same and/or adjacent repeats (Kizer et\u00a0al., 2005, Qiu et\u00a0al., 2012). This analysis suggests that differential Ser2 phosphorylation, only within or next to Ser5 phosphorylated repeats, is the key to maintaining differential Paf1 during transcription. Finally, because a paf1\u0394 strain lacking all Paf1 protein shows reduced levels of both Ser2 phosphorylation and Pcf11 on genes (Tomson and Arndt, 2013) but Pcf11 does not show significantly decreased levels on Paf1-depleted genes (Figures 3G and 3H), we propose that a low level of Paf1, equal to that on the most Paf1-depleted genes identified by our TEF-seq analysis, may determine a level of CTD repeats phosphorylated at Ser2 alone sufficient for Pcf11 recruitment.Paf1-Enriched or Depleted Pol2 on Genes Is Not Related to Transcription ElongationTo address whether Paf1 enrichment/depletion on Pol2 is related to the documented role of Paf1 in transcription elongation (Rond\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2004, Tous et\u00a0al., 2011), we subjected a paf1\u0394 strain lacking all Paf1 protein to NET-seq, which effectively captures all forms of engaged Pol2 on the genome (Churchman and Weissman, 2011, Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2014). Pol2 metagene profiles (Figure\u00a04A), heatmaps showing Pol2 profiles on all genes (Figure\u00a04B), and Pol2 profiles on individual genes (Figure\u00a04C) reveal distinct differences. The most notable differences in the paf1\u0394 strain are the shifts in the position of the 5\u2032 peak toward the 3\u2032\u00a0end and increased reads over the 3\u2032 region of genes relative to reads over the 5\u2032 region, with a notable peak just preceding the polyadenylation site (PAS). To see whether genes with Pol2 enriched or depleted for Paf1 have different distributions of Pol2 over their transcribed regions, we compared the metagene profiles for each class (Figure\u00a04D). The genes with Paf1-enriched or Paf1-depleted Pol2 showed an identical profile after controlling for gene length. Importantly, both profiles were different from that obtained from a paf1\u0394 strain lacking all Paf1 protein. Thus, a certain level of Paf1 ensures a normal profile of Pol2 during transcription elongation on all genes, which must be equivalent to or below that on the most Paf1-depleted gene identified by our TEF-seq analysis. If Paf1 enrichment or depletion is not related to elongation, then what is it doing?Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Distinct Functions for Paf1 in Elongation and RNA Fate(A) Metagene occupancy profiles averaged across mRNA genes using Rpb3 chromatin immunoprecipitation on a microarray chip (ChIP-chip) data (Mayer et\u00a0al., 2010) and Rpb3 NET-seq data for WT and paf1\u0394 strains.

Analysis of photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) datasets in which RNA-bound factors are directly UV cross-linked to transcripts revealed that\u00a0Paf1-enriched or -depleted genes encode transcripts that are similarly enriched or depleted for RNA processing and nuclear export factors. Mean PAR-CLIP counts per nucleotide for 23 RNA-associated factors already normalized for transcript levels were calculated for all transcripts encoded by each Paf1 group: enriched, depleted, or showing no significant enrichment or depletion (p\u00a0< 0.05) (Figure\u00a05A; Table S4; Baejen et\u00a0al., 2014). Paf1-enriched or depleted genes encode transcripts that are\u00a0significantly (p\u00a0< 0.001) enriched or depleted for six of the 23 RNA-associated factors (Cft2 [CPSF-100], Mex67 [TAP], Mpe1, Nab2 [ZC3H14], Pab1 [PABPC1], and Npl3) compared with those with no particular Paf1 enrichment or depletion. These factors have a range of functions, including transcript cleavage and polyadenylation (Cft2 and Mpe1), poly(A) binding (Nab2 and Pab1), and nuclear export of transcripts (Mex67 and Npl3). Yra1, an RNA adaptor that interacts with Mex67, Hpr1, and Sub2, components of mRNA export complexes, is also enriched on transcripts encoded by Paf1-enriched genes. Interestingly, Paf1C interacts with Hpr1, Yra1, Npl3, and Nab2 (Table S4).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Paf1 Influences the Nuclear Export of Transcripts(A) Transcripts from Paf1-enriched or Paf1-depleted mRNA genes show increased or decreased binding, respectively, to Cft2, Mex67, Mpe1, Nab2, Npl3, and Pab1. mRNA genes were split into Paf1-enriched (red), Paf1-depleted (purple), and no significant difference in Paf1 (blue) groups (p\u00a0< 0.05). Bar charts show the average PAR-CLIP counts per nucleotide, normalized for differences in transcript levels, for each group for each protein using data from Baejen et\u00a0al. (2014). Error bars show the SEM p values (Welch\u2019s t test) calculated to test the significance of the increase or decrease in the mean of the enriched or depleted group relative to the no significant difference group, respectively.(B) Transcripts from Paf1-enriched or Paf1-depleted mRNA genes show increased binding to cytoplasmic factors or the nuclear surveillance factor Mtr4, respectively. Bar charts show the percent of mRNA transcripts from each Paf1 group in each of ten clusters defined by Tuck and Tollervey (2013). Transcripts have been clustered according to their association with particular combinations of RNA binding proteins. The asterisk marks cluster II, in which transcripts are associated specifically with the poly(A) binding protein Pab1 but retained in the nucleus for degradation.(C) Top: profiles showing average relative occupancy for Paf1 (blue) and Rpb3 (black) in 50-nt bins from TSS \u2212100 nt to PAS\u00a0+100 nt on selected mRNA genes.

Blue shading indicates the first 400 nt of each gene, reflecting regions were Paf1 has not reached maximum levels on Pol2. Paf1 levels are multiplied by a scaling factor (2.2) across all profiles to enable visualization of relative changes.

Also shown are images showing the distribution of transcripts in a wide field and selected images of individual cells for WT and paf1\u0394 strains. Selected individual cells are numbered 1\u20134. Blue is DAPI, red dots are CMK2 transcripts (see also Figures S4 and S5).(E) Schematic showing the known relationships between Paf1 in Paf1C, H2Bub, and RNA processing and export factors (arrows indicate known direct or indirect interactions). Also shown are the features determined in this work, including the role of transcription factors (TFs) and the phosphorylated CTD (Ser2 and Ser5) in selective Paf1 enrichment on Pol2.See also Tables S4, S5, and S6.We used a second dataset that clustered genes into ten groups (I\u2013X) based on the association of their encoded transcripts with RNA binding proteins using crosslinking and cDNA analysis (CRAC), a technique related to PAR-CLIP (Figure\u00a05B; Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). Paf1-enriched genes are enriched in clusters VIII\u2013X. Because the encoded transcripts of the genes in clusters VIII\u2013X are associated with RNA binding proteins involved in transcript export (Mex67) or cytoplasmic RNA processing functions (Xrn1 and Ski2), this confirms the link between Paf1-enriched genes and the preferential export of their encoded transcripts, and clusters with no clear enrichment for Paf1-enriched or -depleted genes (clusters V\u2013VII) illustrate the selective nature of Paf1 function. Importantly, this dataset\u00a0also contains nuclear surveillance factors (clusters I\u2013IV) such as Mtr4 (SKIV2L2/hMtr4) that target transcripts for processing or degradation by the nuclear exosome. Clusters I\u2013IV, containing Mtr4-associated stable and unstable lncRNAs and 852 of 3,966 mRNAs that are preferentially retained and degraded in the nucleus, are also enriched for transcripts from Paf1-depleted genes. Because the Paf1 groups only contain genes annotated as encoding mRNAs, this association is likely to reflect the mRNAs that are treated similarly to lncRNAs and retained in the nucleus because of low levels of Paf1 on Pol2. This points to a novel role for Paf1 in co-transcriptionally determining selective transcript fate by orchestrating the recruitment of particular RNA binding proteins.Paf1-Enriched Pol2 Promotes Nuclear Export of the Encoded TranscriptIf the processing and export of these selected transcripts depend on levels of Paf1 on Pol2 transcribing the gene, we predict that Paf1-enriched genes would show increased nuclear retention of their encoded transcripts when PAF1 is ablated (paf1\u0394). Indeed, this is what we observed by cell fractionation followed by qRT-PCR at transcripts from Paf1-enriched genes (Figure\u00a05C). No significant increase in nuclear retention was observed for transcripts from Paf1-depleted genes or genes at which Paf1 is neither enriched nor depleted. We used single-molecule RNA fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization (FISH) to detect the transcripts from Paf1-enriched CMK2 in wild-type (WT) and paf1\u0394 backgrounds to confirm these observations (Figure\u00a05D). Counting the number of CMK2 transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm of more than 1,000 individual cells reveals a significant increase in nuclear relative to cytoplasmic transcripts in the absence of Paf1. As expected, an lncRNA showed no change in subcellular localization in the paf1\u0394 background (Figure\u00a0S4). These data support a link between Paf1-enriched Pol2 on genes\u00a0and nuclear export of the encoded transcripts (Figure\u00a05E). However, because deletion of Paf1 may result in changes that indirectly affect transcript export, we sought to confirm the link between differential Paf1 enrichment and RNA export using physiological conditions to alter Paf1 levels on Pol2.Paf1 Enrichment or Depletion on Pol2 Is Dynamic and Related to Differential RNA Export from the NucleusBecause promoters are involved in Paf1 enrichment on Pol2, we expect enrichment/depletion of Paf1 on Pol2 to be dynamic and change with environmental conditions. We used a simple carbon source shift, transferring cells from glucose- to galactose-containing medium for 5, 15, or 60\u00a0min, and compared Paf1 TEF-seq profiles and Rpb3 NET-seq profiles at the three time points with the same data for the cells grown in glucose. We observed significant enrichment or depletion for Paf1 on Pol2 for each sample (Figure\u00a06A; Table S3). Importantly, by comparing how genes that are Paf1-enriched or -depleted under one condition change under the other three conditions, we demonstrate unequivocally that levels of Paf1 on Pol2 are dynamic and that a gene transcribed by Paf1-depleted Pol2 under one condition can be transcribed by Paf1-enriched Pol2 under another condition, and vice versa, independent of levels of transcription. Consistent with a role for transcription factors in differential recruitment of Paf1, 19 of 30 genes (63%) with significantly (p\u00a0< 0.05) Paf1-enriched Pol2 in both glucose and after 60\u00a0min in galactose are regulated by Sfp1.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06Paf1 Enrichment or Depletion on Pol2 Is Dynamic and Related to RNA Export(A) Differential Paf1 occupancy at mRNA genes cultured in glucose (GLU) or after 5, 15, or 60\u00a0min in galactose (GAL) (columns). The rows show genes that are significantly (p\u00a0< 0.05) enriched (green) or depleted (purple) under each of the four conditions and how the patterns of enrichment or depletion for those genes under one condition changes as the environment changes (growth conditions). For each condition, Paf1 TEF-seq and Rpb3 NET-seq data were obtained in duplicate. Each scatterplot shows the base mean occupancy against the log2 relative Paf1-to-Rpb3 occupancy ratio for each mRNA gene.(B) Profiles showing average relative occupancy for Paf1 (blue) and Rpb3 (black) in 100-nt bins across selected mRNA genes. Paf1 levels are multiplied by 2.2 across all GLU profiles and 1.8 across all GAL 60-min profiles because this brings the level of Paf1 compared with Rpb3 to the same level for both conditions for the control gene, CLB1, which shows almost no change in relative Paf1-to-Rpb3 occupancy between these two conditions. Pol2 on the selected genes is significantly (p\u00a0< 0.05) Paf1-enriched in glucose, and all show a decrease in the log2 relative Paf1-to-Rpb3 occupancy ratio greater than 1.2 upon the switch to galactose for 60\u00a0min.(C) Bar charts showing the mean ratio of nuclear to whole-cell transcript levels in glucose and after 60\u00a0min in galactose for the loci shown, measured using qRT-PCR for transcripts encoded by the genes shown above. Transcript levels are normalized to the level of the CLB1 transcript in each sample. Error bars show the SEM p values (Welch\u2019s t test) calculated to test the significance of the increase in the mean ratio in galactose (n\u00a0= 4).See also Tables S3 and S6.To relate differential Paf1 enrichment to nuclear export of the encoded transcripts, we identified genes that are Paf1-enriched in glucose that also show a large reduction in the levels of Paf1 on Pol2 after 60\u00a0min in galactose without any major change in levels of Pol2 under the two conditions (Figure\u00a06B). We predicted that, in galactose medium, the encoded transcripts should show\u00a0increased nuclear retention, and, indeed, this is what we observed (Figure\u00a06C). Taken together, these data suggest that the enrichment/depletion of Pol2 with Paf1 during elongation plays a role in determining the selective fate of the nascent transcripts independent of transcription elongation. DiscussionPaf1 and its associated proteins in Paf1C likely act as a platform, recruiting factors that connect Paf1 to multiple transcription processes from elongation to polyadenylation and termination (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015, Tomson and Arndt, 2013, Yang et\u00a0al., 2016, Yu et\u00a0al., 2015). Given Paf1C\u2019s role in mediating post-translational modifications to histones, such as H2Bub, and its capacity to form protein:protein interactions with factors involved in RNA processing and nuclear export (Table S4), it is not surprising that Paf1 has additional roles in regulating nuclear export of transcripts, as we show here. What is surprising is that this is a selective event and distinct from Paf1\u2019s role in elongation. Given the biochemical evidence that Paf1\u2019s function in elongation is direct (Rond\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2004, Tous et\u00a0al., 2011), we propose that there may be two distinct Paf1-associated functions. Low levels of Paf1, equal to that on the most Paf1-depleted gene defined using TEF-seq, would be sufficient for the core elongation function on all genes. The second function would result from differential association of Paf1 with Pol2 above this level, leading to selective promotion of RNA nuclear export. Our analysis implicates the promoter as the main feature linked to enrichment of Paf1 on Pol2 transcribing the associated gene. Furthermore, levels of Ser2-phosphorylated residues with the CTD, only when neighboring Ser5 residues are also phosphorylated, maintain differential enrichment or depletion during transcription elongation. There are a number of possible ways to envisage how the promoter is linked to Paf1 enrichment on Pol2, all involving specific DNA sequence elements and transcription factors such as Sfp1, Haa1, or Cbf1. Transcription factors (TFs) are known to influence the transition from a more Ser5- to a more Ser2-phosphorylated CTD during transcription elongation (Kwak and Lis, 2013). By analogy with the role of MYC in mammalian cells (Jaenicke et\u00a0al., 2016), TFs could recruit Paf1, perhaps in association with another factor, such as CK2, known to interact with both Paf1 and Sfp1, and then transfer Paf1 to Pol2. Alternatively, TFs could recruit CTD kinases such as Bur1 (CDK9) or Ctk1 (CDK12), leading to differential Ser2 phosphorylation levels on Pol2 and, hence, differential Paf1 levels. Finally, TFs could promote recruitment of a Paf1-enriched pre-initiation complex (PIC) as opposed to a mediator-enriched PIC (Hampsey, 1998).Current models propose that transcript fate is determined by poly(A) tail length and the proteins associated with different transcripts during 3\u2032 end formation (Tuck and Tollervey, 2013). However, we show here that transcript poly(A) tail length (Subtelny et\u00a0al., 2014) showed no relationship to Paf1 enrichment or depletion on mRNA genes (Figure\u00a0S5) and, thus, is unlikely to be related to Paf1\u2019s role in selectively promoting transcript nuclear export. Instead, our data suggest that the proteins associated with these transcripts, and thus their fate, can be determined before 3\u2032 end formation and is related to the levels of Paf1 in the elongation complex during transcription elongation, which is dynamic and subject to environmental control via promoters. Transcript fate can be modulated by signals received at the promoter, already shown to influence transcript localization in the cytoplasm (Zid and O\u2019Shea, 2014) and half-life (Bregman et\u00a0al., 2011, Trcek et\u00a0al., 2011). Our data add differential RNA export to the functions likely to be determined by the promoter.When Paf1 is associated with Pol2, we envisage two consequences. Paf1C is required for H2Bub. H2Bub stimulates the ubiquitylation of the associated with the Pta1 subunit of CPF (APT) complex subunit Swd2, which, in turn, causes an association between Mex67 and Swd2 and independently facilitates recruitment of the Mex67 adaptor Npl3 to nascent transcripts to promote nuclear export (Vitaliano-Prunier et\u00a0al., 2012). Consistently, genes and transcription units with Pol2 depleted for Paf1 also show reduced H2Bub (Murray et\u00a0al., 2015). Alternatively, Paf1C could simply be transported with Pol2 to the 3\u2032 region to recruit or modify RNA binding and processing enzymes, such as Nab2, Npl3, Yra1, and Hpr1. Paf1 interacts with Hpr1 (Chang et\u00a0al., 1999), which, in turn, interacts with Mex67 and Yra1, facilitating interactions with the nuclear pore. Hpr1 also undergoes sumoylation, enabling it to bind specific RNAs, including members of the HAA1 regulon (Bretes et\u00a0al., 2014), shown here to be Paf1-enriched.NET-seq supports a role for Paf1 in the control of transcription elongation. Paf1 changes the relative distribution of Pol2 over the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of genes. Paf1 deletion in yeast and knockdown in mammals results in increased Pol2 CTD phosphorylation at Ser5 and reduced phosphorylation at Ser2 (Mueller et\u00a0al., 2004, Nordick et\u00a0al., 2008, Yu et\u00a0al., 2015), although, in other work, an increase in Ser2 phosphorylation is observed (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015). The disruption of Paf1-dependent CTD phosphorylation patterns could contribute to or result from slower elongation (Tomson and Arndt, 2013) and compromised checkpoints (Laitem et\u00a0al., 2015, Rodr\u00edguez-Molina et\u00a0al., 2016), leading to more Pol2 on the body of the gene, and supports some conservation of Paf1\u2019s role in controlling transcription elongation across the species. However, Paf1\u2019s role in transcription elongation is not related to the differences in Paf1 levels on Pol2 observed at different genes.In summary, our findings support distinct forms of the Pol2 elongation complex, with a core function in elongation and a regulatory function determining differential transcript fate, determined by levels of Paf1 on Pol2. Paf1 is unlikely to be unique in showing enrichment or depletion on elongating Pol2; preliminary data show enrichment or depletion of other elongation factors on Pol2 at different groups of genes. The use of an IP step in TEF-seq makes it eminently adaptable to studying a range of different Pol2-associated factors in different organisms, cell types, or growth conditions and to enhance our understanding of transcription elongation and its relationship to transcript fate. It will be important to determine the conservation of Paf1\u2019s role in transcript fate in metazoans, and development of TEF-seq in these systems will enable this. We anticipate that, given the degree of overlapping pervasive transcription in eukaryotic genomes (Mellor et\u00a0al., 2016, Murray and Mellor, 2016), the strand-specific nucleotide resolution of TEF-seq will be an invaluable tool.

All strains and genetic manipulations were verified by sequencing and phenotype.Strains were streaked from glycerol stocks onto 2% agar YPD (1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% bactopeptone, 2% glucose) plates and grown (48\u00a0hr, 30\u00b0C). Cells were then grown (overnight, 30\u00b0C) in 5\u00a0mL or 25\u00a0mL YPD. This culture was used to inoculate a 25\u00a0mL or 1\u00a0L YPD culture at OD600 0.2 which was grown (30\u00b0C, 200\u00a0rpm) to OD600 0.6-0.7. For carbon source shift experiments, cell cultures were centrifuged (3000\u00a0rpm, 3\u00a0min) and then resuspended in YPG (1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% bactopeptone, 2%\u00a0galactose) prewarmed to 30\u00b0C. Resuspended cells were incubated (30\u00b0C, 200\u00a0rpm) for the specified time.Method DetailGenetic manipulation of yeast strains All strains used in this study are listed in the KEY RESOURCES TABLE. Genetic manipulation of strains was carried out using the homologous recombination method described by (Longtine et\u00a0al., 1998). For gene deletion strains, PCR products were made containing a selection marker with promoter and terminator sequences flanked at both ends by 40bp of sequence homologous to sequences either side of the region to be deleted. For 3xFLAG tagged strains, first a plasmid was created from plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-His3MX6 (Longtine et\u00a0al., 1998) with the 3xFLAG sequence amplified from strain YSC001 by PCR inserted in place of GFP. PCR products were made using this template consisting of a 40bp sequence homologous to the first 40bp upstream of the stop codon of the gene to be tagged followed by the FLAG sequence, His5 selection marker and 40bp of sequence homologous to a region downstream of the gene to be tagged. 3xHA tagged strains were created in a similar manner using the pFA6a-3HA-KanMX6 plasmid (Longtine et\u00a0al., 1998).Cells to be transformed were grown to log phase, pelleted, re-suspended in 450\u00a0\u03bcL 0.1\u00a0M LiAc/TE and incubated (> 1\u00a0hr, 4\u00b0C). 100\u00a0\u03bcL of cell suspension, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of gel-extracted PCR product, 10\u00a0\u03bcL calf thymus DNA (Sigma D8661), 700\u00a0\u03bcL 0.1\u00a0M LiAc/TE, 40% PEG were incubated (30\u00a0min, 30\u00b0C) then heat-shocked (20\u00a0min, 42\u00b0C). Cells were pelleted (5\u00a0min, 7000\u00a0rpm), re-suspended in H20 and plated onto appropriate selection media. DNA was extracted from transformants, screened by PCR and confirmed by sequencing.NET-seq/TEF-seq Yeast culture Cells were grown in 25\u00a0mL YPD (1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% bactopeptone, 2% glucose) overnight. This was used to inoculate 1\u00a0L of YPD in a 2\u00a0L flask to give a starting OD600 of 0.2. 2\u00a0L of cells were grown (30\u00b0C, 170\u00a0rpm) to OD600 of 0.65 (mid-log) and harvested by filtration onto a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcm pore size, 90\u00a0mm diameter nitrocellulose filter paper (Whatman). Cells were scraped off the filter paper with a spatula pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were ground in 6 cycles of 3\u00a0min at a 15\u00a0Hz shaking frequency in a 50\u00a0mL grinding jar (Retch) with a 25\u00a0mm stainless steel ball using a Retsch MM400 mixer mill. The grinding chamber was cooled in liquid nitrogen in between cycles. 1\u00a0g of yeast grindate was stored at \u221280\u00b0C.For carbon source shift experiments 2\u00a0L of cells were grown to mid-log in 2\u00a0\u00d7 2\u00a0L flasks, then centrifuged (3000\u00a0rpm, 3\u00a0min) and then resuspended in 2\u00a0L YPG (1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% bactopeptone, 2% galactose) prewarmed to 30\u00b0C. Resuspended cells were returned to 2\u00a0L flasks, incubated (30\u00b0C, 170\u00a0rpm) and harvested by filtration as above after the requisite incubation time.Immunoprecipitation (IP) 1\u00a0g of yeast grindate was resuspended in Lysis buffer A (20\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 110\u00a0mM KOAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 10\u00a0mM MnCl2, 1x proteinase inhibitors (complete, EDTA-free (Roche)), 50\u00a0U/ml SUPERase.In (Invitrogen)). Resuspended grindate was incubated (4\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min) with 660\u00a0U of DNase I (Promega). Insoluble cell debris was pelleted by spinning (16,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min). Supernatants were combined (a 20\u00a0\u03bcL input sample was taken and combined with 20\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 SDS loading buffer (80\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200\u00a0mM DTT, 3.2% SDS, 0.1% Bromophenol Blue, 1.6% glycerol)) and added to 0.5\u00a0mL of anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose beads (Sigma) pre-washed with 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mL Lysis buffer A (without SUPERase.In). Beads and supernatant were incubated (4\u00b0C, 2.5 h) on a nutator, before spinning (1,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 2\u00a0min). A 20\u00a0\u03bcL unbound sample was taken and combined with 20\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 SDS loading buffer. Beads were washed four times with 10\u00a0mL Wash buffer A (20\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 110\u00a0mM KOAc, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). Beads were incubated (30\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) twice with 300\u00a0\u03bcL of Elution buffer (Lysis buffer A with 1\u00a0mg/mL 3\u00a0\u00d7 FLAG peptide (Sigma)). The elution supernatants were combined (a 20\u00a0\u03bcL elute sample was taken and combined with 20\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 SDS loading buffer) and RNAs were extracted using a miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For the sequential IP procedure, the elution supernatants from two IPs were combined giving a total of 1200 ul and added to 15 ul anti-HA dynabeads (Pierce) pre-washed with 2\u00a0\u00d7 1\u00a0mL Lysis buffer A. Beads and supernatant were incubated (4\u00b0C, 2.5 h) on a nutator. A 20\u00a0\u03bcL secondary unbound sample was taken and combined with 20\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 SDS loading buffer. Beads were washed five times with 1\u00a0mL Wash buffer A. Beads were resuspended in 100 uL Lysis buffer A (a 5 uL secondary elute sample was taken and combined with 15 uL Lysis buffer A and 20 uL 2\u00a0\u00d7 SDS loading buffer) and RNAs were extracted using a miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Input, unbound and elute samples were analyzed by western blot.Western blotting Protein samples were separated by gel electrophoresis on 7.5% or 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with 5% BSA in TBST (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 2\u00a0hr, then primary antibody in 2.5% BSA in TBST for 1.5\u00a0hr, washed, then incubated with rabbit, mouse or rat HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:4000 in 2.5% BSA in TBST for 45\u00a0min and washed again. Primary antibodies and their dilutions are detailed in the Key Resources Table. Antibody binding was visualized using chemiluminescence (Pierce) and X-ray film.Library generation Linker ligation and RNA fragmentation Immunoprecipitated RNA (3\u00a0\u03bcg in 30\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was denatured (2\u00a0min, 80\u00b0C) and placed on ice. A 5\u2032 adenylated, 3\u2032 blocked with a dideoxy C base cloning linker 5rApp/CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT/3ddC (Integrated DNA Technologies) was ligated to the 3\u2032 ends of RNAs by first dividing the RNA into three microfuge tubes and then adding 10\u00a0\u03bcL ligation reaction mix to give final concentrations of 50\u00a0ng \u03bcL\u22121 cloning linker 1, 12% PEG 8000, 1\u00a0\u00d7 T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) (truncated) ligation buffer, 10\u00a0U \u03bcL\u22121 T4 Rnl2 (truncated) (NEB) and incubating for 3\u00a0hr at 37\u00b0C. Ligated RNA was incubated (95\u00b0C, 35\u00a0min) with 20\u00a0\u03bcL Alkaline fragmentation buffer (100\u00a0mM NaCO3 (pH 9.2), 2\u00a0mM EDTA) to fragment linker ligated RNA to a narrow size range to reduce size bias of future steps. RNA was precipitated by incubating (30\u00a0min, \u221220\u00b0C) with ice cold 500\u00a0\u03bcL H20, 60\u00a0\u03bcL 3\u00a0M NaOAc (pH 5.5), 2\u00a0\u03bcL 15\u00a0mg mL\u22121 GlycoBlue (Ambion) and 0.75\u00a0mL isopropanol and then spinning (16,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min). Pellets were washed with 0.75\u00a0mL 80% ethanol, dried (10\u00a0min, room temperature) and resuspended sequentially in the same 10\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0).Size selection Ligated and fragmented RNA was mixed with 10\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 TBE-urea loading dye (89\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, 89\u00a0mM Boric acid, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 12% Ficoll, 7\u00a0M Urea, 2.5\u00a0mg/ml Orange G), denatured (2\u00a0min, 80\u00b0C) and run on a 10 well 10% TBE-urea gel (Biorad) (200 V, 32\u00a0min). The gel\u00a0was stained with SYBRGold (Invitrogen) and the region containing 38-95nt fragments excised. This gel piece was divided between three microfuge tubes and physically disrupted. Each was incubated (70\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min) in 200\u00a0\u03bcL H20. The tubes were pooled and gel debris was removed using a Costar-Spin-X column (Corning). RNA was precipitated by adding 60\u00a0\u03bcL 3\u00a0M NaOAc (pH\u00a05.5), 2\u00a0\u03bcL 15\u00a0mg mL\u22121 GlycoBlue and 0.75\u00a0mL isopropanol, incubating (30\u00a0min, \u221220\u00b0C) and then spinning (16,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min). Pellets were washed with 0.75\u00a0mL 80% ethanol, dried (10\u00a0min, room temperature) and resuspended in 10\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0).Reverse transcription and circularisation Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out by adding 3.28\u00a0\u03bcL 5\u00a0\u00d7 FS buffer, 0.82\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u00a0mM each), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL 100\u00a0\u03bcM RT primer (This is phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end (5 Phos) for later circularization and contains two 18 carbon spacer sequences (iSp18)), denaturing (80\u00b0C, 2\u00a0min) and incubating (48\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min) with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcL Superase.In, 0.82\u00a0\u03bcL 0.1\u00a0M DTT, 0.82\u00a0\u03bcL Superscript III (Invitrogen). 1.8\u00a0\u03bcL 1\u00a0M NaOH was added and RNA was degraded (98\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min). To neutralize, 1.8\u00a0\u03bcL 1\u00a0M HCl was added. cDNA was mixed with 20\u00a0\u03bcL 2\u00a0\u00d7 TBE-urea loading dye, denatured (3\u00a0min, 95\u00b0C), and run (loaded in 2 wells, 20\u00a0\u03bcL per well) on a 10 well 10% TBE-urea gel (Biorad) (200 V, 50\u00a0min). The gel was stained with SYBRGold (Invitrogen) and the regions containing the RT product excised. Both gel pieces were physically disrupted and incubated (70\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min) in 200\u00a0\u03bcL H20 in separate tubes. Gel debris was removed and tubes were pooled. cDNA was precipitated by adding 25\u00a0\u03bcL 3\u00a0M NaCl, 2\u00a0\u03bcL GlycoBlue and 0.75\u00a0mL isopropanol, incubating (\u221220\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min) and then spinning (16,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min). The pellet was washed with 0.75\u00a0mL 80% ethanol, dried (10\u00a0min, room temperature) and resuspended in 15\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).The RT product was circularized by incubating (60\u00b0C, 60\u00a0min) with 2\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0\u00d7 CircLigase buffer, 1\u00a0\u03bcL 1\u00a0mM ATP, 1\u00a0\u03bcL 50\u00a0mM MnCl2, 1\u00a0\u03bcL CircLigase (Epicenter). The enzyme was heat-inactivated at 80\u00b0C, 10\u00a0min.PCR amplification 16.7\u00a0\u03bcL 5\u00a0\u00d7 HF Phusion buffer, 1.7\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs (10\u00a0mM), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcL 100\u00a0\u03bcM Barcoded primer (A, B, C, or D), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcL 100\u00a0\u03bcM Primer 1, 59.2\u00a0\u03bcL H20, 0.8\u00a0\u03bcl Phusion polymerase (NEB) was added to 5\u00a0\u03bcL circularized DNA. This was divided (16.7\u00a0\u03bcL per tube) between five 0.2\u00a0mL tubes. PCR reactions were heated (98\u00b0C, 30 s) and then submitted to 7 temperature cycles (98\u00b0C, 10 s; 60\u00b0C, 10 s; 72\u00b0C, 10 s). At the end of cycle 3 and each subsequent cycle one tube was removed and placed on ice. 3.4\u00a0\u03bcL DNA loading dye (1.5\u00a0g Ficoll 400, 25\u00a0mg Orange G in 10\u00a0mL H20) was added to each reaction and run on an 8% TBE gel (Invitrogen) (180 V, 55\u00a0min). The gel was stained with SYBRGold and the PCR product excised from the PCR reaction with the highest unsaturated signal without higher molecular weight products. The gel piece was physically disrupted and incubated (room temperature, overnight, with agitation) in 0.67\u00a0mL DNA soaking buffer (0.3\u00a0M NaCl, 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). DNA was precipitated by adding 2\u00a0\u03bcL GlycoBlue and 0.68\u00a0mL isopropanol, incubating (\u221220\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min) and spinning (16,000 g, 4\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min). The pellet was washed with 0.75\u00a0mL 80% ethanol, dried (10\u00a0min, room temperature) and resuspended in 10\u00a0\u03bcL 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).Sequencing Samples were submitted to Harvard Biopolymers facility. They determined DNA quality and quantity using the TapeStation (Agilent) and qPCR and then sequenced samples on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine. 50nt were sequenced from one end using the sequencing primer. Barcoded samples were pooled so that 2-3 samples were multiplexed per lane.See the Key Resources Table for a list of DNA primers used for library generation and sequencing.Biochemistry Nuclear Extraction 50\u00a0mL from a 75\u00a0mL OD600 0.6 culture was pelleted (1,000 g, 3\u00a0min), and incubated (< 5\u00a0min, 30\u00b0C) in 0.5\u00a0mL spheroplasting buffer A (1\u00a0M sorbitol, 0.5\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20\u00a0mg/ml zymolase 20T (MP Biomedicals)). Once > 70% of cells were spheroplasted, cells were pelleted (16,000 g, 10 s, 4\u00b0C), washed carefully twice with 1\u00a0mL 1\u00a0M sorbitol, resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL 18% Ficoll and then mixed quickly with 1\u00a0mL 9% Ficoll. Nuclei were pelleted (16,000 g, 5\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) and washed twice with 1\u00a0mL 1\u00a0M sorbitol. RNA was extracted from nuclei as detailed below. Total RNA was extracted from the remaining 25\u00a0mL of culture as detailed -below.RNA extraction 25\u00a0mL OD600 0.6 culture was pelleted (1,000 g, 3\u00a0min), resuspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcL T.E.S. (100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100\u00a0mM EDTA (pH\u00a08.0), 0.5% SDS) and 400\u00a0\u03bcL phenol:chloroform (pH 4.7) and incubated (65\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min, 1400\u00a0rpm). After spinning (16,000 g, 20\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C), the upper layer was mixed with 40\u00a0\u03bcL 3\u00a0M NaOAc pH 5.5 and 1\u00a0mL ethanol and incubated (\u221280\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min). RNA precipitate was pelleted (16,000 g, 10\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL H20.Reverse transcription 4\u00a0\u03bcg of extracted RNA was incubated (37\u00b0C, 1 h) with 2\u00a0\u03bcL DNase I buffer, 1\u00a0\u03bcL RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), 6\u00a0\u03bcL H20, 1\u00a0\u03bcL DNase I (Roche) then heated (70\u00b0C, 15\u00a0min). 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed by incubating (65\u00b0C, 5\u00a0min) with 0.6\u00a0\u03bcL random primers, 1\u00a0\u03bcL dNTPs in a 13\u00a0\u03bcL final volume and then adding 4\u00a0\u03bcL First-Strand buffer, 1\u00a0\u03bcL 0.1\u00a0M DTT, 1\u00a0\u03bcL RNaseOUT, 1\u00a0\u03bcL Superscript III (replaced with 1\u00a0\u03bcL H20 in control reactions) and incubating at 50\u00b0C (1 h) and then 70\u00b0C (15\u00a0min). Complementary DNA (cDNA) levels for each gene were analyzed by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a RotorGene (Corbett), SYBR Green mix (Bioline) and primers. Transcript levels in each sample were normalized to the level of the ADH1 transcript for the comparison between BY4741 and paf1\u0394 samples as this gene is not Paf1-enriched or depleted in YPD. Transcript levels in each sample were normalized to the level of the CLB1 transcript for the comparison between BY4741 in YPD and BY4741 after 60\u00a0min in YPG samples as the level of Paf1 on Pol2 at this gene does not change between these two conditions. The mean transcript level or nuclear/total transcript level was then calculated across all replicates. Error bars show the SEM. See Table S5 for primers used in qPCR.Assessingf Paf1 on Pol2 at URA3 We used artificial constructed genes to assess the level of Paf1 on Pol2 downstream of a Paf1-enriched or Paf1-depleted gene promoter. The coding region of the URA3 gene was inserted in place of CMK2 (a Paf1-enriched gene) or SLC1 (a Paf1-depleted gene) coding regions. Thus URA3 was placed downstream of the promoter of a Paf1-enriched or a Paf1-depleted gene. The NET-seq/TEF-seq IP protocol was then carried out on Paf1-3xFLAG, Rpb3-3xFLAG or non-tagged versions of these strains inclusive of the purification of RNA step. 1\u00a0\u03bcg of purified RNA was reverse transcribed using random primers as above. cDNA levels for 4 control genes (RCR1, TIM21, CLB1 and PUN1) and for test gene URA3 were established for each sample. The level of Paf1, Rpb3 and no-tag signal is expected to be the same in all strains at the control genes. Therefore the control genes were used to determine scaling factors to normalize the signal for each factor to the same level for each strain. An average scaling factor was then determined and this was applied to the signal at URA3. (Paf1 signal - no-tag signal)/(Rpb3 signal - no-tag signal) was calculated for URA3 at each locus to give a value for the level of Paf1 on Pol2. 2 biological replicates were carried out.RNA fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization (RNA FISH) 35\u00a0mL OD600 0.6 culture was fixed by incubating (45\u00a0min, 80\u00a0rpm, 22\u00b0C) with 4.8\u00a0mL 32% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed twice with 10\u00a0mL FISH buffer A (1.2\u00a0M sorbitol, 0.1\u00a0M KHPO4 (pH 7.5)) and resuspended in 1\u00a0mL FISH buffer B (FISH buffer A, 20\u00a0mM ribonucleoside vanadyl-complex (VRC), 20\u00a0\u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol). The mixture was incubated (\u223c25\u00a0min) at 30\u00b0C with 15\u00a0\u03bcL lyticase (25\u00a0U \u03bcL\u22121, Sigma) until > 70% of cells were spheroplasted. Cells were pelleted (1000 g, 3\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) and washed with and then resuspended in 1\u00a0mL FISH buffer B without 2-mercaptoethanol. 150\u00a0\u03bcL of cells were left to settle (30\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) on poly-L-lysine treated coverslips. These were washed with 2\u00a0mL FISH buffer A to remove unattached cells, incubated (\u221220\u00b0C, > 3 h) in 2\u00a0mL 70% ethanol and then rehydrated for 5\u00a0min in 2\u00a0mL FISH wash buffer (10% formamide, 2x SSC). For hybridization, coverslips were placed cell-coated side down on a 48\u00a0\u03bcL drop containing 50\u00a0nM of 42\u00a0\u00d7 20nt Cy3-labeled probes complementary to CMK2 (Biosearch Technologies) or 29\u00a0\u00d7 20nt Cy3-labeled probes complementary to GAL1 antisense (AS) transcript, 0.1\u00a0g mL\u22121 dextran sulfate, 1\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121\nE.\u00a0coli tRNA, 2\u00a0mM VRC, 20\u00a0\u03bcg ml\u22121 BSA, 2x SSC, 10% formamide and incubated (30\u00b0C, 20 h) in a sealed Parafilm chamber (See Table S6 for list of FISH probes used). Coverslips were twice incubated (30\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min) in pre-warmed 2\u00a0mL FISH wash buffer, dipped in H20, air-dried, placed cell-coated side down on a drop of ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Life Technologies), allowed to polymerize for 24\u00a0hr in the dark and then sealed with nail varnish.Cells were imaged using a DeltaVision Elite wide-field fluorescence deconvolution microscope using a 100x/1.40 objective lens. For CMK2, 31 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm z stacks were imaged using an exposure time of 0.08\u00a0s and 1\u00a0s for DAPI and Cy3 channels respectively for each stack. For GAL1 AS, 21 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm z stacks were imaged with an exposure time of 0.01\u00a0s and 1\u00a0s for DAPI and Cy3 channels respectively.Quantification and statistical analysisNET-seq/TEF-seq sequencing data processing Alignment of sequencing reads FASTQ files with sanger (+33) encoded quality scores were uploaded to Galaxy (Blankenberg et\u00a0al., 2010). Adaptor sequences were clipped and reads shorter than 15nt after clipping were discarded. Reads were aligned to the S.\u00a0cerevisiae genome (2011 assembly) using Bowtie for Illumina (Langmead, 2010). Parameters were chosen so non-uniquely aligned reads were discarded (-n 1, -e 70, -l\u00a028, -k 1, -m 1). The SAM file output was converted to a BAM file and downloaded (Li et\u00a0al., 2009).Narrowing reads and data visualization Using R/Bioconductor, aligned reads were narrowed to their 3\u2032 nucleotide and used to create BigWig files for data visualization in the IGV (Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et\u00a0al., 2013). When available, data from combined biological replicates were used for visualization.Subtraction of non-tag specific signal Subtraction of non-tag specific signal was done using data from a non-tagged control strain. Signal that is not specific to the FLAG-tagged TEFs, Rpb2 or Rpb3 is present within alignments, mainly resulting from the non-specific binding to and elution from the affinity matrix of processed transcripts undergoing degradation, generating the 3\u2032OH that allows their incorporation into the libraries and alignment. This signal can be removed using signal obtained from a strain grown in the same conditions without a FLAG-tagged factor (no-tag; control IP). To do this the Pol3-transcribed SCR1 gene (chosen as no signal specific to a factor associated with the Pol2 transcription elongation complex should map to this gene) was divided into 10nt bins exclusive of the first 20nt and final 50nt of the gene (position chrV:442007-442458). The ratio of counts (FLAG-tagged factor/no-tag control) for each bin was calculated. The mean ratio (mean SCR1 ratio) was taken and mean SCR1 ratio \u00d7 no-tag reads were subtracted from FLAG-tagged factor reads genome-wide. For the sequential IP, signal that is not specific to the HA-tagged factor is removed using signal obtained from a strain without an HA-tagged factor (RPB3-3xFLAG, no-HA-tag; control IP). In this case the signal that is not specific to the HA-tagged factor results to a greater extent from Pol2 associated nascent transcripts due to non-specific binding of Pol2, enriched during the first IP step, to the HA-beads during the second IP step. Reads over Pol3 transcribed-SCR1 are not representative of this signal and so cannot be used to determine the ratio necessary for its removal. Instead the ratio of total reads before alignment (HA-tagged factor/no-HA-tag control) was used assuming linear proportionality between this and the signal not specific to the HA-tagged factor. This ratio \u00d7 no-tag reads were subtracted from HA-tagged factor reads genome-wide.For visualization, an 11 nt running mean was calculated, except the running mean window did not overlap gene TSSs or TESs or the 3\u2032 nt of exons (upstream of an intron) or 3\u2032 nt of introns. When available, data from combined biological replicates were used for visualization.mRNA and ncRNA annotations The TSS and PAS/TES positions of all genes encoding mRNAs, stable lncRNAs (termed SUTs; stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable lncRNAs (termed CUTs; cryptic unstable transcripts) were taken from (Pelechano et\u00a0al., 2013), selecting first for the most abundant transcript isoforms expressed in YPD and, of these, the longest, to obtain unique annotations for 5579 mRNAs, 612 stable lncRNAs and 344 unstable lncRNAs. The annotations for the start and end of coding sequences, introns, snRNAs, snoRNAs and other ncRNAs were taken from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; http://www.yeastgenome.org/).Metagene analysis Data from combined biological replicates when available were used for plotting metagene profiles. All metagene profiles were plotted using single IP TEF-seq and/or single IP NET-seq data unless otherwise stated.Standard average occupancy profiles Standard average occupancy profiles (metagene occupancy profiles) were plotted using all mRNA genes unless otherwise stated. For plots of the 5\u2032 region of genes, genes were aligned by their TSS. The final 200nt upstream of the PAS/TES were excluded to avoid transitions occurring at the 3\u2032 end of genes influencing these profiles. The region from the TSS-100nt to TSS+1000nt was split into 10nt bins and the number of counts in each bin was calculated from Rpb3 ChIP-chip data taken from (Mayer et\u00a0al., 2010) and Rpb3 NET-seq data for wild-type and paf1\u0394 strains. The mean number of counts for each bin at each position was then calculated excluding the top 5% and bottom 5% of bins. These were excluded to prevent highly and lowly transcribed genes from skewing the mean. Mean counts were plotted on a linear scale from the minimum value to the maximum value except otherwise stated. For plots of the 3\u2032 region of genes, genes were aligned by their PAS, genes shorter than 501nt and the region from the TSS to\u00a0+500nt of genes were excluded to avoid transitions occurring at the 5\u2032 end of genes influencing these profiles. The region from PAS-400nt to PAS+100nt was split into 10nt bins and the mean number of counts for each bin was calculated and plotted in the same manner.Rpb3-normalized TEF profiles Rpb3-normalized average TEF occupancy profiles (metagene occupancy profiles) were plotted for all mRNA genes or all lncRNA genes unless otherwise stated. For plots of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of genes, genes were aligned to the TSS and the PAS respectively and the same regions were excluded as before. For plots of transitions relative to nucleosomes\u00a0+2 to\u00a0+5, the position of nucleosomes was taken from (Brogaard et\u00a0al., 2012). This publication uses chemical modification of histones to give a base pair resolution genome-wide map of the position of the center of each nucleosome. The region from \u2212100nt to\u00a0+ 100nt around each of the nucleosomes after the TSS+50nt until the PAS were taken from each gene. Again each region was split into 10nt bins and the number of counts from TEF-seq for each TEF divided by the number of counts for Rpb3 NET-seq was calculated. These were multiplied by a factor-specific scaling factor to enable plotting on the same arbitrary linear scale (factor specific scaling factors: Cet1, 1; Paf1, 2.2; Pcf11, 2.7; Spt6, 0.47; Spt16, 1.04; Set2, 6; Ssu72, 8). This is necessary as differences in sequencing depth and the level at which Pol2 is co-immunoprecipitated with different TEFs, leads to large differences in the level of counts for each factor. The mean (scaling factor \u00d7 TEF)/Rpb3 ratio was then calculated for each bin after first excluding undefined ratios and the top 10% and bottom 10% of ratios. These were excluded to prevent single nucleotide spikes in the data seen with TEF-seq from skewing the mean.Rpb2-normalized TEF profiles Rpb2-normalized average TEF occupancy profiles (metagene occupancy profiles) were plotted in the same way as for Rpb3-normalized average TEF occupancy profiles. For single IP data, the mean 0.88\u00a0\u00d7 (Paf1-FLAG TEF-seq)/(Rpb2-FLAG NET-seq) ratio was calculated for each bin. For sequential IP data, the mean 0.75\u00a0\u00d7 (Rpb3-FLAG then Paf1-HA TEF-seq)/(Rpb3-FLAG then Rpb2-HA NET-seq) ratio was calculated for each bin.Use of Rpb2 or Rpb3 NET-seq data There are twelve Pol2 subunits in humans and yeast (Rpb1-12 in yeast). Here, single IP NET-seq data, giving a map of transcribing Pol2, have been obtained either by immunoprecipitating Pol2 via its Rpb3 subunit, as in the original protocol (Churchman and Weissman, 2011), or via its Rpb2 subunit. The Pol2 profiles obtained differ slightly depending on which subunit is IP\u2019d, with slightly fewer reads in the 5\u2032 region relative to the 3\u2032 region of genes for Rpb2 than Rpb3. This results in different Pol2-normalized Paf1 occupancy profiles depending on which subunit is used for normalization (see Figures 3B and 3D). We envisage that the more exterior location of the Rpb3 subunit within the Pol2 complex enables this subunit to be more effectively IP\u2019d from all regions of the gene, whereas the Rpb2 subunit, at the center of the Pol2 complex, may be masked by the binding of particular TEFs to Pol2, decreasing the ability to IP it from particular regions. As we predict Rpb3 NET-seq data give a truer signal for the profile of Pol2, we have used these data for the majority of our analysis. Rpb2 NET-seq data have only been used to confirm the similarity between Pol2-normalized Paf1-occupancy profiles obtained from single and sequential IP procedures. This is because only Rpb2 sequential IP NET-seq data have been obtained (Rpb3-FLAG IP followed by Rpb2-HA IP).Heatmaps All mRNA genes were ordered by length and split into 10nt bins. Using Rpb3 single IP NET-seq data for wild-type or paf1\u0394 strains, the mean number of counts in each bin was calculated. Negative mean counts were replaced with a zero. Mean counts for each bin across a gene were divided by the sum of the mean counts for that gene to normalize for differences in expression level. These values were converted to a heatmap using a linear scale from white to black.Differential occupancy analysis Signal for single IP Paf1 TEF-seq and single IP Rpb3 NET-seq from the TSS+400nt to TES-200nt were counted, thus excluding regions in which Paf1 shows large changes in association with Pol2, for two biological replicates for each carbon source condition. Differential occupancy was assessed using the DESeq algorithm within the DESeq2 package (Love et\u00a0al., 2014) by comparing the counts for Paf1 and Rpb3 at all mRNA genes (Figure\u00a02A; Table S3) or all mRNA and lncRNA genes (Figure\u00a02B). This gives a log2 value for the relative Paf1 to Rpb3 occupancy for each gene and a p value, adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method, showing the significance of Paf1-enrichment or depletion on Pol2 at each gene.For the different downstream analyses carried out on Paf1-enriched and -depleted mRNA gene groups different cut-offs were used based either by selecting genes with log2 relative Paf1 to Rpb3 occupancy above or below a certain threshold or by selecting genes with an adjusted p value below a certain threshold. Reductions in the stringency of the thresholds used to determine which genes are included in each group, increases the probability of the inclusion of false positives. However, such reductions are necessary for particular analyses to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of genes to analyze. By including larger numbers of genes in particular analyses, any observations are less likely to be the result of random noise thus increasing the robustness of these observations. For metagene profiles, including more genes helps to reduce signal noise. The particular cut-off used in each analysis and the number of genes in each group that this gives is specified when described in the main text.Divergent promoters enrichment analysis For the analysis of genes expressed divergently from bi-directional divergent promoters, all yeast mRNA genes at which a log2 relative Paf1 to Rpb3 occupancy value had been established using the DESeq algorithm were taken. The number of divergently expressed gene pairs within this list was then established (661 gene pairs). Divergently expressed gene pairs were defined as genes transcribed in opposite directions to each other with TSSs within 1200\u00a0bp upstream of each other and with no other gene from this list between these two genes. Two groups consisting of the 1200 most Paf1-enriched and the 1200 most Paf1-depleted genes were established based on ordering genes by their log2 value for relative Paf1 to Rpb3 occupancy. To establish the significance of the enrichment of divergently expressed gene pairs within these groups, 10000 random samples containing 1200 genes were repeatedly taken from the list of genes and the number of pairs within each sample was counted, giving a probability distribution of the number of expected divergently expressed gene pairs within a random sample of this size. This was compared to the number of divergently expressed gene pairs within each group to give a p value showing the significance of any enrichment or depletion above or below what would be expected by chance.Promoter motif enrichment analysis For analysis of the enrichment of motifs within the promoters of Paf1-enriched genes the 500\u00a0bp DNA sequence upstream of the TSS was taken from Paf1-enriched genes (p value\u00a0< 0.1, 229 genes). DREME (Villanyi et\u00a0al., 2014) was then used to search for significantly enriched motifs on both strands compared to the same promoter regions taken from Paf1-depleted genes (p value\u00a0< 0.1, 219 genes).RNA FISH analysis Images were deconvolved using a conservative deconvolution method and 15 cycles using DeltaVision Softworx software. Image quantification was carried out using Fiji (Schindelin et\u00a0al., 2012). In this, images were compressed to 2D images displaying the maximum intensity projection for each pixel across z stacks 12 to 22 (for CMK2) or 6-16 (for GAL1 AS). Cells were outlined manually. For nuclei, an automatic threshold was applied on the DAPI signal using Otsu\u2019s thresholding algorithm (Otsu, 1979). Regions corresponding to cell nuclei above the threshold were then automatically outlined. For CMK2, Cy3 signal contrast was enhanced by applying the \u201cSharpen\u201d processing command. Dots corresponding to CMK2 or GAL1 AS transcripts were then counted for cells and nuclei by applying the \u201cFind Maxima\u201d command with a noise tolerance adjusted so that control cells in which CMK2 or GAL1 was deleted gave no counts. For CMK2, 4 biological replicates were performed for both BY4741 and paf1\u0394 strains with 230-400 cells counted per replicate per strain. For GAL1 AS, 3 biological replicates were performed for both GAL1::ADH1T and GAL1::ADH1T\npaf1\u0394 strains with 150-350 cells counted per replicate per strain. The nuclear to whole cell transcript ratio was calculated for each replicate. Bar charts show the mean of these ratios for each transcript in each strain. Error bars show the SEM.Data and Software AvailabilityThe accession number for the raw and processed sequencing data reported in this paper is ArrayExpress: E-MTAB-4568.
