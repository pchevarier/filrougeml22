Specifically, in moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS), vigorous inspiratory effort may amplify the stress-strain applied to the\ndependent lung regions and produce local inflammatory mediators release with\nsystemic consequences, the so-called self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).(1) Despite the potential relevance of\nP-SILI, it has only been demonstrated in animal models and controlled laboratory\nresearch studies with scarce descriptions in clinical practice.(2, 3)The prolongation of controlled mechanical ventilation (MV) time increases the risk of\nrespiratory infections and diaphragmatic weakness, which may hamper ventilator\nweaning. On the other hand, the premature adoption of partial ventilatory support\nmay be associated with a high respiratory drive and cause respiratory failure with\nthe consequent need to switch back to controlled MV, which has been associated with\nhigher mortality and worse outcomes in ARDS.(4, 5)There is a gap of knowledge regarding which ventilatory variables allow clinicians to\ndetect the aptitude to breathe spontaneously and to identify the risk of P-SILI in\npatients recovering from ARDS.(4, 6) Single parameters, such as\noxygenation, respiratory drive, respiratory system (RS) mechanics and the work of\nbreathing (WOB), have been proposed as potential promoters of P-SILI;(2, 4,\n7) however, all of them remain\ncontroversial and there is no strong scientific evidence in their favor.(4)We report conventional basic and advanced monitoring variables of RS mechanics in a\npatient who developed P-SILI during the partial ventilatory support phase with the\ncorresponding physiological and clinical outcomes related to SB. CASE REPORTThe patient was a 33-year-old Caucasian man with a medical history of AIDS and 1 year\nwithout treatment who attended the emergency room with a three-weeks progressive\ndyspnea followed by treatment with levofloxacin for 5 days and\namoxicillin/clavulanic acid for 7 days with no adequate response.At admission, he presented with tachypnea, fever 39.1\u00b0C, dry cough and hypoxemia.\nChest radiography and computed tomography showed bilateral interstitial pulmonary\ninfiltrates with no localized alveolar opacities (Figure 1). Immediately, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was implemented;\nsputum, blood and urine cultures were taken and empiric antibiotics were\ninitiated.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Chest radiography (A) and computed tomography (B) at admission.He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) using NIV, with a Glasgow coma scale\nscore of 15/15, respiratory rate 28-34 breaths per minute (bpm), dyspnea score 8/10\n(zero if no dyspnea at all; ten if greater imaginable dyspnea), comfort 8/10, use of\naccessory muscles and a Heart Rate, Acidosis, Consciousness, Oxygenation,\nand Respiratory Rate (HACOR) score of 4 points.(8) After 1 hour of NIV, arterial blood\ngases showed pH 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 38mmHg,\npartial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 78.1mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3)\n22.2mEq/L, Base Excess (BE)-2.4mEq/L and a ratio of PaO2 to the fraction\nof inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) 156.2mmHg.Considering the clinical presentation features, we decided to switch from NIV to\nhigh-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) using a 60L/minute flow rate and FiO2\n0.50. Initially, the patient reduced the respiratory rate to 23bpm, and the\noxygenation, dyspnea and comfort improved. The ROX index after 1 hour of HFNC was\n8.33.(9)After 48 hours of HFNC, the patient increased the WOB, and the oxygenation worsened,\nso it was necessary to proceed to endotracheal intubation and invasive MV.First period of controlled mechanical ventilationDuring invasive MV, we carried out advanced monitoring of the RS mechanics\nthrough esophageal manometry. Initially, we implemented protective MV using a\ntidal volume (VT) of 4 - 6mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), positive end\nexpiratory pressure (PEEP) titration according to the best RS compliance\n(Crs), a target of plateau pressure (Pplat) <\n30cmH2O, driving airway pressure (\u2206Paw) <\n15cmH2O and driving transpulmonary pressure (\u2206PL) <\n12cmH2O, deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and\nprone positioning (PP) (Figure 1S - Supplementary material).On day 4 of invasive MV, after a clear improvement in oxygenation, the sedation\nlevels were reduced in an attempt to begin the partial ventilatory support phase\nand he was switched from controlled MV to pressure support ventilation\n(PSV).First period of partial ventilatory supportFigure 2 shows the evolution of oxygenation\nand Crs during this period. In addition, table 1 describes the daily ventilatory settings and\nmonitoring during PSV. We carried out a decremental PEEP titration trial to\noptimize our ventilatory strategy. We observed that higher PEEP levels did not\nameliorate the esophageal pressure swing (\u2206Pes) or the \u2206PL\nand they even seemed to increase (Figure\n3); therefore, we prioritized lower PEEP values to reduce the stress and\nmechanical energy applied to the lungs.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Evolution of respiratory system compliance (diamonds) and oxygenation\n(circles) during invasive mechanical ventilation.Compliance in volume-controlled continuous mandatory ventilation and\npressure support ventilation was evaluated in static conditions through\nan end-inspiratory occlusion of 2 seconds, discarding respiratory muscle\nactivation during the procedure, particularly during pressure support\nventilation. Gray arrows show the day when controlled mechanical\nventilation started, white empty symbols represent days of controlled\nmechanical ventilation in volume controlled - continuous mandatory\nventilation, black arrows show the day where spontaneous breathing with\npressure support ventilation started, and black full symbols represent\ndays of spontaneous breathing with pressure support ventilation. Even\nthough spontaneous breathing was maintained for only a few hours on days\n15 and 23, we decided to express the beginning of the controlled\nventilation phase in the graph on days 16 and 24, respectively, because\nthey represent full passive ventilation days (see main text). Notably,\nthe oxygenation worsened during every spontaneous breathing period.\nCompliance of the respiratory system followed the same behavior except\nin the first partial support cycle.

Values are expressed as\nabsolute values or mean \u00b1 standard deviation.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Esophageal and transpulmonary pressure response to a positive end\nexpiratory pressure step of 10cmH2O in pressure support\nventilation.On day 6 of invasive MV, the patient met the classic weaning criteria; thus, we\ncarried out a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with 5cmH2O of\npressure support level to assess the chance for extubation. The patient failed\nthe SBT after 20 minutes due to hypoxemia.On day 7 of invasive MV, due to persistent worsening of oxygenation, we carried\nout a computed tomography, which showed clear progression of the lung injury\nwith the appearance of alveolar bilateral diffuse infiltrate primarily in the\ndependent lung regions (Figure\n2S - Supplementary material). In this\ncontext, we decided to reinstitute controlled MV and deep sedation levels.Second period of controlled mechanical ventilationIn this period, we electively adopted PP cycles from 16 to 20 hours a day with\nthe aim of achieving oxygenation stability, minimizing the risk of lung injury\nand projecting a new SB period under more favorable conditions\n(Figure\n3S - Supplementary material).(10, 11) The supine position was maintained for 4 - 5 hours\nbetween PP cycles.On day 8 of invasive MV, a bronchoalveolar lavage showed positive results for\ncytomegalovirus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Thus, directed\nantibiotics were immediately initiated. It is important to highlight that during\nthis period, it was necessary to reduce the VT to 4mL/kg PBW to maintain\nprotective ventilation parameters (Figure\n1S - Supplementary material).On day 13 of invasive MV, after a clear improvement of oxygenation\n(PaO2/FiO2 = 286mmHg) and Crs\n(30mL/cmH2O), we attempted a new sedation vacation (Figure 2).Second period of partial ventilatory supportIn the first 48 hours of partial support, the patient maintained safe spontaneous\neffort values in PSV (Table 1, Figure 4). However, on the morning of the\nthird day of SB, the patient showed a sudden remarkable increase in respiratory\ndrive and WOB, leading to higher \u2206PL (Table 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Evolution of the airway driving pressure (squares) and transpulmonary\ndriving pressure (triangles) during the invasive mechanical ventilation\ndays.Airway and transpulmonary driving pressure in volume controlled\ncontinuous mandatory ventilation and pressure support ventilation were\nevaluated in static conditions through an end-inspiratory occlusion of 2\nseconds, discarding respiratory muscle activation during the procedure,\nparticularly in pressure support ventilation. Gray arrows show the day\nwhere controlled mechanical ventilation started, white empty symbols\nrepresent days of controlled mechanical ventilation in volume controlled\ncontinuous mandatory ventilation, black arrows show the day where\nspontaneous breathing in pressure support ventilation started, and black\nfull symbols represent days of spontaneous breathing in pressure support\nventilation. Even though spontaneous breathing was maintained for only\nfor a few hours on days 15 and 23, we decided to express the beginning\nof controlled ventilation in the graph on days 16 and 24 because it\nrepresents a full passive ventilation day (see main text). Of note, a\nclear radiographic correlation was observed between the days of\nspontaneous breathing on pressure support ventilation and the appearance\nof new bilateral diffuse infiltrates after the end of each partial\nsupport period. During controlled ventilation cycles, the radiographic\npattern improved clearly.Initially, this change in the clinical condition was attributed to fever,\nasynchronies, anxiety and pain, so we treated them using antipyretic, anxiolytic\nand analgesic medication with a poor response. In this context, we observed\nclear oxygenation, RS mechanics and radiographic deterioration (Table 1, Figures 2 and \u200band4),4), so it was\nnecessary to re-initiate controlled MV and deep sedation.Third period of controlled mechanical ventilationOn day 21 of invasive MV, a percutaneous tracheostomy was performed without\ncomplications. During this period, the oxygenation and RS mechanics response to\nPP remained satisfactory. For that reason, we implemented a 7-day intermittent\nPP strategy. On day 23 of invasive MV, after clinical and radiographic\nimprovement, a new partial support trial was carried out.Third period of partial ventilatory supportThe patient was only capable of breathing in PSV for 24 hours, given that his\nclinical state deterioration was rapidly progressive (Figures 2 and \u200band4),4), which\nis why we had to reassume controlled MV.Fourth period of controlled mechanical ventilationAlthough ultraprotective ventilation was used, it was impossible to keep RS\nmechanics within safe ranges (Figure 4,\nFigure\n1S - Supplementary material).On day 29 of invasive MV, the patient died due to refractory hypoxemia. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show that classic, basic and advanced monitoring variables\ngenerally believed to determine the aptitude to initiate the partial ventilatory\nsupport phase were not sufficient to guarantee SB safety. The rapid deterioration of\noxygenation and RS mechanics along with the clear radiographic correlation during\nthe SB periods show that P-SILI is feasible even though adequate clinical and\nventilator monitoring parameters are present at the beginning of SB.The Crs was recently proposed by Vaporidi et al. as a bedside parameter to\nassess the risk of developing high values of \u2206Paw during assisted\nventilation.(6) Values\nlower than 20mL/cmH2O are unfailingly associated with periods of\n\u2206Paw > 15cmH2O; on the other hand, high \u2206Paw\nvalues are unlikely when Crs is higher than 30mL/cmH2O. Thus,\nbelow this Crs threshold, it is recommended to use advanced monitoring\ntools to avoid injurious spontaneous efforts.(7) It is important to consider that, in the aforementioned\nstudy, the patients were ventilated with proportional assisted ventilation plus\n(PAV+), a ventilatory mode whose operative functions and patient-ventilator\ninteractions differ considerably from PSV. However, Bellani et al. recently reported\nthat lower Crs and incremental \u2206Paw values during PSV are\nassociated with higher mortality.(12) In line with these recommendations, in our case, the\ntransition phase from controlled to partially assisted ventilation was always\ninitiated with Crs \u2265 30mL/cmH2O and \u2206Paw\nlower than 15cmH2O. On the other hand, VT was kept within acceptable\nranges, even lower than those reported in ARDS patients and well recommended to\nallow SB.(13) Our findings are\ncoincident with those reported by van Haren et al. and Vaporidi et al. that VT\nmonitoring does not guarantee low \u2206Paw and does not allow to discriminate\nbetween patients able and unable to breathe spontaneously without potential\nrisks.(5, 7)Previous studies have suggested that the outcomes related to SB during partially\nsupported ventilation depend on oxygenation impairment severity, with clear benefits\nof SB in mild-moderate ARDS and deleterious effects in severe ARDS.(2, 14) In our case, the patient began every SB period in PSV with a\nPaO2/FiO2 greater than 250mmHg.Three main mechanisms have been presumed to precipitate P-SILI during SB:\npatient-ventilator asynchrony, overdistension and increased lung\nperfusion.(15) First,\nasynchronies were clearly noticed only during one single day during SB periods, so\nwe believe it is unlikely to be the key mechanism of lung injury in this case.\nSecond, even though we have been able to measure RS mechanics using esophageal\nmanometry, the regional increase in transpulmonary pressure (PL),\nespecially in dependent lung regions, is highly improbable to be detected when using\nsuch global monitoring measures.(4, 14, 15) A clear example of this situation is the occult\npendelluft, which describes the gas redistribution movement from nondependent to\ndependent lung regions, causing local overdistention and tidal recruitment of\ncollapsed tissue, even at protective VT monitoring.(3, 15) However,\nin our case, this hypothesis could not be confirmed because our monitoring tools\nwere insensitive to the pendelluft phenomenon. Third, regarding increased lung\nperfusion, an echocardiogram was performed during the ICU stay and showed no\nalterations; in addition, the patient never presented any clinical signs of fluid\noverload during the SB periods (i.e., no edema or jugular ingurgitation and no need\nfor antihypertensive medication). Despite that situation, we think that just a\nmodest increase in venous return associated with negative intrathoracic swings might\nbe a reasonable explanation for edema formation, showing rapid and clear changes in\nX-ray patterns and RS mechanics deterioration during SB, even in the absence of\nclinical signs of fluid overload and normal cardiac function.(15) Unfortunately, we had no\nequipment available to measure extrapulmonary water, and a Swan Ganz catheter was\nnot used because the patient was never hemodynamically unstable.A possible confounding factor related to lung mechanics disorders and oxygenation\nimpairment persistence might be the presence of untreated infections acquired during\nthe ICU stay. However, since the patient\u00b4s admission, empirical treatment with\ncefepime-azithromycin, oseltamivir and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) in\nPneumocystis carinii doses plus corticosteroids was started.\nMoreover, after obtaining positive results from the tracheal aspirates for\ncytomegalovirus (with a negative viral load in the blood), ganciclovir was\ninitiated. Once bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, he received 4-drug treatment\nwith isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, empirically treating\ntuberculosis, amphotericin covering a possible mycosis and colistin directed against\nA. baumannii. Finally, treatment with the 4 drugs was suspended\nafter obtaining the results of the direct culture and the negative polymerase chain\nreaction for tuberculosis, and antiretroviral treatment with lamivudine and\nlopinavir/ritonavir syrup was immediately started.The retrospective analysis of our case showed that single conventional and advanced\nmonitoring variables at the beginning of the partial ventilatory support phase were\nnot useful to predict the risk and development of P-SILI. The negative outcomes of\nour report do not intend to discourage the use of respiratory monitoring during SB.\nIn fact, during the SB cycles, we identified a tendency toward deterioration of the\nRS mechanics, oxygenation and radiographic pattern. The predictive capacity of these\ntendencies might provide valuable information for the decision-making process;\nhowever, this premise should be confirmed through future investigations. CONCLUSIONConventional basic and advanced monitoring variables in this case were not sufficient\nto identify the aptitude to breathe spontaneously or to predict the risk and\ndevelopment of patient self-inflicted lung injury during partial ventilatory\nsupport.
