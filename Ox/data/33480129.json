Transient de\u2010SUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins in response to EGF contributes to immediate early gene transcription.\n IntroductionSmall ubiquitin\u2010related modifier (SUMO) is an essential protein modification that regulates hundreds of proteins and numerous processes including signal transduction and transcription processes (Gareau & Lima, 2010; Flotho & Melchior, 2013; Seeler & Dejean, 2017; Zhao, 2018). The last decade has seen a dramatic improvement of SUMO proteomics (as reviewed in (Hendriks & Vertegaal, 2016)), which culminated in several thousand SUMO\u2010modified proteins and the startling number of 14,869 different SUMO2/3 acceptor sites in human cells during stress (Hendriks et al, 2018). Together with studies that revealed simultaneous SUMOylation of multiple subunits in protein complexes, e.g. upon DNA damage (Psakhye & Jentsch, 2012), and with the growing evidence that SUMO can contribute via low\u2010affinity/high avidity interactions to phase separation (reviewed (Zhao, 2018)), this may lead to the impression that SUMO largely functions as a \u201cspray\u201d with little specificity. However, there are numerous examples where reversible SUMOylation of a single protein on a specific lysine residue determines protein function in a highly specific manner. A famous example is yeast PCNA, which interacts with the helicase Srs2 specifically upon S\u2010phase\u2010specific SUMOylation (Pfander et al, 2005). But how can we move from lists of thousands of SUMO targets to those that are most relevant? We speculated that targets whose SUMOylation changes in response to a physiological stimulus may be of particular importance.Comparative quantitative phospho\u2010proteomic screens have been used successfully as discovery tools to identify important players, cancer drug targets, or signaling branches, e.g. by comparing different types of cancers, wild\u2010type versus mutant EGFR cells, or stimulation with platelet\u2010derived growth factor PDGF versus EGF (reviewed in (Kolch & Pitt, 2010)). We thus reasoned that comparative analysis of SUMO, acting as a similar molecular switch, might be another tool to identify new key factors in signaling and signal\u2010dependent transcription. Recently, we developed a method that allows identification and quantitative comparison of endogenously SUMOylated proteins (Becker et al, 2013; Barysch et al, 2014). This method is very well suited to identify individual proteins that may alter their SUMOylation status in response to a physiological stimulus.For a \"proof of principle\" study, we turned to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in HeLa cells. EGFR signaling is one of the most prominent, best\u2010characterized, and essential signaling networks in metazoans. It is involved in cellular growth and development, as well as in cancer progression. Key to its many roles is the transcriptional reprogramming of cells. After stimulation with EGF, a highly complex signaling network is activated, several actors work in parallel and compensatory mechanisms as well as feedback\u2010loops are installed (Citri & Yarden, 2006; Kolch & Pitt, 2010). In the so\u2010called early loops, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation play essential roles to control ligand\u2010induced receptor endocytosis and cytosolic signaling events. The late loops involve transcriptional regulation, which acts in three temporal phases, the immediate early gene (IEG), the delayed early gene (DEG), and the secondary response gene (SRG) transcription waves (Avraham & Yarden, 2011).Large quantitative studies have been performed to investigate EGF\u2010induced changes in the phospho\u2010proteomes (Kratchmarova et al, 2005; Olsen et al, 2006; Oyama et al, 2009) and the ubiquitin\u2010proteome (Argenzio et al, 2011). Those studies led to the identification of important regulatory events, mainly in the early loop of the EGF response. Here we investigated changes in the endogenous SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 proteome in EGFR signaling using quantitative mass spectrometry 10\u00a0min after or without EGF treatment. As detailed below, we could indeed identify a SUMO\u2010dependent molecular switch in EGF receptor signaling that involves the IRF2BP family of transcription coregulators. IRF2BP proteins gain increasing interest, particularly in the context of inflammation, but they have not yet been linked to EGF receptor signaling. Our findings reveal that this protein family plays an important role in immediate early gene expression and demonstrate how transient deSUMOylation of a repressor can serve to control temporal gene expression. Results and DiscussionEGF induces transient deSUMOylation of several transcriptional regulatorsTo address the question whether EGFR signaling induces changes in the SUMO proteome and whether we are able to identify potentially new key factors in EGFR signaling, we combined our previously published method to enrich endogenously SUMOylated proteins (SUMO\u2010IP, (Becker et al, 2013; Barysch et al, 2014)) with SILAC\u2010based quantitative mass spectrometry. For this, labeled HeLa cells were serum\u2010starved and treated with 0 or 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF for 10\u00a0min, respectively. This early time point was chosen to possibly detect both early events, e.g., at the plasma membrane, as well as early downstream events in transcription. Combined cell lysates were subjected to SUMO1\u2010 and SUMO2/3\u2010IPs, followed by quantitative mass spectrometry in three independent experiments with label swapping (Fig\u00a01A). The vast majority of identified SUMO candidates (1,228 for SUMO1 and 855 for SUMO2/3) were equally abundant in EGF\u2010treated and untreated samples. While no protein seemed to quantitatively lose or gain SUMO after 10\u00a0min of EGF stimulation, 11 proteins could be identified whose abundance differed significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) between both samples (Fig\u00a01B and C, left panel, Dataset EV1). Intriguingly, five of these were transcriptional coregulator proteins, TRIM24/TIF1\u03b1 (Le Douarin et al, 1998) and TRIM33/TIF1\u03b3 (Venturini et al, 1999), as well as IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BPL (Childs & Goodbourn, 2003). To validate this finding, we repeated the SUMO\u2010IPs and tested candidates by immunoblotting (Fig\u00a01C, right panel). Indeed, as indicated by the decreased mobility of proteins in the IP compared to the input, IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and TRIM24 were SUMOylated and lost SUMO upon EGF treatment. RanGAP1 and TRIM28, two known SUMO targets whose abundance did not alter in the SUMO proteomic analysis, served as controls (Fig\u00a01C). We next analyzed the kinetics of deSUMOylation by performing an EGF time course experiment. Surprisingly, deSUMOylation of TRIM24, IRF2BP1, and IRF2BP2 is very transient with a minimum of SUMO after 15\u2010min EGF stimulation and full recovery after 60\u00a0min (Fig\u00a01D).Open in a separate windowFigure 1EGF induces rapid and transient deSUMOylation of transcriptional regulators in HeLa cells\nSchematic representation of a quantitative proteome analysis that compares the SUMO proteome of serum\u2010starved HeLa cells treated for 10\u00a0min with or without 100\u00a0nM EGF (SILAC labeling and endogenous SUMO1\u2010 and SUMO2/3\u2010IPs).Scatterplots represent SILAC/SUMO\u2010IP quantification after EGF treatment from three biological replicates. Each dot represents a protein that is either present in the same ratio between untreated and EGF\u2010treated cells (dark blue dots) or is significantly more present in one of the samples (red and yellow dots).Left panel: Bar graph depicting mass spectrometry results of 11 proteins with altered SUMOylation (significant hits with P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), as well as the three non\u2010changing proteins SUMO2, RanGAP1, and TRIM28. Right panel: Proteins highlighted in bold in the left panel were validated by SUMO\u2010IP/immunoblotting from serum\u2010starved HeLa cells without or with 10\u2010min EGF stimulation.Time course experiment: Serum\u2010starved HeLa cells were treated with 100\u00a0nM EGF, and samples were harvested at indicated times and subjected to SUMO2 IP followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and TRIM24 are rapidly but transiently deSUMOylated upon EGF treatment.\nNone of our five strongest hits has previously been described to be directly involved in EGF receptor signaling, even though TRIM24 can cross\u2010talk with PI3K/AKT signaling (Zhang et al, 2015; Lv et al, 2017) and TRIM33, as well as IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 are known players in TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling (Faresse et al, 2008; Xi et al, 2011; Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al, 2014; Manjur et al, 2019; Yuki et al, 2019). Furthermore, while TRIM24 and TRIM33 have been shown to be SUMOylated (Seeler et al, 2001; Fattet et al, 2013), SUMOylation of IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BPL had not been investigated yet (see below).IRF2BP proteins are SUMOylated at their conserved C\u2010terminiIRF2BP proteins are transcriptional coregulators that can homo\u2010 and hetero\u2010oligomerize via a conserved N\u2010terminal zinc finger and interact with diverse transcription factors via a C\u2010terminal RING domain (Childs & Goodbourn, 2003; Yeung et al, 2011). They have initially been identified in a yeast two hybrid screen as interaction partners of IRF2 (Childs & Goodbourn, 2003). In the following years, several groups described individual target genes that they transcriptionally regulate, such as the TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010Smad target genes ADAM12 and p21Cip1 (Faresse et al, 2008), as well as VEGFA (Teng et al, 2010) and FASTKD2 (Yeung et al, 2011). More recently, a ChIP\u2010Seq study of IRF2BP2 in mouse MEL cells revealed more than 11,000 binding sites in the mouse genome (Stadhouders et al, 2015).Very little is known about IRF2BP1's biological functions, but IRF2BP2 has emerged as an important factor in the immune system. It can suppress inflammation in macrophages and microglia (Chen et al, 2015; Cruz et al, 2017; Hari et al, 2017) and has inhibitory effects on the expression of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD\u2010L1) (Soliman et al, 2014; Dorand et al, 2016; Wu et al, 2019). In addition, IRF2BP2 was recently found to regulate the Hippo pathway and to act as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (Feng et al, 2020).To investigate functional consequences of EGF\u2010dependent deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins, we sought to identify their SUMO acceptor sites. SUMO modifies its target proteins with the help of SUMO\u2010specific E1, E2, and E3 enzymes on lysine residues that are typically embedded in SUMO consensus sites (\u03a8KxE/D, where \u03a8 is a bulky hydrophobic residue), as reviewed in (Gareau & Lima, 2010; Flotho & Melchior, 2013). When we inspected IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 for putative SUMOylation sites, we found two motifs that were conserved within the family and between species, a minimal KxE motif (FKKD/E) in the otherwise poorly conserved middle region and a classic SUMO consensus site (VKKE) close to the C\u2010terminus (Fig\u00a02A). To test whether one of those predicted IRF2BP SUMOylation sites is indeed the functional one, we transiently transfected HA\u2010tagged wild\u2010type and KR mutant variants of both proteins into HeLa cells and performed endogenous SUMO\u2010IPs. While SUMOylated IRF2BP wild type and K247R or K326R mutants can be immunoprecipitated, no signal was detected for the C\u2010terminal K579 or K566R mutants. Thus, the lysine within the predicted C\u2010terminal consensus SUMO site seems to be the dominant one endogenously used in mammalian cells (Fig\u00a02B). This SUMOylation site is located at the very C\u2010terminus of IRF2BP proteins, within a stretch of 30 highly conserved amino acids that follow directly after the conserved RING domain (Fig\u00a02C). Of note, this SUMOylation site was not identified in recent proteomic screens from human cells (Hendriks et al, 2014; Impens et al, 2014; Xiao et al, 2015; Hendriks et al, 2018), likely because the branched peptides that were generated upon protease digest of IRF2BP proteins were too short to be assigned. However, very recently, IRF2BP2 SUMOylation on this conserved lysine residue was found in zebrafish (Wang et al, 2020). Taken together, in HeLa cells, IRF2BP proteins are SUMOylated at a very conserved lysine residue, which is located at their C\u2010terminus.Open in a separate windowFigure 2IRF2BP proteins are SUMOylated at their highly conserved C\u2010terminus\nSchematic representation of the domain structure of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2. The primary sequence suggests two putative SUMO sites that are conserved among different species.Identification of the endogenous SUMO sites in IRF2BP1 (left panel) and IRF2BP2 (right panel). HeLa cells were transfected with HA\u2010tagged wild\u2010type (WT) or mutant (KR) proteins, endogenous SUMO\u2010IPs were performed, and the HA\u2010signal was analyzed by immunoblotting. Mutation of the C\u2010terminal SUMO site abolished SUMOylation of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 in HeLa cells.Clustal omega analysis of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans shows high conservation of the C\u2010terminal region including the SUMO site.Schematic representation of the creation of stable, untagged, and siRNA\u2010resistant IRF2BP1 WT and K579R HeLa cells. Constructs expressing IRF2BP1 variants in an pIRES\u2010hrGFP II (\u201cpIRES\u201d) vector were transfected, selected with antibiotics, and FACS sorted for low GFP expression.Stable HeLa cells expressing pIRES\u2010empty vector, IRF2BP1 WT, or IRF2BP1 K579R were treated with siRNA against endogenous IRF2BP1 or non\u2010targeting (nt) siRNA. Exogenous siRNA\u2010resistant IRF2BP1 was expressed at low levels similar to endogenous IRF2BP1. * refers to an unspecific band.Wt and mutant IRF2BP1 localizes in the nucleus. After knockdown of endogenous IRF2BP1, stable IRF2BP1 (WT or K579R) cell lines were immunostained for IRF2BP1. Exogenous IRF2BP1 variants show a similar nuclear localization. Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0\u00b5m.IRF2BP1 wt and mutant associate with chromatin to a similar extent. HeLa cells were lysed in 0.075% NP40 (Input). After centrifugation, the nuclei were incubated and vortexed with a nuclear extract (NE) buffer containing 170\u00a0mM NaCl. The eluates were collected, and the procedure was repeated using a NE buffer with higher salt concentrations, first 290\u00a0mM, then 420\u00a0mM. Wild\u2010type IRF2BP1, the SUMO\u2010deficient K579R mutant and the SUMOylated wild\u2010type form (*) all behave similarly.\nSUMOylation\u2010deficient IRF2BP1 cells differ in EGF\u2010dependent transcriptionTo gain insights into the functional consequences of IRF2BP protein (de)SUMOylation and its role in EGFR signaling, we next generated stable cell lines expressing either IRF2BP1 wild type or the SUMOylation\u2010deficient mutant. To avoid problems arising from variable expression levels and from tags that were reported to interfere with IRF2BP function (Giraud et al, 2014), we generated stable polyclonal HeLa cell lines that express untagged and siRNA\u2010resistant variants of IRF2BP1 (wild type or K579R) using a bi\u2010cistronic vector system (pIRES\u2010hrGFPII; Fig\u00a02D). GFP selection by FACS was used to specifically select low expressing cells, thus leading to exogenous IRF2BP1 expression that matches endogenous protein levels (Fig\u00a02E). Expression levels of exogenous wild type and K579R IRF2BP1 were comparable, suggesting that they have similar stability. Furthermore, localization of exogenous IRF2BP1 was similar in both cell populations (Fig\u00a02F), indicating that SUMO does not regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport of these proteins. Another function that has been attributed to SUMO is an influence on transcription factor\u2014chromatin interaction (reviewed, e.g., in (Rosonina et al, 2017)). We therefore compared chromatin binding of wild\u2010type IRF2BP1 with its SUMO\u2010deficient mutant in salt extraction experiments. A significant fraction of IRF2BP1 binds stably to chromatin, and no difference could be observed between wild\u2010type and mutant forms and also not for SUMOylated wild\u2010type IRF2BP1, which is visible in extracts of stable cell lines (Fig\u00a02G).To begin to address the question whether SUMOylation of IRF2BP1 may contribute to IRF2BP's role in gene expression, we next used microarrays to compare the transcriptome between wild\u2010type and mutant cells that were depleted of endogenous IRF2BP1 and grown asynchronously for 48\u00a0h in serum containing medium (Fig\u00a0EV1A). Indeed, 138 genes were at least 1.5 fold differentially expressed between the two cell lines (see lists of genes in Dataset EV2). Gene Ontology analysis revealed that many of these genes are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and in the response to growth factor stimuli (Fig\u00a0EV1B).Open in a separate windowFigure EV1Transcriptome analyses of HeLa cells expressing either wt IRF2BP1 or the SUMOylation\u2010deficient variant IRF2BP1 K579R\nA Stable IRF2BP1 cell lines were used to perform microarray analyses in asynchronously growing cells (full serum) and under serum starvation, with or without EGF treatment for 1\u00a0h.B\u2013D GO analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes cluster in similar biological processes, such as adhesion, proliferation, and signaling processes, irrespective of whether they were grown in full serum (B), under serum starvation (C), or under serum starvation and EGF treatment (100\u00a0ng/ml) for 1\u00a0h (D).\nThe most important question was, however, whether the lack of IRF2BP1 SUMOylation\u2014and in consequence the lack of temporally controlled deSUMOylation\u2014would result in transcriptional changes upon EGF stimulation. To address this, we again depleted endogenous IRF2BP1 from our polyclonal wild\u2010type IRF2BP1 and K579R cell lines, serum\u2010starved the cells for 16\u00a0h, and incubated them for an additional hour with or without 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF, before cells were harvested and their RNAs quantified using microarray analyses (Fig\u00a0EV1A, Dataset EV2). As in full serum, genes that were differentially expressed between wt and mutant cells clustered in GO categories such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and in the response to growth factor stimuli (Fig\u00a0EV1C and D for the absence and presence of EGF, respectively). Consistent with studies in HeLa cells from Yarden and coworkers (Amit et al, 2007), we identified 529 genes significantly regulated by EGF in our stable cell lines (at least 1.5\u2010fold in IRF2BP1 wild\u2010type or in IRF2BP1 KR cells). Intriguingly, for 38 (7%) of those EGF\u2010responsive genes, a significant difference in the amplitude of the transcriptional change induced by EGF could be observed between wild\u2010type and KR cells (at least 1.5 fold, Fig\u00a03A). In light of the early time point (1\u00a0h after EGF treatment), we considered it likely that these 38 genes are directly regulated by IRF2BP1.Open in a separate windowFigure 3IRF2BP1 deSUMOylation contributes to transcriptional induction of immediate early genes\nStable IRF2BP1 cell lines (knocked down for endogenous IRF2BP1) were used to perform a microarray experiment under serum starvation and upon treatment with EGF for 1\u00a0h. A subset of 38 EGF\u2010dependent genes is differentially regulated in IRF2BP1 wild\u2010type cells compared to IRF2BP1 K579R cell lines (at least 1.5\u2010fold). Among them are DUSP1 (arrow), ATF3, Fos, and Egr2. Each microarray was performed in triplicates, and the bars show log2 values of the fold changes for wt cells (black bars) and for KR cells (gray bars).

IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 bind to the promoter region of DUSP1 between nucleotides \u2010243 and \u201067.ChIP/qPCR experiments reveal preferential IRF2BP1 binding to the promoter region of DUSP1 between \u2010243 and \u201067. Data show mean (bar) and individual data points from two biological replicates.IRF2BP1 wild type and the K579R mutant both bind the DUSP1 promoter in the absence or presence of EGF. Stable cell lines expressing IRF2BP1 wild type or K579R were knocked down for endogenous IRF2BP1, followed by IRF2BP1 ChIP and DUSP1 qPCR of its promoter region \u2010243 and \u201067.

Data show means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM from four biological replicates.\nThe feedback regulator DUSP1 is a direct target of IRF2BP1IRF2BP proteins are transcriptional coregulators that seem to interact with many different transcription factors and coregulators. In mouse MEL cells, 40% of the IRF2BP2 binding sites were found within 5\u00a0kb of the transcriptional start sites (Stadhouders et al, 2015) and IRF2BP2 bound >\u00a02,000 genes in their proximal promoter region (Fang et al, 2020). We thus asked whether any of our 38 candidate genes are among those genes. Indeed, seven of the 38 genes, including DUSP1 (MKP\u20101), activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), Fos and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2), interacted in mouse MEL cells with IRF2BP2 in the proximal promoter region.DUSP1 is a well\u2010known immediate early gene and its gene product, dual specificity phosphatase 1, is an inhibitor of the MAP kinase branch of EGF receptor signaling and thus an important feedback regulator in EGFR signaling (reviewed in (Liu et al, 2007)). In consequence, DUSP1 seemed an excellent candidate to gain mechanistic insights into how IRF2BP (de)SUMOylation contributes to gene expression. We thus tested by chromatin IP experiments whether IRF2BP2 and IRF2BP1 bind to the human DUSP1 promoter in HeLa cells. Indeed, both proteins bind to a region (\u2010243 to \u201067) directly adjacent to the TSS (Fig\u00a03B and C). To validate a second candidate, we also confirmed binding of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 to the proximal promoter of human ATF3 in HeLa cells (Fig\u00a0EV2). ATF3 was a particularly promising candidate, because it had just been found to be under direct control of IRF2BP2 in mouse non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver (Fang et al, 2020).Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Chromatin IP reveals association of human IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 with the proximal ATF3 promoter in HeLa cellsGene architecture of human ATF3. The primers at \u2010358/\u2010241 (\u201cATF3\u2010TSS\u2010241\u201d) relative to the TSS were used for ChIP experiments.We next wanted to interrogate whether transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins regulates its association with the DUSP1 promoter. This does not seem to be the case: Association with the DUSP1 promoter does neither differ significantly between IRF2BP1 wild type and the K579R mutant, nor is it affected by EGF treatment, which causes IRF2BP1 deSUMOylation (Fig\u00a03D). In conclusion, IRF2BP1 binding directly upstream (within 240 nucleotides) of the DUSP1 TSS is independent of its SUMOylation status and is not altered by EGF.IRF2BP1 is a SUMO\u2010dependent repressor of immediate early genesDoes transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP1 contribute to timing or amplitude of DUSP1 mRNA expression after EGF treatment? To address this question, we turned to qPCR experiments (Fig\u00a03E). Indeed, although DUSP1 mRNA levels showed the expected time course of induction and decline after EGF treatment in wild\u2010type IRF2BP1 and in IRF2BP1 K579R cells, the amplitude of DUSP1 expression was significantly enhanced in the mutant cell line (Fig\u00a03E). To ensure that the observed effect was due to lack of SUMOylation, rather than other lysine modifications, we repeated these experiments with cells in which we replaced endogenous IRF2BP1 with IRF2BP1 V578A. V578A is part of the SUMOylation consensus motif and required for IRF2BP1 SUMOylation (Fig\u00a03F, right panel). Also in these cells, the amplitude of DUSP1 transcription after stimulation with EGF was increased compared to cells expressing wild\u2010type IRF2BP1 (Fig\u00a03F, left panel), strongly supporting the notion that SUMOylated IRF2BP1 inversely correlates with DUSP1 expression. As pointed out above, DUSP1 is just one of several immediate early genes (IEGs) that seem to be under EGF and IRF2BP1 control. We thus repeated the qPCR analyses for three additional genes (Fig\u00a03G). Indeed, ATF3, Egr2, and Fos were induced more rapidly and to higher amplitude in cells that expressed the SUMOylation\u2010deficient V578A variant of IRF2BP1. In conclusion, our analyses identified IRF2BP1 as a novel SUMO\u2010dependent regulator of several immediate early genes.How does transient IRF2BP1 deSUMOylation contribute to timely expression of several immediate early genes? We envisioned two different explanations: Either IRF2BP1 is a repressor that requires SUMOylation for its repressive function. Or IRF2BP1 is required for transcription, but is inactive as long as it is SUMOylated. To distinguish between these scenarios, we asked whether IRF2BP1 knockdown stimulates or prevents DUSP1 and ATF3 induction. As shown by immunoblotting in Fig\u00a04A, knockdown of IRF2BP1 prior to serum starvation and EGF treatment caused a strong increase in DUSP1 and in ATF3 induction, consistent with a repressive function.Open in a separate windowFigure 4IRF2BP proteins negatively regulate expression of the EGF receptor\nImmunoblotting of HeLa lysates at indicated times after EGF treatment reveals enhanced DUSP1 and ATF3 expression upon knockdown of IRF2BP1. Uba2 and beta\u2010actin serve as independent loading controls.Model. IRF2BP1 is a SUMO\u2010dependent transcriptional repressor of immediate early genes (IEGs). Transcription of IEGs is repressed by SUMOylated IRF2BP1, which binds to its proximal promoter. EGF receptor signaling yields at least two signals to induce IEG expression, one of which is the transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP1.Wound healing assay: HeLa cells were incubated with nt or IRF2BP1 siRNA for 2\u00a0days, grown to 90% confluency, and analyzed for wound closure with or without addition of 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF. Data show means of the relative wound density\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM from four biological replicates.Proliferation assay: HeLa cells upon knockdown of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP1 were analyzed for cell density over 6\u00a0days in growth medium. One representative biological experiment is shown with means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM from five technical replicates.IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BP1\u00a0+\u00a0IRF2BP2 were knocked down in HeLa cells for 72\u00a0h, and gene expression data were recorded by microarray analysis; non\u2010targeting siRNAs were used as a control. IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 have distinct and overlapping functions. Experiments were done in triplicates.GSEA of the highly significant enriched EGFR signaling pathway. IRF2BP1 knockdown correlates with an increase of genes involved in EGFR signaling.Validation of two candidate genes: IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 were knocked down for 72\u00a0h in HeLa cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.FACS\u2010based analysis of EGFR surface expression: IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 were knocked down for 48\u00a0h in HeLa cells, and cells were serum\u2010starved for 16\u00a0h, stained with fluorescent anti\u2010EGFR antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Shown are means of three independent experiments\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM.\nMany different mechanisms have been described for SUMO\u2010dependent repression in the literature (Gill, 2005; Hay, 2005; Guo et al, 2007; Lyst & Stancheva, 2007; Rosonina et al, 2017; Rosonina, 2019). We consider it most likely that SUMO regulates IRF2BP1 interactions in the context of specific promoters. Its binding partners may for example be HDAC containing corepressor complexes, which have frequently been linked to SUMO\u2010dependent repression (reviewed in Rosenfeld, 2006; Ouyang & Gill, 2009). In line with this idea is a publication that describes extensive IRF2BP2/NCoR co\u2010occupancy in mouse MEL cells and activation of IRF2BP2\u2010repressed genes upon HDAC2/3 inhibition (Stadhouders et al, 2015). Alternatively, SUMO may regulate interactions of IRF2BP1 with components of the transcription machinery that regulate transcription initiation or pausing: The DUSP1 gene shows strong enrichment of polymerase II at the TSS in serum\u2010starved HeLa cells (Gardini et al, 2014), and its expression is rapidly induced in response to EGF. How its transcription is induced remains unclear, but it could involve relieve from transcription pausing, as has been suggested by (Ryser et al, 2004), or an increase of transcription initiation (Ehrensberger et al, 2013). The DUSP1 promoter binds numerous transcription factors (ENCODE database, e.g. (Johansson\u2010Haque et al, 2008)), and the proximal DUSP1 promoter of resting rat pituitary cells is enriched with transcription elongation factors such as NELF and DSIF (Ryser et al, 2004; Fujita et al, 2009). Moreover, SUMO has recently been suggested to contribute to transcriptional pausing, at least in the context of severe heat stress (Niskanen & Palvimo, 2017). Considering that SUMOylated IRF2BP1 sits directly adjacent to the TSS, it is conceivable that SUMO may contribute to the stability of a paused state or inhibit transcription initiation.Our findings identify IRF2BP1 as a SUMO\u2010dependent repressor of DUSP1 and other immediate early genes in EGF receptor signaling (Figs\u00a04B and EV3). It is, however, important to note that IRF2BP1 deSUMOylation is not sufficient to drive DUSP1 expression: We do not observe premature expression or expression in the absence of EGF in the IRF2BP1 SUMO\u2010deficient cells. At least one additional EGF\u2010dependent event is required, which may for example be MAP kinase\u2010dependent phosphorylation of a transcription\u2014or elongation regulator. SUMO thus seems to serve as an important brake that can prevent both, erroneous activation, and overshooting response.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3ModelDeSUMOylation of IRF2BP1 occurs within 15\u00a0min after EGF treatment. This transient event directly correlates with the gene expression of immediate early genes.But how can SUMO restrict DUSP1 expression, if most IRF2BP1 is not SUMOylated in cells? We envision two scenarios: Either IRF2BP1 is quantitatively SUMOylated on the DUSP1 promoter, but not on many other genes to which it binds. Alternatively, the whole pool of IRF2BP1 undergoes constant cycles of SUMOylation and deSUMOylation, and EGF shifts the equilibrium to the unmodified form. Irrespective of whether the SUMOylated species contributes to the stability of a paused state or blocks transcription initiation, shortening the lifetime of the SUMOylated species would increase the amplitude of transcription. Either model depends on a signaling event that will inhibit SUMOylation\u2014or stimulate deSUMOylation of IRF2BP1. Very few SUMOylated proteins lose SUMO in response to EGF\u2014we consider it therefore likely that IRF2BP1 itself, rather than one of the SUMO enzymes, is altered.Precedence for this comes from studies of the transcription factor Elk1, whose repressive activity depends on SUMO. PMA\u2010induced activation of MAP kinases leads to Elk1 phosphorylation and deSUMOylation, which turns Elk1 into an activator (Yang et al, 2003). IRF2BP1 carries numerous phosphorylation sites, none of which is close to the SUMOylation consensus site. Whether (de)phosphorylation of any of these is responsible for the EGF\u2010dependent SUMO switch awaits further investigation. Importantly, our study supports the notion that transient deSUMOylation of transcription factors could be a commonly used mechanism for transcriptional control.IRF2BP proteins act as negative regulators of EGFR signalingAlthough we found clear transcriptional changes in cells that express SUMOylation\u2010deficient IRF2BP1, DUSP1 and ATF3 protein induction did not vary enough between wt and mutant cell lines to be statistically significant and reproducible. Variability may be due in part to technical reasons, for example because knockdown efficiency of the endogenous IRF2BP1 influences DUSP1 induction. More important is the possibility that loss of a single SUMO site in IRF2BP1 may be compensated by the SUMOylation of its family members and binding partners IRF2BP2 and IRF2BPL. To gain full insights into the physiological consequences of the transient deSUMOylation of IRF2BP proteins, we would either need to interfere with an unknown upstream signal or we would have to generate cell lines in which all three proteins would be SUMOylation\u2010deficient. Unfortunately, this is currently not possible\u2014even mild IRF2BP1 overexpression is not well tolerated, and our stable cells lose expression of full\u2010length IRF2BP1 within a few weeks.We thus turned our attention to the more straight forward question of cellular consequences of IRF2BP1 loss. As discussed above, its depletion prior to EGF stimulation leads to robust DUSP1 and ATF3 upregulation (Fig\u00a04A), two important players with rather different functions in EGFR signaling. We thus wondered how knockdown might influence cell migration and proliferation, well\u2010known outcomes of EGF receptor signaling. As shown in Fig\u00a04C and D, knockdown of IRF2BP1 caused both, faster EGF\u2010dependent wound closure and accelerated cell proliferation. Knockdown of IRF2BP2 also enhanced cell proliferation, albeit not as strongly as knockdown of IRF2BP1. These findings suggest that IRF2BP proteins, especially IRF2BP1, have growth inhibitory functions.To gain insights into possible reasons, we performed microarray analyses after knockdown of IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, or both proteins in asynchronously growing HeLa cells (Figs\u00a04E and EV4A). In light of the large number of genes that interact with IRF2BP2, we were not surprised to find that many genes were affected by knocking down IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, or both: In total, approximately 5,200 genes show a significant change (>\u00a01.5\u2010fold, FDR <\u00a00.05, Dataset EV3). Intriguingly, IRF2BP proteins seem to only partially control the same genes and where they do, they may even have opposing effects (Figs\u00a04E and EV4B). The most striking finding was, however, that genes affected by IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 knockdown enriched strongly in diverse signal transduction categories including EGF receptor signaling (\u201cERBB_signaling\u201d, Figs\u00a04F and EV4C and D for IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 knockdown, respectively). Two genes were particularly intriguing: The EGF receptor and Sec24D, a COPII component that facilitates transport of newly synthesized EGFR to the plasma membrane (Scharaw et al, 2016), were both upregulated 4\u2010fold on RNA level upon IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 knockdown. Consistent with this, immunoblotting revealed that IRF2BP1 and/or IRF2BP2 knockdown leads to very clear upregulation of EGFR and Sec24D proteins (Fig\u00a04G). As shown by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), this also leads to strongly elevated levels of the EGF receptor at the plasma membrane (Fig\u00a04H), which may well contribute to enhanced proliferation of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 knockdown cells in response to EGF. Upregulation of EGF receptor transcription is typically a late response, serving to replenish receptors, which have been degraded upon signaling. At presence, we have no evidence that IRF2BP proteins bind the EGF receptor gene directly. Its expression could be affected by any of the immediate early and many subsequent feed\u2010forward and feedback regulatory events in EGF receptor signaling that may be altered upon IRF2BP knockdown. Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, our findings reveal a thus far unknown role for IRF2BP1 in the control of growth factor signaling and cell proliferation. Consistent with this, IRF2BP1 expression has recently been suggested as a favorable prognostic marker for renal and pancreatic cancer patients (www.proteinatlas.org, (Uhl\u00e9n et al, 2017)) and IRF2BP2 was reported to be a favorable prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (Feng et al, 2020).Open in a separate windowFigure EV4Transcriptome analyses of Hela cells with or without depletion of IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, or both proteins\nASchematic representation of the microarray experiment that was performed in this study (three independent experiments): IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and IRF2BP1\u00a0+\u00a0IRF2BP2 were knocked down in HeLa cells for 72\u00a0h, and gene expression data were recorded by microarray; non\u2010targeting siRNAs were used as a control.BVenn diagram of genes that are differentially expressed (at least 1.5\u2010fold, FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05) upon IRF2BP\u2010knockdown compared to control.

Many signaling pathways were enriched upon knockdown of IRF2BP1 (C) and IRF2BP2 (D). The first 15 hits ranked by Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) are shown.\nIn conclusion, our work provides a paradigm for endogenous SUMO proteomics as a discovery tool for novel players in signal transduction and it puts the spotlight on the poorly studied transcriptional regulatory protein IRF2BP1 as a novel regulator of EGF receptor signaling. Although we have not been able to fully address this, we assume that IRF2BP1 and its binding partners IRF2BP2 and IRF2BPL cooperate on immediate early promoters and that their simultaneous deSUMOylation is required for maximal effects. With the \"SUMO switch\" discovered here, we also add an important element that helps understanding temporal control in immediate early gene expression. Materials and MethodsDetailed information on all used resources and reagents (including catalogue numbers) is provided in Table\u00a0EV1.Cell cultureCulture of HeLa cells HeLa cells were obtained from Dr. Simona Polo (Milan) and were the same ones as used in the studies on phospho\u2010 and ubiquitin\u2010proteomes after EGF treatment (Olsen et al, 2006; Argenzio et al, 2011). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, and 1\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate medium (we also refer to it as \u201cfull medium\u201d). Cells were split between 1:3 and 1:15 and were grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and 90% humidity.Culture of hybridoma cells Hybridoma cells producing antibodies against SUMO1 (clone 21C7) and SUMO2/3 (Clone 8A2), both obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and originally developed by Dr. Mike Matunis. Cells were cultured in CELLine 1000 bioreactor (Integra) according to manufacturer's instructions. The medium compartment was filled with RPMI medium containing 10% FBS (heat\u2010inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min) and 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine. For the cell compartment, Hybridoma\u2010SFM (Gibco) medium was used.siRNA transfection of HeLa cells HeLa cells were reverse\u2010transfected for 3\u00a0days using OptiMEM and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligos targeting IRF2BP1 (GCUUCAAGUACCUCGAAUA[dT][dT] and UAUUCGAGGUACUUGAAGC[dT][dT]), IRF2BP2 (GAGAGAGACUCGUGACUUU[dT][dT] and AAAGUCACGAGUCUCUCUC[dT][dT]) as well as \u201cnon\u2010targeting\u201d (AAUAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA[dT][dT] and UUGAUGUGUUUAGUCGCUAUU[dT][dT]) were ordered at Ambion or Applied Biosystems (both Thermo Fischer Scientific). siRNA stocks were kept at 20\u00a0\u00b5M in water at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 1\u00a0year.Plasmid transfection of HeLa cells HeLa cells were transiently transfected 24\u00a0h after seeding at a confluency of 50% using polyethyleneimine (PEI, PolySciences (23966), 1\u00a0mg/ml pH 7.0) at a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:2.5 in serum\u2010free DMEM. Fifteen\u2010cm plates were transfected with 30\u00a0\u00b5g DNA and 10\u00a0cm plates with 13.5\u00a0\u00b5g plasmid DNA. Serum supplemented DMEM was added 6\u00a0h after transfection. Cells were harvested 24\u201348\u00a0h after transfection.Generation of polyclonal stable cell lines Plasmids \u201cpIRES\u2010hrGFPII\u201d, \u201cIRF2BP1 wild type, siRNA resistant, in pIRES\u2010hrGFPII\u201d, \u201cIRF2BP1 K579R, siRNA resistant, in pIRES\u2010hrGFPII\u201d or \u201cIRF2BP1 V578A, siRNA resistant, in pIRES\u2010hrGFPII\u201d were transfected on 10\u2010cm plates. After 3\u00a0days, cells were split 1:3 and full medium (supplemented with G418) was added. We routinely checked G418 efficiency and used the concentration at which all untransfected HeLa cells died within 5\u20137\u00a0days (varied between 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0mg/ml depending on the age of stock solutions).After 2\u00a0weeks, \u201clow GFP\u201d\u2010positive cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria Illu\u2122. Usually, only 0.5\u20135% of the initial cell pools were \u201clow GFP\u201d expressing. FACS sorting was thus repeated several times until the cells appeared stable. We analyzed our polyclonal cell lines once a month by FACS and used them for experiments only if they were at least 70% low GFP expressing.Preparation of cells for FACS sorting HeLa cells growing on a 10\u00a0cm dish were detached very well using 500\u00a0\u00b5l trypsin for 5\u00a0min. 500\u00a0\u00b5l quenching solution (PBS, 1% dialyzed FBS) was added, and cells were resuspended thoroughly. This cell suspension was mixed with 3\u00a0ml dissociation buffer (5\u00a0mM EDTA, 25\u00a0mM HEPES, 1% dialyzed FBS in PBS, pH 7.4), and 5\u00a0mM MgCl2 and DNase (25\u00a0U/ml cells) were added. Cells were transferred into a Falcon\u00ae 5\u00a0ml Round Bottom Polystyrene Test Tube, with Cell Strainer Snap Cap and subsequently FACS sorted.Cloning of IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 constructsmRNA was extracted from HeLa cells using the NucleoSpin\u00ae RNA II kit (Macherey\u2010Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following this, mRNA was transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScriptTM First\u2010Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 open reading frames were amplified by PCR using gene\u2010specific primers, which also contained the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI and Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific). As a vector backbone, a modified pcDNA3.1 vector was used that already contained an N\u2010terminal HA\u2010tag. IRF2BP1 and IRF2BP2 PCR fragments were cloned into this vector using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Lysine to arginine mutations were introduced using the QuickChange\u00ae Site\u2010directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and site\u2010specific mutagenesis primers.For generation of bi\u2010cistronic IRF2BP1/GFP constructs, PCRs were performed from HA\u2010IRF2BP1 constructs using gene\u2010specific primers, which also contained the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI, and Phusion DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific). As a vector backbone, pIRES\u2010hrGFPII was used. IRF2BP1 PCR fragments were cloned into this vector using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Site\u2010directed mutagenesis was done to generate constructs that are resistant to siRNA#5.Sequencing of all constructs was done at GATC using a vector\u2010specific CMV primer as well as internal sequencing primers.Protein gels and Western blottingFor most of the gels and blots, 6, 8, or 10% Sch\u00e4gger gels were used (Sch\u00e4gger & Jagow, 1987; Sch\u00e4gger, 2006)). Blotting was done onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Amersham 0.45), using a buffer containing 25\u00a0mM Tris, 193\u00a0mM glycine, 20% ethanol, and 0.04% SDS.After blocking membranes with 5% milk in PBS\u2010T (1\u00d7 PBS, 0.1% Tween20), primary antibodies were applied for at least 2\u00a0h and secondary, HRP\u2010conjugated antibodies were applied for 1\u00a0h. Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrate (SuperSignal\u2122 West Pico PLUS from Thermo Scientific for standard signals or Immobilon Western HRP Substrate from Merck Millipore for weak signals), and the luminescent signals were detected using LAS 4000 biomolecular imager.Endogenous SUMO immunoprecipitationsEndogenous SUMO immunoprecipitations (SUMO\u2010IPs) were performed as first described in (Becker et al, 2013). For that we grew hybridoma cells to generate antibodies against SUMO1 (clone 21C7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and SUMO2/3 (Clone 8A2, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and used CELLine bioreactors to harvest antibodies at a concentration of approximately 1\u00a0mg/ml.For generating SUMO antibody beads, 8\u00a0mg of SUMO antibody was added to 1\u00a0mg protein G agarose beads (Roche) for 1.5\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed with 20\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and crosslinked using 20\u00a0mM DMP in 50\u00a0mM sodium tetraborate, pH 9.0 for 1.5\u00a0h at room temperature. Afterward, beads were quenched in 50\u00a0mM Tris, pH 8.0, and washed in 20\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 before use.To obtain cell lysates, 80% confluent HeLa cells growing adherently on 15\u00a0cm plates were lysed directly in 500\u00a0\u03bcl denaturing lysis buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 2% SDS, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 10\u00a0mM EGTA, 2\u00a0mM Pefa\u2010blocker, 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 20\u00a0mM NEM), leading to a final volume of 1\u00a0ml lysate (final SDS concentration 1%). The samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.The cell lysates were quickly thawed, supplemented with 75\u00a0mM DTT and boiled for 10\u00a0min at 60\u201370\u00b0C. The lysates were sonicated until the DNA sheared completely and diluted 1:10 in cold pre\u2010RIPA dilution buffer (20\u00a0mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Pefa\u2010blocker, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 20\u00a0mM NEM). Upon dilution, the final extract now corresponds to RIPA buffer. Finally, extracts were sterile filtered (0.45\u00a0\u03bcm pores) in order to obtain the input of the SUMO\u2010IPs. Further steps were performed on ice if not stated otherwise.The filtered input was added to the beads pre\u2010equilibrated in the RIPA dilution buffer (100\u00a0\u03bcl beads/10\u00a0mg protein in the input sample, as determined by Bradford assay) and incubated overnight upon gentle rotation at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed 3\u00d7 in RIPA buffer (20\u00a0mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Pefa\u2010blocker, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 10\u00a0mM NEM) in 1.5\u2010ml LoBind tubes (Eppendorf). Next, the samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C with three volumes (300\u00a0\u03bcl per 100\u00a0\u00b5l beads) of the pre\u2010elution buffer (RIPA buffer containing 500\u00a0mM NaCl, supplemented freshly with 10\u00a0mM NEM) to elute unspecifically bound proteins during gentle mixing. Elution of SUMOylated proteins was done for at least 30\u00a0min with three volumes of elution buffer (RIPA buffer containing 500\u00a0mM NaCl and 0.5\u00a0mg/ml SUMO epitope peptide) during gentle mixing. This elution step was done twice, and the eluates were harvested into fresh LoBind tubes. SUMOylated protein eluates were concentrated using TCA precipitation (10% TCA for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, followed by two washes in acetone at \u221220\u00b0C).Samples were then loaded onto SDS\u2013PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting or mass spectrometry.MicroarrayRNA preparation For comparing the RNA expression levels between IRF2BP1 wild type and the SUMO\u2010deficient KR mutant, HeLa cells stably expressing the pIRES\u2010hrGFPII based vectors (IRF2BP1 WT or IRF2BP1 KR, 4th FACS sorting) were treated with siRNA#5 against IRF2BP1 for 72\u00a0h in a six\u2010well. After 56\u00a0h, cells were serum\u2010starved for (a) 16\u00a0h and (b) 15\u00a0h and treated for 1\u00a0h with 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF or (c) not serum\u2010starved at all.For comparing the RNA expression levels between different knock\u2010downs, six\u2010well plates of HeLa cells were treated with siRNAs (non\u2010targeting, IRF2BP1#5, IR2BP2#13) for 72\u00a0h in a six\u2010well. After 56\u00a0h, cells were serum\u2010starved for (a) 16\u00a0h or (b) 15\u00a0h and treated for 1\u00a0h with 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF.Efficiency of the siRNA was controlled by using the siRNA transfection mixture on normal HeLa cells in parallel and by checking the protein amounts of IRF2BP1 in immunoblotting.Each experiment was done in three independent experiments.RNA samples were purified using Nucleospin RNA Plus kit (Macherey\u2010Nagel) following manufacturer's instructions. RNA was tested by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent), and high quality was confirmed.Gene expression profiling was performed using GeneChip\u2122 HuGene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). Biotinylated antisense cRNA was then prepared according to the Affymetrix standard labeling protocol with the GeneChip\u00ae WT Plus Reagent Kit and the GeneChip\u00ae Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit (both from Affymetrix). Afterward, the hybridization on the chip was performed on a GeneChip Hybridization oven 640, then dyed in the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, and thereafter scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000. All of the equipment used was from Affymetrix (High Wycombe, UK).Bioinformatics A Custom CDF version 21 with ENTREZ\u2010based gene definitions was used to annotate the arrays (Dai et al, 2005). The Raw fluorescence intensity values were normalized applying quantile normalization and RMA background correction. Before performing the ANOVA, a batch normalization was used to remove the individual mouse variations. An ANOVA was performed to identify differential expressed genes using a commercial software package SAS JMP Genomics, version 7, from SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A false\u2010positive rate of a\u00a0=\u00a00.05 with FDR correction was taken as the level of significance.For Fig\u00a03A, intensity values for each gene in the wild type and K579 mutant cell lines with and without EGF were measured in triplicates (arising from three biological replicates). Each value was transformed to its log2 value; then, an average was formed for each triplicate. The log2\u2010fold change was then calculated by subtracting the value obtained for the \u2212EGF from the value obtained for +EGF in both cell lines.Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to determine whether defined lists (or sets) of genes exhibit a statistically significant bias in their distribution within a ranked gene list using the software GSEA (Subramanian et al, 2005). Pathways belonging to various cell functions such as cell cycle or apoptosis were obtained from public external databases (KEGG, http://www.genome.jp/kegg) and the Hallmark Geneset database.The raw and normalized data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE135221\",\"term_id\":\"135221\"}}GSE135221 and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE161716\",\"term_id\":\"161716\"}}GSE161716).Chromatin IPsHeLa cells stably expressing pIRES\u2010hrGFPII\u2010based vectors (IRF2BP1 WT or IRF2BP1 KR, 4th or 7th FACS sorting) were treated with siRNA#5 against IRF2BP1 for 72\u00a0h on a 10\u2010cm plate. After 56\u00a0h, cells were serum\u2010starved for 16\u00a0h or for 15\u00a0h and treated for 1\u00a0h with 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF. Chromatin IP (ChIP) experiments were performed using the SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit (Cell Signalling), exactly following manufacturer's instructions.The chromatin digestion efficiency was systematically controlled, and the chromatin concentration was also monitored. The IP was performed with 10\u00a0\u00b5g of digested chromatin and 2\u00a0\u00b5g of IRF2BP1 or IRF2BP2 antibodies (Proteintech) or normal rabbit IgG provided in the kit.DNA abundance was quantified by qPCR (see below).qPCRRNA was purified using the Nucleospin RNA Plus kit (Macherey\u2010Nagel). RNA concentration and quality was determined by NanoDrop. Two microgram of RNA was used to produce cDNA using the High\u2010Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher, previously Applied Biosystem) following manufacturer instruction. qPCR reactions were prepared using the LightCycler\u00ae 480 SYBR Green kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.For checking DUSP1 expression on the RNA level, DUSP1 qPCR primers and ACTB primers were used. The qPCR was performed with the following cycle: denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, annealing at 56\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s. Technical triplicates were done in each biological experiment, and the data were analyzed using the \u2206\u2206Ct method.For ChIP\u2010qPCRs of DUSP1 and ATF3, we used 2\u00a0\u00b5l of sample (input was 1:5 diluted). Denaturing was done for 10\u00a0s at 95\u00b0C, annealing for 10\u00a0s at 56\u201359\u00b0C using the primers \u201cTSS\u201d (56\u00b0C), \u201cTSS\u201067\u201d (59\u00b0C), \u201cTSS\u2010224\u201d (58\u00b0C), \u201cTSS\u2010961\u201d (59\u00b0C) and \u201cATF\u2010TSS\u2010241\u201d (54\u00b0C), and extension for 20\u00a0s at 72\u00b0C.EGFR surface stainingHeLa cells were serum\u2010starved for 16\u00a0h (to remove all EGF at the plasma membrane that might interfere with EGFR binding) and afterward washed twice with PBS. They were then incubated with a solution containing PBS/2.5\u00a0mM EDTA/25mM HEPES/2% FBS (dialyzed at 12\u201314 MWCO) for 5\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and then detached from cell culture plates using a cell lifter. Cells were centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 300 g, resuspended in 1\u00a0ml PBS/2.5\u00a0mM EDTA, and counted. 106 cells were used for each experiment and blocked with 2% FBS (dialyzed at 12\u201314 MWCO) for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C (rotating). One \u00b5g anti\u2010EGFR\u2010Alexa Fluor\u00ae 555 antibody (neutralizing, clone LA1, Merck) was added to each 106 cells for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C (rotating). Cells were then washed three times in PBS and directly analyzed for Alexa 555 signal (using a 561\u00a0nm laser) using a BD FACSCanto\u2122.Migration assays (IncuCyte\u00ae)HeLa cells were reverse\u2010transfected with siRNA against IRF2BP1 or non\u2010targeting in one 12\u2010well each. After 1\u00a0day, they were split and counted using LUNA\u2122 cell counter\u00a0and a 96\u2010well plate was prepared with 10,000 cells per well (three wells were done as technical replicates for each biological experiment). One day after plating, a scratch wound was created using the IncuCyte\u00ae WoundMaker tool (Essenbioscience) and cells were immediately analyzed in an IncuCyte\u00ae (Essenbioscience) for 4\u00a0days, taking one image per well every 2\u00a0h. Relative wound density\u00a0was determined using the manufacturer's program.Proliferation assays (IncuCyte\u00ae)HeLa cells were reverse\u2010transfected with siRNA against IRF2BP1, IRF2BP2, and non\u2010targeting in one 12\u2010well each. After 3\u00a0days, they were split and FACS sorted to obtain a defined amount of single cells. A 96\u2010well plate was prepared with 5,000 cells per well (five wells were done as technical replicates for each biological experiment), and they were again reverse transfected with their respective siRNA. Cells were immediately analyzed in an IncuCyte\u00ae (Essenbioscience) for 6\u00a0days, taking four images per well every 2\u00a0h. Confluence of the cells was determined using the manufacturer's program.Quantification of the SUMO proteome upon EGF/mass spectrometryHeLa cells were grown for 6\u20137 doublings (from 30 to 3,600\u00a0cm2 culture dish surface, i.e. 24 15 cm plates) in SILAC DMEM medium containing dialyzed FBS (dialyzed 3\u00d7 against PBS through a 6\u20138.000 MWCO bag), 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamine, and 146\u00a0\u00b5g/ml lysine and 86\u00a0\u00b5g/ml arginine. One set of 24 plates contained \u201clight\u201d lysine and arginine, and the other set of 24 plates contained D4\u2010lysine and 13C\u2010arginine. 16\u201318\u00a0h before collecting the cells, they were serum\u2010starved in SILAC DMEM medium containing only glutamine and the respective type of lysine and arginine.One set of cells was treated with 100\u00a0ng/ml EGF (in PBS\u2010BSA) for 10\u00a0min; the other set was treated with PBS\u2010BSA only. For large\u2010scale SUMO\u2010IPs, the cells were lysed in 350\u00a0\u00b5l 2\u2013\u00d7 lysis buffer per plate and lysates from all 48 plates were combined. SUMO\u2010IPs were performed as stated above, and TCA precipitated eluates were loaded onto NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae Bis\u2010Tris Mini Gels (4\u201312%) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.In\u2010gel digestion was performed as described (Shevchenko et al, 2006) with minor modifications. Unless otherwise stated, all incubation steps were performed at 26\u00b0C in an Eppendorf thermomixer at 1,050\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min and all solutions were prepared with LiChrosolv H2O. Each lane of the stained gel was cut into 23 equally sized pieces. Gel slices were first washed with 150\u00a0\u03bcl H2O and dehydrated with 150\u00a0\u03bcl acetonitrile (ACN). Dried gel pieces were incubated with 150\u00a0\u03bcl of 10\u00a0mM DTT reducing solution for 50\u00a0min and then alkylated with 55\u00a0mM iodoacetamide for 20\u00a0min at 26\u00b0C in the dark. After another round of dehydration of gel pieces with ACN, they were rehydrated with 60\u00a0\u03bcl of digestion buffer (2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml trypsin in 25\u00a0mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.5) and incubated at 37\u00b0C over night.For peptide extraction, supernatants of the three following steps were pooled: First, 100\u00a0\u03bcl ACN were added to dehydrate the gel pieces. Second, gel pieces were rehydrated with 50\u00a0\u03bcl 5% [v/v] formic acid (FA), followed by addition of 50\u00a0\u03bcl ACN. Third, 50\u00a0\u03bcl ACN were added to fully dehydrate the gel pieces. The three supernatants containing the peptides were pooled and dried in vacuum centrifuge (Thermo Scientific). Dried peptides were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until submitted to LC\u2010MS.The extracted peptides initially were dissolved in 20\u00a0\u03bcl 3% ACN/1% [v/v] FA by vortexing and brief sonication on water bath. For each MS run, 5\u00a0\u00b5l was loaded onto an in\u2010house packed C18 trap column. Retained peptides were eluted and separated on an analytical C18 capillary column at a flow rate of 300\u00a0nl/min with a gradient from 5 to 37% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid for 50\u00a0min including column equilibrium and wash by using an Agilent 1100 nano\u2010flow LC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Agilent 1100 nano\u2010flow LC was coupled to LTQ\u2010Orbitrap XL (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany), and it was operated in a data\u2010dependent mode. The survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap (m/z 350\u20131,600) with a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400 with a target value of 106. For up to five of the most intense ions with charges \u2264\u00a02 from the survey scan were sequentially selected for collision\u2010induced dissociation (CID) in the LTQ linear ion trap with a normalized collision energy of 35%.MaxQuant software and the Mascot search engine were used for analysis of raw MS files from the LTQ\u2010Orbitrap XL. Quant.exe module of MaxQuant generated the peak lists were searched against the International Protein Index human protein database common contaminants (e.g. keratins, serum albumin) and concatenated with the reverse sequences of all entries. Database (Mascot) search parameters were set as: Cysteine carbamidomethylation was as a fixed modification, whereas methionine oxidation and N\u2010terminal protein acetylation were as variable modifications; tryptic specificity with no proline restriction and up to two missed cleavages was set. The MS survey scans and MS/MS mass tolerance were set 7\u00a0ppm and 0.5\u00a0Da, respectively. A minimal length of six amino acids was considered for identification. The false discovery rate was set to 1% at both the peptide and the protein level. For identification and quantification, a posterior error probability (PEP) of peptides was required to be at maximum 0.05. Re\u2010quantify was enabled, and \u201ckeep low scoring versions of identified peptides\u201d was disabled. A minimum ratio count of one for each protein was required for quantification of SILAC pairs by considering unique and razor peptides.In total, this large\u2010scale SILAC/SUMO\u2010IP/Mass spectrometry experiment was done three times, once where \u201cno EGF\u201d was labeled \u201clight\u201d and \u201c10\u2010min EGF treatment\u201d was labeled \u201cheavy\u201d, and twice vice versa. We used very stringent criteria to obtain the final list of hits: First, all contaminants and reverse sequences, as well as proteins with a \u201cSigB\u201d (calculated by MaxQuant) >\u00a00.05, were removed. Second, only proteins that had a ratio count of 4 or higher were used. Third, proteins that were only identified in one of the tree experiments, or that showed a different behavior in one of the experiments, were removed. Fourth, if a protein was identified in two of the three experiments, it was neglected if the ratio difference was larger than 10\u2010fold. Fifth, a ratio variability larger than 80 percent was not allowed.Immunofluorescence24\u201348\u00a0h after siRNA transfection cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. Cells were fixed 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized for 15\u00a0min in 0.1% Triton X\u2010100. Cells were blocked for 60\u00a0min in blocking buffer (1% BSA in 0.1% Triton X\u2010100). Afterward, cells were incubated for primary antibodies (1:200 for IRF2BP1 antibody, Proteintech) in a wet chamber for 2\u00a0h. After washing, primary antibodies were labeled with Alexa\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies for 1\u00a0h in the dark in a wet chamber. Hoechst was included with the secondary antibody to stain DNA. All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. Images were taken using Axio Observer Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera and a Plan\u2010APOCHROMAT 63\u00d7/1.4 Oil DIC objective. Background subtraction and image brightness and contrast were adjusted equally using ImageJ.Chromatin bindingHeLa cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was lysed with 5\u00d7 pellet volume (PV) of ice\u2010cold cytoplasmic extract (CE) buffer (10\u00a0mM HEPES, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 60\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM Pefa, 0.075% NP40, and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin, pH 7.6) and incubated on ice for 3\u00a0min. Cell lysis was controlled by trypan blue staining for an efficiency of at least 70%. The sample was centrifuged at 1,500\u00a0g for 4\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and the cytoplasmic extract (CE) was transferred to a fresh tube. The nuclear pellet was gently washed with 3xPV ice\u2010cold wash buffer (CE buffer without NP40) by pipetting up and down and centrifuged at 1,500\u00a0g for 4\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was incubated with 2xPV ice\u2010cold nuclear extract (NE) buffer (varying concentrations of NaCl, 20\u00a0mM HEPES, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.2\u00a0mM EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM Pefa, and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, pH 7.9) and incubated on ice for 10\u00a0min, and the sample was vortexed periodically to re\u2010suspend the pellet. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 1,500\u00a0g for 4\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and the nuclear extract was transferred to a fresh tube. This step was done first with 170\u00a0mM NaCl (NE170\u00a0mM buffer) and repeated with the new nuclear pellet and NE290\u00a0mM and NE420\u00a0mM buffers. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Author contributionsSVB, NS\u2010V, and FM conceptualized the study.
