{"title": "In vitro transcription of adenovirus", "pubDate": "1981", "PMCID": "PMC256682", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.40.3.703-719.1981", "PMID": "7321101", "abstract": "A series of recombinants of adenovirus DNA fragments and pBR322 was used to test the transcriptional activity of the nine known adenovirus promoters in a cell-free extract. Specific initiation was seen at all five early promoters as well as at the major late promotor and at the intermediate promoter for polypeptide IX. The system failed to recognize the two other adenovirus promoters, which were prominent in vivo only at intermediate and late stages in infection. Microheterogeneity of 5' termini at several adenovirus promoters, previously shown in vivo, was reproduced in the in vitro reaction and indeed appeared to result from heterogeneous initiation rather than 5' processing. To test for the presence of soluble factors involved in regulation of nRNA synthesis, the activity of extracts prepared from early and late stages of infection was compared on an assortment of viral promoter sites. Although mock and early extracts showed identical transcription patterns, extracts prepared from late stages gave 5- to 10-fold relative enhancement of the late and polypeptide IX promoters as compared with early promoters.", "author": [{"author": "A Fire", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Fire+A&cauthor_id=7321101"}, {"author": "C C Baker", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Baker+CC&cauthor_id=7321101"}, {"author": "J L Manley", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Manley+JL&cauthor_id=7321101"}, {"author": "E B Ziff", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ziff+EB&cauthor_id=7321101"}, {"author": "P A Sharp", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Sharp+PA&cauthor_id=7321101"}], "refPMID": ["5325727", "6927849", "729003", "744489", "478297", "478299", "487437", "498279", "227610", "264242", "529286", "537065", "6985473", "6929494", "7383157", "6248533", "7407913", "6250944", "6251548", "6252477", "6933037", "6933038", "6253153", "6253158", "6253660", "6255460", "6256354", "7460018", "7207591", "6259538", "6259539", "6938951", "6938957", "6262775", "6262780", "6262784", "6262796", "6264425", "1017010"], "citedInPMID": ["7321101", "7143576", "6834470", "6834469", "6828386", "6828378", "6717442", "6593702", "6583493", "6514578", "6314273", "6304717", "6292845", "6083549", "4009788", "3863127", "3806795", "3785199", "3720730", "3614200", "3367909", "3302945", "3021995", "2989786", "2985959", "2983114", "2968498", "2942942", "2839684", "2677669", "2579322", "2527315", "2524383", "1549117"], "body": ""}
