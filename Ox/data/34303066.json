{"title": "Defining R-loop classes and their contributions to genome instability", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.dnarep.2021.103182", "PMID": "34303066", "abstract": "R-loops are non-B DNA structures that form during transcription when the nascent RNA anneals to the template DNA strand forming a RNA:DNA hybrid. Understanding the genomic distribution and function of R-loops is an important goal, since R-loops have been implicated in a number of adaptive and maladaptive processes under physiological and pathological conditions. Based on R-loop mapping datasets, we propose the existence of two main classes of R-loops, each associated with unique characteristics. Promoter-paused R-loops (Class I) are short R-loops that form at high frequency during promoter-proximal pausing by RNA polymerase II. Elongation-associated R-loops (Class II) are long structures that occur throughout gene bodies at modest frequencies. We further discuss the relationships between each R-loop class with instances of genome instability and suggest that increased class I R-loops, resulting from enhanced promoter-proximal pausing, represent the main culprits for R-loop mediated genome instability under pathological conditions.", "author": [{"author": "Daisy Castillo-Guzman", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, 95616, United States."], "href": "/?term=Castillo-Guzman+D&cauthor_id=34303066"}, {"author": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ch\u00e9din", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, 95616, United States.
