Since transcriptional regulation by ncRNA is critically important in developmental process and diseases, clarification of the principles ensuring the locus-specific chromatin regulation is of great interest. Here, we found that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ser7 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII is involved in locus-specific siRNA amplification within heterochromatin and facilitates heterochromatin formation. Ser7 and a chromodomain protein Chp1, which binds to H3K9 methylation and RNAs, cooperatively promote chromatin retention of the nascent heterochromatic RNAs (hRNAs) across heterochromatin.

The molecular basis of this retention remains unknown. We show that in fission yeast serine 7 (Ser7) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII is required for efficient siRNA generation for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation. Surprisingly, Ser7 facilitates chromatin retention of nascent heterochromatic RNAs (hRNAs). Chromatin retention of hRNAs and siRNA generation requires both Ser7 and an RNA-binding activity of the chromodomain of Chp1, a subunit of the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex. Furthermore, RITS associates with RNAPII in a Ser7-dependent manner. We propose that Ser7 promotes cotranscriptional chromatin retention of hRNA by recruiting the RNA-chromatin connector protein Chp1, which facilitates RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation. Our findings reveal a function of the CTD code: linking ncRNA transcription to RNAi for heterochromatin formation. Eukaryotic genomes encode large numbers of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Some of these ncRNAs regulate gene expression by recruiting activating or repressive epigenetic modifiers, that is, histone modification enzymes and DNA methyltransferases (1). In this situation, ncRNAs are retained on chromatin at specific target loci where they act as scaffolds for the epigenetic modifiers. Since transcriptional regulation by ncRNAs is critically important in developmental processes and diseases, clarification of the principles ensuring locus-specific chromatin regulation by ncRNA is an area of great interest. In this respect, heterochromatin formation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a well-studied example. Transcription within pericentromeric repeats dg and dh is strictly repressed by heterochromatin characterized by H3K9 methylation and HP1 enrichment (2, 3). Meanwhile, RNAPII generates heterochromatic RNAs (hRNAs) as ncRNAs by transcribing the repeats bidirectionally at low level, which induces heterochromatin formation through the RNAi machinery (4\u20136).The initial step of heterochromatin formation consists in the generation of dsRNA by hybridization with anti-sense transcripts and/or the formation of hairpin structures, which are directly processed into primary siRNAs by Dicer (Dcr1) (7, 8). The primary siRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex, which contains the Argonaute protein Ago1, the chromodomain protein Chp1, and the WG/GW motif protein Tas3 (9). siRNA sequence complementarity mediates targeting of RITS to nascent hRNAs.RITS acts as the hub of a protein complex that contributes to H3K9 methylation and secondary siRNA amplification. RITS interacts with the Clr4\u2013Rik1\u2013Cul4 (CLRC) complex via the LIM domain protein Stc1 (10). Clr4 deposits H3K9 methylation across pericentromeric repeats, and H3K9 methylation in turn serves as a platform for the HP1 proteins Swi6 and Chp2. RITS also interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) on heterochromatin which synthesizes dsRNA from hRNA (11). This dsRNA synthesis is coupled with secondary siRNA generation by Dcr1 around the nuclear periphery (11\u201314). In addition, H3K9 methylation is recognized by RITS via the Chp1 chromodomain (Chp1-CD), which is required for secondary siRNA amplification (15, 16). Therefore, H3K9 methylation and secondary siRNA amplification promote each other via RITS in a mutually dependent manner, forming a positive-feedback loop that assures maintenance of heterochromatin.We showed previously that hRNAs in S. pombe are retained on chromatin (17) where hRNAs seem to act cotranscriptionally as a scaffold for RNAi machinery. However, the mechanistic details and the functions of this chromatin retention remain unknown. Since the similar RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation is found in multiple species [e.g., in Arabidopsis thaliana, Neurospora crassa, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mammals (18)], the underlying mechanisms coordinating transcription of hRNAs and RNAi should be investigated.The largest subunit of RNAPII, Rpb1 contains evolutionarily conserved heptapeptide repetitive sequences (Tyr1\u2013Ser2\u2013Pro3\u2013Thr4\u2013Ser5\u2013Pro6\u2013Ser7) in its C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTDs of fission yeast, budding yeast, and mammals consist of 29, 26, and 52 repeats, respectively. The CTD is highly phosphorylated during transcription. The patterns of phosphorylation, glycosylation, isomerization, and the unmodified state of each residue, collectively referred to as the \u201cCTD code,\u201d are deciphered by various interacting proteins to regulate transcription and cotranscriptional events such as activating histone modifications and nascent RNA processing (19, 20).Among various elements of the CTD code, the unphosphorylated state at Ser2 and Ser5 is required for preinitiation complex formation (21\u201323) and mediator recruitment at the promoter (24, 25). Phosphorylation at Ser5 (Ser5P) is a mark of transcription initiation, and phosphorylation at Ser2 (Ser2P) is a mark of transcription elongation and termination (19, 20). Phosphorylation at Ser7 promotes snRNA transcription by recruiting Integrator and RPAP2 at promoters in mammals (26, 27). P-TEFb/Cdk9 (28, 29), Cdk12 (30), and Cdk13 (31) predominantly phosphorylate the Ser7 prephosphorylated CTD. In S. pombe, Ser7 mutations in the truncated CTD alter gene expression of phosphate homeostasis (32, 33) and subtelomeric genes (34). However, with respect to cotranscriptional RNA processing of hRNAs, it has remained elusive whether the CTD codes are involved in RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation.Despite the importance of CTD codes, technical difficulties (i.e., high-copy-number repetitive units, substrate specificity of CTD kinases, and redundant phosphorylation by several kinases) have precluded a comprehensive analysis of each residue (35\u201337). Complicating matters further, CTD kinases phosphorylate and regulate each other (38\u201341). In this study, to manifest the functions of each residue, we used alanine-substitution mutants of CTD, which not only function as nonphosphorylated acceptor mutations but also perturb the unphosphorylated state. Consequently, we found that Ser2 and Ser7 are responsible for the repression of pericentromeric ncRNA expression. Ser2 played an important role in gene silencing, independently of heterochromatin structure, whereas Ser7 was required for siRNA generation and H3K9 methylation across pericentromeric heterochromatin. Interestingly, Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD cooperatively promoted chromatin retention of nascent hRNAs and facilitated efficient secondary siRNA amplification. The cooperation was ensured by a Ser7-dependent association between RNAPII and RITS. Our findings reveal a mode of coupling between the CTD codes and histone codes. ResultsMutations at Ser2 and Ser7 of CTD Cause Loss of Pericentromeric Silencing. The RNAPII-CTD of fission yeast contains 29 heptapeptide repeats. To investigate the function of each residue of CTD at Ser2 and Ser7, full-length mutants have been generated in which Ser2 or Ser7 in all heptads are replaced by alanine, which abrogates both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states (ctdS2A and ctdS7A) (Fig. 1A) (42, 43). In addition to ctdS2A and ctdS7A mutants, we used the rpb1-11 mutant, which encodes a protein with a short CTD containing only 16 repeats (Fig. 1A). First, we tested the expression level of ade6+ inserted into the outer repeat of pericentromeric repeats (otr::ade6+) (Fig. 1B). Repression of otr::ade6+ by heterochromatin in the wild type resulted in inhibited adenine biosynthesis, resulting in the formation of red colonies on medium containing a limiting amount of adenine (low-adenine condition). By contrast, heterochromatin mutants, such as clr4\u2206, dcr1\u2206, and rpb2-m203, formed white or pink colonies on low-adenine plates (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A). All the RNAPII mutants produced a mixture of red, pink, and white colonies with the exception of the rpb1-11 mutant (Fig. S1A). The variegated phenotype indicated that the silent and active states were metastable in the ctdS2A and ctdS7Amutants. Note that all the RNAPII mutants proliferated almost normally under standard vegetative growth conditions (Fig. 1C). To obtain unambiguous results, white clones derived from each mutant were used in subsequent analyses. qRT-PCR of ctdS2A and ctdS7A mutants confirmed the accumulation of hRNAs bidirectionally transcribed from dh pericentromeric repeats and forward transcripts of otr::ade6+ (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1B).Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Unphosphorylatable mutations of CTD Ser2 and Ser7 cause loss of pericentromeric silencing. (A) Amino acid sequences of the CTD in the wild type and mutants. (B) Schematic representation of the pericentromeric regions of the strains used in the silencing assay. The ade6+ gene was inserted into the dg repeat in the outermost repeats (otr) on the right side of the pericentromeric region of chromosome I (otr::ade6+).

Error bars indicate the SEM from three biologically independent experiments. (E) Scatter plot comparing gene expression in ctdS2A, ctdS7A, or dcr1\u0394 cells with that in the wild-type cells. Blue rhombuses indicate expression levels of all transcripts, and red squares indicate expression levels of pericentromeric ncRNA, calculated as the log2 ratio.Global Expression Profiles of Mutants of CTD Ser2 and Ser7. To characterize the global gene-expression profiles in ctdS2A or ctdS7A mutant cells, we compared the level of the microarray signal of each transcript in the CTD mutants with the corresponding signal in the wild-type cells. We found that ctdS2A affects the expression of a subset of genes, including meiotic genes and antisense RNAs, as previously described (42). Similarly, ctdS7A caused change in a limited number of genes (Table S1), including stress-response genes. In agreement with these results, ctdS2A and ctdS7A cells did not show obvious growth defects on a nonselective (N/S) plate (Fig. 1C). As expected from the results shown in Fig. 1 C and D, genes that were up-regulated more than in fourfold each mutant included a large population of pericentromeric ncRNAs (Table S1). The scatter plots comparing each mutant with the wild-type cells revealed that expression levels of some, but not all, pericentromeric ncRNAs were markedly up-regulated in ctdS2A (four- to eightfold) or ctdS7A (four- to 13-fold) cells (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that both Ser2 and Ser7 are required for strict repression of pericentromeric ncRNAs.Because previous studies revealed that the RNAi machinery represses the expression of pericentromeric ncRNAs, we compared the transcriptome in ctdS2A and ctdS7A cells with that of dcr1\u2206 cells. Comparison by Venn diagrams and scatter plots showed that changes in gene expression in dcr1\u2206 cells were more similar to those in ctdS7A cells than to those in ctdS2A cells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1C and Table S1). These data suggested that Ser7 and Dcr1 silence pericentromeric ncRNAs via the same pathway. Only a small number of genes related to heterochromatic silencing exhibited more than twofold changes in expression in the ctdS2A or ctdS7A mutants (4 and 3 of 115 genes, respectively) (Table S2). Particularly, ctdS7A mutation did not reduce the expression of genes participating in heterochromatic silencing. Hence, it is unlikely that the CTD mutants impair heterochromatic silencing by affecting the expression of heterochromatic genes.CTD Ser2 and Ser7 Play Distinct Roles for Pericentromeric Silencing. To assess the chromatin state around pericentromeric ncRNA genes in ctdS2A and ctdS7A cells, we used ChIP assays to estimate the levels of repressive epigenetic marks: H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), and the HP1 family protein Swi6 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1D). The truncated CTD mutant rpb1-11 did not exhibit a remarkable reduction in H3K9me2 deposition or Swi6 localization at either dh or otr::ade6+, except for a slight reduction of H3K9me3 at dh (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1D), indicating that the first 16 heptads are sufficient to form the heterochromatin structure. Similarly, the ctdS2A mutation did not affect the enrichment of repressive epigenetic marks at dh repeats, although it moderately decreased them at otr::ade6+ (Fig. 2 A and B and Fig. S1D). Rik1, a component of the CLRC methyltransferase complex, accumulated at high levels at dh and slightly decreased levels at otr::ade6+ (Fig. S1E), indicating that almost the complete heterochromatin structure was retained in ctdS2A mutant. On this basis, we concluded that Ser2 does not contribute to the formation of heterochromatin structure. Meanwhile, activating histone modifications found on euchromatin, such as H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), and H3K14 acetylation (H3K14Ac) were obviously elevated at otr::ade6+ (Fig. S2), which might be related to a loss of silencing that is independent of heterochromatin structure.Open in a separate windowFig. 2.CTD Ser7 is required for heterochromatin formation via efficient generation of siRNA. (A and B) ChIP assay of H3K9me2 and Swi6 (A) and Chp1-13Myc (B). H3K9me2, Swi6, and Chp1 were precipitated, and the associated DNAs were quantified by qPCR.

(Lower) Western blot of Input and immunoprecipitated Ago1 using anti-FLAG antibody. (D) ChIP assay of Ago1. 3FLAG-Ago1 was immunoprecipitated, and the associated DNAs were quantified by qPCR. Details of qPCR are identical to A. (E) RIP assay of Rdp1. Rdp1-13Myc was immunoprecipitated, and the associated RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Primers for cDNA synthesis were gene-specific reverse-strand primers. Primer pairs for qPCR were site-specific primers for dh, otr::ade6+ at the pericentromere, and act1+. RIP signals of each strain are presented as percent input. RIP signals of act1+ are the negative control. Error bars indicate the SEM from three independent experiments.In contrast to ctdS2A, ctdS7A mutation caused impairment of heterochromatin formation. In ctdS7A cells, levels of H3K9me2/3 and Swi6 were reduced (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1D): On dh repeats, they decreased by \u223c50%, while at otr::ade6+, they were markedly diminished, nearly to the same extent as in clr4\u2206 and dcr1\u2206 cells (Fig. 2 A and B and Fig. S1 D and E). Residual H3K9me2 on dh repeats is likely to be a common feature of RNAi mutants such as dcr1\u2206 (10, 44). In accordance with the decrease in repressive histone modifications in ctdS7A cells, levels of activating histone modifications such as H3K4 methylation and histone acetylations were significantly elevated at both dh and otr::ade6+ (Fig. S2). In particular, obvious hyperacetylation occurred at dh in ctdS7A cells. These phenotypes of ctdS7A cells were quite similar to those of dcr1\u2206 cells. Since Ser7 is involved in heterochromatin formation, we focused on the function of Ser7 in subsequent experiments.Ser7 Is Required for Heterochromatin Formation via Efficient siRNA Generation. The similarity of the phenotypes in ctdS7A and dcr1\u2206 mutants suggested that Ser7 is involved in siRNA generation for heterochromatin formation. To test this, we next analyzed Ago1-bound mature siRNAs derived from pericentromeric ncRNAs by Northern blotting (Fig. 2C). In Ago1 complex purified from wild-type, rpb1-11, and ctdS2A cells, dg/dh siRNAs were clearly detected at comparable signal intensities. However, siRNA signal was not detected in clr4\u2206, dcr1\u2206, and ctdS7A cells, indicating that siRNA generation was impaired in ctdS7A cells. Furthermore, ChIP and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments revealed that RNAi machineries, such as Chp1, Ago1, and Rdp1, were not properly assembled at pericentromeric heterochromatin in ctdS7A cells, as well as in dcr1\u2206 cells (Fig. 2 B, D, and E). These results suggest that Ser7 is required for proper assembly of RNAi machineries at pericentromeric repeats for siRNA generation.Truncated CTD Mutation Rescues the Defect in siRNA Generation in ctdS7A-Mutant Cells. We next questioned whether the defects of ctdS7A are due to the loss of phosphorylation at Ser7. To explore this, we tried to use phospho-mimetic mutants in which Ser7 was replaced with either glutamic acid (ctdS7E) or aspartic acid (ctdS7D), but we failed to construct the full-length mutants even in diploid cells. This suggested that the constitutive hyperphosphorylation is toxic to cells and that the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser7 is important, as reported in budding yeast and mammalian cells (45, 46). Since it was reported that in fission yeast the truncated mutant with 18 repeats of ctdS7E (ctdS7Ex18) was viable (47), we first examined the heterochromatin defects and siRNA generation in truncated-CTD mutant (ctdwtx18) cells and truncated-ctdS7A mutant (ctdS7Ax18) cells.Similar to rpb1-11 cells, ctdwtx18 cells did not show any marked reduction of H3K9 methylation at either dh or otr::ade6+ (Fig. S3A). Interestingly, in contrast to the full-length ctdS7A cells, the truncated ctdS7Ax18 cells retained a substantial amount of H3K9me2/3 at both the dh and otr::ade6+ regions (Fig. S3A) (34). On the other hand, ctdwtx18 dcr1\u2206 and ctdS7Ax18 dcr1\u2206 double-mutant cells showed a marked reduction of H3K9me2/3at dh and otr::ade6+ nearly comparable to the level in dcr1\u2206 cells (Fig. S3A). Consistent with the ChIP assay, dg/dh siRNAs were detected in ctdS7Ax18, while the siRNAs were hardly detected in full-length mutant ctdS7A cells (Fig. S3B). These observations indicated that truncation of CTD suppresses the failure in siRNA generation and heterochromatin formation seen in a full-length ctdS7A mutant. The difference in H3K9 methylation in ctdS7A between our data (Fig. 2A) and previously reported data (34) is most likely due to the length of the CTD repeats, reinforcing the notion that truncated CTD mutants should be used with caution (43) and that they are inappropriate for analyzing the function of Ser7. Hereafter, we analyze the function of Ser7 using full-length CTD mutants.Ser7 Enables Stable Binding of hRNA to Chp1. All the data shown above strongly suggested that the ctdS7A mutation abrogated pericentromeric heterochromatin formation by disturbing siRNA generation. Since siRNA generation and heterochromatin formation at pericentromeric repeats are mutually dependent, it is difficult to determine whether the defects in siRNA generation observed in ctdS7A cells were a direct consequence of the mutation or a secondary effect of the loss of heterochromatin due to the mutation. Because two redundant pathways, RNAi and Atf1/Pcr1, establish heterochromatin at the mating-type locus (48), heterochromatin structure is preserved even in siRNA-deficient cells. Therefore, we decided to investigate the function of Ser7 at the mating-type locus and constructed strains in which a ura4+ reporter gene was inserted into the K region of the mating-type locus (Kint2::ura4+) (Fig. 3A). A silencing assay, qRT-PCR, and ChIP for H3, H3K9me2, and Chp1 confirmed that heterochromatin and the silencing state at the Kint2::ura4+ locus were not defective in ctdS7A and dcr1\u2206 cells (Fig. S4), supporting our assumption that Ser7 functions in the RNAi pathway.Open in a separate windowFig. 3.CTD Ser7 and RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD cooperatively ensure chromatin retention of hRNA. (A) Schematic diagram showing heterochromatin at the mating-type locus. The ura4+ gene was inserted into a dg-like sequence of the K region. The small bar indicates the position of the primer set used for qRT-PCR, ChIP-qPCR, and RIP-qPCR. (B) RIP assay for Chp1 evaluating the association between Kint2::ura4+ RNA and Chp1. Chp1 was immunoprecipitated, and the associated RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR as in Fig. 2E using site-specific primers for Kint2::ura4+. Error bars indicate the SEM from three biologically independent experiments. (C) Stability of the variegated phenotype of otr::ade6+ silencing. White and red colonies were picked and restreaked onto low-adenine plates, and colonies with the indicated colors were counted in the indicated strains. (D and E) RIP assay for histone H3 showing that RNA transcribed from Kint2::ura4+ associates with histone H3. Histone H3 was immunoprecipitated, and the associated RNAs were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Details of qRT-PCR are identical to those in B.As RITS targeting to nascent hRNAs is critical for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation, we next evaluated the interaction of hRNAs (Kint2::ura4+ transcript) and euchromatic RNAs (act1+ transcripts) with Chp1 by RIP analysis. In wild-type and even in dcr1\u2206 cells, Chp1 captured significant levels of Kint2::ura4+ RNAs but not act1+ RNAs (Fig. 3B). By contrast, in clr4\u2206 cells, Kint2::ura4+ transcripts were no longer captured by Chp1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that the interaction between hRNA and Chp1 does not depend on siRNA generation but does depend on H3K9 methylation, which may provide a scaffold for Chp1 to capture nascent hRNAs on chromatin. Interestingly, the amount of Kint2::ura4+ transcripts captured by Chp1 was threefold lower in ctdS7A cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B), despite the substantial enrichment of Chp1 at Kint2::ura4+ in this mutant (Fig. S4E). These findings indicated that Ser7 plays a crucial role in the capture of hRNAs by RITS. Note that small amounts of signals specifically found in heterochromatic Kint2::ura4+ transcripts in the absence of reverse transcriptase (Fig. 3B; RT\u2212) are derived from the DNA/RNA hybrid structure and were significantly decreased when samples were treated with RNase H (17).Previous work showed that Chp1-CD not only is a reader of H3K9 methylation but also has a unique RNA-binding activity that is critical for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation at pericentromeric repeats (16). Since we speculated that the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD is involved in the Ser7-dependent capture of hRNA by RITS, we used the chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutant that specifically loses the ability to interact with RNA (16). We first realized the phenotypic similarity between ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutants in terms of the silencing at otr::ade6+; the chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells as well as ctdS7A cells showed the variegated phenotype of otr::ade6+ gene expression on low-adenine plates (Fig. 3C and Fig. S5 A and B). The frequencies of the appearance of red, pink, or white colonies in chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells and ctdS7A cells in the absence of any selection (Fig. S5B) and after isolation of white or red clones (Fig. 3C) were quite similar, suggesting that ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutants have similar silencing defects. In agreement with this, patterns of H3K9me2 in chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells and in ctdS7A cells were nearly comparable (Fig. S5C). Hereafter, we used white clones of the chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutant for further analyses.Next, we analyzed the effect of the chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutation on the capture of hRNA by RITS. Remarkably, the chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutation reduced the interaction between Chp1 and Kint2::ura4+ transcripts to the same extent as the ctdS7A mutation (Fig. 3B). In the ctdS7A chp1-\u03b1mut1 double mutant, the Chp1 RIP signal of Kint2::ura4+ transcripts was comparable to the signal in either single mutant (Fig. 3B). This result suggested that Ser7 is required for the capture of hRNA by RITS via the RNA-binding surface of Chp1-CD. These results support the notion that Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD act in the RITS\u2013hRNA interaction.Ser7 and the RNA-Binding Activity of Chp1-CD Ensure Chromatin Retention of hRNA. In S. pombe, hRNAs that induce RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation should be retained at specific locations on heterochromatin to exert their function. We previously showed that hRNAs of S. pombe are indeed retained on heterochromatin (17). In addition, we showed that Ser7 is required for siRNA generation (Fig. 2C) and promotes the interaction between hRNA and Chp1-CD (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the bivalent function of Chp1-CD in H3K9 methylation binding and RNA binding implies that Chp1-CD connects hRNAs with heterochromatin structure. In this respect, we hypothesized that Ser7 mediates chromatin retention of nascent hRNAs, in cooperation with the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD, to stimulate the generation of siRNAs on chromatin.To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutants on the chromatin retention of heterochromatic Kint2::ura4+ transcripts by histone H3 RIP analysis (17). H3 RIP signals in both ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells, which reflect the amount of chromatin retained by Kint2::ura4+ transcripts, declined by approximately fourfold relative to the wild type cells, suggesting that Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD play critical roles in proper chromatin retention of hRNAs (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the ctdS7A chp1-\u03b1mut1 double mutant also exhibited marked reduction to a level similar to that of either single mutation alone (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD play important role(s) in ensuring chromatin retention of hRNAs (Fig. 3 B and D). Note that the reduction of the H3 RIP signal in ctdS7A cells is due to a decrease in the chromatin retention of Kint2::ura4+ transcripts but is not due to an increase of total transcripts, because the Kint2::ura4+ transcript was repressed in ctdS7A cells to the same level as in wild-type and dcr1\u2206 cells (Fig. S4B). In the H3-RIP assay, a significant amount of RNA bound to H3 in dcr1\u2206 cells in which no siRNA were formed. In ctdS7A cells and chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells, the amount of H3-bound RNA was much lower than that in dcr1\u2206 cells, indicating that low siRNA was not the reason for the defects in chromatin retention by Kint2::ura4+ RNA in these mutants (Fig. 3 D and E). By contrast, clr4\u2206 severely impaired the chromatin retention of hRNA (Fig. 3E), indicating that H3K9 methylation is essential for stable chromatin retention of hRNA. Given the interaction between Chp1-CD and H3K9 methylation, chromatin retention seems to assure maintenance of heterochromatin by the generation of activated siRNA once a locus had been established.As in ctdS7A cells, the RITS mutants ago1\u2206, chp1\u2206, and tas3\u2206 and stc1\u2206 cells also exhibited reduced H3 RIP signals (about fourfold lower than the wild-type level) (Fig. 3E), suggesting that an intact RITS complex mediates the chromatin retention of hRNA although siRNA is not required for the retention.Dcr1 Overexpression Rescues Primary siRNA Generation in ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1. The initial step in heterochromatin formation is the generation of primary siRNA from the intrinsic hairpin structure of the 5\u2032 region of dg/dh RNAs and/or annealed bidirectional dg/dh transcripts. Subsequently, the RITS\u2013RDRC\u2013Dcr1 interaction promotes the secondary siRNA amplification (12). Regarding the primary siRNA biogenesis, others (49, 50) and we (14) previously indicated that overexpression of dcr1+ in mutant cells lacking RITS, RDRC, or CLRC caused marked siRNA generation (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6B), indicating that Dcr1 can produce primary siRNA without RITS, RDRC, or CLRC. Next, we investigated whether Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD affect this Dcr1-depenndent primary siRNA generation. We performed dcr1+ overexpression under the control of the urg1 promoter (Fig. S6A) in various mutants, including ctdS7A. In clr4\u2206 cells, substantial restoration of pericentromeric siRNA generation (to nearly wild-type levels) was observed, showing that H3K9 methylation is not required for primary siRNA biogenesis (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6B). In ctdS7A cells, dcr1+ overexpression resulted in significant recovery of pericentromeric siRNA generation (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6B), showing that ctdS7A cells can still generate Dcr1-dependent primary siRNAs. Similar recovery of siRNA synthesis was also observed in ago1\u2206 and chp1\u2206 cells. Note that dcr1+ overexpression promoted more efficient secondary siRNA amplification in ctdS7A, ago1\u2206, and chp1\u2206 cells than in rdp1\u2206 cells. This may indicate that dcr1+ overexpression stimulates the production of dsRNA in these mutants, probably by the enhanced catalytic activity of Rdp1 due to the increased interaction between Dcr1 and the RDRC (12).Open in a separate windowFig. 4.Mutation at Ser7 and RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD was rescued by dcr1+ overexpression.

Untrimmed raw data of A are shown in Fig. S6B. (B and D) ChIP assays showing H3K9me2 levels in the indicated mutants in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of dcr1+ overexpression (dcr1-o/e) at otr::ade6+ in RNAi mutants (B) and chp1+ mutants (D). Details are identical to those in Fig. 2A. Error bars indicate the SEM from three biologically independent experiments.Next, we examined whether siRNA recovery upon dcr1+ overexpression would be sufficient to promote H3K9 methylation. In rdp1\u2206 cells, dcr1+ overexpression resulted in a slight accumulation of H3K9me2 at otr::ade6+ (Fig. 4B), reflecting the small amount of siRNA produced by dcr1+ overexpression. By contrast, in ago1\u2206 and chp1\u2206 cells, despite significant recovery of pericentromeric siRNAs upon dcr1+ overexpression, the level of H3K9me2 at otr::ade6+ was not elevated (Fig. 4B), indicating that the RITS complex is essential for siRNA-dependent deposition of H3K9me2. Unlike these RNAi mutants, ctdS7A cells exhibited striking deposition of H3K9me2 under dcr1+ overexpression, at levels comparable to that in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that under dcr1+ overexpression in ctdS7A cells, primary siRNA production by Dcr1 is sufficient for H3K9 methylation, and Ser7 is not essential for H3K9 methylation by Clr4 after primary siRNA production.To gain the further insight into the importance of chromatin retention of hRNA on siRNA generation, we measured the amount of siRNAs in ctdS7A, chp1\u2206, and chp1-\u03b1mut1 single mutants and in the ctdS7A chp1\u2206 and ctdS7A chp1-\u03b1mut1 double mutants. With dcr1+ overexpression, siRNA production in each single mutant was restored to the wild-type levels (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the ctdS7A chp1-\u03b1mut1 double mutants generated smaller amounts of siRNAs with dcr1+ overexpression than did the single mutants (Fig. 4C), which is contrary to the results of the Chp1-RIP and H3 RIP assays; Ser7 and Chp1-CD appear to function in the same pathway for capture of hRNA by Chp1 and retention of hRNA on chromatin (Fig. 3 B and D). A similar reduction of siRNA was observed in the ctdS7A chp1\u2206 double mutant (Fig. 4C). These results revealed that Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD have redundant functions in Dcr1-dependent primary siRNA generation, probably in the step of Dcr1 loading on hRNAs.ChIP assays revealed that dcr1+ overexpression facilitates proper H3K9me2 deposition in ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the ctdS7A chp1-\u03b1mut1 double mutant exhibited moderate H3K9me2 deposition under dcr1+ overexpression, reflecting the low levels of recovered siRNAs (Fig. 4 C and D). These results suggest that Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD contribute to H3K9 methylation by redundantly facilitating efficient primary siRNA generation. By contrast, cells lacking chp1+ did not exhibit any restoration of H3K9me2 (Fig. 4B), confirming that an intact RITS complex is necessary to connect siRNA generation to H3K9 methylation, probably via the RITS\u2013CLRC interaction.Ser7 Facilitates Secondary siRNA Amplification. Next, to examine whether Ser7 is involved in secondary siRNA amplification, we designed an artificial siRNA generation system dissecting siRNA synthesis into Dcr1-dependent primary siRNA and RITS-mediated secondary siRNA (Fig. 5A). In brief, overexpression of dcr1+ supplies the primary siRNA from dg/dh repeats even in mutant cells. Insertion of three copies of the complemental sequence of the siRNA hotspot into the 3\u2032 UTR of ura4+ (ura4-3ERIS) promotes ectopic RITS targeting to the ura4-3ERIS transcripts, resulting in the generation of the secondary siRNA corresponding to ura4+. The silencing assay, H3K9me2 ChIP, and Northern blot indicated that in wild-type cells this system mediates heterochromatin formation at the ura4-3ERIS locus according to secondary siRNA production (Fig. 5 B\u2013D). On the other hand, ctdS7A cells as well as dcr1\u2206 and rdp1\u2206 cells could not form heterochromatin in this system (Fig. 5 B\u2013D). Northern blot analysis indicated that ctdS7A cells fail to produce the secondary siRNAs (ura4 siRNA) even though they produce substantial amounts of primary siRNA (Fig. 5C and Fig. S6C), indicating that Ser7 facilitates secondary siRNA amplification. Given that RITS complex directs secondary siRNA amplification via RITS\u2013RDRC\u2013Dcr1 interaction (11, 12) and Ser7 enhances RITS targeting to the nascent RNA (Fig. 3B), Ser7 would promote RITS targeting to ura4-3ERIS RNA. Notably, the secondary ura4 siRNA was not produced in clr4\u2206 cells, indicating that H3K9 methylation is important for the transition from primary siRNA to secondary siRNA.Open in a separate windowFig. 5.Ser7 promotes secondary siRNA amplification. (A) Schematic diagram of the artificial heterochromatin formation assay. Three copies of ERIS DNA sequences, which Dcr1-dependent primary siRNAs preferentially target, were inserted into the 3\u2032 UTR of endogenous ura4+ gene. To reinforce the primary siRNA generation, dcr1+ was overexpressed under the urg1+ promoter. The primary siRNA induces the secondary siRNA, which corresponds to the ura4+ sequence. (B) Silencing assay of the ura4-3ERIS experiment using the indicated strains. Silencing states of ura4+\nor ura4-3ERIS expression were monitored by viability on plates containing 0.2% of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Silencing states of otr::ade6+ were simultaneously monitored on low-adenine (Low Ade) plates. (C) ChIP assay showing H3K9me2 levels at ura4-ERIS in the indicated mutants in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of dcr1+ overexpression (dcr1-o/e). Details are identical to those in Fig. 2A. Error bars indicate the SEM from three biologically independent experiments. (D) Northern blot of the indicated strains in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of dcr1+ overexpression (dcr1-o/e). Details of the Northern blot were identical to those in Fig. 4A. Untrimmed raw data of D are shown in Fig. S6C.Ser7 Is Required for the Assembly of the RNAPII\u2013RITS Complex. The experiments described above showed cooperative roles for Ser7 and RITS, particularly in the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD. To explore the molecular basis of this cooperative function, we investigated an interaction between RNAPII and RITS by immunoaffinity purification. When we immunoprecipitated Ser2-, Ser5-, or Ser7-phosphorylated (Ser2P, Ser5P, and Ser7P) RNAPII with antibodies specifically recognizing each phosphorylated form of CTD (Fig. S7A), Chp1 was coimmunoprecipitated with each form (Fig. 6A). Note that immunoprecipitants with anti-Ser7P had the highest Chp1 signal (more than fivefold greater than the others). Moreover, Ago1 was also associated with the Ser7P form of RNAPII (Fig. 6A). Importantly, Chp1 and Ago1 signals were not detected in cells that express ctdS7A. These results suggested that RNAPII coimmunoprecipitates with RITS in a Ser7-dependent manner.Open in a separate windowFig. 6.Ser7 is required for the interaction between RNAPII and RITS. (A) Western blot analysis of Chp1-13Myc and Ago1 associated with RNAPII. Each phosphorylated form of the CTD was immunoprecipitated with anti-Ser2P, -Ser5P, and -Ser7P antibodies and then blotted with anti-Myc or anti-Ago1 antibodies. (B) Western blot analysis of Ser5P and Ago1 associated with Chp1-13Myc. Crude lysates were treated with (+) or without (\u2212) 300 U/mL Benzonase endonuclease in 2 mM Mg2+ for 30 min, and then Chp1-13Myc was immunoprecipitated. An asterisk indicates degradation products of Chp1-13Myc. (C) List of peptides identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. Magenta shading indicates silencing factors related to RNAi function. Blue shading indicates characterized silencing factors related to histone deposition. Yellow shading indicates silencing factors related to the IPI complex. (D) Western blot analysis of Ser2P associated with Chp1-13Myc in ctdS7A and chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutants.To confirm this result, we conversely immunoprecipitated Chp1. In addition, to determine whether the interaction was mediated by nucleic acid, we treated crude lysates with Benzonase endonuclease, which removes both DNA and RNA (Fig. S7B), and compared the CTD signals with those prepared in the absence of Benzonase. Consistent with the former experiment, RNAPII was associated with RITS (Fig. 6B). Following Benzonase treatment, the RNAPII signal was still detectable, albeit weaker, demonstrating that the RNAPII\u2013RITS assembly is partly dependent on nucleic acids. In light of our other findings, the indirect interaction appears to be mediated by RNAs retained on chromatin. Thus, the assembly of the RNAPII\u2013RITS complex and the chromatin retention of nascent hRNAs might mutually promote each other. LC-MS/MS analysis of Chp1-interacting proteins revealed that Chp1 is further associated with components of the transcription machinery, such as components of HIRA, FACT, Mot1, Spt5, and Spt6, whose interaction decreased in ctdS7A-mutant cells (Fig. 6D and Fig. S7C). Since these factors function with transcribing RNAPII, this result suggests that RNAPII\u2013RITS assembly occurs cotranscriptionally. Besides, Chp1 interacted with silencing factors related to histone deposition (51, 52) and the trimeric complex involved in processing of ITS2 (IPI complex) (53), implying that RITS composes multiple silencing complexes contributing to RNAi-dependent and -independent mechanisms.We next investigated whether the integrity of the RITS components could affect RNAPII\u2013RITS coimmunoprecipitation. RNAPII was immunoprecipitated with Chp1 in ago1\u2206 and stc1\u2206 cells as efficiently as in wild-type cells (Fig. S7D). By contrast, in tas3\u2206 cells, as in ctdS7A cells, RNAPII signals were indistinguishable from the background (chp1\u0394) (Fig. S7D). Because Tas3 interacts with Chp1 directly, independently of Ago1 (54), the Chp1\u2013Tas3 subcomplex is likely to be preferentially associated with RNAPII. Consistent with this, the chp1-\u03b1mut1 mutation did not severely affect the interaction between RNAPII and Chp1 (Fig. 6D), because the Chp1\u2013Tas3 subcomplex is maintained in chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells in vivo (16). In summary, Ser7 is required for the association between RNAPII and RITS (particularly Chp1), which cotranscriptionally ensures chromatin retention of hRNAs to facilitate RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation. DiscussionOur findings demonstrated that Ser2 and Ser7 of the RNAPII-CTD have novel but distinct CTD code functions in cotranscriptional gene silencing within heterochromatic regions. Ser2 is involved in heterochromatic silencing but does not participate in heterochromatin formation, while Ser7 is involved in RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation. The major findings of our study regarding the function of Ser7 are as follows: (i) Ser7 is critical for the efficient generation of siRNA, which directs subsequent RNAi-dependent heterochromatin formation; (ii) Ser7 ensures chromatin retention of nascent hRNAs redundantly with the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD; (iii) Ser7 directs RITS targeting to the nascent RNA, facilitating secondary siRNA amplification; (iv) Ser7 promotes assembly of the RNAPII\u2013RITS complex.Based on these findings, we propose a model of cotranscriptional chromatin retention of hRNA by CTD Ser7 and the RNA-binding activity of Chp1-CD for the secondary siRNA amplification (Fig. 7). First, the Ser7-dependent RNAPII\u2013RITS complex accompanied by transcription machineries is assembled, and subsequently hRNAs are transcribed by the RNAPII\u2013RITS complex (Fig. 7, step1). Second, the RNAPII-associated RITS cotranscriptionally captures nascent hRNAs through the RNA-binding motif of the Chp1-CD (Fig. 7, step 2). The interaction of Chp1-CD with H3K9 methylation further reinforces chromatin retention of hRNAs (Fig. 7, step 3). The retained hRNAs are likely to be a preferential target of siRNA-containing RITS (Fig. 7, step 4). Finally, hRNAs retained on chromatin provide scaffolds for the assembly of factors promoting secondary siRNA amplification (Fig. 7, step 5), and the following siRNA-dependent RITS\u2013CLRC interaction leads to locus-specific H3K9 methylation. Besides, once established, H3K9 methylation acts as storage of Chp1, enabling efficient formation of the RNAPII\u2013RITS complex at heterochromatin (Fig. 7, step 1). In addition, since H3K9 methylation enhances the association between Chp1-CD and RNAs (16), accelerated secondary siRNA amplification seems to occur only at heterochromatin, resulting in the maintenance of heterochromatin. In ctdS7A cells, RNAPII cannot form a complex with RITS, whereas in chp1-\u03b1mut1 cells, the Chp1-CD cannot capture the hRNAs even though the RNAPII\u2013RITS complex is assembled.Open in a separate windowFig. 7.Model of chromatin retention of hRNA mediated by Ser7, Chp1-CD, and the generation of siRNA in cis. The figure presents a stepwise explanation of Ser7 function in siRNA biogenesis at pericentromeric repeats. See text for details.Ser7 Links hRNA Transcription to Secondary siRNA Amplification. In our model, Ser7 facilitates heterochromatin formation by linking hRNA transcription to secondary siRNA amplification. The RNAPII\u2013RITS assembly and accompanying chromatin retention of hRNAs appear to occur cotranscriptionally, because we identified components of the transcription machinery as Ser7-dependent Chp1 interactors (Fig. 6C). The hRNAs captured by RITS on chromatin, in turn, may partly contribute to the protein\u2013protein interaction between RNAPII and RITS (Fig. 6B). The RNAPII\u2013RITS association presumably mediates the stable assembly of the RITS\u2013RDRC\u2013Dcr1\u2013hRNA complex in collaboration with a connector protein, Dsh1 (14). The hRNAs in the complex are close to Dcr1, thus achieving efficient secondary siRNA synthesis. In this way, Ser7 provides the molecular basis for linking hRNA transcription to secondary siRNA biogenesis on chromatin. Similar to the interaction between RNAPII and RITS in S. pombe, the interaction between RNAPII and Argonaute family proteins is evolutionally conserved in Homo sapiens (55), D. melanogaster (56), and A. thaliana (57). In A. thaliana, Pol V interacts with Argonaute proteins (58\u201360). Therefore, it would be worthwhile to test the effect of Ser7 on RNAi and heterochromatin formation in multiple species.Possible Mechanisms of Ser7 Residues. We revealed the important role of Ser7 in connecting RNAPII to RNAi. There are two possible mechanisms through which Ser7 itself (possibly in the unphosphorylated state) or phosphorylation at Ser7 is important for the function at this stage. Our observation that the Ser7P CTD associated efficiently with RITS (Fig. 6A) appears to support the importance of phosphorylation at Ser7. In addition, the inhibition of Cdk9 that would be responsible for Ser7 phosphorylation resulted in the loss of hRNA silencing and siRNA production (61). In mammals, besides Ser5, P-TEFb/Cdk9 phosphorylates Ser7 (31, 62). However, it is difficult to conclude that phosphorylation at Ser7 by Cdk9 is a single cause of recruiting RNAi factors, because Cdk9 is a multitarget kinase. Alternately, it is also possible that the amino acid residue Ser7 itself is crucial for the function. This possibility is supported by a recent observation in A. thaliana: An atypical RNAPII-like polymerase Pol V interacts with AGO4 via the CTD of the largest subunit of Pol V independently of CTD phosphorylation (58, 63).With respect to linking transcription to RNAi, the RITS complex may recognize Ser7 or Ser7P. Alternately, unknown factors (factor X in Fig. 7) may connect RNAPII to RITS in a Ser7-dependent manner. Importantly, the suppressive phenotypes of the truncated ctdS7Ax18 cells (Fig. S3 A and B) raise the possibility that Ser7 is not a direct binding target of RITS but changes the state of transcribing RNAPII to facilitate the RNAPII\u2013RITS interaction. Although there are many possible mechanisms for the interaction between RNAPII and RITS (particularly Chp1), the important notion in this study is that Ser7 mediates the association cotranscriptionally, which ultimately promotes the cotranscriptional formation of heterochromatin. Further biochemical analysis will reveal the role of Ser7 in the RNAPII\u2013RITS interaction. Materials and MethodsStrain Construction. S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table S3.
