Southern hybridizations of the fly genomic DNA, using as probe a plasmid containing only the coding region of the gene, shows that the fly contains at most three or four genes and very few related sequences for the small nuclear U1 RNA. These genes were localized by in situ hybridization at different chromosomal loci and show no spatial relationship to the U2 snRNA genes.", "author": [{"author": "A Alonso", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Alonso+A&cauthor_id=6084722"}, {"author": "J L Jorcano", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Jorcano+JL&cauthor_id=6084722"}, {"author": "E Beck", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Beck+E&cauthor_id=6084722"}, {"author": "B Hovemann", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Hovemann+B&cauthor_id=6084722"}, {"author": "T Schmidt", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Schmidt+T&cauthor_id=6084722"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["6084722", "8451192", "3458178", "3131740", "3084498", "2922259", "2411548", "2339054", "2124674", "1651882"], "body": ""}
