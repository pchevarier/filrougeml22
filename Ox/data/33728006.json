We also aim to investigate whether this relationship varies by corticosteroid use. METHODSDatabase introductionOur data source was the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4), an open international database. The MIMIC-III database includes deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units (ICUs) of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. Data were extracted by the author HTC (certification number: 37147539).Inclusion and exclusion criteriaPatients with ARDS who were 16 years or older, used mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay, and stayed in the ICU for at least 48 consecutive hours, were selected for inclusion. To screen the patients with ARDS accurately, the diagnostic information recorded in the MIMIC-III database and the Berlin criteria[15] were considered simultaneously, and the following condition was proposed: the onset of ARDS was acute, patients must have partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (P/F) ratio \u2264300 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) when positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was at least 5 cmH2O (1 cmH2O=0.098 kPa) and the free-text radiology reports mentioned bilateral opacities/infiltrates in the first 24 hours after ICU admission. The patients with COPD or asthma and patients without EOS data within the first 72 hours after ICU admission were excluded.Data extractionStructured query language (SQL) was used to extract the following data: age, sex, weight, body mass index (BMI), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), P/F ratio, comorbidities (diabetes, sepsis), disease severity score (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II [SAPS II]), laboratory outcomes (white blood cell [WBC] count, red blood cell [RBC] count, platelet [PLT], blood lactate, pH, EOS count), mechanical ventilation (tidal volume), minute ventilation (L/minute), and drugs (corticosteroid, vasopressor, and antibiotics). The extracted data were obtained within 72 hours after ICU admission.Grouping and definitionAccording to the cut-off value of 2%, the maximum value of EOS counts within 72 hours after ICU admission were used to divide the patients into EOS counts \u22652% and EOS counts <2% groups. ARDS severity was classified based on P/F ratio: 200 mmHg<P/F\u2264300 mmHg (mild), 100 mmHg<P/F\u2264200 mmHg (moderate), and P/F\u2264100 mmHg (severe). Corticosteroids can decrease blood EOS t least 50% at the first four hours after administration and then return to baseline within 24 hours.[16] Therefore, we excluded the patients who used corticosteroid 24 hours before the EOS count recording time. In the subgroup analysis, all patients were assigned to two subgroups based on the usage of any corticosteroid drugs except the external administration route within 72 hours after ICU admission, including dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and methylprednisolone. Vasopressor included norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, dopamine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine. The mean tidal volume \u22646 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) within 72 hours after ICU admission was adopted to define adherence to the target of low tidal volume. The primary endpoint was the 28-day mortality, defined as death within 28 days from ICU admission. The secondary endpoints included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay. For patients with ICU stay more than one time, only the first ICU stay of the first hospitalization was considered.Statistical analysisContinuous variables were summarized as the mean\u00b1standard deviation or median (upper and lower quartiles) when appropriate, and categorical data were summarized as proportions. The characteristics of patients with ARDS were compared using Student\u2019s t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and Chi-square test according to the distribution of the data. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to compare 28-day mortality among the EOS counts \u22652% and EOS counts <2% groups. Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between EOS counts and 28-day mortality. A backward stepwise method with P <0.05 was used to build the model. Sixteen potential confounders with a P-value <0.10 in the univariate analyses were included in the Cox regression models: age, BMI, weight, HR, P/F ratio, sepsis, ARDS severity, SAPS II, WBC, EOS counts, lactate, pH, tidal volume, minute ventilation, low tidal volume, and vasopressor use. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to test multicollinearity, and VIF\u226510 indicated multicollinearity between variables. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals, with P<0.05 constituting evidence for non-proportionality. Subgroup analyses were also performed separately in patients who used corticosteroids and those who did not. PSM was used to balance the cofounders between the EOS counts \u22652% and EOS counts <2% groups. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the propensity score by the variables that entered the Cox regression model and that were essential to ARDS prognosis (sepsis and low tidal volume). A 1:1 nearest-neighbour matching algorithm was used with a calliper of 0.05. All P-values were two-tailed, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (Version 16; Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). RESULTSCharacteristics of patientsA total of 2,567 patients were included, and the 28-day mortality rate was 24.19% (621/2,567). The baseline characteristics of enrolled patients are shown in Table 1.Table 1Comparisons of baseline characteristics between survivors and non-survivorsOpen in a separate windowClinical outcomesWithout adjusting for covariates, the EOS counts \u22652% group had a significantly lower 28-day mortality rate, ICU mortality rate, and hospital mortality rate than the EOS counts <2% group (Table 2). In patients who did not use corticosteroids, the result was similar to the crude outcome, but this result was not observed in patients who used corticosteroids. The differences in the median length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay were not significant between the EOS counts \u22652% group and the EOS counts <2% group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves depicting the 28-day survival distributions of patients with EOS counts \u22652% or EOS counts <2% are presented in Figure 1, and the comparison between the two groups showed that patients with EOS counts \u22652% had a significantly higher survival rate (log-rank test, P=0.026).Table 2Comparisons of outcome characteristics between the EOS counts <2% and EOS counts \u22652% groupsOpen in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowFigure 1Kaplan-Meier survival curve of the study population. EOS: eosinophil; ICU: intensive care unit.Relationship between EOS counts and 28-day mortalityTo assess the relationship between EOS counts and 28-day mortality and to test whether the relationship varied by corticosteroid used, three models were developed using Cox regression analyses (Table 3). Model 1 used all patients in our study, and EOS counts \u22652% showed a significant association with a decreased 28-day mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR] 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.581\u20130.921, P=0.008) after adjustment for SAPS II, lactate, minute ventilation, vasopressor use, ARDS severity, BMI, age, and P/F ratio. Model 2 used patients who did not use corticosteroids, and the results were similar to those in Model 1, with HR of 0.697 (95% CI 0.535\u20130.909, P=0.008). Model 3 included patients who used corticosteroids, and EOS counts were not included into the model because the P-value was 0.860. We also detected an interactive effect of EOS counts and corticosteroids on the 28-day mortality with an odd ratio of 2.585 (95% CI 1.444\u20134.627, P=0.001).Table 3Association between EOS counts and 28-day mortalityOpen in a separate windowOutcomes after PSMA total of 457 matched pairs were obtained after PSM. No significant difference was observed in any confounders between the two matched groups, indicating excellent matching among all pairs. Compared with the EOS counts <2% group, the EOS counts \u22652% group had significantly lower 28-day mortality (18.60% [85/457] vs. 26.70% [122/457], P=0.003), ICU mortality (15.54% [71/457] vs. 23.19% [106/457], P=0.003), and hospital mortality (17.72% [81/457] vs. 26.26% [120/457], P=0.002) after matching. The differences in the median length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay were not significant between the EOS counts \u22652% group and the EOS counts <2% group after matching. DISCUSSIONIn our large-sample study, we demonstrated that increased blood EOS counts were related to a significantly decreased risk of 28-day mortality after ICU admission in patients with ARDS. After adjustment for covariates, this result remained consistent in the PSM analysis. However, an interaction was observed between blood EOS counts and corticosteroid use. The relationship between blood EOSs and 28-day mortality was detected only in patients who did not use corticosteroid drugs, whereas this relationship was non-existent in patients who used corticosteroids.The ARDS is related to innate immune response. Neutrophil-dependent lung injury is the key pathway. The inflammatory factors released from endothelial cells can recruit neutrophils and dramatically increase the number of neutrophils migrating to lungs.[17] Neutrophils may cause alveolar damage by forming extracellular traps in response to endothelial injury and histone release and further lead to multiple organ failure or death.[18] Recently, Zhu et al[12] found that EOSs can be grouped into CD101+ and CD101- subtypes by the CD101 marker. CD101+ EOSs may play a pro-inflammatory role by overexpressing alarmins. CD101- EOSs, the EOS subtype mostly elevated in patients with ARDS, might play a protective role in the inflammatory process by preventing neutrophil recruitment and stimulating clean-up of neutrophil debris through the production of protectin D1. Our study suggests that EOSs play a possible protective role in ARDS patients, which has rarely been demonstrated previously.Corticosteroids may improve oxygenation and shorten mechanical ventilation times in ARDS.[19] However, no consistent result has been reported regarding whether corticosteroids should be routinely used in ARDS patients. Meduri et al[20] found that methylprednisolone can significantly improve pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction in ARDS patients and reduce ICU mortality by downregulating systemic inflammation. Guidelines for corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) also suggest that corticosteroids should be used in early moderate-to-severe ARDS.[21] However, in a randomized controlled trial including 180 patients with ARDS, no benefit of corticosteroids was found in hospital survival; moreover, using methylprednisolone two weeks after the onset of ARDS can significantly increase the 60-day and 180-day mortality rates.[22] A similar result[23] was also detected in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. In our study, 28-day non-survivors had a higher ratio of corticosteroid use when compared with survivors, and the relationship between EOS counts and 28-day mortality was non-existent in patients who used corticosteroids; this suggests that the potential protective role of EOSs can be counteracted by corticosteroid use. Although corticosteroids improve clinical symptoms to some extent, the clinical use of corticosteroids in ARDS should be considered with caution, taking into account both the negative effects and the use time.The large sample size from the MIMIC III database was our study strength, and it allowed a more in-depth analysis under full consideration of confounding variables and ensured robust results; however, the study also has limitations. First, patients in our study were divided based on the maximum value of blood EOS counts within 72 hours after ICU admission. However, the EOS fluctuation and variation tendency may also affect patients\u2019 prognoses, and this needs further study. Second, the best cut-off value of EOSs has yet to be determined. A cut-off value of 2% has been used in a previous study of COPD;[24] therefore, we used 2% for our group standard, but this cannot avoid related bias. Third, there were many important data missed in the MIMIC-III database. Inflammatory markers, such as C-reaction protein, are important indicators of prognosis for ARDS patients. However, the proportion of missed C-reaction protein data was higher than 20%, and thus we did not include it in this study. Fourth, the subgroup analysis was conducted only according to whether corticosteroids were used within 24 hours before ICU admission to 72 hours after. Whether the dose of corticosteroids and the time courses of the corticosteroid treatment affect the relationship between EOS counts and the outcome of patients with ARDS needs to be explored in future studies. Finally, the present study was a retrospective study which only allowed us to deduce the relationships between the blood EOS counts, corticosteroids, and mortality, and a definite causal relationship cannot be established. Further studies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are needed to verify this relationship. CONCLUSIONSHigher EOS counts are related to lower mortality in patients with ARDS. This relationship is not influenced by confounders, such as the characteristics of mechanical ventilation or the disease severity. However, this result is significant only in patients who do not use corticosteroids. To definitively assess the protective role of blood EOS counts in ARDS, larger RCTs are needed.
