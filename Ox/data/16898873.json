Subsequent synthesis of new viral RNA is tightly controlled by a complex interaction of viral and cellular proteins [1]. Transcription starts from the LTR (long terminal repeat) of the integrated proviral DNA by the cellular RNA Pol II (polymerase II). Once the initial sequence of 60 nucleotides of the viral RNA, the so-called TAR (transactivator-response element), is synthesized, a stable RNA stem\u2013loop structure is formed which is present at the 5\u2032 end of all viral transcripts [1]. At this step, several cellular transcription factors, including the cellular negative transcription elongation factor NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF [DRB (5,6-dichloro-1\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole)-sensitivity-inducing factor], bind to the TAR element [2\u20135]. Elongation of transcription is possible only if the viral transactivator protein Tat (transactivator of transcription) recruits the cellular positive transcription elongation factor pTEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) and binds to the bulge region of TAR [3,5,6]. Upon phosphorylation of RNA Pol II, NELF and DSIF by the kinase component CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9) of pTEFb, anti-termination occurs, leading to productive elongation of transcription [5]. NELF consists of four different subunits, namely NELF A, NELF B, alternatively spliced NELF C or D, and NELF E, also called RD because of its internal repeats of the amino acids arginine (R) and aspartic acid (D) [4,7]. NELF A exhibits sequence similarities to HDAg (hepatitis delta antigen) which binds to and activates RNA pol II [8]. NELF E contains an RRM (RNA-recognition motif). Furthermore, NELF E interacts with the NELF B subunit, probably via a leucine zipper motif. It has been shown that NELF E binds to various RNA elements [7\u20139]. Most importantly, isolated NELF E binds to the HIV TAR element in vitro [9]. Its TAR RNA-binding activity suggests that NELF E plays a role in the control of HIV transcription. EXPERIMENTALPlasmid construct, expression and protein purificationA synthetically produced gene adapted to the Escherichia coli codon usage harbouring the RRM of NELF E and adjacent regions was cloned via the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites into the E. coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen). The soluble recombinant protein contained an N-terminal His6 tag (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of NELF E RRMThe construct contains a His6 tag at the N-terminus, followed by a thrombin cleavage site indicated by the grey box. The amino acids defining the RRM are underlined, the amino acid sequence derived from NELF E is written in bold letters. The conserved ribonucleoprotein motifs RNP2 and RNP1 containing residues Tyr43 and Phe77 are marked by black boxes. Amino acid numbering is indicated on the right.E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) containing the recombinant plasmid was grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in LB (Luria\u2013Bertani) medium containing ampicillin until a D600 of 1 was reached and then induced with 1\u00a0mM IPTG (isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside). Cells were harvested 3\u20134\u00a0h after induction. For 15N- and 13C-labelling, cells were pelleted at 15\u00a0\u00b0C before induction and resuspended in \u00bc vol. of M9 medium [10,11] supplemented with 15NH4Cl and 0.2% [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources respectively [12]. After 1\u00a0h of shaking at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, induction was performed with 1\u00a0mM IPTG and cells were harvested after 3\u20134\u00a0h.In order to purify NELF E RRM, bacterial cell pellets were lysed by sonication [6\u00d745\u00a0s, 200\u00a0W; Labsonic U (B. Braun Biotech)] in 20\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\u00a07.4, 0.5\u00a0M NaCl, 5\u00a0mM imidazole and 1\u00a0mM DTT (dithiothreitol). After centrifugation at 19100\u00a0g for 45\u00a0min, the supernatant was loaded on to a Ni2+-affinity column (His-trap chelating, GE Healthcare) and eluted by applying an imidazole step gradient. Peak fractions containing NELF E RRM were dialysed against 10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\u00a06.9, 250\u00a0mM NaCl and 1\u00a0mM DTT, and purified further on a heparin column (GE Healthcare) by an NaCl step gradient in the same buffer with up to 1\u00a0M NaCl. The eluted fractions containing NELF E RRM were dialysed against 10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\u00a06.9, 100\u00a0mM NaCl and 1\u00a0mM DTT, concentrated with Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience, molecular-mass cut-off 5000\u00a0Da), divided into aliquots and then stored after shock-freezing at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.In vitro transcription and purification of TAR RNASynthesis of TAR RNA was performed by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, a T7 RNA primer oligodeoxyribonucleotide and a template oligodeoxyribonucleotide coding for the corresponding 59 nucleotides of the TAR sequence (5\u2032-GCCUCUCUCUGGUUAGACCAGAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCUCUCUGGCUAACUAGGGAAGGC-3\u2032) plus the region complementary to the T7 primer. The TAR RNA was then purified by denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis as described in [13].NMR spectrometryAll NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on Bruker DRX600, Avance 700 and Avance 800 spectrometers equipped with standard inverted or cryogenically cooled 1H/13C/15N triple-resonance probes with pulsed-field gradient capabilities. In order to obtain sequential backbone and side-chain resonance assignments, standard double- and triple-resonance NMR experiments were recorded [14,15] with uniformly 15N- or 13C/15N-labelled recombinant NELF E RRM at a concentration of 0.6\u00a0mM. Distance restraints for structure calculation were derived from three-dimensional 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) experiments with mixing times of 120\u00a0ms [16,17]. Dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3J(HN, H\u03b1) scalar coupling constants determined from the intensity ratios of cross and diagonal peaks of the HNHA spectrum [18]. A series of New MEXICO (measurement of exchange rates in isotopically labelled compounds) [19] experiments with different mixing times were recorded for characterizing amide proton exchange. 1D (one-bound) (1HN,15N) RDCs (residual dipolar couplings) were determined by the IPAP (in-phase/antiphase) method [20] using a weakly aligned sample of uniformly 15N-labelled NELF E RRM in a mixture of penta(ethylene glycol)-monododecyl ether (C12E5), hexanol and water [molar ratio of C12E5/hexanol=0.95, 3% (w/v) C12E5/water] [21]. {1H}15N NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) values were determined using the pulse sequence of Dayie and Wagner [22] with a relaxation delay of 6\u00a0s including the 3\u00a0s saturation period with 120\u00b0 high-power pulses for the saturated subspectrum. Chemical-shift changes of NELF E RRM upon binding to TAR RNA were observed in 1H/15N-HSQC spectra after gradually adding TAR RNA to a sample containing 15N-labelled NELF E RRM.Normalized chemical-shift changes were expressed as the weighted geometric average of 1HN- and 15N-chemical-shift changes for each residue:\nNormalized chemical shift changes larger than 0.04 p.p.m. were considered significant [23]. NMR data were processed using in-house written software and analysed with the NMR-View 5.2.2 program [24].Structure calculationDistance restraints for structure calculation were derived from 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra. NOESY cross-peaks were classified according to their relative intensities and converted into distance restraints with upper limits of 3.0\u00a0\u00c5 (1\u00a0\u00c5=0.1\u00a0nm) (strong), 4.0\u00a0\u00c5 (medium), 5.0\u00a0\u00c5 (weak) and 6.0\u00a0\u00c5 (very weak). For ambiguous distance restraints, the r\u22126 summation over all assigned possibilities defined the upper limit [25].The raw scalar coupling constants were multiplied with a correction factor of 1.1 to take into account the different relaxation rates of in-phase and antiphase components [18]. Residues with scalar coupling constants below 6 Hz were restrained to dihedral angles between \u221280\u00b0 and \u221240\u00b0, residues showing coupling constants above 8 Hz were restricted to dihedral angles of \u2212160\u00b0 to \u221280\u00b0 [26]. Glycine residues were omitted, since they were not stereospecifically assigned and the coupling constants are likely to be affected by cross-relaxation [18].Hydrogen bonds were included in the final structure calculation if the acceptor of a slowly exchanging amide proton characterized by a missing signal in a 150\u00a0ms New MEXICO experiment [19] could be identified from the results of preceding structure calculations. Thus a hydrogen bond was assumed if the distance between the carboxy oxygen and the amide proton was below 2.6\u00a0\u00c5, and the angle of the amide proton, the amide nitrogen and the carboxy oxygen was less than 60\u00b0 in all accepted structures. For each hydrogen bond, the distance between the amide proton and the acceptor was restrained to less than 2.3\u00a0\u00c5, and the distance between the amide nitrogen and the acceptor was restrained to less than 3.3\u00a0\u00c5 [26]. All proline residues were considered to adopt the trans-conformation as strong HA(i)-HD(i+1) and HN(i) and HD(i+1) NOEs could be observed [27].The structure calculations were performed with the program XPLOR 3.8.5.1 using a three-step simulated annealing protocol [28,29] with floating assignment of prochiral groups [30]. Initial conformational space sampling was carried out for 120\u00a0ps with a time step of 3 fs at a temperature of 2000\u00a0K, followed by a cooling period of 120\u00a0ps down to 1000\u00a0K, and 60\u00a0ps cooling to 100\u00a0K, both with a time step of 2\u00a0fs. A modified conformational database potential for backbone and side-chain dihedral angles was applied [31,32]. The proline angles were modified according to Neudecker et al. [33]. After simulated annealing, the structures were subjected to 1000 steps of Powell minimization [34], and the final 500 steps were minimized without conformational database potential.In a first step, 200 structures were calculated (Table 1) using 1926 distance, 24 hydrogen bond and 32 dihedral angle restraints. The 40 structures with the lowest total energy were then refined using 55 1D (1HN,15N) RDCs with a harmonic potential [35]. Dipolar couplings of flexible residues showing a {1H} 15N NOE below 0.65 at 14.1 T were excluded from the calculations. The tensor components of the alignment were optimized with a grid search by varying the axial component Da and the rhombicity R in steps of 0.5 and 0.1 respectively. The initial values of Da and R were estimated from the distribution of the 1D (1HN,15N) [36], and a Molecular Dynamics run was performed for each pair of Da and R, yielding an axial component of 9.0 Hz, and a rhombicity of 0.4 for the energetically most-favourable combination of Da and R.Table 1Structural statisticsEpot, overall potential energy; Eimpr, potential energy of improper angle; Ecdih, potential energy for dihedral restraints; Esani, potential energy for RDC restraints.ParameterValueExperimental restraints\u2003Distance restraints\u2003\u2003Total1926\u2003\u2003Intraresidual468\u2003\u2003Sequential406\u2003\u2003Medium-range281\u2003\u2003Long-range623\u2003Dihedral angles32\u2003Dipolar couplings55\u2003Hydrogen bonds (two restraints each)24Molecular Dynamics statistics\u2003Energies (kcal/mol)\u2003\u2003Epot14.1\u00b11.4\u2003\u2003Ebond0.58\u00b10.06\u2003\u2003Eangle6.7\u00b10.6\u2003\u2003Eimpr2.3\u00b10.2\u2003\u2003Erepel2.4\u00b10.3\u2003\u2003ENOE1.3\u00b10.5\u2003\u2003Ecdih0.03\u00b10.03\u2003\u2003Esani0.7\u00b10.2\u2003RMSDs from ideal distances (\u00c5)\u2003\u2003Bond lengths0.00068\u00b10.00004\u2003\u2003Distance restraints0.0036\u00b10.0007\u2003RMSDs from ideal angles (\u00b0)\u2003\u2003Bond angles0.14\u00b10.06\u2003\u2003Dihedral angle restraints0.15\u00b10.15\u2003RMSDs from dipolar couplings (Hz)0.11\u00b10.02Atomic co-ordinate precision (RMSD) (\u00c5)\u2003Backbone heavy atoms0.28 (Gly39\u2013Ala108)\u2003Heavy atoms0.64 (Gly39\u00ad\u2013Ala108)Ramachandran plot statistics\u2003Residues in\u2003\u2003Most-favoured regions91.0%\u2003\u2003Allowed regions9.0%Open in a separate windowThe 20 structures showing the lowest values of the target function excluding the database potential were analysed further with X-PLOR 3.8.5.1, MOLMOL [38] and PROCHECK 3.5.4 [39,40]. The structural co-ordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession code 2BZ2.Fluorescence equilibrium titrationsMeasurements were performed using a Fluorolog spectrophotometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) in reaction buffer consisting of 10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate, pH\u00a07.0, and 100\u00a0mM NaCl in a volume of 2\u00a0ml. The excitation wavelength was 495\u00a0nm, and the emission intensity was measured at 522 or 525\u00a0nm with slit widths set at 2\u00a0nm for both excitation and emission. To analyse the doublestranded TAR RNA stem, the oligoribonucleotide representing the 5\u2032 end of HIV-1 TAR, TAR-(1\u201318) (5\u2032-GGUCUCUCUGGUUAGACC-3\u2032) was hybridized in reaction buffer to the complementary 5\u2032-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)-labelled oligoribonucleotide (biomers.net) representing the 3\u2032 end of the HIV-1 TAR RNA, TAR-(42\u201357) (5\u2032-FAM-GGCUAACUAGGGAACC-3\u2032). The solution was heated to 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. For analysis of the single strands, the corresponding 5\u2032-FAM-labelled oligoribonucleotides were used. Double- or single-stranded substrate (50\u00a0nM) was titrated with increasing amounts of NELF E RRM. Values for the dissociation constant, Kd, were determined assuming a two-state model, using a quadratic equation for the fitting procedure:\n\nwhere Fobs is observed fluorescence, FL0 is starting fluorescence, [L0] is concentration of the RNA, \u0394F0 is change in fluorescence, and [E0] is concentration of protein. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification of NELF E RRMTo analyse the structure and function of NELF E RRM, a synthetic gene containing the corresponding DNA coding for an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin site and the NELF E RRM was constructed with the codon usage adapted to E. coli (Figure 1). The regions adjacent to the NELF E RRM coding region had to be introduced since plasmid constructs lacking these additional DNA stretches led to insoluble protein. The DNA sequence was deposited into GenBank\u00ae under the accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"DQ885937\",\"term_id\":\"113472812\",\"term_text\":\"DQ885937\"}}DQ885937. The expressed and purified protein was stable and could be stored in 10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\u00a06.9, containing 100\u00a0mM NaCl and 1\u00a0mM DTT, by shock-freezing aliquots at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. After thawing and addition of 10% (v/v) 2H2O, the samples were used directly for NMR studies.Structural NMR analysisTo investigate the integrity of the structure of purified NELF E RRM we performed CD (results not shown) and one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Using standard double- and triple-resonance NMR techniques with isotopically labelled protein, 1H, 13C and 15N backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned. Complete backbone and nearly complete side-chain assignment was obtained for the region Ala35\u2013Arg109. For residues N-formyl-Met1\u2013Arg34, as well as Lys110\u2013Ser121, several amide resonances could not be assigned because of missing signals due to conformational exchange or proton exchange with the solvent.The 1H/15N-HSQC spectrum of NELF E RRM shows the characteristic dispersion of a protein with an intact tertiary structure. Using standard double- and triple-resonance NMR techniques, it was possible to assign nearly all 1H, 13C and 15N resonances. While for the sequence region Lys38\u2013Arg109 nearly all (>95%) backbone resonances and more than 85% of the side-chain resonances could be assigned, the terminal regions, especially the N-terminus, remained partially unassigned owing to strong overlap or missing resonances. The {1H} 15N-heteronuclear steady-state NOE experiment at 14.1 T (Figure 2) shows values around 0.6\u20130.8 for the region Lys38\u2013Arg109, while outside of this region the heteronuclear NOE decreases towards the termini. {1H} 15N steady-state NOE values cluster around 0.7, indicating the absence of pronounced motions on the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale for nearly all residues in between Gly39 and Arg109. Additionally, the assigned residues from the terminal regions show chemical shifts typically found for highly flexible polypeptides. This is characteristic for a compactly folded domain within the region Lys38\u2013Arg109 and unstructured termini. Missing assignments of amide resonances can therefore be explained by conformational or solvent exchange. Owing to the flexible character of the termini, residues N-formyl-Met1\u2013Arg34 and Leu114\u2013Ser121 were excluded from further structural determination.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Size of heteronuclear {1H} 15N steady-state NOE at 14.1 T along the amino acid sequenceThe values in the range 0.6\u20130.85 for residues Leu40\u2013Cys110 indicate a rigid protein backbone in this region.During the iterative structure determination, a set of 2037 experimental restraints, consisting of 1926 NOE-derived distance restraints, 24 hydrogen bonds (two distance restraints for each hydrogen bond), 32 dihedral restraints and 55 RDCs could be derived from NMR data (Table 1). The final structure calculation resulted in an ensemble of 20 structures showing no distance restraint violation larger than 0.16\u00a0\u00c5, no violation of a dihedral restraint larger than 2.6\u00b0 and no violation of an RDC larger than 0.48 Hz. Only small deviations from the idealized covalent bond geometry were obtained (Table 1). The resulting ensemble of 20 structures shows a high-co-ordinate precision of 0.28\u00a0\u00c5 for the heavy backbone atoms and 0.64\u00a0\u00c5 for all heavy atoms for residues Gly39\u2013Ala108, corresponding to the structurally defined domain, as well as good stereochemical properties reflected by the fact that 91% of residues are located in the most-favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot (Figure 3A).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Solution structure of NELF E RRM(A) Overlay of the 20 structures (residues Ala35\u2013Met113) showing the lowest values of the target function excluding the database potential. (B) Ribbon presentation of the NELF E RRM structure. The Figure was generated using MOLMOL [38]. (C) Packing of Phe58, Val78 and Leu93. The amino acid residues are displayed as space-filled atoms. (D) The highly conserved aromatic residues Tyr43 and Phe77 derived from RNP2 and RNP1 of NELF E RRM are represented as balls and sticks. The N- and C-termini are indicated.The solution structure of NELF E RRM exhibits a compact \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold with a four-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21=Asn40\u2013Tyr45, \u03b22=Ile64\u2013Asp70, \u03b23=Cys75\u2013Tyr80, \u03b24=Gln102\u2013Ile107) that packs against two helices (h1=Pro51\u2013Phe61, h2=Met83\u2013Leu93) which are oriented approximately perpendicular to each other (interhelix angle=114.3\u00b11.8\u00b0; Figure 3B). Numerous hydrophobic contacts involving Leu42, Val44, Leu54, Ala57, Phe58, Val78, Ala86, Val90, Leu93, Val98, Val105 and Ile107 stabilize this packing. For example, Phe58 from h1 contacts Val78 from the central strand \u03b23 and Leu93 from h2 (Figure 3C). These residues are conserved in all other known RRMs and adopt a similar conformation. Residues Thr96 and Gln97 form an additional short \u03b2-strand aligned antiparallel to \u03b24, thus extending the \u03b2-sheet. This is similar to other RRMs where a \u03b2-hairpin is found in the sequence region between h2 and \u03b24 [41]. The highly conserved aromatic residues Tyr43 and Phe77 known to be involved in base-stacking interactions with RNA in other RRMs are highlighted in Figure 3(D) [41].Identification of the binding interfaceTo obtain information on the binding of NELF E RRM to the HIV-1 TAR RNA, we performed additional NMR experiments. The binding interface could be clearly defined by the NMR titration studies (Figure 4). Amide (1HN,15N) chemical shifts are very sensitive to local structural changes. Therefore observation of chemical-shift changes on titration of a binding partner to a 15N-labelled protein provides a powerful method for mapping of the binding interface. Addition of TAR RNA results in remarkable chemical-shift changes for resonances located in the central \u03b2-sheet (Asn41, Leu42, Tyr45, Cys75 and Phe77) and in the N-terminal region of h2 (Glu84 and Asp87; Figure 4A). For several residues in particular in strand \u03b24 (Lys104\u2013Ile107), signals were absent in the 1H/15N-HSQC spectra, probably due to exchange processes on the intermediate time scale, suggesting that these residues are involved in binding. This is characteristic for affinities in the low-micromolar range. The chemical-shift changes for residues located in strands \u03b21 and \u03b23 indicate the typical binding of RNA to the RRM by stacking of bases on to the two conserved aromatic residues Tyr43 and Phe77 (Figure 4B). Figure 4(C) shows a surface representation of the protein, highlighting the binding interface and the residues that exhibit chemical shift changes upon binding of TAR RNA.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Determination of the binding interface(A) Overlay of the 1H/15N-HSQC spectra of free NELF E RRM (black) and the NELF E\u2013TAR RNA complex (red). The amino acid resonances showing significant chemical-shift changes upon addition of an equimolar amount of TAR RNA are indicated by arrows. (B) Normalized chemical-shift changes of NELF E RRM upon TAR RNA binding. The normalized chemical-shift changes (weighted geometric average of 1HN and 15N chemical-shift changes) are shown as a function of the primary sequence. Changes larger than 0.04 (dotted line) were considered significant. Resonances disappearing after TAR binding due to extreme line broadening by chemical exchange are marked with an \u00d7. (C) Surface representation of NELF E RRM highlighting the binding interface. Residues with resonances showing significant chemical-shift changes upon TAR binding (0.04<\u0394\u03b4\u22640.1), including the highly conserved Tyr43 and Phe77 of the RNP2 and RNP1 sequence motifs, are shown in yellow, those with resonances showing chemical-shift changes with \u0394\u03b4>0.1 are indicated in light red and residues whose resonances could not be detected due to extreme line broadening are presented in light green.The large chemical-shift changes seen in the Met113 and Ala116 resonances on TAR titration (Figure 4B) imply a structural change of this region which is highly flexible in free NELF E RRM. Structural changes of the C-terminus are observed, e.g. in hnRNP1 (heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein 1) RRM1, where the corresponding region is also unstructured in the free state and adopts a 310 helix upon RNA binding [42]. The additional \u03b2-strand of the NELF E RRM (Thr96\u2013Gln97) does not exhibit significant chemical-shift changes, indicating that this region is not involved in RNA recognition. This is in contrast with the RRM from TcUBP1 (Trypanosoma cruzi U-rich-RNA-binding protein 1), where large chemical-shift changes of the resonances of the additional \u03b2-hairpin indicate interaction with RNA [43]. Unusual chemical-shift changes or disappearing signals are found for several residues in the loop preceding h2 (Glu81\u2013Glu84 and Asp87). This region is not involved in RNA binding in complexes with known structures [42,44\u201346], and the distance between the RNA-contact sites and h2 is rather large for the induction of secondary chemical-shift changes. We thus analysed whether a second NELF E RRM molecule is binding simultaneously to TAR.Substrate bindingIn order to obtain information on the stoichiometry of the complex, more detailed structural and dynamical characterizations, i.e. 15N-relaxation measurements and temperature-dependent titrations, were performed. However, analysis of the data was hampered by severe line broadening due to the large molecular mass of the complex, and only ambiguous data could be obtained (results not shown).Therefore fluorescence titrations were performed. It has been shown previously that NELF E binds to the lower region of the TAR RNA stem [47]. However, none of the RRMs analysed so far exhibits high affinity for double-stranded RNA [41]. To determine whether NELF E RRM binds to single- or double-stranded TAR RNA, fluorescently labelled single or double-stranded oligoribonucleotides representing the lower stem of TAR were used for fluorescence equilibrium titrations. The experimental data obtained with the single-stranded RNA oligomers could be closely described by a two-state model, and Kd values of approx.\u00a08.2\u00a0\u03bcM for TAR-(1\u201318) and 2.6\u00a0\u03bcM for TAR-(42\u201357) respectively could be derived (Figures 5A and \u200band5B).5B). Binding to the double-stranded RNA oligomer, however, could not be described by such a simple model (Figure 5C). However, further experiments will be necessary to obtain the precise binding region on the TAR RNA.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Fluorescence equilibrium titration with the TAR RNA stemFAM-labelled (A) TAR-(1\u201318), (B) TAR-(42\u201357) or (C) double-stranded TAR RNA stem (50\u00a0nM) was titrated with NELF E RRM in 10\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH\u00a07.0, 100\u00a0mM NaCl. The curves in (A) and (B) show the best fit to a quadratic equation describing the binding equilibria with Kd values of 8.2\u00b11.0\u00a0\u03bcM and 2.6\u00b10.2\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. No curve could be fitted to the data in (C) using a simple two-state model.In parallel to our structure determination of the RRM, the NMR structure of the RRM of Parp14 which is identical with the NELF E RRM, was determined by the RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative (PDB accession code 1X5P). The average structures of both ensembles display a backbone RMSD (root mean square deviation) of 1.3\u00a0\u00c5 showing a high similarity of the three-dimensional fold. The N- and C-terminal extensions of our construct, however, proved to be crucial for RNA binding.The presented results thus demonstrate that NELF E RRM by itself is sufficient for binding to TAR RNA. The structures of RRMs generally exhibit a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold. The loops between the secondary-structure elements of RRMs are usually disordered and of various lengths. It is assumed that the different specificities and binding affinities of RRMs are, among other factors, modulated by variations in these loop regions [41]. Although full-length NELF E can bind to various RNA elements via its RRM, the precise binding regions have not yet been determined [9,47]. Thus analysis of the interaction of NELF E RRM with different single- and double-stranded RNAs will contribute to the understanding of the function of NELF E in the regulation of HIV transcription in particular, and eukaryotic transcription in general, and to identify new drug targets against HIV.
