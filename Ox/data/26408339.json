These include biochemical and biophysical responses as well as alterations in the steady\u2010state level of different transcripts and proteins. Recent studies utilizing promoter::reporter constructs suggested that transcriptional responses to changes in light intensity could occur within seconds, rates for which changes in mRNA expression are not routinely measured or functionally studied. To identify and characterize rapid changes in the steady\u2010state level of different transcripts in response to light stress we performed RNA sequencing analysis of Arabidopsis\u00a0thaliana plants subjected to light stress. Here we report that mRNA accumulation of 731 transcripts occurs as early as 20\u201360\u00a0sec following light stress application, and that at least five of these early response transcripts play an important biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress. More than 20% of transcripts accumulating in plants within 20\u201360\u00a0sec of initiation of light stress are H2O2\u2010 and ABA\u2010response transcripts, and the accumulation of several of these transcripts is inhibited by transcriptional inhibitors. In accordance with the association of rapid response transcripts with H2O2 and ABA signaling, a mutant impaired in ABA sensing (abi\u20101) was found to be more tolerant to light stress, and the response of several of the rapid response transcripts was altered in mutants impaired in reactive oxygen metabolism. Our findings reveal that transcriptome reprogramming in plants could occur within seconds of initiation of abiotic stress and that this response could invoke known as well as unknown proteins and pathways.Keywords: Arabidopsis thaliana, transcription, RNA\u2010Seq, light stress, ultra\u2010fast IntroductionPlaying a principal role in sustaining life on Earth, plants convert solar radiation into bio\u2010available energy. Unable to avoid abiotic stress by means of relocation, plants have evolved sophisticated acclimation mechanisms to cope with changes in their environment. These include sensing, signal transduction and stress protection proteins and pathways (Nakashima and Yamaguchi\u2010Shinozaki, 2006; Bailey\u2010Serres and Voesenek, 2008; Cavanagh et\u00a0al., 2008; Munns and Tester, 2008; Chinnusamy and Zhu, 2009; Mittler and Blumwald, 2010). Although changes in environmental conditions could occur within seconds in nature, studies attempting to dissect the responses of plants to abiotic stress have traditionally focused on events occurring 10\u201330\u00a0min or hours after application of abiotic stress (Mittler et\u00a0al., 2012). Recent studies have nonetheless indicated that the response of plants to abiotic stress could occur much faster than previously measured, and that changes in environmental conditions such as temperature or light intensity could cause immediate alterations in the level or structure of different proteins, metabolites and RNA molecules, as well as changes in the redox status of different molecules (Mittler, 2002; Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; Mittler et\u00a0al., 2012; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a; Gilroy et\u00a0al., 2014; Dietz, 2015). Even a gradual change in environmental conditions could trigger a rapid response once a particular physiological or biochemical sensing threshold is passed (Mittler et\u00a0al., 2012). Alterations in metabolites and RNA species could result from stress\u2010induced differential enzymatic co\u2010efficiencies, RNA transcription and processing, or metabolite and RNA stability. These could in turn reprogram the cell metabolome and transcriptome and trigger specific sensors for abiotic stress response that would in turn activate multiple signal transduction pathways and result in the mounting of a full\u2010scale acclimation response (Mittler et\u00a0al., 2012). Although much is known about the different signaling and downstream pathways that mediate the acclimation of plants to stress, virtually nothing is known about the rapid changes in the metabolome and transcriptome of plants that occur within seconds to minutes of initiation of abiotic stress (Mittler et\u00a0al., 2012; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a,b; Gilroy et\u00a0al., 2014; Miller et\u00a0al., 2009).We recently reported on the detection of ultra\u2010fast changes in the metabolome of plants subjected to high\u2010light stress, with changes in many metabolites occurring as early as 15\u00a0sec after the application of light stress (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a). Using a Zat12::luciferase reporter system, we also reported on the existence in plants of a rapid local and systemic signal termed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave that is activated by different abiotic stresses and propagates at rates of up to 8.4\u00a0cm min\u22121 (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; Mittler et\u00a0al., 2011). Those reports, as well as a recent report on the existence of a rapid local and systemic \u2018calcium wave\u2019 (Choi et\u00a0al., 2014), and the possible integration of the two (Gilroy et\u00a0al., 2014), suggest that transcription, RNA stability and/or RNA processing responses in plants could occur at a much faster rate than is typically studied. Moreover, if such rapid responses occur, and have an important biological function, then the lack of data for early time points in many of the abiotic stress\u2010response transcriptome studies deposited in different gene and data banks (e.g. Hruz et\u00a0al., 2008; https://genevestigator.com/gv/) could hamper our attempts to develop crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses because many of the important early response genes will be missed. In support of the possibility that the steady\u2010state transcript level of many genes could be enhanced within seconds of initiation of abiotic stress are measurements of transcription rates in eukaryotic cells nearing or exceeding 50\u00a0kb min\u22121 (Maiuri et\u00a0al., 2011), and the discovery that many genes in eukaryotic cells contain stalled RNA polymerases at their promoters and could mount a rapid transcriptional response following changes in environmental conditions (Nechaev and Adelman, 2008; Levine, 2011; Kwak and Lis, 2013).Here we uncover the ultra\u2010fast transcriptome response of plants triggered by light stress. This response includes the ordered and clustered mRNA accumulation of 731 transcripts that occurs as early as 20\u201360\u00a0sec after application of light stress. We further determined that five of the transcripts involved in this ultra\u2010fast response play an important biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress, that many of the ultra\u2010fast light stress\u2010response transcripts are H2O2\u2010 or ABA\u2010response transcripts, and that the accumulation of several of the ultra\u2010fast response transcripts is inhibited by transcriptional inhibitors. We also report that a mutant impaired in ABA sensing (abi\u20101) is more tolerant to light stress, and that the response of several of the rapid response transcripts was altered in mutants impaired in ROS metabolism/signaling. Our findings reveal that transcriptome reprogramming in plants occurs at a much faster rate than is typically studied and that this response could involve known as well as unknown transcripts and pathways. Because several of the genes identified as ultra\u2010fast light response genes appear to be important for acclimation to light stress, our studies highlight the need to study the ultra\u2010fast transcriptional response of plants to other abiotic or biotic stresses that may include important, but as\u2010yet unidentified, genes for acclimation to abiotic stress and/or plant resistance to pathogens and pests. ResultsRNA sequencing (RNA\u2010Seq) analysis of the ultra\u2010fast response of Arabidopsis to light stress\nArabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to light stress for 0, 20, 30, 60 and 90\u00a0sec were used for transcriptome (RNA\u2010Seq; 0, 20, 60\u00a0sec) and quantitative (q)PCR analyses and H2O2 measurements (0, 20, 30, 60 or 90\u00a0sec) in three biological replicates (Figure\u00a01 and Figure\u00a0S1a in Supporting Information). Each biological replicate contained three technical replicates of 15\u201320 plants each, grown in pots for 18\u201321\u00a0days, exposed to a light intensity of 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122 sec\u22121 at 21\u00b0C, and immediately dipped in liquid nitrogen. The steady\u2010state level of 731 transcripts was found to be significantly enhanced in response to light stress within 20\u201360 sec. These were divided into three clusters based on their expression pattern (Figure\u00a01a, Tables S1\u2013S3), indicating a complex response pattern that involved differential timing. Out of the 731 transcripts shown in Figure\u00a01, 49 were found not to be annotated on the ATH1 Affymetrix chips (Table\u00a0S4). Interestingly, only 34 transcripts out of the 731 shown in Figure\u00a01(a) increased in expression from a very low basal level [below 2.0 fragments per kilobase of\u00a0transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM); Table\u00a0S5]. The steady\u2010state level of 419 and 668 transcripts significantly declined at 20 and 60\u00a0sec of light stress, respectively (Tables S6 and S7). As shown in Figure\u00a01(b), qPCR analysis confirmed the expression of selected transcripts from Cluster I. It should be noted that few transcripts included in Cluster I in some experiments could be found in Clusters II or III in other experiments. These differences, detected by qPCR, could result from small variations in the physiological pre\u2010conditioning of plants used for the different experiments or from the stochastic nature of the transcriptional response in different cells belonging to the same tissue (Stegle et\u00a0al., 2015). Interestingly, enhanced cellular levels of H2O2 were not detected during early stages of light stress (Figure\u00a01b). This finding could be linked to the high content of antioxidants in plants, generating a buffer against rapid changes in ROS (Mittler, 2002; Halliwell, 2006). In accordance with this hypothesis, the level of ascorbic acid rapidly decreased in response to light stress in Arabidopsis in a process that was dependent on the presence of ascorbate peroxidase 1 (APX1; Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005a), an ascorbate\u2010dependent H2O2\u2010scavenging enzyme (Figure\u00a01c). This finding demonstrated that APX1 could be directly involved in scavenging of H2O2 produced during the initial response to light stress, and that during this process the stored levels of ascorbic acid are utilized as part of the Asada\u2013Foyer\u2013Halliwell pathway (Figure\u00a01c; Halliwell, 2006).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Ultra\u2010fast alterations in transcript steady\u2010state level in response to light stress in Arabidopsis thaliana detected by RNA sequencing.(a) Three different clusters of transcript alterations distinguished by their pattern of response to light stress.(b) Accumulation of H2O2 and selected transcripts determined by quantitative PCR during the early stages of light stress acclimation.(c) Rapid changes in the level of ascorbic acid in response to light stress in wild\u2010type (WT) plants and knockout mutants lacking the ascorbate\u2010dependent H2O2\u2010scavenging enzyme ascorbate peroxidase 1 (apx1).The majority of transcripts belonging to all ultra\u2010fast response clusters were annotated as stress, abiotic or biotic response transcripts based on their Gene Ontology (GO) annotation (Figure\u00a02a), and genes encoding the bulk of these transcripts were scattered on all Arabidopsis chromosomes, with only a few clustering at certain locations (Figure\u00a0S1b). A breakdown of the overlap between responses to different biotic/abiotic stresses and the different transcripts found in each of the ultra\u2010fast response cluster indicated that many of the transcripts with an enhanced steady\u2010state level in response to light stress are also responsive to abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, heat and salinity, demonstrating their possible involvement in tolerance of abiotic stress in plants (Figure\u00a02b; ATH1 chip data were obtained from the supplementary material of Huang et\u00a0al., 2008; Matsui et\u00a0al., 2008; Larkindale and Vierling, 2008; Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007; Ding et\u00a0al., 2014; Tosti et\u00a0al., 2006; Consales et\u00a0al., 2012; Truman et\u00a0al., 2006). A comparison, shown in a Venn diagram in Figure\u00a02(c), between the transcriptomes of the ultra\u2010fast response to light stress (this work), the response of Arabidopsis to H2O2 (Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005b; data obtained from the supplementary material therein) and the response of Arabidopsis to a 3\u2010h light treatment (Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007; data obtained from the supplementary material therein), revealed that 502 transcripts found to be induced between 20 and 60\u00a0sec after light stress application were not found to be induced by the longer light stress or H2O2 treatments. Out of these 502 transcripts, 245 transcripts (Table\u00a0S8) were also not found to be included in the response of plants to the stresses shown in Figure\u00a02(b). Of course, 49 of these were not represented in the ATH1 chips (Table\u00a0S4). These transcripts could therefore represent a unique group of transcripts that are relatively more specific to the ultra\u2010fast response (Table\u00a0S8).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Meta\u2010analysis of ultra\u2010fast light stress\u2010response transcripts in Arabidopsis.(a) Gene Ontology annotation of the different transcripts found in the three ultra\u2010fast response clusters shown in Figure\u00a01(a).(b) Distribution of abiotic and biotic stress\u2010response transcripts between the different ultra\u2010fast response clusters. Transcript representation higher than 10% is highlighted in bold.(c) Venn diagram showing the overlap between ultra\u2010fast response transcripts to light stress, transcripts accumulating in Arabidopsis following a 3\u2010h light stress treatment and transcripts accumulating in Arabidopsis following a 1\u2010h treatment with H2O2. Out of the 502 transcripts shown to be unique to ultra\u2010fast high light (HL), 245 do not overlap with any of the abiotic stresses shown in (b). Out of those 245 transcripts, 49 do not appear on the ATH1 Affymetrix chips.Functional characterization of ultra\u2010fast response transcripts in ArabidopsisTo determine whether some of the ultra\u2010fast response transcripts play a biological role in the acclimation of plants to light stress, we obtained from the SALK collection knockout mutants for 70 genes encoding transcripts with altered expression at 20\u00a0sec of light stress (O'Malley and Ecker, 2010) and screened them for tolerance to light stress. Seven knockouts showed enhanced cell death in response to light stress and a second independent knockout was obtained for these and screened again. As shown in Figure\u00a03(a), five genes were found to be important for acclimation to light stress using two independent knockouts. They encoded two proteins of unknown function (At5g10695 and At3g10020), a Golgi\u2010associated protein (At5g51430), a RAV transcription factor (At1g25560) and a glycosyl hydrolase (At3g13750), and were required to prevent light\u2010induced cell death in Arabidopsis leaves. It should also be mentioned that a sixth protein identified by our analysis, Zat12 (Figure\u00a01b), was previously shown to be required for acclimation to light stress (Iida et\u00a0al., 2000). Interestingly, as shown in Figure\u00a03(b), none of the five transcripts functionally characterized in Figure\u00a03(a) was induced in response to the 3\u2010h light stress treatment (Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007). Also, none of the five transcripts shown in Figure\u00a03(a) was found to be enhanced in a time\u2010course experiment subjecting Arabidopsis to light stress as reported in Davletova et\u00a0al. (2005a; Figures S2 and S3). The five ultra\u2010fast transcripts assayed in Figure\u00a03(a) were therefore primarily induced during early stages of the response of Arabidopsis to light stress (with two of them also induced by H2O2; Figure\u00a03b). Our finding that these transcripts were primarily induced during the rapid response of plants to light stress, but not during later stages of this response (Figures\u00a03b, S2 and S3; Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005a; Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007), highlight their potential biological role in protecting plants from light stress (Figure\u00a03a), thus demonstrating that the rapid response is important for the tolerance of plants to light stress.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Functional analysis of selected ultra\u2010fast response transcripts in Arabidopsis.(a) Light stress\u2010induced cell death in knockout mutants for five different genes encoding ultra\u2010fast response transcripts.

We selected four different transcripts with a defined response pattern confirmed by qPCR for this analysis (Figure\u00a04). As can be seen in Figure\u00a04(a), changes in transcript accumulation, visualized by RNA\u2010Seq read alignment maps, could be seen for the four selected transcripts across the entire length of their corresponding genes with some genes changing in expression two\u2010 to three\u2010fold within 20\u00a0sec of light stress. Pre\u2010treatment with \u03b1\u2010amanitin or actinomycin D suppressed the accumulation of all four selected transcripts (Figure\u00a04b), demonstrating that at least some of the transcripts accumulating at 20\u00a0sec of light stress could require active transcription for their regulation.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Suppression of light stress\u2010induced ultra\u2010fast accumulation of transcripts by transcriptional inhibitors.(a) Standardized RNA sequencing read maps for four selected genes encoding ultra\u2010fast response transcripts at 20\u00a0sec of light stress exposure.

As can be seen in Figure\u00a05(a), subjecting three independent homozygous lines for each of these reporter genes to light stress for 20\u00a0sec resulted in enhanced luciferase activity that occurred within 40\u201360\u00a0sec in the Zat12::Lucu and 110\u2013140\u00a0sec in the WRKY40::Lucu constructs. In addition, we used qPCR to measure the accumulation of the luciferase transcripts in Zat12::luc (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; regular stable luciferase fused to the same Zat12 promoter fragment) plants 20 and 60\u00a0sec following application of light stress. As shown in Figure\u00a05(b), luciferase transcripts driven by the Zat12 promoter could be detected as early as 20\u00a0sec following light stress. The findings shown in Figures\u00a04(b) and \u200band55 suggest that at least some of the transcripts with enhanced steady\u2010state levels at 20 and 60\u00a0sec following application of light stress in Arabidopsis are driven by the activation of their promoters.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Analysis of the ultra\u2010fast response to light stress using promoter::reporter constructs.(a) Luciferase activity measurements of the ultra\u2010fast light stress response using an unstable luciferase gene fused to the promoters of the Zat12 (measured from 0 to 100 sec) or WRKY40 (measured from 0 to 200 sec) genes. Three independent transgenic lines per construct are shown.(b) Accumulation of the luciferase transcript, determined by quantitative PCR, during the early stages of light stress acclimation in Zat12::luc plants. **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01.Because the steady\u2010state level of many of the transcripts shown in Figure\u00a01 could also be enhanced in response to light stress due to changes in their RNA stability (i.e. by increased stability during the early stages of light stress), we determined the content of 11 different RNA\u2010destabilizing sequences (Ohme\u2010Takagi et\u00a0al., 1993; Narsai et\u00a0al., 2007) in these transcripts and compared it with the content of the same RNA\u2010destabilizing sequences in transcripts induced by light stress at 3\u00a0h (Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007). As shown in Figure\u00a0S4, the content of the destabilizing sequences was very similar in these two transcript groups. However, further studies are needed to determine the role of RNA stability in the ultra\u2010fast response of Arabidopsis to light stress.Involvement of ABA and ROS in the ultra\u2010fast response of Arabidopsis to light stressMeta\u2010analysis of the transcriptomic response at 20 and 60\u00a0sec of light stress revealed that 12\u201322% of the transcripts with an enhanced steady\u2010state level in all clusters are ABA\u2010response transcripts (Figure\u00a06a; ATH1 chip data was obtained from the supplementary material of Nemhauser et\u00a0al., 2006; Blanco et\u00a0al., 2009; Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005b; Scarpeci et\u00a0al., 2008; Gadjev et\u00a0al., 2006). Twelve to 21% of transcripts from Cluster I were also brassinolide\u2010, jasmonate\u2010 and H2O2\u2010response transcripts. These findings suggest that Cluster I is distinct from Clusters II and III in its content of hormone\u2010response transcripts (Figure\u00a06a). To further test the dependence of the ultra\u2010fast response on ABA signaling we studied the response of selected mutants impaired in ABA and retrograde signaling to light stress using the assay described in Figure\u00a03(a). For this analysis we used aba\u20101, deficient in ABA biosynthesis, abi\u20101, deficient in ABA sensing via protein phosphatase 2C that is involved in NADPH oxidase activation in response to ABA, and abi\u20104 and gun\u20101, deficient in retrograde signaling from the chloroplast to the nuclei (Koussevitzky et\u00a0al., 2007; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a). As shown in Figure\u00a06(b), of the different mutants tested only the abi\u20101 mutant displayed enhanced tolerance to light stress, potentially due to an enhanced content of stress\u2010response transcripts or deficiency in ABA\u2010induced NADPH oxidase activation. Because protein phosphatase 2C (ABI\u20101) activity could be directly suppressed by enhanced H2O2 levels, or by enhanced ABA levels (through PYR/PYL; Mittler and Blumwald, 2015), the finding that the abi\u20101 mutant is impaired in the response to light stress could suggest that this protein is involved, via H2O2 and/or ABA, in early light stress responses in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, as shown in Figure\u00a06(c), a considerable overlap was found between the transcripts upregulated in untreated abi\u20101 plants (Hoth et\u00a0al., 2002; data obtained from the supplementary material therein) and the transcripts enhanced in plants subjected to 3\u2010h light stress (Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007) or the ultra\u2010fast high light (HL) treatment described in this work. This finding could suggest that in Arabidopsis deficiency in ABI\u20101 mimics some aspects of the light stress response and that the abi\u20101 mutant is more tolerant to light stress (Figure\u00a06b) because it already activates some of these responses.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Distribution of hormone\u2010 and reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2010response transcripts between the different ultra\u2010fast response clusters and tolerance of different mutants impaired in ABA and retrograde signaling to light stress.(a) Meta\u2010analysis of the different ultra\u2010fast clusters showing that Cluster I is distinct from Clusters II and III in its content of hormone\u2010response transcripts.

As can be seen in Figure\u00a07, some of the transcripts tested were found to be dependent on ROS scavenging (WRKY40), some were independent of ROS signaling/scavenging (WRKY18 and KMD1) and some were only partially dependent on ROS scavenging (Zat12). Interestingly, the response of all transcripts tested was unaltered in the rbohD mutant, suggesting that RBOHD may not be involved in the regulation of these transcripts and that the possible function of ABI1 in this response could be different from its function in classical ABA sensing. Further studies are of course required to unravel the role of ROS and ABA in the ultra\u2010fast response of plants to light stress.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Expression of four selected ultra\u2010fast transcripts in two genetic backgrounds impaired in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging (apx1 and cat2) and in a genetic background impaired in ROS signaling (rbohD).(a) WRKY40.(b) WRKY18.(c) Zat12.(d) KMD1.*P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01. DiscussionSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the ultra\u2010fast transcriptome response reported here is biologically\u2010important. It was composed of 731 transcripts that demonstrated an ordered and clustered response (Figure\u00a01, Tables S1\u2013S3 and S5\u2013S7); it included several ultra\u2010fast response\u2010specific transcripts that were required for acclimation to light stress (Figure\u00a03; Iida et\u00a0al., 2000); the different clusters included in the response were composed of transcripts with differential responsiveness to different abiotic/biotic stresses, ROS or hormones (Figures\u00a02 and \u200band6);6); expression of some of the transcripts involved in the response could be suppressed by transcriptional inhibitors (Figure\u00a04); and it included transcripts that responded differentially when studied in a genetic background that was altered in ROS scavenging responses (Figure\u00a07). Taken together, these observations indicate that very rapid responses at the mRNA level in plants could play an important biological role in the acclimation of plants to stress.It is possible that many of the ultra\u2010fast changes observed in the steady\u2010state transcript level in response to light stress in our study (Figure\u00a01a, b, Tables S1\u2013S3 and S5\u2013S7) were caused by post\u2010transcriptional alterations in RNA stability. Furthermore, many of the ultra\u2010fast response transcripts contained RNA\u2010destabilizing sequences, albeit not at a proportion higher than late (3\u00a0h) light stress\u2010response transcripts (Figure\u00a0S4). Nevertheless, the findings that transcriptional inhibitors suppressed the expression of some ultra\u2010fast response transcripts (Figure\u00a04), and that the ultra\u2010fast response could be observed via promoter::reporter constructs (Figure\u00a05), combined with several reports of stalled RNA polymerases found on the promoters of eukaryotic genes (Nechaev and Adelman, 2008; Levine, 2011; Kwak and Lis, 2013), strongly suggest that some of the ultra\u2010fast response transcripts reported here are regulated at the transcriptional level and could contain stalled but active RNA polymerases at their promoters. This possibility, combined with reported transcription rates of over 50\u00a0kb min\u22121 in eukaryotic cells (Maiuri et\u00a0al., 2011), could explain the rapid accumulation of some of the transcripts observed in our experiments (Figures\u00a01, \u200b,2,2, \u200b,3,3, \u200b,4,4, Tables S1\u2013S3), especially considering the relatively short length of Arabidopsis genes (average of 2000\u00a0bp; Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000). Differential RNA stability and stalled RNA polymerases could therefore provide a mechanistic explanation for the ultra\u2010fast transcriptome reprograming observed in response to light stress in Arabidopsis.In contrast to the rapid accumulation of different transcripts, the ultra\u2010fast transcriptome response of Arabidopsis to light stress included a rapid decline in the level of many transcripts (Figure\u00a0S1a, Tables S6 and S7). Genome\u2010wide analyses of decline of mRNA in Arabidopsis have revealed three different groups of transcripts that are prone to rapid mRNA decline: transcripts encoded by intronless genes, transcripts possessing destabilizing sequences in their 3\u2032 end and transcripts that are targets of microRNA regulation (Narsai et\u00a0al., 2007). In addition, uncapping\u2010mediated mRNA degradation was found to be associated with abiotic stress responses (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2013). Nevertheless, the majority of studies focusing on mRNA decline in plants did not use short time points such as 20 and 60\u00a0sec and further analysis is needed to decipher the mechanisms that regulate mRNA decline under the conditions described in this study.Taking into account the \u2018harsh\u2019 biological assay we used to define a function in light stress acclimation (i.e. cell death; Figure\u00a03), it is likely that many other transcripts identified by our transcriptome analysis could play a role in light stress acclimation, albeit less significant than prevention of cell death. The relationship between ROS and the expression of many of the genes identified by our analysis is unclear at present. High levels of ROS did not accumulate in cells during the first 0\u201390\u00a0sec of light stress (Figure\u00a01b), but the expression of some ultra\u2010fast response genes was dependent on ROS signaling (Figure\u00a07). This finding suggests that the high antioxidant capacity of plant cells is able to handle the initial rise in ROS produced during early stages of light stress (Figure\u00a01c), but that several genes that are highly sensitive to ROS levels still react (Figures\u00a01b and \u200band7).7). In addition to these, proteins inhibited by H2O2, such as ABI\u20101, could also be affected by low levels of ROS (Figure\u00a06b,\u00a0c). The rapid APX1\u2010dependent depletion of ascorbic acid levels in response to light stress (Figure\u00a01c) supports the hypothesis that plants have a high buffering capacity for rapid changes in ROS levels. Key players in the regulation of rapid transcriptional responses could therefore be localized and/or low\u2010level ROS signals, calcium signatures or ABI\u20101 and/or conjugated ABA (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; Mittler et\u00a0al., 2011, 2012; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a; Choi et\u00a0al., 2014; Gilroy et\u00a0al., 2014; Mittler and Blumwald, 2015).Abscisic acid was shown to play a key role in the response of plants to abiotic stresses, and ABA and ROS were shown to coordinate responses to the ROS wave in systemic tissues (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a; Mittler and Blumwald, 2015). Our findings that many of the ultra\u2010fast response transcripts are also ABA\u2010response transcripts (Figure\u00a06a) and that the abi\u20101 mutant has an impaired response to light stress (Figure\u00a06b) is therefore in line with the potential role of ABA in this response. Because, in addition to its function in the ABA pathway, the ABI\u20101 protein could also be directly inhibited by H2O2 (Mittler and Blumwald, 2015), an alternative explanation for our findings could also be that during the ultra\u2010fast response to light stress the little H2O2 that is accumulated is directly inhibiting this protein. In this case the deficiency in ABI\u20101 protein in the abi\u20101 mutant will mimic the response of these plants to light stress and pre\u2010condition them to resist light (Figure\u00a06b,\u00a0c). Further studies are required to address these possibilities.Virtually all time\u2010course omics studies of plant or animal responses to abiotic stress lack early time points (seconds to minutes; e.g. Hruz et\u00a0al., 2008). Our findings demonstrate that during these early stages of the stress response the cell undergoes a reprogramming of its transcriptome that could affect the activation of signal transduction pathways and the establishment of successful acclimation. The large number of transcripts that respond to light stress within 20\u201360\u00a0sec in Arabidopsis, uncovered by our analysis (Figure\u00a01, Tables S1\u2013S3 and S5\u2013S7), combined with the important role that some of these early response transcripts play in light stress tolerance (Figure\u00a03; Iida et\u00a0al., 2000), highlight the importance of these early stages for plant acclimation. Further characterization of these transcripts, as well as additional studies of the ultra\u2010fast response of plants to other abiotic and biotic stresses, could lead to the development of new and novel approaches to enhance the tolerance of plants and crops to different environmental stresses using pathways and compounds that were not previously known, or considered to be involved in abiotic stress. Experimental proceduresPlant material and growth conditions\nArabidopsis thaliana Col\u20100 (cv. Columbia\u20100), WS\u20100 (cv. Wassilewskija\u20100), Ler\u20100 (cv. Landsberg erecta), rbohD, apx1, aba1, abi1, antisense Cat2 (Torres et\u00a0al., 2002; Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005a; Koussevitzky et\u00a0al., 2007; Vanderauwera et\u00a0al., 2011; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a,b) and confirmed knockout lines for 70 genes encoding high\u2010light\u2010response transcripts (O'Malley and Ecker, 2010; Table\u00a0S1) were grown in peat pellets (Jiffy\u20107, Jiffy, http://www.jiffygroup.com/en/) or soil mixture (MetroMix 200, SUN GRO, http://www.sungro.com/) in 9\u00a0x\u00a09\u00a0x\u00a06\u00a0cm3 pots covered with a fiberglass screen net at 23\u00b0C under constant low light (50\u00a0\u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121). Knockout lines were obtained from ABRC (http://abrc.osu.edu/) and bulked together with wild\u2010type seeds under carefully controlled growth conditions as previously described (Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2011; Luhua et\u00a0al., 2013). Zat12::luc plants were obtained as described in Miller et\u00a0al. (2009). A similar strategy was also used to fuse the promoters of Zat12 (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009) and WRKY40 (1.2\u00a0kb), to the unstable form of Luciferase [Promega, http://www.promega.com/; pGL4.11(luc2p), designated here as LucU] (Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005b; Miller et\u00a0al., 2009). Luciferase activity was imaged as described by Miller et\u00a0al. (2009). One leaf of 16\u2010 to 20\u2010day\u2010old plants was sprayed with 1\u00a0mm luciferin (GOLD Biotechnology, https://www.goldbio.com/), exposed to light stress (1500\u00a0\u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121) using a goose neck bulb, and imaged using a NightOWL LB983 NC100 (Berthold, https://www.berthold.com/) imager. Images were captured every 10\u00a0sec for 300\u00a0sec. Bioluminescence in photon counts sec\u22121 was measured using indigo v.2.0.3.0 (Berthold). Treated samples were compared to their respective controls and graphed.Light stress treatmentFor RNA\u2010Seq, qPCR analyses and measurements of H2O2 and ascorbic acid, 15\u201320 plants grown in pots for 18\u201321\u00a0days as described above were exposed to a light intensity of 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121 at 21\u00b0C for periods of 0, 20 and 60 sec, 0, 10, 60 and 300 sec, or 0, 20, 30, 60 and 90\u00a0sec in a growth chamber (E\u201030\u2010HB, Percival Scientific, http://www.percival-scientific.com/). Samples were collected by immediately dipping the pots in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were then cut onto aluminum foil, ground and transferred into 1.5\u2010ml tubes (about 100\u2013150\u00a0mg per tube). Samples were kept frozen during the entire collecting process and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For treatment with transcriptional inhibitors, plants grown in pots were sprayed with water, 10\u00a0\u03bcm \u03b1\u2010amanitin or 75\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 actinomycin D and incubated for 90\u00a0min at room temperature (21\u00b0C) prior to exposure to light stress for periods of 0, 20 and 60 sec. To test the tolerance of plants to light stress, one fully expanded rosette leaf of 21\u2010 to 25\u2010day\u2010old plants grown on peat pellets was exposed to 2000\u00a0\u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121\u00a0high light for 1\u00a0h using a gooseneck light source (ACE I; Schott, http://www.amscope.com/). Leaves were then photographed and analyzed for electrolyte leakage as described below.RNA\u2010Seq, qRT\u2010PCR, meta\u2010analyses and ascorbic acid measurementsFor RNA\u2010Seq analysis, three independent biological replicates, each composed of leaves pooled from at least 30 different plants in three technical repeats, were used for each experimental condition. Total RNA was isolated and purified as described in Suzuki et\u00a0al. (2013a) and RNA\u2010Seq analysis was conducted using an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the University of Wisconsin\u2010Madison Biotechnology Gene Expression Center. Gene Ontology annotations of the transcripts identified by our RNA\u2010seq analyses were performed using PANTHER (http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/) or obtained from TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp). Quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) was performed as previously described (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a) using a StepOnePlusTM Real\u2010Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/). The qPCR data were analyzed with steponeplus software v.2.0.1 (Applied Biosystems). Threshold cycle values for Zat12, WRKY18, WRKY40, APX1, RbohD, GNAT5 and KMD1 were calculated with the CT of EF1\u2010a as an internal control. Primer pairs used for amplifications are shown in Table\u00a0S9. The overlap between transcripts enhanced in leaves in response to short\u2010term high\u2010light exposure and transcripts enhanced in response to ABA, ethylene (ACC), brassinolide (BL), cytokinin (CK), gibberellin (GA), auxin (IAA), methyl jasmonate (MJ), salicylic acid (SA), H2O2, O2\u2212 or 1O2 (Davletova et\u00a0al., 2005b; Gadjev et\u00a0al., 2006; Nemhauser et\u00a0al., 2006; Scarpeci et\u00a0al., 2008; Blanco et\u00a0al., 2009), or in response to different abiotic stresses (Tosti et\u00a0al., 2006; Truman et\u00a0al., 2006; Kleine et\u00a0al., 2007; Huang et\u00a0al., 2008; Larkindale and Vierling, 2008; Matsui et\u00a0al., 2008; Consales et\u00a0al., 2012; Ding et\u00a0al., 2014), was determined as previously described (Miller et\u00a0al., 2009; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a). Levels of ascorbic acid were measured by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2010MS) analysis and expressed as relative to an internal control (ribitol) as previously described (Rizhsky et\u00a0al., 2004; Suzuki et\u00a0al., 2013a).H2O2 measurementThe accumulation of H2O2 in tissues exposed to the short\u2010term light stress was measured using Amplex Red (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/). Five hundred microliters of 50\u2010mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 50\u00a0\u03bcm Amplex Red and 0.05 U\u00a0ml\u22121 horseradish peroxidase was added to ground tissues and samples were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 12\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. Following the centrifugation, 450\u00a0\u03bcl of supernatant was transferred into fresh tubes and incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in the dark. Absorbance at 560\u00a0nm was then measured and the concentration of H2O2 in each sample was determined from a standard curve consisting of 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 9\u00a0\u03bcm of H2O2. Following the measurement of absorbance, tissue samples were completely dried using a speed vacuum concentrator at 30\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min and H2O2 accumulation per mg dry weight was calculated.Electrolyte leakage assayElectrolyte leakage was measured as described by Sung and Guy (2003) with minor modifications. Briefly, one fully expanded leaf exposed to high light as described above was excised and immersed in 10\u00a0ml of distilled, deionized water in a 50\u2010ml Falcon tube. Samples were shaken for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and the conductivity of the water was measured using a conductivity meter (Sung and Guy, 2003). Samples were then heated to 95\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min using a heat block, shaken for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and the conductivity of the water was measured again. The percentage of electrolyte leakage was calculated as the percentage of the conductivity before heating over that after heating.Statistical analysisWe performed next generation RNA\u2010Seq for differential expression profiling and characterization of transcript processing events. Three biological replicates were obtained as described above. Paired\u2010end Illumina sequencing generated on average 21 million read pairs per sample, with each sequence read having a length of 101 nucleotides. We utilized the services of frequently used, publicly available RNA\u2010Seq analysis software, namely bowtie (Langmead et\u00a0al., 2009), tophat (Trapnell et\u00a0al., 2009) and cufflinks (Trapnell et\u00a0al., 2010), for alignment of paired\u2010end reads onto the reference genome, parsing the alignment to infer the exon\u2013exon splice junctions, and performing the differential expression analysis of annotated genes. Transcripts expressing differentially in two (or more) conditions were identified by examining the difference in their abundance under the two conditions. The abundance of a transcript is measured in terms of FPKM, normalized for the transcript length and total number of cDNA fragments for a sample replicate. The difference in expression was obtained as the log of fold change in abundance between the two conditions. A test of statistical significance for differential expression of each transcript was performed based on a negative binomial model estimated from the data (Trapnell et\u00a0al., 2010). The fold change of genes with multiple isoforms was assessed by summing up the FPKMs for all isoforms of a gene and then measuring the difference between the two conditions (Trapnell et\u00a0al., 2010). Other statistical analyses were performed by one\u2010tailed Student's t\u2010test as previously described in Suzuki et al. (2013a) . Results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (*P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).We extracted three distinctive patterns representing elevation in steady\u2010state transcript level at 20 or 60\u00a0sec or both using a Fortran code on a Unix platform: Cluster I, elevation of steady\u2010state transcript level at 20\u00a0sec followed by decline at 60\u00a0sec; Cluster II, elevation of steady\u2010state transcript level at 60\u00a0sec with no significant change at 20\u00a0sec; and Cluster III, elevation of steady\u2010state transcript level at 20\u00a0sec and 60\u00a0sec. Elevation or decline in steady\u2010state transcript level at a particular time point indicated a statistically significant increase or decrease, respectively, in steady\u2010state transcript level relative to the previous time point. Steady\u2010state transcript level refers to transcript abundance which is measured in terms of FPKM, normalized for the transcript length and total number of cDNA fragments for a replicate sample.
