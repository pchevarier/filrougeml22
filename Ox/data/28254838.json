Together with Larp7 (La\u2010related protein 7) and MePCE (methylphosphate capping enzyme; Jeronimo et\u00a0al, 2007; He et\u00a0al, 2008; Krueger et\u00a0al, 2008; Markert et\u00a0al, 2008), it forms the 7SK snRNP that is a central regulator of RNAPII\u2010mediated pre\u2010mRNA elongation (Peterlin et\u00a0al, 2011; Zhou et\u00a0al, 2012). Shortly after transcription initiation, RNAPII is frequently arrested by negative elongation factors (NELFs). To convert promoter\u2010proximally paused RNAPII into elongation\u2010competent polymerase, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb), a cyclin\u2010dependent protein kinase comprising Cdk9 and cyclin T1 (CycT1) or CycT2, phosphorylates NELFs and the YSPTSPS heptapeptide repeat of the C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII at Ser2 (Price, 2000; Peterlin & Price, 2006; Zhou et\u00a0al, 2012; Smith & Shilatifard, 2013). The nuclear level of active P\u2010TEFb is controlled primarily by the 7SK snRNP (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2001; Yang et\u00a0al, 2001). In collaboration with HEXIM (hexamethylene bisacetamide\u2010inducible protein), the 7SK snRNP sequesters P\u2010TEFb into the large kinase\u2010inactive 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb RNP (Michels et\u00a0al, 2004; Barboric et\u00a0al, 2007). Dynamic association of 7SK snRNP with P\u2010TEFb adjusts the level of active P\u2010TEFb to the actual transcriptional condition of the cell. Upon transcriptional stimuli, the 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb negative transcriptional regulatory RNP disassembles and the free 7SK snRNP associates with a set of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins, including hnRNP A1, A2/B1, R, and Q (Barrandon et\u00a0al, 2007; Van Herreweghe et\u00a0al, 2007). The released active P\u2010TEFb is recruited to the transcriptionally active chromatin by several factors including the super elongation complexes (SECs; Mueller et\u00a0al, 2009; He et\u00a0al, 2010; Lin et\u00a0al, 2010; Sobhian et\u00a0al, 2010; Yokoyama et\u00a0al, 2010). SECs promote suppression of promoter proximal RNAPII pausing and increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation (Luo et\u00a0al, 2012; Zhou et\u00a0al, 2012). Mammalian SECs are related multiprotein complexes composed of different combinations of the four AF4/FRM2 family proteins (AFF1, AFF2, AFF3, or AFF4), the eleven\u2010nineteen lysine\u2010rich leukemia family RNAPII elongation factors (ELL1, ELL2, or ELL3), the ELL\u2010associated factors (EAF1 or EAF2), and finally the eleven\u2010nineteen leukemia (ENL) protein or the highly similar ALL1\u2010fused gene from chromosome 9 (AF9) protein.RNAPII also participates in the synthesis of the major (U1, U2, U4, and U5) and minor (U11, U12, and U4atac) spliceosomal snRNAs, the U7 snRNA involved in histone mRNA 3\u2032\u2010end processing and the U3, U8, and U13 ribosomal processing snoRNAs (Hernandez, 1992). Transcription of RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes is governed by three major regulatory elements, the distal sequence element (DSE) that functions as a classical transcriptional enhancer, the proximal sequence element (PSE) that coordinates transcription initiation through binding the snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc, also called PSE\u2010binding transcription factor, PTF), and finally the 3\u2032\u2010box that directs co\u2010transcriptional RNA 3\u2032\u2010end processing (Henry et\u00a0al, 1998; Hernandez, 2001; Egloff et\u00a0al, 2008; Jawdekar & Henry, 2008). RNAPII engaged in snRNA gene transcription shows elevated CTD phosphorylation at Ser5 and Ser7 and weak phosphorylation at Ser2 (Glover\u2010Cutter et\u00a0al, 2009). Transcription elongation on snRNA genes does not depend on P\u2010TEFb activity and Ser2 phosphorylation (Medlin et\u00a0al, 2005). Instead, together with Ser7\u2010P, Ser2\u2010P coordinates the recruitment of the Integrator complex directing the 3\u2032\u2010end cleavage of nascent snRNA transcripts (Baillat et\u00a0al, 2005; Egloff et\u00a0al, 2007, 2010).Recently, it has been demonstrated that efficient sn/snoRNA synthesis by RNAPII requires an additional snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor termed the little elongation complex (LEC) that shares some structural and functional properties with SECs (Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013). In addition to the LEC\u2010specific Ice1 and Ice2 proteins, Drosophila LEC also contains the ELL1 and EAF1/2 subunits of SEC. Instead of EAF1/2, the human LEC associates with the ZC3H8 zinc finger protein that lacks an apparent Drosophila homologue. LEC has a dual function in snRNA gene expression; it facilitates RNAPII loading onto the promoters of snRNA genes through an Ice1\u2010dependent mechanism and promotes the elongation capacity of RNAPII in an ELL\u2010dependent manner (Hu et\u00a0al, 2013).In this study, we demonstrate that the human 7SK/MePCE/Larp7 snRNP is an essential component of the snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor LEC. The 7SK snRNP is required for the integrity and correct subnuclear localization of LEC, and it supports efficient loading of LEC and RNAPII onto sn/snoRNA genes. Thus, besides controlling the elongation phase of mRNA transcription, the 7SK snRNP also functions as a canonical transcription factor promoting synthesis of RNAPII\u2010transcribed sn/snoRNAs. Results7SK snRNA co\u2010purifies with RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser5 and\u00a0Ser7To test whether the 7SK transcriptional regulatory snRNP can directly interact with RNAPII, HeLa RNAPII complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the N\u2010terminal region or against the CTD of the largest subunit of RNAPII, Rpb1, phosphorylated at Ser2, Ser5, or Ser7. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of RNAPII by the four different antibodies was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig\u00a01, lower panel, lanes 3\u20136). RNAs co\u2010precipitated with the four RNAPII samples were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with a mixture of oligonucleotide probes complementary to the 7SK, U1, and U2 snRNAs (upper panel). In the anti\u2010Ser5\u2010P and anti\u2010Ser7\u2010P IP reactions, the 7SK snRNA was highly enriched compared to the U1 and U2 control RNAs (lanes 5 and 6). Since the anti\u2010Rpb1 antibody that reacted mostly with the unphosphorylated form of RNAPII (lower band) recovered 7SK snRNA with very low efficiency (lane 3, and data not shown), we concluded that the human 7SK snRNP preferentially associates with a small fraction of RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser5 and Ser7.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Human 7SK snRNA interacts with RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser5 and Ser7HeLa RNAPII was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the N\u2010terminal part of the largest RNAPII subunit Rpb1 (\u03b1\u2010Rpb1), and for the CTD of Rpb1 phosphorylated at Ser2 (\u03b1\u2010Ser2\u2010P), Ser5 (\u03b1\u2010Ser5\u2010P), or Ser7 (\u03b1\u2010Ser7\u2010P). Recovery of RNAPII was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the \u03b1\u2010Rpb1 antibody. Co\u2010IP of 7SK, U1, and U2 snRNAs was measured by Northern blot analysis. Total cell extract (Ext) representing 1% of the input was also analyzed. Control IP performed without antibody (no AB) was also analyzed.

We performed chromatin IP and high\u2010throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP\u2010seq) experiments using a polyclonal population of HeLa cells stably expressing a Flag\u2010tagged version of the 7SK snRNP protein Larp7 (FL\u2010Larp7) and an anti\u2010Flag antibody, because commercially available Larp7 antisera performed poorly in ChIP analysis (our unpublished data). HeLa cells expressing FL\u2010Larp7 showed no detectable global Larp7 overaccumulation, although the majority of the cells showed FL\u2010Larp7 expression by immunostaining with an anti\u2010Flag antibody (Fig\u00a0EV1A, lane 4, and Fig\u00a0EV1B). Larp7 was selected for our ChIP\u2010seq analysis because the other 7SK core protein MePCE also interacts with the U6 spliceosomal snRNA (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2013). We also determined the genomewide distribution of RNAPII with the anti\u2010Rpb1 antibody that recognizes the N\u2010terminus of Rpb1. Mapping of the obtained ChIP\u2010seq datasets to the human genome sequence (UCSC Genome Browser) identified a set of genomic sites (<\u00a0100) with significant Larp7 enrichments. Plotting of Larp7 occupancy against RNAPII distribution revealed that the majority of genomic sites marked by solid Larp7 and RNAPII co\u2010occupancy corresponded to RNAPII\u2010transcribed spliceosomal snRNA (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U4atac) and ribosomal processing snoRNA (U3, U8, and U13) genes (Fig\u00a02A, red dots). Apart from the obvious exception of the NEAT1 long non\u2010coding RNA gene, the remaining Larp7\u2010bound genomic sites which corresponded to known or predicted protein\u2010 or non\u2010protein\u2010coding transcription units showed no (data not shown) or low RNAPII occupancy (gray dots), as compared to the RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes.

Extracts prepared from cells expressing FL\u2010HEXIM1 (lane 2), FL\u2010MePCE (lane 3), FL\u2010Larp7 (lane 4) or from non\u2010transfected (NT) control cells (lane 1) were analyzed by Western blotting with anti\u2010Larp7, anti\u2010MePCE, anti\u2010HEXIM1, and as a loading control, with anti\u2010hnRNP A1 antibodies.

The RNAPII occupancy levels indicate the numbers of extended read fragments per million (rpm) within\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0bp of the Larp7 peaks. The complete list of Larp7\u2010associated genes with significant RNAPII co\u2010occupancy represented by at least 50 reads (indicated by gray and red dots) is shown in Table\u00a0EV1.Representative genome browser track examples displaying read coverage profiles for Larp7 and RNAPII on HeLa snRNA (U1, U2), snoRNA (U3, SNORD13), and protein\u2010coding (TTI2 and c\u2010Myc) genes.\nAs representative examples, Larp7 and RNAPII occupancies on a few snRNA (U1 and U2) and snoRNA (U3 and U13) genes as well as on the TTI2 and c\u2010Myc protein\u2010coding genes are shown in Figs\u00a02B and EV5. The similar coverage profiles of RNAPII and Larp7 observed on sn/snoRNA genes support the idea that Larp7 interacts with RNAPII engaged in sn/snoRNA transcription. In contrast, Larp7 showed no apparent co\u2010occupancy with promoter\u2010proximally paused RNAPII on the inducible TTI2 gene or with RNAPII distributed on the actively transcribed P\u2010TEFb\u2010dependent c\u2010Myc gene.Open in a separate windowFigure EV5Larp7, 7SK, and the little elongation complex are enriched on RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes\nRepresentative genome browser track examples displaying read coverage profiles for 7SK, FL\u2010Larp7, RNAPII, Ice1, Ice2, ZC3H8, and their respective negative controls on human U3A and U3C and U13 snoRNA genes. The 7SK ChIRP\u2010seq (two independent datasets) and the Ice1, Ice2, and ZC3H8 ChIP\u2010seq datasets have been published (Hu et\u00a0al, 2013; Flynn et\u00a0al, 2016). Adapters were trimmed with Cutadapt v. 1.9.1 with the following constant parameters: \u2013minimum\u2010length 10 \u2013q 15, 10 \u2013\u2010max\u2010n 1 (Martin, 2011). The obtained sequences were mapped to the human Hg19 reference sequence with Bowtie2 v. 2.2.5 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012). Unmapped reads were removed with SAMtools v. 1.3.1 (Li et\u00a0al, 2009). Mapped reads were then de\u2010duplicated using Picard to remove PCR\u2010duplicates. Bam files were sorted and indexed with SAMtools. Trackhubs in the UCSC browser were created by employing deepTools2 v. 2.2.4 bamCoverage tool with the following parameters: \u2010bs 10 \u2013normalizeUsingRPKM \u2010e 200 \u2013p max (Ramirez et\u00a0al, 2016).Profiles of Larp7, RNAPII (left panel, this study), and 7SK (right panel, Flynn et\u00a0al, 2016) and their respective negative controls across the U2 snRNA repeat genes (RNAU2). The number of mapped reads to the RNU2 gene for each ChIP/ChIRP\u2010seq was normalized to reads per million (RPM). Adapters trimmed sequences were mapped to the human RNU2 repeat (GenBank: {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U57614.1\",\"term_id\":\"1373285\",\"term_text\":\"U57614.1\"}}U57614.1) with Bowtie2. Unmapped reads were removed with SAMtools. Mapped reads were then de\u2010duplicated using Picard to remove PCR\u2010duplicates. Bam files were sorted and indexed with SAMtools. Mapped reads were scaled to one million, and read coverages across the RNU2 repeat were visualized with Bedtools v. 2.23 genomecov tool (Quinlan & Hall, 2010).

All these factors show a strong preference for sn/snoRNA genes compared to protein\u2010coding genes. For retrieving non\u2010overlapping transcription units, the GENCODE V19 annotation was parsed using a custom Python script to keep only non\u2010overlapping transcription units within a region of 2.5\u00a0kb upstream of the TSS and 2.5\u00a0kb downstream of the TES. Protein occupancy was then calculated on non\u2010overlapping protein\u2010 and sn/snoRNA\u2010coding genes. Input and IP coverage were computed with SAMtools bedcov tool across the gene body (GB: TSS to TES) and normalized to reads per million (RPM). The Input value was subtracted to the IP value and then divided by the transcription unit size. Only transcription unit with a protein occupancy above 0 were kept. The protein occupancy is therefore defined as: log10((GB IP \u00d7 RPM)\u2212(GB Input \u00d7 RPM))/(lengthGB). Boxplots were created with GraphPad Prism 6. The number of genes in each category is indicated. P\u2010values were computed by a Wilcoxon rank sum test in R. Horizontal lines: median; box ranges: third/upper quartile (75%) \u2013 first/lower quartile (25%); error bars: maximum and minimum values.\nTo validate our Larp7 ChIP\u2010seq data, we performed ChIP\u2010quantitative PCR (ChIP\u2010qPCR) experiments to directly assess the interaction of Larp7 with several selected HeLa snRNA, snoRNA, and protein\u2010coding genes (Fig\u00a03A). All of the tested RNAPII\u2010transcribed snRNA (U1, U2, and U4) and snoRNA (U3, U8) genes showed strong enrichments for Larp7, as compared to a randomly selected intergenic region that was used as negative control. In contrast, no significant Larp7 occupancy was measured at the promoters of the c\u2010Myc, PCNA, GAPDH, c\u2010Fos, cyclin D1, and TGM2 protein\u2010coding genes or at the intron\u2010encoded SNORA55 and SNORA74 snoRNA and the RNAPIII\u2010transcribed U6 snRNA genes.Open in a separate windowFigure 3ChIP\u2010qPCR validation of Larp7 interaction with RNAPII\u2010specific snRNA genes in HeLa cells\nAssociation of FL\u2010Larp7 with various classes of human genes.

Other details are identical to panel (A).ChIRP\u2010qPCR analyses of 7SK and U1 snRNAs occupancy of U2, 7SL, and hnRNP H1 genes. Biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to the C178\u2010A197 (7SK\u20101), C221\u2010G241 (7SK\u20102), and G272\u2010C291 (7SK\u20103) sequences of the 7SK snRNA or to the A1\u2010G20 sequences of the U1 snRNA were used for RNA affinity selection from a cross\u2010linked and sonicated HeLa cell extract. Chromatin DNAs co\u2010purified with 7SK and U1 snRNAs were analyzed by qPCR using U2, 7SL, and hnRNP H1 gene\u2010specific primers. Bar graphs represent mean values of three replicates. Error bars represent standard deviations.\nNext, we further interrogated RNAPII, Larp7, and MePCE occupancy at various regions (R1\u2013R5) of the human U2 snRNA gene by ChIP\u2010qPCR (Fig\u00a03B). Due to the lack of MePCE antibody competent for ChIP, polyclonal HeLa cell populations stably expressing flag\u2010tagged MePCE (FL\u2010MePCE) and Larp7 (FL\u2010Larp7) were used. The R2 promoter region of the U2 gene was highly enriched for RNAPII, FL\u2010Larp7, FL\u2010MePCE as well as for ELL, an essential component of the snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor LEC (Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013). DNA fragments immediately following the U2 coding region (R3) or situated further downstream (R4) showed decreasing RNAPII, FL\u2010Larp7, FL\u2010MePCE, and ELL occupancy. None of the tested proteins were enriched at the R1 and R5 intergenic control regions located 1,422\u00a0bp upstream and 737\u00a0bp downstream of the U2 RNA encoding region. In contrast to the FL\u2010Larp7 and FL\u2010MePCE 7SK core proteins, we failed to detect FL\u2010HEXIM1 enrichment on the U2 gene, suggesting that that the 7SK core snRNP associates with the U2 snRNA gene.To demonstrate that the 7SK snRNA also associates with RNAPII\u2010transcribed snRNA genes, we performed ChIRP (chromatin isolation by RNA purification)\u2010qPCR experiments (Chu et\u00a0al, 2011). After in\u00a0vivo cross\u2010linking and chromatin fragmentation, the 7SK and as a negative control, the U1 snRNA was affinity\u2010selected with biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to three internal regions of the 7SK (7SK\u20101, 7SK\u20102, and 7SK\u20103) and to the 5\u2032\u2010terminal region of U1 snRNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the 7SK and U1 target RNAs were recovered with great efficiency and specificity (Fig\u00a0EV2A). Analysis of the co\u2010purified genomic DNAs by qPCR detected no significant U1 snRNA occupancy on the U2, 7SL, and hnRNP H1 genes (Fig\u00a03C). However, the 7SK snRNA showed increased association with the U2 gene in the three independent ChIRP\u2010qPCR experiments [t\u2010statistics 6.65 (7SK\u20101), 4.68 (7SK\u20102), and 4.58 (7SK\u20103) with P\u2010values of \u2264\u00a00.01]. We failed to detect significant 7SK snRNA association with the 7SL and hnRNP H1 control genes. We also measured an increased 7SK occupancy on\u00a0the U1 snRNA gene that also showed an extremely strong association with U1 snRNA sequences, likely representing nascent U1 transcripts (Fig EV2B).Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Association of 7SK and U1 snRNAs with HeLa U1, 7SK, and 7SL genes was analyzed by ChIRP (chromatin isolation by RNA purification)\u2010qPCR (see also Fig\u00a03C)\nAffinity selection of U1 and 7SK snRNAs. Biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to the U1 or to the 7SK (7SK\u20101, 7SK\u20102, and 7SK\u20103) snRNA were used for streptavidin affinity selection of U1 and 7SK snRNAs from an extract (Ext) prepared from in\u00a0vivo cross\u2010linked HeLa cells. Recovery of U1 and 7SK snRNAs was monitored by Northern blot analysis with a mixture of U1\u2010 and 7SK\u2010specific oligonucleotide probes.

The bar graphs indicate the relative enrichment of genomic U1, 7SK, and 7SL DNA association with U1 and 7SK snRNAs over the input control, upon correction with background values obtained by control selections with non\u2010specific oligonucleotides. The observed extremely strong association of U1 and 7SK snRNAs with their own genes is most probably due to transient accumulation of the nascent snRNA transcripts at the site of transcription. Please note that 7SK snRNA shows similar levels of accumulation on the U1 and U2 snRNA genes (see Fig\u00a03C). Bars represent the mean from three independent experiments, and error bars correspond to standard deviation.\nWe concluded that all components of the 7SK core snRNP, including Larp7, MePCE, and the 7SK snRNA, accumulate at the U2 and probably other RNAPII\u2010specific snRNA genes (see Discussion). These observations, together with the finding that 7SK snRNA associates with RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser5 and Ser7 and non\u2010phosphorylated at Ser2, a CTD phosphorylation pattern similar to that observed for RNAPII engaged in snRNA synthesis (Glover\u2010Cutter et\u00a0al, 2009), strongly suggested that the human 7SK snRNP participates in sn/snoRNA gene expression.Depletion of 7SK snRNP inhibits transcription of RNAPII\u2010specific snRNA genesTo test whether the 7SK snRNP is required for expression of RNAPII\u2010transcribed sn/snoRNA genes, Larp7 was depleted by RNA interference (RNAi). Transfection of HeLa cells with a Larp7\u2010specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) knocked down Larp7 expression about 90% as compared to cells treated with control siRNA (Fig\u00a04A). As expected, depletion of Larp7 largely diminished the level of 7SK snRNA, but had no detectable effect on the accumulation of HEXIM1, Cdk9, CycT1, and hnRNP A1 (He et\u00a0al, 2008; Krueger et\u00a0al, 2008; Markert et\u00a0al, 2008). Accumulation of several RNAPII\u2010 and RNAPIII\u2010synthesized small RNAs as well as a few mRNAs was measured in the Larp7\u2010depleted cells by Northern blot analysis and/or by quantitative RT\u2013PCR (Fig\u00a04A and B). Depletion of 7SK snRNP largely reduced accumulation of the RNAPII\u2010synthesized U1, U2, U4, and U5 spliceosomal snRNAs and the U3 and U8 snoRNAs. Larp7 depletion also inhibited accumulation of the newly synthesized precursor (pre\u2010)U2 snRNA that carries a short 3\u2032\u2010terminal tail. This indicated that the 7SK snRNP promotes snRNP biogenesis at the level of snRNA synthesis, rather than facilitating pre\u2010snRNA maturation and/or snRNP assembly. In contrast, Larp7 depletion had no significant effect on the accumulation of the RNAPIII\u2010transcribed signal recognition particle RNA (7SL RNA), the U6 spliceosomal snRNA, and the 5S rRNA. Likewise, expression of the tested GAPDH, \u03b2\u2010actin, c\u2010Myc, c\u2010Fos, CD44, and Gadd45b mRNAs or the U19 and U64 snoRNAs which are processed from pre\u2010mRNA introns showed no significant alteration upon Larp7 and 7SK snRNA depletion, indicating that the nuclear P\u2010TEFb activity is not limiting for expression of protein\u2010coding genes in HeLa cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Knockdown of 7SK snRNP inhibits RNAPII\u2010mediated synthesis of snRNAs and snoRNAs\nLarp7 depletion reduces the accumulation of RNAPII\u2010synthesized snRNAs and snoRNAs. HeLa cells were transfected twice (at 0 and 48\u00a0h) with Larp7\u2010specific or non\u2010targeting control siRNAs and incubated for additional 24\u00a0h. RNAs were isolated and size\u2010fractionated on a sequencing gel, electroblotted onto a nylon membrane, and probed with sequence\u2010specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes as indicated. Accumulation of Larp7, HEXIM1, Cdk9, CycT1, and hnRNP A1 was monitored by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies.Relative expression of selected protein\u2010coding genes (black bars), RNAPII (gray bars)\u2010, and RNAPIII\u2010specific (white bars) small RNA genes was determined by RT\u2010qPCR in HeLa cells in response to siRNA\u2010mediated Larp7 depletion. The signals were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels that showed no significant change after siRNA treatment. Bars indicate average values of three independent experiments with error bars representing standard deviations.Knockdown of 7SK snRNA by RNA interference inhibits accumulation of RNAPII\u2010synthesized small nuclear RNAs. Other details are identical to panel (A).Nuclear run\u2010on assay. Transcriptionally active nuclei isolated from HeLa cells transfected with Larp7\u2010 and Ice1\u2010specific or with non\u2010targeting control siRNA were incubated with radiolabeled uridine 5\u2032\u2010[\u03b1\u201032P]\u2010triphosphate. After RNA extraction, the newly synthesized internally labeled RNAs were partially hydrolyzed and reacted with immobilized oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the U1, U2, U6, 5S, and 7SL RNAs. As negative controls, sense U1 and U2 oligonucleotides were used.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nThe facts that Larp7 is required for 7SK snRNA stability (Fig\u00a04B) and that all components of the 7SK core snRNP associate with the U2 snRNA gene (Fig\u00a03) strongly suggested that Larp7 promotes sn/snoRNA synthesis as an integral component of the 7SK snRNP. To unambiguously verify this conclusion, we also investigated the effect of targeted 7SK snRNA depletion on sn/snoRNA expression (Fig\u00a04C). Suppression of 7SK snRNA accumulation with a 7SK\u2010specific siRNA greatly inhibited accumulation of the RNAPII\u2010transcribed U1, U2, and U3 RNAs, but failed to compromise Larp7 and HEXIM1 accumulation, excluding the formal possibility that Larp7 promotes snRNA synthesis in a 7SK\u2010independent fashion. As expected, 7SK depletion did not alter the level of the RNAPIII\u2010synthesized U6 snRNA.To corroborate the conclusion that 7SK snRNP promotes the synthesis of RNAPII\u2010transcribed snRNAs, instead of facilitating snRNP assembly, we performed nuclear run\u2010on assays to compare the rates of nascent snRNA synthesis in Larp7\u2010depleted and control HeLa cells (Fig\u00a04D). Probing of antisense U1, U2, U6, 5S, and 7SL oligonucleotide blots with internally labeled nuclear run\u2010on test RNAs showed that Larp7 depletion inhibited the synthesis of nascent U1 and U2 snRNAs by about 50%, but had no significant effect on the production of the RNAPIII\u2010specific U6, 5S, and 7SL RNAs (for quantitation, see Fig\u00a0EV3). Immobilized sense U1 and U2 control oligonucleotides failed to react with the nuclear run\u2010on test RNAs. As reported before (Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013), depletion of the Ice1 subunit of the snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor LEC also inhibited U1 and U2 snRNA transcription by about 50%. Thus, the 7SK snRNP, like the previously described LEC, is required for efficient transcription of RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Nuclear run\u2010onNuclear run\u2010on analysis was performed to determine the relative levels of RNAPII\u2010mediated synthesis of nascent HeLa U1 and U2 snRNAs in Ice1\u2010 and Larp7\u2010depleted and in control cells (see Fig\u00a04D). The transcription rates of the RNAPIII\u2010specific U6, 5S, and 7SL RNA genes were also measured. The obtained slot blot hybridization signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager. The nascent RNA levels detected in control cells treated with a non\u2010specific interfering RNA were considered as 100%.The 7SK snRNP associates with the little elongation complexEfficient expression of RNAPII\u2010transcribed snRNA genes requires at least three snRNA gene\u2010specific multiprotein transcription factors, the snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc), the Integrator complex, and the little elongation complex (LEC) (Henry et\u00a0al, 1998; Hernandez, 2001; Egloff et\u00a0al, 2008; Jawdekar & Henry, 2008). To test whether the 7SK snRNP promotes snRNA transcription through cooperation with any of these factors, HeLa LEC, SNAPc, and Integrator complex were immunoprecipitated and co\u2010purification of 7SK snRNA was monitored by Northern blot analysis (Fig\u00a05). IP of the Ice1 and Ice2 subunits of human LEC with specific antibodies recovered the 7SK snRNA, but failed to pull down the U2 and U6 snRNAs (Fig\u00a05A, lanes 4 and 5). Ice1 and Ice2 co\u2010purified with each other in both IP reactions, indicating that they were integrated into LEC. IP of two other components of human LEC, ELL and ZC3H8, also recovered 7SK RNA, demonstrating that the human 7SK snRNA interacts with LEC (Fig\u00a05B). In contrast, no detectable 7SK RNA was recovered upon IP of SNAPc with an antibody directed against its SNAPc2 subunit (Fig\u00a05A, lane 3). Finally, purification of the Integrator complex by IP of transiently expressed Flag\u2010tagged Integrator subunits Int7 and Int11 failed to recover 7SK RNA (Fig\u00a05C, lanes 2 and 3), although control IP of transiently expressed Flag\u2010tagged HEXIM1 pulled down 7SK snRNA (lane 4). We concluded that the 7SK snRNA interacts with the snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor LEC.Open in a separate windowFigure 5The human 7SK core snRNP interacts with the snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor LEC\n\nA\u2013C HeLa endogenous SNAPC2, Ice1, Ice2 (A), ELL and ZC3H8 (B), and transiently expressed FL\u2010Int7, FL\u2010Int11, and FL\u2010HEXIM1 proteins (C) were immunoprecipitated, and co\u2010purification of 7SK, U2, U6, or 7SK RNAs was monitored by Northern blot analysis.

Ice1, ZC3H8, ELL, and HEXIM1 were immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from HeLa cells either treated (+) on non\u2010treated with ActD. IP of Ice1, ZC3H8, ELL, and HEXIM1 was confirmed by Western blotting, and co\u2010precipitation of 7SK and 7SL RNAs was measured by Northern blot analysis.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nTo demonstrate that 7SK snRNA interacts with LEC in the form of 7SK snRNP, the 7SK core protein Larp7 was immunoprecipitated from a HeLa cell extract (Fig\u00a05D). Western blot analysis of the recovered proteins confirmed that in addition to the other 7SK core protein MePCE, the ELL and Ice2 LEC proteins also co\u2010purified with Larp7, while GAPDH, an unrelated control protein, was not detectable in the IP pellet (lane 3). Likewise, IP of Larp7 from a HeLa extract prepared from cells expressing Flag\u2010tagged ZC3H8 LEC protein efficiently recovered FL\u2010ZC3H8, demonstrating that the 7SK snRNP rather than naked 7SK RNA interacts with LEC (Fig\u00a05E, lane\u00a0\u00a03).Besides existing in the form of free snRNP, a fraction of the\u00a0human 7SK/MePCE/Larp7 snRNP is sequestered into large 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb and 7SK/hnRNP particles (see Introduction). Our results presented thus far are most consistent with the idea that the 7SK core snRNP, rather than any of the large 7SK complexes, promotes snRNA gene expression. To confirm this assumption, HeLa LEC was immunoprecipitated with an anti\u2010Ice2 antibody and the co\u2010purified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig\u00a05F). As expected, IP of Ice2 pulled down the ELL component of LEC as well as the 7SK snRNA and the two 7SK core proteins Larp7 and MePCE (lane 3). In contrast, the major 7SK cofactor directing P\u2010TEFb recruitment and inactivation, HEXIM1 (Michels et\u00a0al, 2004; Barboric et\u00a0al, 2007), failed to co\u2010purify with the 7SK/LEC RNP. Likewise, hnRNP A1, the most prominent component of 7SK/hnRNP particles (Barrandon et\u00a0al, 2007; Van Herreweghe et\u00a0al, 2007), also failed to co\u2010precipitate with the immunopurified 7SK/LEC RNP, corroborating the idea that the 7SK core snRNP interacts with LEC to promote RNAPII\u2010mediated snRNA synthesis.Transcription inhibition provokes rapid disassembly of 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb to increase the nuclear level of active P\u2010TEFb in order to alleviate RNAPII transcription blockade (Nguyen et\u00a0al, 2001; Yang et\u00a0al, 2001). Consistent with this, ActD treatment of HeLa cells largely abolished HEXIM1 interaction with 7SK snRNA, but at the same time, it significantly increased the Ice1, ZC3H8, and ELL association with 7SK, suggesting that at least a fraction of 7SK snRNP released from 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb can be incorporated into 7SK/LEC RNP (Fig\u00a05G). We propose that RNAPII inhibition increases the levels of active P\u2010TEFb and 7SK/LEC to promote both pre\u2010mRNA and sn/snoRNA synthesis.The 7SK snRNA is required for LEC integrity and recruitment to snRNA genesTo test whether integrity of the LEC protein complex is RNA\u2010dependent, extracts prepared from HeLa cells transiently expressing either FL\u2010Ice2 or FL\u2010ZC3H8 were subjected to RNase A treatment before IP of LEC with an anti\u2010ELL antibody (Fig\u00a06A). As demonstrated by Western blot analysis of the precipitated proteins, the RNase treatment largely reduced ELL association with both FL\u2010ZC3H8 and FL\u2010Ice2 (lanes 9 and 12). From the untreated control extracts, both FL\u2010ZC3H8 and FL\u2010Ice2 co\u2010purified with ELL (lanes 8 and 11), indicating that an RNA component is required for the structural integrity of human LEC.Open in a separate windowFigure 6The 7SK snRNA is required for the assembly and recruitment of LEC to snRNA genes\nRNase treatment disrupts LEC.

Depletion of 7SK and 7SL RNAs was monitored by Northern blotting.The 7SK snRNP is required for efficient recruitment of RNAPII and ELL to the U2 snRNA gene.

Depicted are means from three independent experiments, and error bars correspond to standard deviation. For other details, see Fig\u00a03.7SK snRNP promotes RNAPII loading onto the promoters of the U1 snRNA and U3 snoRNA genes. ChIP was performed with anti\u2010Rpb1 antibody from control and Larp7\u2010depleted cells. Co\u2010purification of U1, U3, U2, and GAPDH DNA was measured by qPCR using sequence\u2010specific primers. Other details are identical to panel (C).\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nTo confirm that the 7SK snRNA supports LEC stability, we investigated the integrity of LEC in 7SK\u2010depleted HeLa cells. Transfection of a 7SK\u2010specific interfering RNA largely diminished 7SK snRNA accumulation, but had no effect on the level of 7SL RNA (Fig\u00a06B, left panel). IP of ELL from the 7SK\u2010depleted extract failed to recover ZC3H8 (lane 6), although ZC3H8 co\u2010purified with ELL immunoprecipitated from the control cell extract (lane 5). Besides demonstrating that Larp7 and MePCE are unable to support in\u00a0vivo LEC stability in the absence of 7SK snRNA, these results also suggest that the 7SK snRNP plays a central role in structural organization of the 7SK/LEC RNP.Depletion of 7SK snRNP had no effect on the accumulation of LEC proteins including ELL, ZC3H8, and Ice1 that serves as the central scaffold for LEC assembly (Figs\u00a06B and EV4). This suggests that the compromised snRNA synthesis observed in 7SK\u2010depleted HeLa cells was due to reduced LEC recruitment to snRNA genes. To test this idea, we investigated the ELL occupancy at the R2 promoter region of the U2 snRNA gene (see Fig\u00a03B) in 7SK snRNP\u2010depleted HeLa cells by ChIP\u2010qPCR (Fig\u00a06C). As compared to control cells, Larp7 depletion by RNAi highly reduced ELL occupancy at the U2 promoter. A less robust, but significant reduction was observed for RNAPII occupancy at the U2 promoter in the absence of 7SK snRNP. To test whether in the absence of 7SK snRNP, compromised polymerase occupancy is a common feature of RNAPII\u2010specific snRNA genes, we compared RNAPII association with the promoter regions of the U1 and U2 snRNA and the U3 snoRNA genes in Larp7\u2010depleted and control cells by ChIP\u2010qPCR (Fig\u00a06D). Disruption of 7SK snRNP decreased RNAPII occupancy on the U1, U2, and U3 genes by similar extents, but failed to inhibit RNAPII recruitment to the promoter region of the GAPDH gene. These results demonstrate that the 7SK snRNP, as a component of the 7SK/LEC transcription factor, stimulates sn/snoRNA synthesis through supporting RNAPII loading onto the promoters of RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes.Open in a separate windowFigure EV47SK snRNP is required for LEC localization to CBs\n7SK snRNP is not required for Ice1 expression. Total cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected with Larp7 (Larp7 RNAi)\u2010, 7SK (7SK RNAi)\u2010, or non\u2010specific (Cont RNAi) interfering RNAs were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for Ice1 and Larp7. Accumulation of 7SK snRNA was monitored by Northern blotting. As controls, the levels of the 7SL signal recognition particle RNA and hnRNP A1 were also measured. While transfection with Larp7\u2010specific interfering RNA diminished accumulation of both Larp7 and 7SK snRNA, RNAi\u2010mediated depletion of 7SK snRNA has no effect on Larp7 expression (see also Fig\u00a04A and C). More importantly, neither Larp7 nor 7SK snRNA depletion affected Ice1 accumulation.Depletion of Larp7 and MePCE inhibits Ice2 accumulation in Cajal bodies. HeLa cells either non\u2010treated (WT) or treated with Larp7\u2010 or MePCE\u2010specific interfering RNAs were immunostained with antibodies specific for Ice2 and coilin. Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm.\nThe 7SK snRNP is required for localization of LEC components to the Cajal bodyCajal bodies (CBs) are distinct subnuclear domains where assembly and maturation of large multiprotein and RNP complexes take place (Machyna et\u00a0al, 2013). HeLa LEC proteins frequently concentrate within CBs in a transcription\u2010dependent manner, raising the possibility that CBs provide the nuclear locale for the assembly of 7SK/LEC RNP (Polak et\u00a0al, 2003; Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013). Previous fluorescent in\u00a0situ hybridization (FISH) experiments revealed a diffuse punctuate nucleoplasmic localization pattern for HeLa 7SK snRNA (Egloff et\u00a0al, 2006; Prasanth et\u00a0al, 2010) (Fig\u00a07A, upper panel). However, due to the high concentration of 7SK snRNA in the nucleoplasm, FISH failed to confirm 7SK accumulation within CBs. Therefore, to visualize 7SK snRNA associated with CBs, HeLa cells were pre\u2010extracted with detergent to partially remove the soluble fraction of nucleoplasmic 7SK before cell fixation. Co\u2010staining of the pre\u2010extracted cells with a fluorescently labeled 7SK\u2010specific oligonucleotide probe and an antibody against the CB marker protein coilin revealed a small, but significant fraction of 7SK snRNA that co\u2010localized with coilin in CBs (lower panel, indicated by arrowheads).Open in a separate windowFigure 77SK snRNP is required for Ice2 localization to CBs\nHeLa 7SK snRNA is present in CBs.

Error bars correspond to standard deviation. For other details, see the text.\nAfter having demonstrated that 7SK snRNA is present in CBs, we tested the importance of 7SK snRNP for CB\u2010specific accumulation of LEC. Consistent with previous reports, immunofluorescence microscopy performed with Ice2\u2010 and coilin\u2010specific antibodies detected Ice2 co\u2010localization with coilin in the CBs of a fraction of HeLa cells (Fig\u00a07B, upper panel). Upon closer inspection of 1,274 randomly selected HeLa cells derived from three independent experiments, we detected CB\u2010specific Ice2 accumulation in 6.44% of the cells (Fig\u00a07C). However, depletion of 7SK snRNA abolished Ice2 accumulation in CBs (Fig\u00a07B and C). Conscientious examination of 1,278 cells derived from three independent 7SK knockdown experiments identified only 3 cells (0.2%) with detectable Ice2 accumulation in CBs. The same results were obtained upon investigation of the CB\u2010specific localization of ZC3H8 in wild\u2010type and 7SK snRNA\u2010depleted HeLa cells (data not shown). Likewise, RNAi\u2010mediated depletion of the 7SK core proteins Larp7 and MePCE largely inhibited Ice2 accumulation in CBs (Fig\u00a0EV4B). Thus, we concluded that the 7SK snRNP is required for localization of LEC into CBs. DiscussionExpression of mammalian RNAPII\u2010specific spliceosomal snRNA and snoRNA genes is supported by the little elongation complex (LEC) that promotes both transcription initiation and elongation on snRNA genes (Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Smith & Shilatifard, 2013). Here, we have demonstrated that the human 7SK snRNP, composed of the 7SK snRNA, Larp7, and MePCE, specifically associates with LEC to promote RNAPII\u2010mediated snRNA and snoRNA synthesis. As an essential component of the 7SK/LEC sn/snoRNA transcriptional stimulatory RNP, the 7SK snRNP functions as a canonical RNAPII transcription factor. Earlier, the U1 snRNP has been reported to interact with the general RNAPII initiation factor TFIIH to stimulate transcription initiation, indicating that snRNPs may function in various steps of the RNAPII transcription cycle (Kwek et\u00a0al, 2002).Instead of serving as an auxiliary cofactor of LEC, the 7SK snRNP seems to form a stable complex with the four LEC proteins, ELL, Ice1, Ice2, and ZC3H8. 7SK is an abundant snRNA that is present in about 200,000 copies in mammalian cells (Diribarne & Bensaude, 2009). Our IP experiments detected only a small portion (<\u00a02\u20133%) of cellular 7SK associated with LEC, indicating that the nuclei of HeLa cells contain maximum 5,000\u20136,000 7SK/LEC particles. The structural organization of the 7SK/LEC particle remains unknown, but the fact that the 7SK snRNA is required for LEC integrity suggests that the 7SK snRNP provides the structural scaffold for the assembly of the 7SK/LEC RNP. The 7SK snRNP and the four LEC proteins accumulate within CBs raising the possibility that assembly and/or recycling of the 7SK/LEC particles takes place in these nucleoplasmic domains (Polak et\u00a0al, 2003; Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013). The major function of CBs is in promoting assembly of macromolecular complexes involved in transcription, splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and telomere synthesis (Smith et\u00a0al, 2011; Hu et\u00a0al, 2013). The Ice2 and ZC3H8 LEC proteins accumulate in CBs in a 7SK snRNP\u2010dependent manner supporting the notion that 7SK snRNP plays a central role in the assembly and intracellular trafficking of the 7SK/LEC RNP. CBs are highly mobile subnuclear organelles which are frequently found in the proximity of actively transcribed snRNA genes, raising the possibility that CBs might also deliver the 7SK/LEC transcription factor to snRNA genes (Ogg & Lamond, 2002). However, further efforts are required to understand the structural organization, biogenesis, and trafficking of the 7SK/LEC RNP. It is also possible that in addition to the 7SK snRNP and the four LEC proteins, transcriptionally fully active 7SK/LEC RNP contains other, yet unidentified components.Similar to the RNAPII\u2010specific sno/snRNA genes, the NEAT1 long non\u2010coding RNA gene showed strong Larp7 and RNAPII co\u2010occupancy. The NEAT1 gene encodes a 4\u00a0kb unspliced polyadenylated non\u2010coding RNA that is required for paraspeckle integrity (Clemson et\u00a0al, 2009). Our preliminary experiments have suggested that Larp7 is required for efficient NEAT1 RNA synthesis, although in contrast to the RNAPII\u2010specific snRNA genes, expression of the NEAT1 gene is governed by a classical TATA box\u2010containing promoter (our unpublished data). Our genomewide ChIP analysis also revealed high Larp7 occupancy on a set of known or predicted protein\u2010coding and long non\u2010coding RNA genes which showed very low or no apparent RNAPII occupancy (data not shown). These observations raise the possibility that the 7SK snRNP and/or Larp7 play a complex role in\u00a0controlling expression of various classes of RNAPII\u2010transcribed genes.Our ChIP\u2010seq analysis failed to detect significant Larp7 accumulation on the overwhelming majority of protein\u2010coding genes. A recent study, however, reported widespread promoter occupancy of Larp7 on protein\u2010coding genes and in contrast to our results, did not detect Larp7 enrichments on sn/snoRNA genes (McNamara et\u00a0al, 2016). The reason for these contradictory observations remains uncertain. It is possible that the ectopically expressed FL\u2010Larp7 is competed out by the excess of endogenous Larp7, reducing FL\u2010Larp7 signals on protein\u2010coding genes (Fig\u00a0EV1). On the other hand, the anti\u2010Larp7 epitope of endogenous Larp7 might be masked in the RNAPII\u20107SK/LEC complex, impeding 7SK snRNP detection on sn/snoRNA genes. Nevertheless, to confirm our conclusion that 7SK/LEC specifically associates with RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes, we reanalyzed the recently published 7SK ChIRP\u2010seq and Ice1, Ice2, and ZC3H8 ChIP\u2010seq data sets and compared them with our FL\u2010Larp7 and RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq results (Hu et\u00a0al, 2013; Flynn et\u00a0al, 2016). We found that all components of the 7SK/LEC RNP analyzed so far, including the 7SK snRNA, Larp7, Ice1, Ice2, and ZC3H8 preferentially associate with RNAPII\u2010specific sn/snoRNA genes (Fig\u00a0EV5A\u2013C).Promoting the release of promoter\u2010proximally paused RNAPII by P\u2010TEFb is a prominent regulatory step of human gene expression (Adelman & Lis, 2012; Zhou et\u00a0al, 2012; Smith & Shilatifard, 2013). The nuclear level of active P\u2010TEFb and consequently, the global level of pre\u2010mRNA production are controlled primarily by the 7SK snRNP that, together with HEXIM1/2, sequesters P\u2010TEFb into the transcriptionally inactive 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb RNP. Demonstration that the 7SK snRNP also functions in snRNA gene expression implies that the 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb RNP is a bifunctional negative transcriptional regulatory particle that inhibits both pre\u2010mRNA and snRNA synthesis. In the 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb complex, the 7SK snRNP and P\u2010TEFb, with the help of HEXIM1/2, mutually inhibit the transcriptional stimulatory capacity of each other. Consistent with this idea, disassembly of the 7SK/HEXIM/P\u2010TEFb RNP in response to transcription inhibition by ActD increased the level of active P\u2010TEFb and at the same time augmented 7SK/LEC accumulation to alleviate the blockade of both pre\u2010mRNA and spliceosomal snRNA synthesis (Fig\u00a05G). Thus, we propose that sequestering P\u2010TEFb and 7SK snRNP into the same inhibitory complex provides an elegant regulatory mechanism to co\u2010ordinate cellular pre\u2010mRNA synthesis with spliceosomal snRNP production.Larp7 provides metabolic stability for the 7SK snRNA and directly participates in P\u2010TEFb recruitment and inactivation (He et\u00a0al, 2008; Krueger et\u00a0al, 2008; Muniz et\u00a0al, 2013). Larp7 depletion increases nuclear P\u2010TEFb activity, promotes cell growth, transformation, and cancer progression (He et\u00a0al, 2006; Biewenga et\u00a0al, 2008; Cheng et\u00a0al, 2012; Ji et\u00a0al, 2014). Primordial dwarfism (PD) is a rare human genetic disorder characterized with global growth failure, multiple developmental defects, and finally death before the age of 3\u00a0years (Alazami et\u00a0al, 2012). Mutations causing primordial dwarfism have been identified in the U4atac minor spliceosomal snRNA gene, indicating that compromised minor spliceosomal activity is responsible for the disease (Edery et\u00a0al, 2011; He et\u00a0al, 2011). Paradoxically, recent studies linked a form of primordial dwarfism to loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations in the human LARP7 gene, contrary to the fact that Larp7 depletion is expected to promote cell growth through disrupting 7SK snRNP and thereby, increasing P\u2010TEFb activity (Najmabadi et\u00a0al, 2011; Alazami et\u00a0al, 2012). In the light of our current results, however, we can propose that the lack of functional Larp7 in primordial dwarfism patients compromises the synthesis of\u00a0RNAPII\u2010transcribed spliceosomal snRNAs. Since the minor spliceosomal snRNAs accumulate at low levels, it is conceivable that\u00a0proper function of the minor splicing machinery is highly sensitive to snRNA production and compromised snRNA accumulation may lead to splicing defects similar to those caused by U4atac mutations.In summary, demonstration that the human 7SK snRNP is an essential component of the 7SK/LEC snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor provides support to the recently emerging view that snRNPs, instead of participating in a single nuclear reaction, frequently possess multiple nuclear roles. Identification of 7SK snRNP as a snRNA gene\u2010specific transcription factor has further\u00a0expanded the complex functional repertoire of eukaryotic snRNPs. Materials and MethodsGeneral procedures, oligonucleotidesStandard laboratory protocols were used for manipulating RNA, DNA, and proteins. Unless indicated differently, all DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega. All oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon, and they are either specified in this chapter or listed in Table\u00a0EV2. Human HeLa cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO, Invitrogen).Expression plasmidsTo generate pFL\u2010Int7 (utilized restriction sites, EcoRI/XbaI), pFL\u2010Int11 (HindIII/EcoRI), pFL\u2010ZC3H8 (HindIII/EcoRI), pFL\u2010Ice2 (NotI/XbaI), and pFL\u2010Hexim1 (HindIII/XbaI) expression plasmids, the corresponding full\u2010length cDNAs were amplified by RT\u2013PCR and inserted into the p3XFLAG\u2010CMV\u201010 expression vector (Sigma). The identity of all constructs was verified by sequence analysis. Expression plasmids were introduced into HeLa cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For ChIP\u2010seq and ChIP\u2010qPCR analysis, HeLa cells were transfected with pFL\u2010Larp7, pFL\u2010MePCE, or pFL\u2010HEXIM1 expression plasmids and the transfected cells were selected by administration of 1\u00a0mg/ml of G418 48\u00a0h after transfection to generate polyclonal cell populations stably expressing FL\u2010Larp7, FL\u2010MePCE, or FL\u2010HEXIM1. Accumulation of FL\u2010MePCE, FL\u2010Larp7, or FL\u2010HEXIM1 was verified by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy with monoclonal anti\u2010Flag M2 antibody conjugated with anti\u2010mouse IgG\u2010Cy3 (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, F1804 and C2181, respectively) (Fig\u00a0EV1).siRNA\u2010mediated knockdownControl siRNA (D\u2010001210\u201001) and siRNAs targeting Larp7 (M\u2010020996\u201001), MePCE (M\u2010016636\u201000), and Ice1 (M\u2010024272\u201001) mRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 7SK\u2010specific siRNA complementary to the A230\u2010U250 region of human 7SK snRNA was purchased from Euromedex.Chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencingFormaldehyde cross\u2010linking and IP of chromatin was performed essentially as described by Boyd et\u00a0al (1998). Briefly, HeLa cells were cross\u2010linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at RT and quenched for 5\u00a0min by adding glycine to 125\u00a0mM final concentration. Cells were resuspended in Cell Lysis Buffer (5\u00a0mM PIPES pH 8.0, 85\u00a0mM KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P\u201040 supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and incubated on ice for 10\u00a0min. After collection by centrifugation at 2,300\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min, nuclei were lysed in Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.1, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS) for 20\u00a0min. Chromatin was disrupted with Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) sonifier (high power setting, 20 cycles for 30\u00a0s on and 30\u00a0s off) on ice. The extract was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcg of appropriate antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immunocomplexes were immobilized by reacting with 10\u00a0\u03bcl of BSA\u2010saturated Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. IP of RNAPII was performed with, or as a control without, anti\u2010PolII (sc\u2010899X, Santa Cruz) antibody. To recover FL\u2010Larp7, the anti\u2010Flag M2 (F1804, Sigma) antibody was used in combination with a rabbit anti\u2010mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). In the control reaction, the anti\u2010Flag antibody was omitted. After extensive and stringent washing and elution, protein\u2010DNA cross\u2010links were reversed by incubation at 67\u00b0C for 5\u00a0h and DNA was deproteinized with proteinase K treatment at 50\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. DNA was purified by the Nucleospin PCR cleanup kit of Macherey\u2010Nagel. ChIP samples were directly analyzed by qPCR or by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford). Sequences were mapped to the Hg18 human genome build using the Burrows\u2010Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software, and the Larp7\u2010enriched regions of ChIP\u2010seq signal were analyzed by the Model\u2010based Analysis of ChIP\u2010seq 2 (MACS2) program (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2008; Li & Durbin, 2009) (Fig\u00a02B). Larp7 peaks were annotated using the Ensembl project (http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/gtf/homo_sapiens). RNAPII co\u2010occupancy at Larp7\u2010enriched regions was measured by calculating the numbers of extended read fragments per million (rpm) within\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100\u00a0bp of the Larp7 peaks with a cutoff 50\u00a0rpm for the RNAPII signal to select for the most significant Larp7/RNAPII\u2010enriched regions.Chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) experimentsChromatin isolation by RNA purification experiments were performed essentially as described earlier (Chu et\u00a0al, 2012). Briefly, HeLa cells (~20\u00a0million) grown in monolayer cultures were harvested and cross\u2010linked in PBS containing 1% of glutaraldehyde for 10\u00a0min at RT with continuous gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to 125\u00a0mM final concentration. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010Cl pH 7.0, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors), and sonicated for 2\u00a0h in a 4\u00b0C water bath (Bioruptor Plus, Diagenode, 30\u00a0s pulses with 30\u00a0s intervals at high setting). Hybridization of 7SK\u2010 and U1\u2010specific and control biotinylated oligonucleotides (~100\u00a0pmol) to cellular RNAs was performed at RT for 4\u00a0h in 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010Cl pH 7.0, 750\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 15% formamide supplemented with protease inhibitors. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were affinity\u2010selected by streptavidin\u2010agarose beads (S1638, Sigma) for 30\u00a0min at RT. Beads were extensively washed in 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.5% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors, and the bound chromatin was eluted in DNA Elution Buffer (50\u00a0mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS). DNA was deproteinized with proteinase K treatment and phenol extraction and analyzed by quantitative PCR.Nuclear run\u2010on assayNuclear run\u2010on analysis was performed according to Medlin et\u00a0al (2003). For evaluation of U1 and U2 synthesis, two pairs of 80\u2010mer oligonucleotides complementary to the U5\u2010G164 and C28\u2010C187 regions of U1 and U2 snRNAs, respectively, were used. For analysis of U6, 5S, and 7SL RNA transcription, we used oligonucleotides complementary to the A27\u2010U106, C9\u2010A88, and C63\u2010U142 sequences of the U6, 5S, and 7SL RNAs, respectively. Control oligonucleotides (U1 sense and U2 sense) corresponded to the U1 and U2 snRNA sequences between U5\u2010G164 and C28\u2010C187, respectively.Immunoprecipitation and protein analysisHeLa cells grown in monolayer cultures were rinsed with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), scraped, and collected by centrifugation. Cell was placed on ice, resuspended in 0.5\u00a0ml of cold NET\u20102 buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.5, 200\u00a0mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P\u201040), and disrupted with a Bioruptor Plus Sonicator (Diagenode) by sonication five times for 30\u00a0s with 30\u00a0s interval at high setting. Cell debris were removed by sedimentation at 16,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min, and the clarified cell extracts were incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcg of antibodies coupled to 20\u00a0\u03bcl of packed protein A agarose beads (Sigma). For IP of Flag\u2010tagged proteins, 20\u00a0\u03bcl of anti\u2010Flag M2 Affinity Gel (A2220, Sigma) was used. After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed six times in NET\u20102 buffer and the associated proteins were eluted by 1\u00d7\u00a0SDS\u2013PAGE loading buffer. For IP, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy, the following antibodies were used: anti\u2010SNAPC2 (Yoon et\u00a0al, 1995), anti\u2010Ice1, anti\u2010Ice2 and anti\u2010ELL (provided by Dr. A. Shilatifard), anti\u2010Flag M2 (F1804, Sigma), anti\u2010Ser2P (3E10, ChromoTek), anti\u2010Ser5P (3E8, ChromoTek), anti\u2010Ser7P (4E12, ChromoTek), anti\u2010PolII (sc\u2010899X, Santa Cruz), anti\u2010ZC3H8 (ab97821, Abcam), anti\u2010HEXIM1 (ab25388, Abcam), anti\u2010Larp7 ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"ARP40847\",\"term_id\":\"1190171759\",\"term_text\":\"ARP40847\"}}ARP40847, Aviva System Biology), anti\u2010MePCE (ab185991, Abcam), and anti\u2010coilin (kind gift of Dr. M. Carmo\u2010Fonseca). Unless indicated differently by the manufacturers, antibodies were diluted to 1:1,000 for Western blot analyses. As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit and anti\u2010mouse IgGs (W401B and W402B, Promega) were used.RNA analysisRNAs from HeLa cells, cell extracts and protein A agarose beads were purified by the guanidine thiocyanate/phenol\u2013chloroform RNA extraction procedure. For Northern blot analysis, RNAs were size\u2010fractionated on a 6% sequencing gel, electroblotted onto a Hybond\u2010N nylon membrane and probed with labeled oligonucleotides. Real\u2010time quantitative RT\u2013PCR was performed on 2\u00a0\u03bcg of total RNA isolated from wild\u2010type or Larp7\u2010depleted HeLa cells. DNA first strands were synthesized by AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega), and qPCR reactions were performed on a Bio\u2010Rad C1000 Touch thermal cycler using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix of Bio\u2010Rad. The delta\u2010delta Ct method was used for relative quantification of RNA accumulation. The oligonucleotides used for Northern blot analysis and RT\u2010qPCR are listed in Table\u00a0EV2.Fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridizationFluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization, image acquisition, and processing have been described (Darzacq et\u00a0al, 2002). Removal of the nucleoplasmic soluble fraction of 7SK snRNA from living HeLa cells and fixation of the cells was performed according to the protocols of the Lawrence laboratory (http://www.umassmed.edu/cellbio/labs/lawrence/protocols/). The following oligonucleotide probe was used to detect HeLa 7SK snRNA: (5\u2032\u2010G*TGTCTGGAGTCTTGGAAGC*\u20103\u2032). The aminoallyl\u2010nucleotides labeled with FluoroLink Cy3 monofunctional reactive dye (GE Healthcare) are indicated by asterisks. Nuclear DNA was visualized with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DAPI. Coilin and Ice2 were detected with polyclonal mouse anti\u2010coilin and rabbit anti\u2010Ice2 antibodies provided by Drs. M. Carmo Fonseca and A. Shilatifard, respectively.Data availabilityFL\u2010Larp7 and RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq datasets have been deposited into the GEO genomics data repository (accession number: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE87470\",\"term_id\":\"87470\"}}GSE87470).
