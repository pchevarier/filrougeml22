INTRODUCTIONThe majority of vertebrate U snRNA genes (e.g. U1\u2013U5) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) to yield short non-polyadenylated 3\u2032-elongated pre-snRNAs. The 3\u2032 ends of these RNAs are produced by a processing reaction dependent on the 13\u201316 nucleotide (nt) cis-acting 3\u2032 box element, located 9\u201319 nt downstream of the 3\u2032 end of the RNA-encoding region (1). Most of the 3\u2032 extension is removed by further processing in the cytoplasm before nuclear re-import (2,3). A compatible snRNA promoter is also required for proper 3\u2032 end formation of pre-snRNAs (4,5), highlighting the tight link between transcription and the function of the 3\u2032 box. Relevant to this we have recently demonstrated that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II is required for 3\u2032-box-dependent RNA processing in vivo and that processing in vitro is activated by phospho-CTD (1,6).3\u2032 End formation of pre-snRNAs is likely to involve divalent-cation-dependent endonucleolytic activity, in common with 3\u2032 end formation of vertebrate pre-mRNAs or yeast pre-snRNAs (1,7). However, neither subunits of the cleavage\u2013polyadenylation complex factors cleavage/polyadenylation-specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage-stimulation factor (CstF) and cleavage factor I (CFI), nor the human homologues of yeast pre-snRNA processing factors hRNase III and PM-Scl100 appear to co-purify with the human pre-snRNA 3\u2032 processing activity (1). This suggests that there is little overlap between known RNA 3\u2032 end processing factors and those used for 3\u2032 end formation of human pre-snRNAs. Two cis-acting elements, the U2 3\u2032 box and the upstream sequence element (USE) act together to efficiently direct accurate pre-U2 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation both in vitro and in vivo (1), whereas 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U1 snRNA appears to depend largely on the 3\u2032 box. Thus, there may also be differences in the cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors involved in 3\u2032 end formation of different pre-snRNAs.Further investigation of the biochemical requirements of pre-U1 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation indicates that, in addition to the phospho-CTD of pol II, creatine phosphate and a 5\u2032 cap activate processing. We also demonstrate that 3\u2032 processing requires an RNA component and that the activity is heat labile. Thus, 3\u2032-box-dependent processing has some characteristics in common with both AAUAAA-dependent processing (8) and 3\u2032 end formation of the replication-activated histone mRNAs (9) as well as significant differences. Furthermore, we show that the efficiency of in vitro pre-U1 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation is not affected by additional cis elements although the exact sequence around the cleavage site influences the site of the final 3\u2032 end formed in vitro. The S100 fraction active for 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U1 snRNA is also active for 3\u2032 end maturation and we show that these processes can occur independently in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA constructsIn 10end U1 3\u2032 box, 17end U1 3\u2032 box and 59end U1 3\u2032 box templates, the 10, 17 and 59 nt, respectively, located upstream of the 3\u2032 box of U1 3\u2032 box template described by Uguen and Murphy (1) were replaced by the 10, 17 and 59 nt of the endogenous U1 snRNA gene (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"J00318\",\"term_id\":\"340085\",\"term_text\":\"J00318\"}}J00318). The U1 3\u2032 box sequence, GTTTCAAAAGTAGA, is deleted from the 59end \u03943\u2032 box template. DNA constructs used to produce synthetic RNA were obtained by deleting the U1 promoter region by EcoRI/BglII digestion as described previously (1).S100 fraction preparationHeLa cell S100 extract was prepared using a slight modification of the procedure of Shapiro et al. (10). After cell lysis in buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.75 \u00b5M spermidine, 0.15 \u00b5M spermine, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 \u00b5M DTT) sucrose was added to a final concentration of 10% before spinning.In vitro RNA synthesis and in vitro processingSynthetic, capped RNA was produced as described previously (1). To produce uncapped RNA, m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G was omitted from the reaction. Processing was carried out as described in (1) for 2.5 h at 30\u00b0C in the presence of 3 mM MnCl2 unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. To reduce the level of endogenous ATP, the S100 fraction was bound to heparin\u2013sepharose at 100 mM KCl and eluted by 1 M KCl. This fraction was then incubated for 15 min at 30\u00b0C with 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM glucose and 0.6 U of hexokinase (Boehringer Mannheim) to deplete any residual ATP.S1 mapping analysisAfter incubation with S100, RNA was extracted, annealed to the S1 probe, digested and analysed on a 6% polyacrylamide\u20138 M urea gel as described previously (1). The S1 probes used for each construct (U1 3\u2032 box, 10end U1 3\u2032 box, 17end U1 3\u2032 box, 59end U1 3\u2032 box and 59end \u03943\u2032 box) were prepared as described previously (1).Western blottingWestern blotting was carried out as described by Medlin et al. (6). Anti-stem\u2013loop-binding protein (SLBP) antibody was kindly provided by Berndt Mueller (University of Aberdeen) and used diluted at 1/100. RESULTSImproving U1 3\u2032-box-dependent in vitro processingWe recently described an in vitro system where 3\u2032-box-dependent processing of substrate RNAs was detected for the first time (1). However, long incubation times (>5 h) are required to detect any accurate 3\u2032 end processing directed by the U1 3\u2032 box in unpurified S100. We therefore undertook to improve the efficiency of the processing activity by modifying the extract preparation procedure (see Materials and Methods) as a prelude to characterization of the requirements for 3\u2032 processing. Modification of the extract preparation method described by Shapiro et al. (10) led to the production of S100 that yields up to 8% properly processed RNA after 2.5 h incubation rather than the 13 h needed with S100 produced by our previously described protocol (1). The increased sucrose concentration used in production of this extract (see Materials and Methods) may reduce the release of nucleases from the nuclei upon spinning and consequently reduce turnover of substrate RNA, which proved to be a major problem for in vitro processing (1). Relevant to this, the amount of pol II and factors involved in mRNA 3\u2032 end formation is reduced in this S100 fraction (data not shown and see Fig. \u200bFig.44B).Open in a separate windowFigure 4 U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing activity is heat labile. (A) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 preheated for 10 min at the indicated temperature (temp.).

SLBP is 45 kDa. (C) Western blot with anti-SLBP antibody on the different fractions resulting from purification of the processing activity on different sepharose resins as described by Uguen and Murphy (1). B-heparin and B-Q represent proteins bound to heparin\u2013 and Q-sepharose, respectively; UB-SP represents proteins that did not bind to SP-sepharose.Efficient U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing requires creatine phosphate as a co-factor and is ATP independentSince creatine phosphate (CP) (usually used to transfer Pi to ADP, creating ATP) improves the efficiency of some mRNA processing steps (11), we tested its effect on U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1).1). Little processing (1%) is detected in the absence of added CP after incubation for 2.5 h at 30\u00b0C (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A,1A, lanes 2 and 4), whereas 7% of the input RNA is processed in the presence of 20 mM CP (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A,1A, lanes 3 and 5). Processing efficiency is only slightly improved by increasing the concentration of CP further (8% of input RNA is processed in the presence of 40 or 60 mM CP; Fig. \u200bFig.1A,1A, lanes 6 and 7). Furthermore, nucleoside triphosphates, including ATP, do not support U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing in the absence of CP (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A,1A, lane 4, and B, lanes 3\u20136), indicating that CP does not act simply to regenerate the energy source. Serine phosphate (SP) can also activate processing although not as effectively as CP (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C,1C, lanes 3\u20135) suggesting that the effect of CP is not entirely due to the presence of phosphate groups.Open in a separate windowFigure 1 Efficient U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing requires CP as a co-factor and is ATP independent. (A) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence of ATP (1 mM) and different concentrations of CP as indicated. The percentage of input RNA processed (% proc.) is indicated below this and subsequent gels. The scheme represents the position and size of the S1 probe, input (IP) and processed (proc.) RNA. The diagram on the left side of this and subsequent figures indicates the position of the U1 3\u2032 box in the input RNA. (B) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence of 20 mM CP or 1 mM of the nucleosides triphosphates indicated. (C) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence of 20 mM CP or different concentrations of SP as indicated. (D) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence or absence of 20 mM CP and in the presence of phospho-CTD as indicated. (E) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 fractionated on heparin\u2013sepharose in the presence of 20 mM CP, and with or without ATP, hexokinase and glucose. The processing reaction was carried out in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2.It has been proposed that CP activates pre-mRNA 3\u2032 cleavage by mimicking the effect of the pol II CTD rather than affecting the reservoir of energy (11,12) and may facilitate a conformational change of some factors. In support of this notion, the phosphorylated form of the CTD of pol II activates 3\u2032-box-dependent processing in vitro better than the unphosphorylated form (1). However, no processing is detected in the absence of CP when phospho-CTD is added (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1D).1D). This indicates that CP does not simply substitute for phospho-CTD in our system.To eliminate the ATP present in the S100 fraction, we fractionated the processing activity by binding to heparin\u2013sepharose at 100 mM KCl and eluting by 1 M KCl. Although this fractionation procedure should markedly reduce the level of ATP in the active fraction it does not result in a requirement for added ATP (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1E,1E, lanes 2 and 6). Furthermore, addition of both glucose and hexokinase (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1E,1E, lane 5), which together deplete the available pool of ATP (11), has no greater effect than the addition of glucose or hexokinase alone (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1E,1E, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that 3\u2032-box-dependent processing is ATP independent. Interestingly, AAUAAA-dependent 3\u2032 cleavage is also CP dependent and ATP independent in vitro (11).U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing is activated by a 7-methyl-G capTo examine whether 5\u2032 cap binding proteins activate 3\u2032-box-dependent RNA processing in addition to splicing, 3\u2032 processing, transport and translation of mRNA (13), we compared the efficiency of 3\u2032 processing of capped and uncapped U1 3\u2032 box RNA. In the absence of a 5\u2032 cap structure, U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing is slower (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2A),2A), suggesting that either the 5\u2032 cap itself, or more likely, cap binding proteins present in the S100, activate processing. The decrease of proper 3\u2032 end formation of uncapped RNA is not due simply to RNA instability since input RNA is still detected after 3 h incubation (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2A).2A). Addition of 7-methyl-G cap analogue [m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G] to the in vitro reaction inhibits processing and the highest concentration of cap analogue tested effectively abolished processing (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B,2B, lanes 8\u201312). This suggests that the cap analogue can sequester cap binding proteins and interacting 3\u2032 processing factors. Consistent with this, the effect of the cap structure of the RNA on processing efficiency is lost after partial purification of the 3\u2032 processing activity as described by Uguen and Murphy (1) (data not shown), indicating that the 5\u2032 cap per se is not sufficient. Moreover, addition of unmethylated cap analogue G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G to the reaction has little effect on processing (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2B,2B, lanes 3\u20137). Taken together, these results suggest that the nuclear cap binding complex (14) may be involved in the recruitment of pre-snRNA 3\u2032 processing factor(s) in vivo.Open in a separate windowFigure 2 U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing is activated by a 7-methyl-G cap. (A) Capped (empty square) or uncapped (filled diamond) U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 for 0\u20133 h. The graph below represents the percentage relative processing activity calculated by comparison with the amount of processing obtained after incubating capped RNA for 3 h. (B) Capped U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence of different concentrations of unmethylated cap analogue [G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G; Epicenter] (lanes 3\u20137) or methylated cap analogue [m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)G; Amersham Pharmacia] (lanes 8\u201312) as indicated. The graph below represents the average percentage relative processing activity obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of unmethylated (filled triangle) or methylated (empty square) cap analogue in two independent experiments.U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing requires an RNA co-factorSmall non-coding RNAs function as co-factors in both splicing and 3\u2032 processing of pre-mRNAs (8,9). To determine whether 3\u2032 processing of U1 3\u2032 box RNA substrate is dependent on a trans-acting nucleic acid component, the S100 was treated with micrococcal nuclease (MN) before incubation with U1 3\u2032 box RNA (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3).3). U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing is completely abolished by this treatment (lane 3). However, when EGTA, which chelates the Ca2+ ions essential for this nuclease to function, is added to the S100 before MN, no reduction in processing is observed (lane 4). This suggests the involvement of an RNA or DNA co-factor in U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we treated the S100 with pancreatic DNase I before incubation with U1 3\u2032 box RNA (lane 8). This has no effect on 3\u2032 processing, indicating that the nucleic acid co-factor is composed of RNA. In order to test whether this RNA component is the sole catalytic component of the 3\u2032 processing activity, we extracted ribonucleic acid from the S100 by acidic phenol/chloroform treatment and incubated it with U1 3\u2032 box RNA. This fraction does not support 3\u2032 processing on its own (lane 5). In addition, 3\u2032 processing is not recovered when the MN-treated S100 is complemented with this RNA fraction (lane 6). These data suggest that U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing involves both RNA and protein factor(s) and leads us to propose that processing is carried out by an RNA\u2013protein complex.Open in a separate windowFigure 3 U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing requires an RNA co-factor. U1 3\u2032 box RNA was incubated with S100 in the presence of 2 mM of MgCl2 before or after pretreatment with MN or DNase I and/or complemented with the extracted RNA. MN (lane 3), S100 pretreated for 15 min at 25\u00b0C with MN (5 U/\u00b5l of S100; Roche) in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mM EGTA. MN in. (lane 4), S100 pretreated for 15 min at 25\u00b0C with MN inactivated by the addition of 2 mM EGTA; RNA extracted (lane 5), S100 extracted by acidic phenol/chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitated before resuspension in buffer D (15); RNA extracted + MN (lane 6), S100 pretreated for 15 min at 25\u00b0C with MN in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 and complemented by the extracted RNA. RNA extracted + MN in. (lane 7), S100 pretreated for 15 min at 25\u00b0C with MN inactivated by the presence of 2 mM EGTA and complemented by the extracted RNA; DNase I (lane 8), S100 pretreated for 15 min at 30\u00b0C with pancreatic DNase I (10 U/\u00b5l of S100).U7 snRNA is required for 3\u2032 end formation of the mRNAs for replication-activated histones and has a region of complementarity to the substrate RNA (9). Since mammalian U7 snRNAs contain no conserved sequences complementary to 3\u2032 box sequences it is unlikely that U7 snRNA participates in 3\u2032 end formation of U1 snRNA. Unfortunately, experiments to test the effect of depletion of U7 snRNA and other U snRNAs from the processing extract using antibodies to the trimethylguanosine cap present at the 5\u2032 end were inconclusive.U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing activity is heat labileTo analyse the sensitivity of the 3\u2032-box-dependent processing activity to heat, the S100 fraction was heated for 10 min at temperatures from 30 to 55\u00b0C before incubation with U1 3\u2032 box RNA (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4).4). The efficiency of 3\u2032 processing is slightly reduced at 45\u00b0C (inhibition of 33%; Fig. \u200bFig.4A,4A, lane 4). However, 3\u2032 processing is inhibited by 83% after preheating the S100 fraction at 50\u00b0C (lane 5) and is lost completely after treatment at 55\u00b0C (lane 6), suggesting that U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing involves heat-sensitive factor(s).3\u2032 Processing of replication-activated histone mRNAs is similarly heat labile (16), raising the possibility of shared factors with U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing. A well-characterized SLBP is required for histone 3\u2032 end formation (9) and we have used an anti-SLBP antibody to analyse our processing extract by western blot (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4B).4B). SLBP is not readily detected in the S100 used for the in vitro processing reactions shown in Figure \u200bFigure4A4A (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4B,4B, lane 1) although it is relatively abundant in our previously described S100 preparation (1) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4B,4B, lane 2). In addition, no SLBP is detected in the partially purified 0.4 M KCl SP fraction active for pre-snRNA 3\u2032 end formation (1) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4C,4C, lane 6). These results suggest that SLBP is not involved in 3\u2032-box-dependent processing.Sequences upstream from the U1 3\u2032 box can influence 3\u2032 processingWe have shown that accurate pre-U2 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation requires two cis-acting elements, USE and U2, acting synergically. Although the U1 3\u2032 box is sufficient to direct accurate formation of RNA 3\u2032 ends in vitro and in vivo (1,4,17), the last 5\u20136 nt of the mature 3\u2032 end of U1 snRNA can affect the in vivo accuracy of pre-U1 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation (17). We therefore analysed the influence of the natural sequences preceding the U1 3\u2032 box on the efficiency and accuracy of 3\u2032 processing in vitro. When RNA containing the 10 nt just upstream of U1 3\u2032 box (10end U1 3\u2032 box RNA) is incubated with S100, no properly processed RNA is detected (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A,5A, lanes 6\u201310, and C), even after 3 h incubation. This may be due to instability of processed RNA rather than to a complete loss of processing. When the 17 nt upstream of the U1 3\u2032 box are present (17end U1 3\u2032 box), processing is detected (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A,5A, lanes 11\u201315, and C) although the efficiency is reduced by 45% with respect to U1 3\u2032 box RNA (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A,5A, lanes 1\u20135, and C). A small amount of the 3\u2032 end processed RNA maps to the same nucleotides seen with the U1 3\u2032 box RNA but most map a few nucleotides upstream, corresponding to the most highly represented 3\u2032 ends detected in vivo, which end 6\u20138 nt upstream of the 3\u2032 box (17,18) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A,5A, compare lanes 1\u20135 and 11\u201315, and C). These results may indicate that the addition of 17 nt of the natural U1 sequence influences the position of 3\u2032 endonucleolytic cleavage. Alternatively, 3\u2032 exonucleolytic trimming of the RNA occurs after cleavage 3\u20135 nt upstream from the 3\u2032 box.Open in a separate windowFigure 5 Sequences upstream from the U1 3\u2032 box can influence 3\u2032 processing. (A) U1 3\u2032 box, 10end U1 3\u2032 box and 17end U1 3\u2032 box RNA substrates were incubated with S100 for 0\u20133 h. The scheme below indicates the position and size of the S1 probes, input (IP) and processed (proc.) RNA. (B) U1 3\u2032 box, 59end U1 3\u2032 box and 59end \u03943\u2032 box RNA substrates were incubated with S100. The scheme below indicates the position and size of the S1 probes, input (IP), processed (proc.) and mature RNA. (C) The sequences of the 3\u2032 ends of the substrate RNAs in (A) and (B) are shown with the position of in vivo and in vitro processing sites and mature ends. The endogenous U1 snRNA sequence is highlighted in grey. The U1 3\u2032 box is boxed. The vertical line indicates the boundary between the end of the mature snRNA and the first nucleotide of the non-coding RNA. The bold nucleotides represent the processing sites observed in vivo (17,18). The arrows above the sequence indicate the pre-snRNA processing sites observed in vitro. The mature ends observed in vitro are indicated by unfilled arrows above the sequence.We have also tested the effect of placing a longer endogenous sequence (59 nt) upstream of the U1 3\u2032 box. This substrate RNA contains both the Sm protein binding site and the 3\u2032 terminal stem\u2013loop, which are not required in vivo for pre-U1 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation but are required for efficient nuclear export (19). When 59end U1 3\u2032 box RNA (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B,5B, lanes 3 and 4) is incubated with S100, RNA with the mature 3\u2032 end mapping 10\u201312 nt upstream of the 3\u2032 box (17) is produced. This indicates that the activities required for production of mature U1 3\u2032 ends (20) are present in the S100, in addition to factors required for pre-U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing. Some accurately processed pre-U1 RNA 3\u2032 ends are still detected and these map to the same sites as are observed when only 17 nt of natural U1 sequence are present upstream of the 3\u2032 box (17end U1 3\u2032 box RNA; Fig. \u200bFig.5A,5A, lanes 11\u201315, and C). This may suggest that processing proceeds in a stepwise manner as it does in vivo and the precise pre-snRNA 3\u2032 ends are required for the next step, which matures the 3\u2032 end of the RNA, as has been shown for 3\u2032 end formation of U2 snRNA (21). 3\u2032 Ends mapping 6\u20138 nt upstream from the 3\u2032 box are no longer detected when the 3\u2032 box is removed (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B,5B, lanes 5 and 6, and C). However, production of the mature U1 3\u2032 ends is unaffected (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B,5B, lane 6), indicating that these two processing events occur independently in our in vitro system. This suggests that any RNAs containing the Sm protein binding site and the 3\u2032 terminal stem\u2013loop can be 3\u2032 end matured, presumably by exonucleolytic trimming. Since the 59end \u03943\u2032box RNA has 27\u201329 nt downstream from the sites of the mature 3\u2032 ends, these results also indicate that RNAs longer than pre-U1 at the 3\u2032 end are readily 3\u2032 matured in vitro. In contrast, only pre-U1 snRNAs with a short 3\u2032 extension (no more than 10 nt) are further processed after injection into Xenopus oocytes (20). This may highlight differences between species in the 3\u2032 end maturation of snRNAs. Alternatively, the exact sequence of the 3\u2032 extension may influence trimming and/or some in vivo constraints may be lost in our in vitro system. DISCUSSIONThe first step of expression of the vertebrate U1 snRNA genes involves the production of a 3\u2032 extended pre-U1 snRNA, which occurs by a co-transcriptional 3\u2032-box-dependent mechanism (4,5). Proper 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U1 snRNA is important for the stability of the snRNA in the nucleus, in addition to nucleocytoplasmic export (19,20). The exact 3\u2032 ends of U1 snRNA precursors can also influence the cytoplasmic 3\u2032 trimming of the RNA required for the nuclear translocation of U1 snRNPs and subsequent maturation steps (20). Towards the dissection of the molecular mechanism of 3\u2032 end formation of human pre-U1 snRNA we have determined several of the co-factor requirements of U1 3\u2032-box-dependent in vitro processing. We have also investigated the influence of sequences upstream of the U1 3\u2032 box on 3\u2032 end formation. The results of these studies highlight similarities and differences between 3\u2032 end formation of pre-snRNAs and other vertebrate pol II transcripts. In addition, we show that 3\u2032 extended RNAs containing the U1 Sm protein binding site and the 3\u2032 terminal stem\u2013loop can be processed to the mature U1 3\u2032 end in vitro.Comparing U1 3\u2032-box-dependent processing and formation of mRNA 3\u2032 endsSome co-factor requirements for 3\u2032-box-dependent processing are shared with AAUAAA-dependent processing. Both processing events require divalent cations and CP, are ATP independent and are activated by 5\u2032 cap binding proteins (8,11,13) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.6).6). In addition, both require the CTD of pol II in vivo (6,13) and are activated by phospho-CTD in vitro (1,12) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.6).6). So far there is no indication that any subunits of CPSF, CstF and CFI factors required for AAUAAA-dependent processing participate in pre-snRNA 3\u2032 end formation (1). However, it has been shown that CFI participates in 3\u2032 processing of some yeast snoRNAs and snRNAs (22).Open in a separate windowFigure 6 Requirements for U1 3\u2032-box-dependent RNA processing. 3\u2032-Box-dependent 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U1 snRNA requires an RNA\u2013protein complex, CP and divalent cations (div. ion). The reaction is also activated by 5\u2032 cap binding proteins (diamond) and the CTD of pol II. In addition, the processing activity is abolished by relatively mild heat treatment, which suggests the involvement of a heat-labile factor (HLF).There are also some similarities between 3\u2032 end formation of U1 snRNA and replication-activated histone mRNAs. In both cases a stem\u2013loop structure is present just upstream of the mature 3\u2032 end, the processing activities are heat labile and a trans-acting RNA component is required (9). Our results therefore point to mechanistic similarities in 3\u2032 end formation of non-polyadenylated histone mRNA and snRNA. However, our data indicate that the SLBP is not involved in U1 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation. In addition, the lack of complementarity between U7 snRNA and 3\u2032 box sequences makes it likely that a distinct RNA is required.Divalent cations are also necessary for efficient activity of the yeast RNase III homologues, Pac1p and Rnt1p (23,24) which are involved in yeast snRNA 3\u2032 end formation (25). However, human RNase III does not co-purify with the 3\u2032-box-dependent processing activity and the cis-acting elements do not correspond to RNase III recognition sequences (1). Divalent cations may be required for the function of a 3\u2032-box-specific processing factor or play a more direct catalytic role.The currently known requirements for 3\u2032 end processing of pre-U1 snRNA are summarized in Figure \u200bFigure6.6. Taken together our results indicate that there is little overlap in the factors required for 3\u2032-box-dependent processing and mRNA 3\u2032 end formation apart from the shared co-factors noted above. This is consistent with the differences in cis-acting sequences and the differential promoter dependence of these signals in vivo (4,5).Sequences immediately upstream of the U1 3\u2032 box influence 3\u2032 end formationThe efficient production of accurately 3\u2032 processed pre-U2 snRNA requires two distinct sequences: the U2 3\u2032 box and the USE, which contains a \u2018minihelix\u2019 stem\u2013loop structure (1). The U2 3\u2032 box alone directs formation of RNA a few nucleotides longer than cellular pre-U2 snRNA while RNA containing the USE is processed to the authentic pre-U2 snRNA 3\u2032 end. In addition, the amount of processed product detected in vitro is increased when both the U2 3\u2032 box and the USE are present. The minihelix may therefore influence processing by interacting with a processing factor and/or prevent RNA cleaved by a 3\u2032-box-dependent endonuclease from being rapidly turned over by exonucleases (1). Addition of 17 nt of the natural U1 gene-encoded sequence upstream of the U1 3\u2032 box also causes an apparent shift in the position of the final 3\u2032 ends, some of which now map to the most abundant pre-U1 3\u2032 ends detected in cellular RNA (17,18). The sequences directly upstream from the U1 3\u2032 box may therefore play a similar role to the U2 USE to determine the final position of the pre-U1 3\u2032 end. In both cases the site of endonucleolytic cleavage may be influenced by the exact sequence of the target RNA or changes in processing\u2013factor RNA interaction. Alternatively, the natural sequences may be preferential substrates for limited trimming by exonucleases following 3\u2032 box-directed cleavage. However, unlike the U2 USE, the 17 nt upstream from the U1 3\u2032 box do not cause an increase in the amount of processed RNA detected but rather a decrease. In addition, unlike the U2 USE (1), the 59 nt of U1 sequence upstream of the 3\u2032 box do not direct formation of pre-U1 3\u2032 ends, suggesting functional differences. In agreement with this, little authentic pre-U1 RNA is produced from transfected U1 templates lacking the 3\u2032 box (17).A precise pre-U1 3\u2032 end is not required for RNA maturation in vitroAlthough pre-U2 snRNA can be further 3\u2032 processed in vitro (2,21), maturation of the 3\u2032 ends of pre-U1 snRNA in vitro has not previously been reported. However, in our in vitro system the inclusion of U1 snRNA sequences containing the Sm protein binding site and the 3\u2032 terminal stem\u2013loop (19) in the RNA substrate results in the production of properly processed mature U1 3\u2032 ends. Interaction of Sm protein with its binding site is required for the cytoplasmic 5\u2032 cap modification of U1 snRNA, which is necessary for nuclear re-import (26) and it also plays a role in maturation of the 3\u2032 ends of yeast U1 snRNA (27, reviewed in 3,28). Surprisingly, in vitro 3\u2032 end maturation occurs independently of 3\u2032-box-dependent processing, suggesting that no intermediate processing step is required even though the substrate U1 RNAs have relatively long 3\u2032 extensions (27\u201329 nt). Instead, 3\u2032 end extensions longer than 10 nt are not processed to the mature form when human pre-U1 RNAs are injected into Xenopus oocytes (20). In addition, specialized sequences distinct from the Sm protein binding site are required for cytoplasmic trimming of the 3\u2032 end of human U2 snRNA (29), and pre-U2 RNA with the natural 3\u2032 ends are preferential substrates for the reaction in vitro (2,21). There may therefore be differences in 3\u2032 end maturation of Xenopus and human U1 snRNAs, and between human U1 and U2 snRNAs. The availability of in vitro systems for both 3\u2032-box-dependent processing and maturation of 3\u2032 extended pre-U1 snRNAs will facilitate the molecular analysis of all steps leading to accurate formation of U1 3\u2032 ends.
