The aim of the present study was to assess tracheostomy-related practices in a multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients in the United States (US). We also investigated whether different timing and techniques of tracheostomy were associated with better patient outcomes. METHODSAll adult patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who required tracheostomy between February 1, 2020 and September 4, 2020 across 5 systems in United States were included. Data on outcomes were collected and reviewed last on January 15, 2021. Tracheostomies were performed by several specialties: interventional pulmonology, general surgery, thoracic surgery, otorhinolaryngology, and neurocritical care intensivists. Participating institutions included Duke University (Durham, NC), University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI), University of California at San Diego (San Diego, CA), Emory University (Atlanta, GA), and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU; Richmond, VA). Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from every institution (Duke IRB protocol # 00106067). Data were extracted from review of electronic medical records and included patient and disease characteristics; intra and post-procedural data; hospital course including ventilator weaning and length of stay; and outcomes including adverse events and survival. All data were entered into a REDCap database maintained by Duke University for secure web-based data capture from different institutions.Statistical AnalysisContinuous data are presented as the median with 25th and 75th percentiles (Q1-Q3), whereas categorical data are displayed as counts with percentages. Comparisons between continuous variables were made using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used if >2 groups were compared, as none of the variables met normality assumptions for parametric tests. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare matched pairs. Categorical variables were assessed using the \u03c72 test. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all analyses, and a two-sided P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTSDuring the study time frame, 2793 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19 to the seven hospitals in 5 academic medical systems, 966 (34.5%) were admitted to the intensive care units, and 668 (23.9%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy was performed in 118 (4.2% of total admitted) mechanically ventilated patients. Patients on invasive mechanical ventilation who did not undergo tracheostomy either stayed on the ventilator for <2 weeks or died. Patient characteristics are shown in Table \u200bTable1.1. Most patients were obese, with a median body mass index (BMI) of 32.6 (Q1\u2013Q3: 27.9\u201337.4). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present in all patients during the ICU admission, and based on Berlin definition,17 63.6% of patients met criteria for severe ARDS. Thirty patients (25%) were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 22\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 18\u201325), and only 9 (7.6%) patients had tracheostomy within 14\u200adays (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Percutaneous technique was used for 78.0% of procedures, whereas the remainder were performed with open surgical technique\u2014primarily because of anatomical concerns that precluded percutaneous approach. Tracheostomy was performed with standard percutaneous and surgical techniques, with addition of personal protective equipment and measures to decrease aerosolization.4,9 Most of the tracheostomies (61.0%) were performed by interventional pulmonologists. Five (4.2%) surgical tracheostomies were done in the operating room, mainly due to complexity of the patient airway and surgeon preference.TABLE 1Patient Characteristics (N = 118)DemographicsAge, y, median (Q1\u2013Q3)54 (42.5\u201365.0)Sex, N (%)\u2003Male75 (63.6%)\u2003Female43 (36.4%)Race, N (%)\u2003African American54 (45.7%)\u2003White26 (22%)\u2003Hispanic27 (22.9%)\u2003Others11 (9.3%)BMI, median (Q1\u2013Q3)32.6 (27.9\u201337.4)Comorbidities, N (%)\u2003Diabetes49 (41.5%)\u2003Hypertension53 (44.9%)\u2003Cardiovascular disease13 (11%)\u2003Cerebrovascular disease5 (4.2%)\u2003Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease2 (1.7%)\u2003Asthma16 (13.6%)\u2003Liver disease3 (2.5%)\u2003Renal disorder26 (22%)\u2003Malignancy2 (1.7%)Hospitalization data\u2003Mode of COVID-19 diagnosis, N (%)\u2003\u2003Nasopharyngeal swab118 (100%)\u2003Time in days from COVID-19 diagnosis to intubation, median (Q1\u2013Q3)2 (0\u20135)\u2003ARDS\u2217, N (%)\u2003\u2003Any118 (100%)\u2003\u2003Mild10 (8.5%)\u2003\u2003Moderate33 (28.0%)\u2003\u2003Severe75 (63.6%)\u2003SAPS II Score on admission to ICU, median (Q1\u2013Q3)35 (29\u201345)\u2003ECMO support, N (%)30 (25.4%)\u2003Respiratory data on day of tracheostomy\u2003PEEP on tracheostomy day, median (Q1\u2013Q3), cm H2O10 (6\u201312)\u2003FiO2 on tracheostomy day, median (Q1-Q3)0.4 (0.4\u20130.5)\u2003PaO2 on tracheostomy day, median (Q1\u2013Q3), mm Hg81 (72\u2013107)\u2003PaO2/FiO2 ratio on tracheostomy day, median (Q1\u2013Q3)195.8 (144.3\u2013273.3)Open in a separate window\u2217ARDS defined according to Berlin definition where PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 201 to 300 is mild, 101\u2013200 is moderate, and \u2264100 is severe ARDS.ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.TABLE 2Tracheostomy Procedural DataTime from intubation to tracheostomy, median (Q1\u2013Q3), days22 (18\u201325)Tracheostomy timing, N (%)\u2003Early (0\u201314 days)9 (7.6%)\u2003Middle (15\u201321 days)48 (40.7%)\u2003Late (>21 days)61 (51.7%)Type of tracheostomy procedure, N (%)\u2003Percutaneous92 (78.0%)\u2003Surgical or open26 (22.0%)Procedural team, N (%)\u2003Interventional pulmonary72 (61.0%)\u2003General surgery23 (19.5%)\u2003Thoracic surgery8 (6.8%)\u2003Otorhinolaryngology10 (8.5%)\u2003Neurocritical care5 (4.2%)Tracheostomy tube size, N (%)\u2003635 (29.7%)\u200374 (3.4%)\u20037.51 (0.8%)\u2003877 (65.3%)\u20038.51 (0.8%)Paralytic used, N (%)118 (100%)Ventilator pause, N (%)118 (100%)Ultrasound use during tracheostomy, N (%)\u2003Yes56 (47.5%)\u2003No62 (52.5%)Bronchoscope, N (%)\u2003Disposable105 (89.0%)\u2003Nondisposable13 (11.0%)Personal protective equipment, N (%)\u2003PAPR70 (59.3%)\u2003CAPR14 (11.8%)\u2003N95 with face-shield54 (45.8%)\u2003Caps118 (100%)\u2003Gowns118 (100%)\u2003Gloves118 (100%)Location of procedure, N (%)\u2003Bedside113 (95.8%)\u2003Operating room5 (4.2%)Negative pressure room, N (%)117 (99.2%)Medications when performing tracheostomy, N (%)\u2003Aspirin15 (12.7%)\u2003Clopidogrel0 (0%)\u2003Heparin\u2003\u2003Subcutaneous8 (6.8%)\u2003\u2003Intravenous-held77 (90.6%)\u2003Enoxaparin- held21 (18.4%)\u2003Direct thrombin inhibitors-held12 (10.3%)\u2003Vasopressors43 (36.4%)Open in a separate windowCPAR indicates controlled air-purifying respirator; PAPR, powered air-purifying respirator.Direct thrombin inhibitors included bivalirudin and argatroban.Seventy-eight (66.1%) patients were weaned from the ventilator by the time of last data review, with a median of 36\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 30\u201341) on ventilator (Table \u200b(Table3).3). The median sedation days, defined as days with Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) <0, were 18\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 14\u201322) pre-tracheostomy versus 7\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 3\u201313) post-tracheostomy (P < 0.001). Tracheostomy tubes were decannulated in 40 (33.9%) patients. Ninety-eight patients (83.8%) were discharged from ICU, with median ICU length of stay of 35.5\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 28\u201345.5). Ultimately, 100 patients (84.7%) were discharged from the hospital, with median length of stay of 49\u200adays (Q1\u2013Q3: 37\u201361). Eighteen (15.3%) patients died in the hospital, and no deaths were attributable to tracheostomy. Non\u2013life-threatening complications seen with tracheostomy are listed in Table \u200bTable3.3. There were no significant differences in complications when stratified by timing, technique of tracheostomy, or patient BMI. Seventy-five (63.6%) patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) defined as clinical suspicion of ventilator associated pneumonia with positive respiratory cultures that necessitated antibiotic administration.

DISCUSSIONThis study is the first to report on multicenter and multidisciplinary experience of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure in the United States. Differences in protocols at institutions allowed us to identify sources of variation and to investigate outcomes associated with different approaches. Almost all the tracheostomies were performed at bedside in negative pressure rooms in the intensive care units, using enhanced personal protective equipment. Percutaneous tracheostomy was the first-line technique, with surgical tracheostomy reserved for patients with difficult anatomy. Most tracheostomies were performed after >2 weeks of mechanical ventilation, and limited bleeding was the most common complication.Percutaneous tracheostomy, as compared to surgical tracheostomy, was associated with decreased total ventilator days, earlier weaning from the ventilator post-tracheostomy, and shorter ICU and hospital length of stay. This outcome contrasts with a randomized controlled trial by two surgeons at a single institution that compared percutaneous versus surgical tracheostomy in 67 patients with COVID-19 and found no difference between the 2 techniques.21 The decreased total ventilator days may have led to lower incidence of VAP in the percutaneous group when compared to the surgical cohort (59% vs 81%, P = 0.039), as other patient characteristics like BMI were similar in both groups. Lower VAP rate can also explain other improved outcomes seen with percutaneous tracheostomy.There was no significant difference in complications between percutaneous and surgical techniques. The most common complication associated with tracheostomy was non\u2013life-threatening bleeding (n = 10, 8.5%). This incidence of bleeding falls within the range reported in previous COVID-19 cohorts of 2% to 30%.18,19,21,22 Tracheostomy-associated bleeding in patients with COVID-19 could be explained by the high use of anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients due to their prothrombotic state23 and ECMO cannula maintenance. Additional factors that might have predisposed to bleeding risk include the lack of standardized use of ultrasonography between centers to avoid vascular structures and the avoidance of electrocautery use.There is a significant controversy as to which tracheostomy technique should be first-line in COVID-19 patients.12,13 Proponents of percutaneous tracheostomy cite lower incidence of infection and bleeding,24 whereas advocates of surgical tracheostomy point to previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and possibly decreased aerosolization.13,14 Such recommendations are likely influenced by not only the available evidence in the literature but also the experience and expertise of the operators.22,25 In our study, we observed that percutaneous technique was the routine first-line procedure, with surgical tracheostomy reserved for patients whose anatomy was not conducive to percutaneous method. This approach was also the standard practice at all institutions before the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating that institutions may maintain their practice with additional safety measures to minimize aerosolization.No previous studies have compared different timings of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. An important caveat in this study was our use of a definition for what constituted early (\u226414\u200adays), middle (15\u201321\u200adays), and late (>21\u200adays) tracheostomy groups based on time from intubation. Although several publications during the pandemic have alluded to timing of tracheostomy within 14\u200adays,18\u201320 or 21\u200adays,8,10,11,21,26 the guideline with broadest stakeholder engagement suggests that tracheostomy need only be delayed until day 10 of invasive mechanical ventilation.9 In our cohort, relatively few patients underwent tracheostomy before 14\u200adays. We observed that the early tracheostomy group was associated with decreased ventilator days compared to late groups in patients who were weaned, but there was no significant association between tracheostomy timing and the rate of VAP. Nonetheless, a significant body of literature attests to the salutary effect of early tracheostomy on reducing days on ventilator and ventilator associated pneumonia.6,27,28 In addition, we observed that early tracheostomy was associated with non-significant increase in complications. A larger cohort will be needed to delineate possible benefits from earlier tracheostomy in COVID-19 respiratory failure.Outcomes of COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy have been reported with varying levels of detail.18\u201322,25,26,29,30 Detailed outcomes, such as comparison of different techniques, sedation duration, and mechanical ventilator parameters, were not reported. In our study, the ventilator weaning rate of 66.1% was similar to other studies, and ECMO weaning rate was 83.3%. About 25% of our patients were on ECMO, after failing the routine ventilator support and proning, as our institutions were tertiary care centers specializing in ECMO care. Tracheostomy was associated with accelerated weaning from sedation, consistent with studies predating the pandemic.5 In our cohort, 15.3% of patients died, corresponding to a mortality rate similar to the other large reported studies.19,26,30 We observed a 63.6% incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is notable since few data are available on VAP in COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation.The strengths of our study include its multicenter design; performance of the tracheostomy by a variety of specialists with both percutaneous and surgical techniques; and identification of significant associations with patient outcomes, which are missing in some larger registries.19,30 Our study is limited by its observational design and small sample size, precluding causal inferences regarding tracheostomy technique and outcomes. We observed that the early tracheostomy group was associated with decreased ventilator days compared to late groups in patients who were weaned, but there was no significant association between tracheostomy timing and the rate of VAP. We also hypothesize that systematic differences in patient selection, rather than effects of procedural technique, may account for the association of percutaneous tracheostomy with reduced time on ventilator, VAP, and length of stay. Although performance of tracheostomy by different specialties increased the heterogeneity of the data, it reflected the real world, multidisciplinary practice at the institutions and increased the generalizability of the findings.Percutaneous tracheostomy is a safe and effective procedure for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and has become a first line approach at several institutions, with surgical tracheostomy often reserved for patients with challenging anatomy. The outcomes of early percutaneous tracheostomy versus surgical tracheostomy should be evaluated in prospective, randomized trials assessing tracheostomy timing and technique in COVID-19 respiratory failure.
