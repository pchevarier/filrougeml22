Here, we present a proximity ligation and sequencing method called Chromatin-Associated RNA sequencing (ChAR-seq) that maps all RNA-to-DNA contacts across the genome. Using Drosophila cells, we show that ChAR-seq provides unbiased, de novo identification of targets of chromatin-bound RNAs including nascent transcripts, chromosome-specific dosage compensation ncRNAs, and genome-wide trans-associated RNAs involved in co-transcriptional RNA processing.Research organism: D. melanogaster IntroductionMuch of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed into non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and several studies have established that a subset of these ncRNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes that bind and regulate chromatin (Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Meller et al., 2015; Cech and Steitz, 2014). Some of the most well studied ncRNAs are those involved in dosage compensation, which include roX1 and roX2 in Drosophila and Xist in mammals. In Drosophila, roX1 and roX2 are part of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex that coats the single male X chromosome to acetylate histone H4K16 and increase transcription (Conrad and Akhtar, 2012). In female mammals, Xist is expressed from a single X-chromosomal locus and coats the X chromosome from which it is expressed in order to silence transcription (Augui et al., 2011). Other ncRNAs, such as HOTAIR (Rinn et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2011), HOTTIP (Wang et al., 2011), and enhancer RNAs (Sigova et al., 2015), have been shown to regulate expression of specific genes by localizing to chromatin and recruiting activating or repressing proteins. Finally, repetitive ncRNA transcripts have roles at chromosomal loci essential in maintaining genomic integrity over many cell divisions, including TERRA at telomeres (Bunting et al., 2010) and alpha-satellites near centromeres (Hall et al., 2012). Despite these well-studied examples, the genomic targets of most chromatin-associated ncRNAs are unknown, and the mechanisms by which these ncRNAs regulate the epigenetic and spatial organization of chromatin remain largely unexplored.Genomic methods for studying the localization of specific RNA transcripts include ChIRP (Chu et al., 2011), CHART (Engreitz et al., 2013), and RAP (Simon et al., 2011). These techniques use hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides to pull down a single target RNA and then next generation sequencing or mass spectrometry to identify its DNA- or protein-binding partners (Simon et al., 2011). However, de novo discovery of chromatin-associated RNAs remains limited to computational predictions (Guttman and Rinn, 2012) or association with previously known factors (Khalil et al., 2009). Nuclear fractionation allows isolation of bulk chromatin and subsequent identification of chromatin bound RNAs via sequencing, but does not provide sequence-resolved maps of RNA binding locations along the genome (Werner and Ruthenburg, 2015). To overcome these limitations, we have developed ChAR-seq, a proximity ligation and sequencing method (Figure 1A) that both identifies chromatin-associated RNAs and maps them to genomic loci (Figure 1B).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.ChAR-seq uses proximity ligation of chromatin-associated RNA and deep sequencing to map RNA-DNA contacts in situ.(A) Overview of the ChAR-seq method wherein RNA-DNA contacts are preserved by crosslinking, followed by in situ ligation of the 3\u2019 end of RNAs to the adenylated 5\u2019 end of the ssDNA tail of an oligonucleotide \u2018bridge\u2019 containing a biotin modification and a DpnII-complementary overhang on the opposite end. After extending the bridge by reverse transcription to generate a strand of cDNA complementary to the RNA, the genomic DNA is then digested with DpnII and then re-ligated, capturing proximally-associated bridge molecules and RNA. The chimeric molecules are reverse-transcribed, purified and sequenced. (B) Chimeric molecules are sequenced and the RNA and DNA ends are distinguished owing to the polarity of the bridge, which preferentially ligates to RNA via the 5'-adenylated tail and to DNA via the DpnII overhang. The RNA and DNA reads are then computationally recombined to produce contact maps for each annotated RNA in the genome. (C) Representative examples of genome-wide RNA coverage plots generated for Total RNA (black), mRNA (red), Hsromega (green), chinmo (green), ten-m (green), snRNA:U2 (cyan), snRNA:7SK (cyan), rox1 (blue) and roX2 (purple). Arrows show the transcription start site for each gene. In chromosome cartoons throughout the paper, light gray represents the primary chromosome scaffolds, darker gray regions are heterochromatic scaffolds, and black circles are centromeres. (D) Zoomed in region for an 850 kilobase region of chromosome 3L (chr3L). ChAR-seq tracks for Total RNA, ten-m, snRNA:U2, and snRNA:7SK are shown in comparison with PRO-seq tracks (Drosophila S2 [Kwak et al., 2013]) and ATAC-seq (this study, CME-W1-cl8+). (E) ChAR-seq contact matrix (RNA-to-RNA, top) plotted and aligned with same 850 kb region as panel D. ChAR-seq was performed without bridge addition (Hi-C/Mock-ChAR), resulting in DNA-DNA proximity ligation as in Hi-C (\u2018Hi-C, DNA-to-DNA\u2019, bottom).Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1.Open in a separate windowDiagram of the oligonucleotide bridge and efficiency of bridge ligation and capture.The oligonucleotide bridge contains a 5'-adenylated (5'-App) six nucleotide ssDNA tail (green), a single biotin modification (purple), a DpnII site (red) and a 3'-three carbon spacer (Sp3). The 3'-Sp3 is removed from the bridge during genomic DpnII digestion, permitting subsequent ligation to genomic DNA.

Products were then analyzed using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a combination of NEB microRNA and low range ssRNA ladders and stained with SYBR-gold. Bands were quantified and the percent product was calculated using (shifted / (total * 0.66)) to account for the molar excess of DNA over RNA. No adjustment was made to account for preferential staining of ssDNA over ssRNA. Residual signal is expected in the lower band owing to the molar excess of DNA over RNA. A high molecular weight band is visible in the Therm 5\u2019 Ligase lane, which most likely consists of high molecular weight concatemers of the AppDNA substrate caused by incomplete 3\u2019 blocking of these oligos or removal of the 3\u2019 block by the Therm 5\u2019 Ligase. This experiment was performed once.Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3.Open in a separate windowDiagram of the ChAR-seq data processing pipeline and bar plot of RNA alignment.(a) Data were processed using a custom pipeline, which can be accessed and is fully documented at: https://github.com/straightlab/flypipe (Bell, 2017\u00a0copy archived at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/flypipe.

We then calculated a cis score, which is equivalent to the percentage of contacts that arise from this region.

ResultsWe developed and performed ChAR-seq using Drosophila melanogaster CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells, a male wing disc derived cell line with a normal karyotype and well-characterized epigenome and transcriptome (Cherbas et al., 2011; Roy et al., 2010). ChAR-seq is a chromosome conformation capture method that maps genome-wide RNA-to-DNA contacts in crosslinked nuclei (Dekker et al., 2002; Rao et al., 2014). Briefly, cells are cross-linked with formaldehyde and permeabilized, then RNA is partially fragmented and soluble RNA is washed away. The chromatin-cross-linked RNA is then ligated to an oligonucleotide duplex 'bridge' molecule and reverse transcribed. Genomic DNA is then digested and ligated onto the other end of the oligonucleotide 'bridge', creating a link between chromatin-associated RNA and proximal DNA. The ligated RNA is fully converted to cDNA during second strand synthesis. Finally, the DNA is sonicated and the chimeric molecules are purified, processed, and sequenced.To enable the capture and analysis of RNA-to-DNA contacts, the oligonucleotide bridge (see\nFigure 1\u2014figure supplement 1) was designed to have several key features: (1) the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) of the bridge ensures that it is the only 5\u2019 end competent for ligation to the 3'-ends of ssRNA by truncated T4 Rnl2tr R55K K227Q mutant ligase (Viollet et al., 2011), which cannot adenylate 5' ends (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2), (2) the sequence of the bridge does not exist in the yeast, fly, mouse or human genomes and encodes a defined polarity, (3) the end of the bridge contains a restriction site for specific ligation to digested genomic DNA, and (4) the bridge is biotinylated so that it can be captured and enriched. After the bridge is ligated to RNA in situ, the molecules are stabilized by reverse transcription using Bst3.0 polymerase, which can traverse the DNA-RNA junction. The genomic DNA is then digested using the restriction enzyme DpnII, which has a median spacing of\u00a0~200 bp between sites in the fly genome. The digested genomic DNA is then ligated to the bridge adaptor using T4 DNA ligase. Second strand synthesis is completed using limiting RNase H and DNA Polymerase I. Crosslinks are then reversed followed by DNA precipitation, sonication and purification using streptavidin beads. Libraries are constructed by repairing and dA-tailing the DNA fragments, ligating TruSeq adaptors to the ends and PCR amplifying (Figure 1A).Upon conversion of RNA-DNA contacts to a covalent chimera, the chimeric molecules were sequenced using 152 bp single-end reads. Sequencing across the bridge junction ensures identification of the RNA and DNA portions of the chimeric molecule by reading the polarity of the bridge (Figure 1B). The RNA/cDNA (Figure 1B, red) and the genomic DNA side (Figure 1B, black) of each read were computationally split and aligned to the transcriptome and genome. After post-processing for unique alignments, repeat removal, and removal of blacklisted regions, each RNA molecule was mapped to the genomic location to which it was ligated (see Materials and methods and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3), resulting in 22.2 million high-confidence unique mapping events for ~16,800 RNA transcripts. All individual RNA-to-DNA contacts for a given transcript were then combined to produce a genome-wide association map for each individual transcript (Figure 1C). To ensure that ChAR-seq signal was not due to spurious bridge-to-DNA ligation, we performed a control experiment in which we added RNase A and RNase H to lysed cells before the RNA-to-bridge ligation. This RNase-treatment reduced the number of unique bridge molecules identified by six-fold, demonstrating that the vast majority of bridge ligation events are indeed RNA-dependent (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4). The ChAR-seq protocol is highly reproducible, with the number normalized RNA-to-DNA contacts observed for each RNA showing high concordance between replicates (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5). To estimate the specificity of our observed RNA-to-DNA ligation events and to ensure that the contacts that we observed were not due to diffusion of RNA after fragmentation, we performed a spike-in experiment wherein we added increasing amounts of exogenous RNA to the cells after lysis but before bridge ligation. After lysis and RNA fragmentation, we recovered and quantified the total soluble RNA from the supernatant, then spiked-in purified in vitro transcribed RNA fragments (~200 nt) from commonly used protein expression vectors (MBP, HALO and GFP). The spike-in controls were added at 0.1%, 1% and 10% of the total, recoverable RNA by mass. Though we see a clear concentration-dependent increase in the number of false positives, even in the scenario where we spiked in RNA at 10% of the total soluble RNA we observed fewer than 0.5% false positive RNA-to-DNA contacts (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6), which compares favorably to the false positive rates in related RNA-DNA mapping methods (Li et al., 2017; Sridhar et al., 2017).Only the 3'-hydroxyl of each RNA is available for ligation to the bridge, thus the polarity of each RNA molecule with respect to its transcriptional direction can be determined by its orientation with respect to the bridge. The majority (85% of total) of the RNAs captured in our assay were sense, with the largest single subtype represented by sense-stranded mRNA (32% of total), owing to the capture of nascent transcripts (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7). Most of the chromatin-associated antisense transcripts that we identified arose from ncRNA or intronic regions. In fact, 96% of the antisense mRNAs were intronic in origin with 64% of these originating from a single 119 kb gene (CG42339), suggesting the presence of unannotated ncRNAs in this region. The remaining chromatin-associated RNA detected in our assay arose from non-protein coding transcripts (see\nFigure 1\u2014figure supplement 7), of which 18% were small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and 19% were small nuclear RNA (snRNA).ChAR-seq generated RNA-to-DNA contacts can be aggregated (Figure 1C, see e.g., Total RNA), grouped by RNA class (Figure 1C, see e.g., mRNA) or viewed individually (Figure 1C). Individual RNAs mapped by ChAR-seq generally fell into one of three classes. In the first class, RNAs were found around the locus from which they are transcribed (Figure 1C, see, e.g., Hsromega, chinmo, ten-m). In the second class, RNAs were found bound to chromatin in trans, generally distributed across most or all of the genome, often in addition to a peak around the gene body from which the RNA is transcribed (Figure 1C, see e.g., snRNA:U2, snRNA:7SK). In a third class, RNAs that are part of the dosage compensation complex (Figure 1C, see roX1 and roX2) were enriched on and coat the X chromosome. To investigate this first class of RNAs, we compared aggregated RNA-to-DNA contacts with data from nascent transcription sequencing using PRO-seq (Kwak et al., 2013), and observed qualitative agreement between PRO-seq and ChAR-seq data sets (Figure 1D, see PRO-seq and mRNA). Nevertheless, many RNA-to-DNA contacts in our dataset are associated in trans to genomic regions outside of the gene body from which the RNA is transcribed (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8).To determine if the ChAR-seq protocol disrupts genome organization, we omitted the bridge to produce a mock-treated sample. We next biotinylated the DpnII-digested ends in our mock-sample and ligated them, essentially preparing a Hi-C library (\u2018Hi-C/Mock-ChAR\u2019) (see Materials and methods for details) from the mock-treated sample (Figure 1E, bottom). Topologically associated domains (TADs) are preserved in the mock-treated sample and the DNA-DNA contacts show high correlation with previously published CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell Hi-C (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2015) (Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 9\u201310). Thus, the three-dimensional genome organization is largely preserved in our protocol. Furthermore, the profile of RNA-to-DNA contacts detected by ChAR-seq was distinctly different from that of DNA-to-DNA contacts in our mock-treated Hi-C library (Figure 1E and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 9), indicating that ChAR-seq signal is not simply a byproduct of DNA-DNA contacts.ChAR-seq data can also be visualized in a two-dimensional contact plot, where the genomic locus from which the RNA is transcribed is represented on the y-axis in linear genome coordinates, and the x-axis defines the genomic location where each RNA was bound. These plots provide a useful overview visualization for of the entire dataset. When we generated these contact plots for ncRNA (Figure 2A), mRNA (Figure 2B) and snRNA (Figure 2C), we observed strong horizontal lines that represent RNA transcripts that are transcribed from a single locus but are found distributed throughout the genome (class II), or in the special case of roX1 and roX2, specifically along the X chromosome (class III). Furthermore, RNAs found at sites from which they are transcribed clustered tightly along the diagonal, a feature most pronounced for mRNAs (class I) (Figure 2B). Many of the RNAs we found distributed broadly across the genome are transcription associated small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Figure 2C). One of these, snRNA:7SK, is an abundant snRNA that functions as a scaffold for a transcriptional regulatory ribonucleoprotein complex that includes p-TEFb, Hexim and LARP7. Other broadly distributed snRNAs are components of the spliceosome (e.g., snRNA:U2) which largely functions co-transcriptionally (Perales and Bentley, 2009).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.ChAR-seq is an \u2018all to all\u2019 RNA-to-DNA proximity ligation method.(A) Genome-wide plot of RNA to DNA contacts for non-coding RNAs. The y-axis represents the region of the genome from which a given RNA was transcribed and the x-axis represents the region of the genome where each RNA was found to be associated through proximity ligation (i.e., the binding site for each RNA). Genome-wide contact plots generated in the same way for (B) mRNA, and (C) snRNA. (D) Cumulative frequency of length-normalized contacts for 16,812 RNAs identified on the \u2018RNA-side\u2019 of chimeric reads. The majority (88%) of RNAs have fewer than 10 contacts per kilobase per million reads (CPKM) in our dataset and were not further analyzed owing to low coverage. The remaining 1952 RNAs account for 18.5 million (83%) of the total RNA-to-DNA contacts. (E) Scatter plot of length normalized chromatin-contacts versus total expression for each RNA.

Right bars represent the fold-enrichment of each RNA in ChAR-seq over RNA-seq.Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2.Open in a separate windowChromatin associated RNAs identified by ChAR-seq are highly reproducible.Venn diagrams displaying overlap of chromatin-associated RNAs identified as having contacts more than 4-fold enriched over RNA expression which have more than 10 CPKM (left) or more than 100 CPKM (right) in technical replicates.To identify RNAs that are highly enriched for chromatin interactions, we plotted the normalized cumulative distribution of the number of sense contacts observed for each gene (Figure 2D). The majority of the RNAs in our dataset (14,860 out of 16,812, 88%) had fewer than 10 contacts per kilobase million reads (CPKM) (Figure 2D) and were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 1952 RNAs (12%) accounted for 83% (18.5 million) of all chromatin contacts in our data set. To estimate the contribution of total RNA abundance to this interaction signal, we performed RNA-seq for the CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell line and compared RNA expression levels with RNA-to-DNA contacts identified by ChAR-seq (Figure 2E, Supplementary file 1). We observed a correlation between RNA expression level and chromatin-RNA contacts; however, a cluster of RNAs clearly generated more chromatin interactions that would be expected from the overall expression levels (Figure 2E). Using both the length and read normalized contacts (CPKM) and the fold-enrichment over RNA expression as measured by RNA-seq, we identified 138 RNAs that had more than 100 CPKM and were enriched more than ten-fold, though many were enriched by 2\u20135 orders of magnitude (Figure 2E, red symbols; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). Notably, we observe good concordance between the RNAs identified using this methodology between replicates (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2).We developed ChAR-seq using the male WME-cl8+\u00a0line, reasoning that the ncRNAs roX1 and roX2 would serve as an internal positive control. Both roX1 and roX2 are part of the MSL2 complex, which binds across the X-chromosome in male flies to recruit chromatin-modifiers that increase transcriptional output (Figure 3A) (Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015). Indeed, ChAR-seq data showed roX1 and roX2 to be 7.6-fold (p-value<10\u221210) and 8.1-fold (p-value<10\u221210) enriched for interactions on the X chromosome, respectively (Figure 3B,C, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). In contrast, female flies express Sex lethal (Sxl), which binds to msl2 mRNA to prevent its translation, blocking assembly of the MSL2 complex (Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015). Importantly, roX1 and roX2 require MSL2 for X-chromosome specific localization (Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015), therefore female cells should lack detectable spreading of these ncRNAs along the X-chromosome. When we performed ChAR-seq in a female Drosophila melanogaster cell line, Kc167, we did not detect any significant roX2 localization on the X chromosome (Figure 3D) but observed excellent agreement in interaction signal from other RNAs across both cell lines (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2, Figure 3C\nmale, CME-W1-cl8+ and Figure 3D, female, Kc167, see e.g., snRNA:7SK and Hsromega).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Mapping roX1 and roX2 of the X chromosome dosage compensation complex.(A) Illustration of the roX1/roX2 spreading across the solitary X chromosome in male flies (CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell line). In contrast, the female-derived Kc167 cell line expresses significantly lower levels of the MSL2 complex, which mediates the association of roX1 and roX2, which therefore do not coat either of the two X-chromosomes in females.

(E) Comparison of ChAR-seq (this work) to an alternative RNA-to-chromatin mapping method called ChIRP-seq (data from reference [Quinn et al., 2014]). Tracks for roX1 (upper, blue) and roX2 (lower, purple) were generated from 32308 and 87453 contacts, respectively, from a ChAR-seq dataset containing a total of 22.2 million contacts. For comparison, the roX1 and roX2 tracks derived from ChIRP-seq each represent greater that 20 million reads. To compare tracks at different read depths, the contact number was autoscaled, with the maximum peak height given a value of 1.

(G) Correlation coefficients were calculated for roX1 and roX2 coverage tracks generated using ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq and plotted relative to increasing bin size to estimate the resolution of the ChAR-seq assay.Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1.Open in a separate windowroX RNAs are enriched on the X chromosome.(A) roX1 and roX2 are\u00a0~8 fold enriched on chromosome X as compared to autosomes (autosomal reads normalized to 1). (B) Comparison of ChAR-seq with ChIRP-seq and another recently published RNA-DNA contact identification method, GRID-seq (Li et al., 2017).

Read density is DpnII or AluI site density normalized for ChAR- and GRID-seq, respectively, and library sized normalized for published ChIRP-seq data (asterisk). See Extended methods for filtering and restriction enzyme density normalization procedures. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation of signal (over 20 kb bins across chrX) between methods is: ChAR-ChIRP, rho\u00a0=\u00a00.80, GRID-ChIRP, rho\u00a0=\u00a00.84, ChAR-GRID, rho\u00a0=\u00a00.79.Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2.Open in a separate windowComparison of RNA-to-DNA contacts between cell type.Scatter plot of the number of contacts for chromatin-associated RNAs identified in CME-W1-cl8+ (x-axis) and Kc167 (y-axis) cell lines. Location of roX1 and roX2 are indicated in blue and purple respectively. Red line indicates where chromatin-associated RNAs that are not expressed in a cell-type dependent manner are expected to be found.High-resolution maps of roX1 and roX2 localization have previously been generated using ChIRP-Seq, which hybridizes probes against a known RNA and pulls down the associated chromatin for sequencing (Chu et al., 2011; Quinn et al., 2014). Comparing ChIRP-seq to ChAR-seq for both roX1 and roX2 (Figure 3E), we found that DNA contact locations were in surprisingly good agreement despite the fact that ChAR-seq reads are spread across all RNAs while ChIRP-seq reads map the specific RNA target, resulting in a large disparity in the effective sequencing depth between the methods. In ChIRP-seq, virtually all of the signal is attributable to interactions between chromatin and the target RNA. In contrast, ChAR-seq captures all RNA and DNA contacts, so that any given target RNA will comprise a subset of the total RNA-chromatin contacts in the dataset. In the case of roX1 and roX2, we observed 32,308 and 87,453 contacts, representing 0.1% and 0.36% of the ChAR-seq dataset. In contrast, the ChIRP-seq datasets plotted in Figure 3E represent\u00a0~24M and\u00a0~21M reads for roX1 and roX2, respectively. This indicates that ChAR-seq can identify RNA peaks along chromatin with high sensitivity for a given RNA.To more quantitatively compare ChAR-seq to ChIRP-seq, we compared the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for roX1 and roX2 binding to DNA in each assay (Figure 3F). We defined signal as the most densely bound regions on chrX, whereas we defined noise as binding events distributed randomly on autosomes (see Materials and methods for details). We found that ChAR-seq roX1 SNR was much higher than that of ChIRP-seq (49.8 vs 3.9), and ChAR-seq roX2 SNR was about two-fold higher than that of ChIRP-seq (45.2 vs 22.0), despite having 2 orders of magnitude fewer reads in ChAR-seq. Altogether, these data suggest that ChAR-seq has excellent sensitivity and sufficient signal-to-noise to characterize accurate chromatin-binding events for individual RNAs.The resolution with which we can measure the localization of an RNA to a given genomic site constrains our ability to assess its potential modes of action. To measure the accuracy of ChAR-seq measurements of RNA interaction with DNA, we compared ChAR-Seq data to ChIRP-seq data to estimate the base-pair resolution of ChAR-Seq. We expected this resolution to be bounded \u2013\u2013in part\u2013\u2013by the local DpnII cut frequency and the number of contacts for any given RNA. We divided the X chromosome into evenly sized bins and calculated correlation coefficients between ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq datasets at increasing bin sizes for both roX1 and roX2 (Figure 3G). Using this method, we noted a bi-phasic increase of the correlation coefficient, corresponding to a minor plateau around 200 bp and a major plateau at\u00a0~25 kbp. The minor plateau is likely due to the DpnII distribution bias in the ChAR-seq tracks, while the major plateau is an estimate of the resolution of our assay, which is on the order of other proximity-ligation sequencing assays like Hi-C (van Berkum et al., 2010).To test if we could identify the functional roles for our most highly enriched RNAs, we clustered the snRNA class of RNAs based on their genomic contacts. These snRNAs collectively comprised 23% of all the RNA-to-DNA contacts in our dataset (Figure 4A) and are a substantial component of the spliceosome, a multi-megadalton ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing (Zhou et al., 2002; Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011). The composition and conformation of the spliceosome is highly dynamic, though two dominant species exist in eukaryotes: the major spliceosome comprised of U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs, and the minor spliceosome comprised of U4:atac, U6:atac, U5, U11, and U12 (Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011). Many members of this class of snRNAs have highly similar gene duplication variants in the Drosophila genome. We therefore first calculated the base sequence similarity of these variants to one another and aggregated signals that were tightly clustered (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). When we then correlated genome-wide binding signal within this class, we found that the distribution patterns of the major spliceosome snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 clustered together along with snRNA:7SK (Figure 4B), which is part of the p-TEFb complex that relieves pausing of RNA Polymerase II at promoters (Kwak and Lis, 2013) and may participate in the release of paused polymerase during RNA splicing (Barboric et al., 2009). The components of the minor spliceosome did not cluster together, likely due to their low abundance (Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2011) and consequently low representation in our dataset.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.Correlation of chromatin-associated RNAs with genome features.(A) Relative abundance of snRNAs identified by ChAR-seq.

Distance scores were then clustered using the heatmap module in R. Low scores (blue) represent a high similarity, while a higher score (red) represents higher levels of dissimilarity.Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2.Open in a separate windowRNA abundance over TAD boundaries and centers.(A) (top row) Boxplots showing the number of snRNA:7SK and snRNA:U2 ChAR-seq RNA-DNA trans contacts intersecting TAD boundaries (blue) or TAD centers (red) in 20 kb bins centered around the feature. Boxplot contains the median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentile) for RNA-to-DNA contacts per bin for each RNA type. Bins were matched for repeatmasking and size. Asterisks above each boxplot denote p-values (p<1\u00d710\u22129), and were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Bonferonni corrected for the multiple tests (all p-values<1\u00d710\u22129). (bottom row) Meta-analysis plots aggregating the signal of snRNA:7SK and snRNA:U2 over TAD boundaries (red) and random regions (black) of matched size. Signal is relative to random background. (B) Similar plots as in (A), but for roX2 and ATAC-seq (i.e., Tn5 insertion signal).We next reasoned that spliceosome RNAs\u2013\u2013as part of the co-transcriptional RNA processing machinery\u2013\u2013should also be enriched in regions of active transcription. We therefore aggregated spliceosomal RNA signals over gene bodies (Figure 4C, red lines), putative enhancers (Kvon et al., 2014) (Figure 4C, blue dashed lines) and a random distribution of genomic bins of similar size (Figure 4C, black lines). We observed an enrichment of snRNAs (7SK, U2 and U6), but not roX1 or roX2, over gene bodies (Figure 4C) with a broad peak around transcription start sites, in good agreement with ChIRP data for 7SK in mice (Flynn et al., 2016). Because active transcription is also correlated with topological boundaries in flies (Hou et al., 2012; Ulianov et al., 2016), we examined the relationship between RNA contacts and genome organization. To test whether RNA-DNA contacts are enriched at topological boundaries, we measured the DNA contact frequency for snRNA:7SK and snRNA:U2 in 20 kb windows spanning TAD boundaries and TAD centers. Both 7SK and U2 RNAs were modestly, but significantly (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) enriched at TAD boundaries (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A (top)). We also aggregated 7SK and U2 contact signals across all TAD boundaries (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A (bottom), red lines) and a random distribution of identically sized genomic bins (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A (bottom), black lines), and found that these RNAs were\u00a0~1.4 fold enriched over boundaries. We also noted that roX2 was\u00a0~2.2 fold enriched over TAD boundaries on the X chromosome (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B), consistent with previous data showing that MSL2 dosage compensation complex High Affinity Sites (HAS) are preferentially found at TAD boundaries (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2015). Examination of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) over TAD boundaries (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B) showed that open chromatin is enriched at TAD boundaries, supporting the idea that TAD boundaries are transcriptionally active in flies.In contrast to the small number of well-defined and well-characterized snRNAs involved in splicing, there are more than 200 snoRNAs in flies (Huang et al., 2005) that are significantly divergent in sequence and, surprisingly, were highly represented in our dataset (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132). Most of these snoRNAs have either unknown function or are computationally identified and indirectly implicated in the maturation and modification of ribosomal rRNA (Huang et al., 2005).To determine if our enriched chromatin-associated RNAs, in particular snRNAs and snoRNAs, might localize to euchromatic or heterochromatic states or with specific transcription factors, we cross-correlated our ChAR-seq signal against modENCODE datasets available for the CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell line. To normalize the signals for comparison, we first calculated the expected contacts per 2 kb bin for each RNA under a uniform distribution, based on the total number of genome-wide contacts for each RNA and the number of DpnII sites per bin. This null model was then used to calculate the log2 ratio of the observed to the expected contacts per bin for each RNA, which was then transformed into a z-score ((x-\u03bc)/\u03c3) based on the whole-genome mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). Similarly, we re-binned the modENCODE tracks, removed bins that did not contain a DpnII site, and transformed the log2 mean-shift values to a z-score. We then calculated the pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between each signal track, and then clustered the data (Figure 4D). We observed discrete clustering of roX1 and roX2 with known dosage compensation complex factors, MOF, the histone modifications H4K16ac and H3K36me3 (Bell et al., 2008), and JIL-1 kinase (Bai et al., 2004), validating this analytical approach (Figure 4D). Beyond this sub-cluster of dosage compensation factors, the remainder of the chromatin-associated RNAs fell into two distinct and anti-correlated categories: those associated with active chromatin and transcription (e.g., RNAPII, H4K8ac, H3K18ac) or heterochromatin (e.g., HP2, H3K9me3, HP1a) (Figure 4D). In particular, we note that snRNA:U2 and snRNA:7SK cluster tightly with the transcription-associated chromatin marks, while many of the snoRNAs and minor spliceosome snRNAs that we identified are associated with heterochromatin, likely due to co-localization of heterochromatin factors to the nucleolus. Interestingly, snRNA:U5, a component of both the major and minor spliceosome, has variants that clearly cluster with either transcriptionally active chromatin (63BC) or heterochromatin (23D, 38ABa, and 34A). Previous work has shown that the snRNA:U5:38Aba variant (Figure 4D, heterochromatin cluster) exhibits a unique tissue-specific expression profile with the greatest abundance in neural tissue, which led the authors to propose isoform-dependent functions in alternative splicing (Chen et al., 2005). The differential clustering that we observe for snRNA:U5, and between major and minor spliceosome snRNAs, for euchromatin and heterochromatin might reflect such isoform-specific functions of the spliceosome in different chromatin states. DiscussionChAR-seq maps the chromosomal binding sites of all chromatin-associated RNAs, independent of whether they are associated as nascent transcripts or bound as part of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). In this way, ChAR-seq can be thought of as a massively parallelized de novo RNA mapping assay capable of generating hundreds to thousands of RNA-binding maps. ChAR-seq also detects multiple classes of chromatin-associated RNAs. ChAR-seq preserves the three-dimensional structure of the genome and provides an RNA-DNA interaction matrix that complements DNA-DNA proximity measurements using Hi-C. We validated ChAR-seq using chromosome-specific ncRNAs roX1 and roX2 associated with dosage compensation. The comparison between ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq, which vary dramatically in the sequencing depth needed to analyze a specific RNA, highlights the utility of ChAR-seq as a de novo chromatin-associated RNA discovery tool. ChAR-seq also maps nascent RNAs found at the loci from which they are transcribed.ChAR-seq is similar to a recently published method (Sridhar et al., 2017), but has two key distinctions. First, proximity ligations are performed in situ in intact nuclei, which reduces nonspecific interactions (Rao et al., 2014). Second, ChAR-seq uses long single-end reads to sequence across the entire junction of the \u2018bridge\u2019, ensuring that RNA-to-DNA contacts are mapped with high confidence and reporting on the polarity of the bridge-ligated RNA.While this work was in revision, a genome-wide RNA-DNA contact method\u2014GRID-seq\u2014was published that also uses proximity ligation of a directional bridge to RNA and DNA (Li et al., 2017). One key difference is that GRID-seq uses a restriction enzyme to cut cDNA and gDNA fragments 19\u201323 bp distal to the bridge, which allows size selection of molecules that contain both RNA and DNA. This likely reduces the number of uninformative molecules sequenced. A disadvantage, however, is that the resulting reads are 19\u201323 bp, which have a greater chance of falsely mapping during genome alignment than the 20\u2013100 bp RNA and DNA fragments obtained with ChAR-seq. Although their details differ, ChAR-seq and GRID-seq appear to have similar ability to detect roX2 binding to chrX in Drosophila (see\nFigure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B).We used ChAR-seq to discover and map several dozen ncRNAs that are pervasively bound across the genome. Many of these ncRNAs are components of ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with transcription elongation (snRNA:7SK), splicing (snRNA:U2, etc) and RNA processing (snRNAs, snoRNAs and scaRNAs). Interestingly, more than half of the chromatin-associated RNAs identified based on our enrichment criteria are snoRNAs, most of which\u2013\u2013but not all\u2013\u2013correlate with heterochromatin. Generally, snoRNA ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) use intermolecular base pairing to direct chemical modification of the 2'-hydroxyl groups or the isomerization of uridines to pseudouridine (Cech and Steitz, 2014) and snoRNAs are known abundant components of chromatin in both flies (Schubert et al., 2012) and in mice (Meng et al., 2016). Despite their abundance and the their known role in RNA modification, we do not yet understand the functions of these modifications, or the implication of snoRNAs and scaRNAs chromatin association in cells (Cech and Steitz, 2014). We also demonstrate that ChAR-seq can be used with orthogonal genome-wide datasets to identify and classify RNAs that are associated with specific chromatin states (e.g., euchromatin vs heterochromatin). We expect this approach will be particularly useful in organisms that use lncRNAs such as HOTAIR, HOTTIP and BRAVEHEART as scaffolds for ribonucleoproteins that regulate facultative heterochromatin. Finally, we observed enrichment of transcription-associated RNAs with TAD boundaries, reflecting a potential role for active transcription in the topological organization of the genome. This observation is consistent with previous observations that active transcription is a stronger predictor for TAD partitioning in flies (Hou et al., 2012; Ulianov et al., 2016) than CTCF and cohesin, the prototypical TAD boundary markers in mice and humans (Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016).We anticipate that ChAR-seq will be a powerful new high throughput discovery platform capable of simultaneously identifying new chromatin-associated RNAs and mapping their chromatin binding sites (and associated epigenetic chromatin states), all of which will be particularly useful in comparing \u2018epigenomic\u2019 changes that coincide with cellular differentiation or tumorigenesis. Materials and methodsBrief description of ChAR-Seq protocolDrosophila melanogaster CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells (Drosophila Genome Resource Center, Stock #151) were grown in T-75 flasks at 27\u00b0C in Shields and Sang M3 media supplemented with 5 \u00b5g/mL insulin, 2% FBS, 2% fly extract and 100 \u00b5g/mL Pen-Strep (Cherbas et al., 2011). Approximately 100\u2013400 million cells were harvested for each library by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 2\u20134 min, resuspended in fresh media plus 1% formaldehyde and fixed for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was quenched by adding 0.2 M glycine and mixing for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 2\u20134 min, resuspended in 1 mL of PBS, and centrifuged again at 2000 x g for 2 min. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, and the cell pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280C until needed. Cells were thawed in lysis buffer and the cross-linked nuclei and cellular material were isolated by centrifugation for the in situ ligation protocol. Female Kc167 cells (Drosophila Genome Resource Center, Stock #1) for analysis of sex dependent RNA contact map were processed as for CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells. Both Kc167 and CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells were authenticated by the Drosophila Genome Resource Center and tested for mycoplasma contamination by cytoplasmic DNA staining.Briefly, RNA was lightly and partially chemically fragmented by heating in the presence of magnesium. The pellet was isolated and washed, and RNA ends were ligated using truncated T4 Rnl2tr R55K K227Q ligase (hereafter referred to as trT4KQ RNA ligase) to an oligonucleotide 'bridge' molecule containing a 5'-adenylated ssDNA overhang. The RNA ligase was inactivated, the pellet was washed and the RNA strand was stabilized by first strand synthesis of the RNA through extension of the bridge by Bst 3.0 polymerase. The polymerase was inactivated and the pellet was washed. Genomic DNA was then digested with DpnII, followed by ligation of the DpnII digested genomic DNA to the opposite end of the oligonucleotide 'bridge'. Second strand synthesis was then performed using RNaseH and DNA Polymerase I to complete cDNA synthesis of the RNA-encoded side of the new, chimeric molecules. The sample was then deproteinized and crosslinks were reversed by heating overnight in SDS and proteinase K. DNA was then ethanol precipitated and sheared to\u00a0~200 bp fragments using a Covaris focused ultra-sonicator. DNA fragments containing the biotinylated bridge were then purified using magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. DNA ends were repaired using the NEBNext End Repair and dA tailing module, and ligated to NEBNext hairpin adaptors for Illumina sequencing. The adaptor hairpin was cleaved using USER, and DNA fragments were amplified by\u00a0~8\u201312 rounds of PCR with NEBNext Indexing Primers for Illumina (TruSeq compatible). The partially amplified library was then purified using AMPure XP beads to remove adaptor dimers, and the optimum number of additional PCR cycles was determined by qPCR to achieve approximately 30% saturation. Library amplification was then completed by the additional rounds of PCR, and the library was purified and size selected to a target range of 100\u2013500 bps using AMPure XP beads. The size distribution of the library was checked by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and quantified using qPCR against a phiX Illumina library standard curve. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform for quality control, and subsequently sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform (Stanford Functional Genomics Facility) using single-end 152 bp reads. Data were processed and analyzed using a custom pipeline.Detailed ChAR-seq protocolShields and Sang M3 media, for 0.5 L 19.6 g S and S M3 powder (Sigma)0.25 g bicarb5 \u00b5g/mL insulin2% FBS2% fly extract1x Pen/StrepSterile filter media using 0.2 um filter.

The number of cycles will vary between each sample library.Step 26: High and low size selection using AMPure XP beads (final polishing) Allow AMPure bead slurry to warm to room temperatureAdd 0.5 volumes of AMPure bead slurry (30 \u00b5L) to PCR mix (60 \u00b5L). Mix by pipetting and incubate at RT for 5 min.Pull down beads with magnet, give 1\u20132 min to clear solution, then recover the supernatant. This should contain fragments from 0 to 500 bp. Larger fragments, if you want them, are bound to the beads. Add 70% EtOH to the beads and set aside.To the supernatant (90 \u00b5L), add 0.5 volumes of original volume (30 \u00b5L) for a final bead to input ratio of 1:1 (total volume should be 120 \u00b5L). Mix and incubate at RT for 5 min.Pull down the beads and remove the supernatant, which should contain small, unwanted fragments (adaptor dimers, etc). Nonetheless, save it for now just in case and set aside.Wash the beads with 700 \u00b5L 70% EtOH, pull down the beads in a magnetic tube rack until clear (1\u20132 min), discard supernatant, and repeat for a total of two washes. Do not disrupt the beads during the second wash.Remove the EtOH completely and let the beads passively dry for\u00a0~5 minAdd 50 \u00b5L of elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8). Incubate for 2\u20133 min. Pull down the beads until clear and remove the supernatant. This should contain fragments from\u00a0~100\u2013500 bp.Step 27: Quality control QC library by Bioanalyzer (1:10 dilution, High Sensitivity)Quantify library by phiX qPCRSequencingChAR-seq libraries were sequenced with single-end 152 bp reads on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Data processing and softwareReads were processed using a custom pipeline, which can be accessed at: https://github.com/straightlab/flypipe\u00a0(Bell, 2017 copy\u00a0archived at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/flypipe). PCR duplicates were removed using Super Deduper (Petersen et al., 2015 using the entire read length. Adapters were removed and reads trimmed for low quality with Trimmomatic\u00a0(Bolger et al., 2014) using a composite set of Illumina adapters, leading/trailing cut length of 3, sliding window of 4:15, and a minimum length of 36. RNA and DNA portions of each read are identified and split by a custom python script that finds the bridge, uses the bridge polarity to identify which side of the read is RNA or DNA, and verifies that there is only a copy of the bridge. All reads lacking a full bridge sequence or that contained two or more bridges were removed. Only reads that contained sequence on both sides of the bridge (RNA and DNA) were processed further. Unique read IDs from the initial read containing the full molecule remained linked to both the RNA and DNA sequences after splitting from the bridge sequence. Additional software used by FlyPipe or during preparation of figures include: bowtie2\u00a0(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), SAMtools\u00a0(Li et al., 2009), BEDtools\u00a0(Quinlan and Hall, 2010), MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008), Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009), R, GraphPad Prism v7.0, deepTools2 (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2016), HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010), and Genieous (Kearse et al., 2012).ChAR-seq DNA and RNA alignmentFour replicates were processed and merged for analysis in the following way. Reads were aligned to Drosophila melanogaster genome (dm3, release r5.57 using bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with the --very-sensitive option and allowing one mismatch. RNA was aligned separately to all dm3 transcriptomes from FlyBase (downloaded January 2016, versions r5.57): with the same bowtie2 parameters, but also first forcing sense strandedness as bridge orientation should preserve the RNA strand information, and then for reads that did not align in the sense direction, permitting antisense alignment. Reads that aligned with equal alignment score to more than one transcriptome were filtered based on a priority rank according to the following order: tRNA, miscRNA, ncRNA, transcript, three_prime_UTR, five_prime_UTR, exon, intron, miRNA, gene, gene_extended2000. For a given read, this rank preserves the annotation information from the top ranked transcripome. For example, a read aligning to the \u2018ncRNA\u2019, \u2018transcript\u2019, and \u2018exon\u2019 transcriptomes would receive ncRNA annotations, and be considered a ncRNA in further analysis. Reads aligning to tRNA and miscRNA groups were removed from further analysis. Reads lacking valid sense alignments to any transcriptome, but that aligned in the antisense orientation were ranked and filtered in the same manner. We note that for some mRNAs, some highly abundant reads emanating from the mRNA locus may potentially be\u00a0expressed from small RNAs (e.g., unannotated snoRNA, tRNA, snRNA) overlapping the mRNA locus. Although the CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell line has the most normal karyotype of the commonly used Drosophila cell lines, the CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0reference genome has not been assembled and slight variation may exist in the positions of some reads due to potential genomic differences between CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells and the sequence fly strain used for the reference genome.ChAR-seq RNA-DNA contact identificationPreviously linked RNA and DNA sequences with sense alignments had their information re-associated using the original read ID. These 1-to-1 links are deemed \u2018RNA-DNA contacts\u2019. Any RNA-DNA contact that contained Ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) were removed from further analysis. Additional processing was then performed to remove mapped DNA contacts that overlapped regions of poor mappabilty using the modEncode Drosophila blacklist (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012) (https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists), repetitive regions downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) using the following selection parameters: clade: Insect, genome: D. melanogaster, assembly: Apr. 2006 (BDGP R5/dm3), group: Variation and Repeats, track: Repeatmasker. Several RNAs that were re-annotated as rRNA in later Drosophila genome annotation versions were also removed.RNA coverage tracksIndividual RNA tracks were generated by extracting contact information from the BED-formatted table generated by FlyPipe (described above). Coverage was calculated using BEDtools for 200 bp windows, and the number of contacts was then normalized by dividing by the number of DpnII sites for each window throughout the genome. Coverage tracks for the metagene profile analysis in Figure 4C were similarly normalized, but were extracted and normalized using a sliding window method with 200 bp bins and 20 bp steps. For the correlation clustering in Figure 4D, we normalized the X chromosome signal to the autosomes by doubling the raw contacts on chrX and chrXHet before DpnII normalization to account for the presence of only a single X chromosome in the CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cell line. Where indicated, coverage tracks were calculated for 2 kb bins, then converted to the log2 ratio of the contacts and DpnII frequency, which was subsequently used to calculate a z-score for each bin based on the whole genome mean and standard deviation for each RNA signal track.Hi-C and TAD analysisHiC libraries (\u2018Hi-C/Mock-ChAR\u2019) were performed as indicated in the methods (blue text indicates branch points in the protocol). Hi-C libraries were sequenced using 2 \u00d7 75 paired end reads and were aligned to blacklisted and repeatmasked genome using the \u2018local\u2019 and \u2018reorder\u2019 flags. The subsequent bam files were used to build the contact matrices using HiCExplorer (https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer/blob/master/docs/index.rst). Matrices were built at 10 kb resolution. Data from GEO:{\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE58821\",\"term_id\":\"58821\"}}GSE58821 were downloaded, re-aligned and processed using HiCExplorer in parallel. Plotting, TAD calling, and matrix correlation were all performed in HiCExplorer. Plots showing RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA contacts were also generated using HiCExplorer, where RNA-DNA matrices were also built at 10 kb resolution.TAD boundary analysisBoundary regions were chosen as the 10 kb on either side around TAD edges (i.e., 20 kb total). TAD midpoints were calculated and rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 kb, and the midpoint region was set as 10 kb to either side of the midpoint. Both boundary and midpoint region edges therefore align with 10 kb bins used for TAD calling. Regions overlapping the modENCODE blacklist or our manually curated blacklist were removed from analysis. ChAR-seq contacts were filtered to remove cis contacts, defined here as the RNA parent gene locus\u00a0\u00b12 kb. Counts of DpnII sites, ATAC-seq insertion sites (5\u2019 end of sequenced fragments, shifted\u00a0+4 bp on the\u00a0+strand and \u22125 bp on the - strand of the reference genome) and ChAR-seq DNA contacts within regions were calculated using the coverage or map commands in bedtools (version 2.20.1). The number of base pairs in each region (midpoint or boundary) masked by our repeat masking blacklist was calculated using bedtools coverage and groupby commands. Subsequent analysis was done with R version 3.3.1. To match the distributions of masked base pairs per region between TAD midpoints and boundaries, 20 kb region masked lengths were divided into bins of 50 bp between 0 and 1000 bp, and 500 bp between 1000 bp and 20000 bp. The boundaries and midpoints were divided into these masked length bins; within each bin, boundaries and midpoints were subsampled to the minimum number of regions for the two region types (e.g., if in a masked length bin there three boundaries and five midpoints, the midpoints will be randomly subsampled to select three midpoints.) The bin matching was verified with a Wilcoxon rank sum test of the total length of repeat masked regions in each region, with an expected non-significant p-value of 0.76. ChAR-seq DNA contact counts for each RNA type within each region were normalized by dividing the number of counts in the region by the number of DpnII sites in the region. roX2 analysis of trans-ChAR contacts at boundary and midpoint regions was only performed for TADs on the X chromosome. All other RNA contact categories were analyzed for all TAD midpoint and boundary regions that fell outside of blacklisted regions.Correlation clustering and metaplotsWe used deepTools (https://github.com/fidelram/deepTools) to calculate the correlation between coverage tracks using the multiBigWigSummary tool excluding the following chromosome regions: chrU, chrUextra, ChrYHet and chrM. Coverage was calculated using 100 kb bins unless indicated. The Pearson correlation coefficients were then clustered and plotted using the either the PlotCorrelation function in deepTools (snRNA clustering) or the heatplot function in R using the ward.D2 method and Euclidian distance function (modENCODE vs ChAR-seq correlation clustering). modENCODE datasets (M-values, wig-formated) for CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0were downloaded from data.modencode.org, and then re-binned into 2 kb windows, and filtered to remove modENCODE blacklist sites and repeat-regions, chrYHet, chrM, chrU and any bins lacking DpnII sites. modENCODE tracks were then transformed into z-scores by dividing the mean shifted (log2 M-values) by the genome-wide standard deviation of the bin depth. Metaplots were generated using the computeMatrix and plotProfile tools with a 2 kb window up and downstream of each region. Signal was then normalized to fold-change relative to mean of the random signal and re-ploted in GraphPad Prism.roX1 and roX2 chromosome X enrichmentThe enrichment of roX RNAs bound to chrX was calculated by obtaining the number of ChAR-seq roX1 or roX2 RNA reads that contact chrX, and comparing this to the expected number on chrX if roX1 or roX2 reads were distributed randomly over total chromosomal sequence space. A one-tailed cumulative binomial distribution test was used to generate each p-value, which is the probability of obtaining the same or greater number of ChAR-seq roX1 or roX2 reads on chrX given a random genomic distribution.ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq correlation analysisChIRP-seq binding profiles for roX1 and roX2 were obtained from published data (GSE53020_roX1_merge.bw, GSE53020_roX2_merge.bw) (Quinn et al., 2014). The Drosophila melanogaster genome (dm3) was divided into equally sized windows for a range of distinct window sizes (50 bp to 1 MB). Read counts per window were obtained using BEDtools. ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq data were filtered identically to remove modENCODE blacklist sites and repeat-regions, chrYHet, chrM, and any bins lacking DpnII sites. roX1 and roX2 origins were excluded due to extreme read pileups in ChIRP-seq data (Chu et al., 2011). Spearman\u2019s rank correlations of read-counts-per-bin across the genome between ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq were performed in R and plots graphed and fitted with Prism.ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq signal-to-noise comparisonSignal-to-noise (SNR) analysis for ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq data was performed similar to the approach in Figure 4B of Quinn et al. (2014), with minor modifications. We treat roX RNA contacts on the autosomes as \u2018noise\u2019, and dense chrX contacts as \u2018signal\u2019. Due to the limited number of reads for individual RNAs and the insufficient resolution afforded by DpnII cut-site locations, we were unable call narrow (<1 kb) peaks for roX1 and roX2 ChAR-seq reads using standard methods (e.g., MACS2). Therefore, to calculate signal, we divided the genome into 2 kb bins and counted the number of roX1 or roX2 RNA-DNA contacts per bin for the 300 chrX bins containing the most contacts. ChAR-seq reads were normalized to DpnII cut sites within each bin. To define noise, we randomly selected 300 equal sized bins from autosomes. The mean RNA-DNA contact count per bin on chrX peaks (\u2018signal\u2019) was divided by the mean RNA-DNA contact count per bin on autosomes (\u2018noise\u2019) to produce the SNR value. To avoid complications due to extreme bin values or repetitive regions, we filtered for chr4, chrM, chrY, chr2Het, chr3Het, chrXHet, chrU, and modEncode blacklist regions (REF:modencode). The roX1 and roX2 loci on chrX were removed due to extreme values for ChIRP-seq data (Chu et al., 2011). For consistency, we re-calculated the SNR for ChIRP-seq roX1 and roX2 data using the above approach and filtering, and obtained values similar to those published in Quinn et al. (2014).ChAR-seq, ChIRP-seq, GRID-seq correlationsChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq roX2 DNA contact signal was processed as in the SNR analysis. GRID-seq RNA and DNA raw reads were download from the NCBI SRA database (accessions: SRX1824449 and SRX1824449) aligned to the genome using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) with the parameter --local, and minimum scoring threshold set to G,1,10. GRID-seq\u00a0S2 cell Replicates 1 and 2 were merged after mapping. Uniquely mapping RNA reads with uniquely mapping DNA mates (samtools flag -q2) were preserved. RNA reads aligning to the roX2 locus were designated as roX2 RNAs, and the associated DNA coordinate as the roX2 DNA-contact. For consistency with the other data sets,\u00a0GRID-seq reads were filtered for repeats and small chromosome scaffolds identically to the ChAR- and ChIRP-seq filtering applied in the SNR analysis. We divided the genome into 2 kb bins and counted the number of roX2 DNA-contacts in each bin, as above for ChAR- and ChIRP-seq. Restriction enzyme density can bias the number of reads within a given bin, so we normalized the raw GRID-seq\u00a0read count by dividing the reads-per-bin by the number of AluI RE sites-per-bin (AluI cut map generated with hicup(version 0.5.2). This signal was then calculated for 20 kb bins across chrX, and Spearman\u2019s rank correlation performed pairwise among the three methods.RNA-seq library preparationFor total RNA-seq analysis, total RNA from 10 to 20 million CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells was purified using TriPure, then treated with 10 units of TURBO DNase (Life Technologies) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was re-purified with TriPure, resuspended in DEPC-treated water, and quality checked by Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Ribosomal RNAs were depleted using the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (Illumina), RNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), then cDNAs were generated, amplified, and indexed with the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Indexed libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer and qPCR, pooled, and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).ATAC-seq library preparationATAC-seq using 250 K-500K CME-W1-cl8+\u00a0cells per reaction was performed with the Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, FC-121\u20131030). The reaction protocol was as previously described (Buenrostro et al., 2013), but without detergent\u00a0or lysis\u00a0incubation steps. Transposition reactions were performed at 37\u00b0C for 30 min shaking at 400 r.p.m. Libraries were purified with the QIAGEN MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and PCR amplified with barcoded primers. Amplification cycle number for each sample was monitored by qPCR to minimize PCR bias. PCR amplified libraries were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit and excess primers removed by AMPure XP bead selection (Beckman Coulter). Final library concentrations were determined by qPCR using custom primers and PhiX sequence (Illumina) as a standard.ATAC-seq data processingSix technical replicates were sequenced with 75 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina Next-seq. Illumina Nextera Adapters were removed using a custom Python script. Reads were aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster genome (dm3) using bowtie2 (version 2.2.5) with the parameter -X 2000. Duplicates were removed with Picard; mitochondrial reads or reads with bowtie2 MAPQ score\u00a0<30 were removed using SAMtools. All replicates had high similarity so their alignment files were merged to increase library complexity before analysis with ChAR-seq data.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Job Dekker (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.Summary:This is an interesting manuscript describing a new approach for mapping RNA-chromatin interactions genome-wide. It has the potential to be a major improvement over existing methods. Three patterns of RNAs linked to chromatin are identified in flies: 1) those of nascent transcript next to their genes, 2) RNAs in trans across all genome, and 3) those on X chromosome for male cells. The method could be an important approach for the study of how RNA modulates the genome and is therefore of interest to many. Several issues related to reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity need to be addressed, as outlined below.Essential revisions:The authors need to address the following main points:1) Compare CharSeq performance in more detail to previously published MARGI and ChIRP-Seq methods: what are the key difference, improvements? Can you quantify this?2) Can you add metrics describing sensitivity and specificity of the method?3) Please clarify concerns about how many times experiments were performed and add details on statistical analysis of reproducibility of data and analyses.4) Can you make the results available in a more user-friendly way, i.e. make the results available as a list of RNAs and loci they associate with.5) Explore RNAs interacting with heterochromatin, rDNA etc. These are repetitive DNA sequences, but a meta-analysis of RNAs associating with defined repeats is of considerable interest and would enhance the paper.Reviewer #1:\nThis is an interesting manuscript describing a new approach for mapping RNA-chromatin interactions genome-wide. It has the potential to be a major improvement over existing methods. I missed a more deep quantification of background, sensitivity and signal to noise ratios and how these relate to expression levels.Reviewer #2:\nThe manuscript by Bell et al., presents a sequencing method to map all RNA-chromatin/DNA contacts in a genome: Chromatin-Associated RNA sequencing (ChAR-seq) a proximity ligation and sequencing method. The approach is utilized mainly to examine what RNAs are interacting with chromatin in Drosophila melanogaster CME-Wl-cl8+ (male) wing disc cells. Some work is also done using female Kc167 cells. Three patterns of RNAs linked to chromatin are identified: 1) those of nascent transcript next to their genes, 2) RNAs in trans across all genome, and 3) those on X chromosome for its inactivation. This last group, as expected, does not show up in the female cell line. The data obtained via ChAR-seq are in agreement with those obtained by Quinn et al., 2014 using ChIRP-seq. The ChAR-seq appears as a more sensitive method because it captures all RNA-DNA contacts. Authors also use their data to provide novel insights about the function of the various RNAs that they found to have abundant association with chromatin. The application of ChRA-seq in this study have revealed many snoRNA molecules interacting with chromatin in the heterochromatin form.1) Overall, the authors show that ChRA-seq works well to identify both RNAs that are nascent and thus still connected with DNA in cis, and RNAs that do not directly interact with DNA, but rather with chromatin factors in trans. The ChRA-seq approach is validated with the RNAs that are known to be functioning in chr. X dosage compensation, in fact these RNAs (roX1 and roX2) are found to bind chr. X chromatin in the Drosophila male cells but not in the female cells. In addition to the similarity of the ChRA-seq approach to the ChIRP-seq by Quinn et al., Nat Biotech 2014, which although is limited to RNA-chromatin interactions, as pointed out by the Authors, ChRA-seq is almost identical to the method used in Sridhar et al., 2017in vivo. Thus, the novelty of the study by Bell et al. is in part reduced because of this recent publication, which exploits a very similar ligation method to capture sites of RNA interaction with chromatin and DNA.Other points:2) What is described in the first paragraph of Results does not match perfectly with Figure 1A, because the RT step in the figure is shown after the bridge is ligated to DNA, while in the text it is described before the bridge is ligated to DNA. The text should match the figure description.3) It would be good to add the polarity of the RNA molecule in red in the Figure 1A. It would be good also to explain that the approach captures the 3' RNA ends of RNA molecules. Also Figure 1A should be bigger to clearly show which RNA end is ligated to the bridge, to clearly indicate the polarity of ends and the structure at the junction. If the App has a free 3' end, and this is ligated to 3' end RNA, is this a 3'-3' ligation? Or is the App removed in the ligation process? This should be explained well because it is not evident.4) The statement \"the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) enables increased ligation specificity for 3'-terminated ssRNA\" is not clear: 'increased specificity' relative to what?5) Is the sequence of RNA and DNA oligos presented in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 provided? It is not clear what the molar excess of DNA over RNA is, please clarify. Also the legend of this figure should explain what is shown in every lane. In lane 1 there is a high mw band, what is this, what is its size? The ladder sizes are provided only for the bottom part of the gel, they should be provided also for the top part, considering that there is a high mw band. How many times was this experiment repeated? Is there any statistical analysis of these data? This, possibly, should be explained in the legend.6) The statement: \"This RNase-treatment dramatically reduced in the number of bridge molecules identified, demonstrating that bridge ligation is indeed RNA-dependent (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5)\" is not strongly supported by the data shown in this figure. In addition to a typo in this statement, looking at the figure, there seems to be a factor of six reduction, which does not represent a 'dramatic' reduction. Importantly, there appears to be no repeats of this experiment and no statistical analysis of the data. Was this experiment reproducible, are there repeats that can be shown?7) Legend to Figure 1E has a typo: \"Zoomed in region of shown\".8) Typo in Results: \"we performed RNA-seq to for\".9) The correlation between expression level of the RNA and FPKM contacts is not very clear, because in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2 this does not seem to be the case.Reviewer #3:\nThis manuscript presents a very important new technique (CHAR-seq) developed to identify chromatin-associated RNAs. The major benefit of this method in contrast to previously used techniques is the use of proximity dependent ligation to generate sequences from ssRNAs linked to nearby DNA, which allows relatively unbiased assessments of associations across much of the genome. The authors demonstrate very nicely that application of ChAR-seq to Drosophila cultured cells identifies a spectrum of chromatin-associated RNAs, including chromosome-specific, nascent mRNAs, and sn/sno RNAs. The utility and novelty of ChAR-seq makes it completely appropriate for publication in eLife; I am very enthusiastic about acceptance once some issues about the presentation and analyses are addressed / clarified.1) Data completeness and transparency:To provide a more complete resource for the community, all potentially interesting RNAs should be named/identified in a table, including those that were initially included but didn't match criteria for 'chromatin associated'.a) There should be a table listing the 1797 RNAs (Figure 2D), and relevant information, such as% and numbers of cis and trans contacts, RNA expression level, RNA-DNA contacts, and a way to access information about their genomic distributions, etc. \u2013 essentially anything that may be of use to scientists interested in whether or not their favorite RNA is present, or in performing their own analyses of the data.b) I assume Figure 2E shows all 1797 as 'included', but the 'chromatin associated' RNAs in Figure 2E should be listed in a table. My impression is that some (73) but not all are listed in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 \u2013 are these the red dots in 2E? Even if all red dots are listed in the supplement, readers should be able to access identity and other data for all 1797, and especially the grey dots that are RNA-DNA contact outliers with high expression (I suspect that normalization to expression levels eliminates interesting candidates, see statistics discussion below). Similarly, there appear to be RNAs with low expression that may be chromatin enriched, yet are not highlighted in red.2) Genomics, Analysis and Statistics:a) Figure 1D, 2A and elsewhere. I could not find a description of what the black circles and darker grey areas on the chromosome graphics indicate. I assume black=centromere, but the rest is unclear.b) Why was release 5 used, given that the more complete release 6 has been available for at least a year? In addition, genomes from the cell lines used have not been assembled, and are likely rearranged (plus other variation, including DNA copy number) relative to the reference sequence, so the positions shown in the figures are likely to be incorrect, though we don't know where. No, the authors do not need to assemble the clone8 or Kc genomes, but they should acknowledge this issue.c) It is unclear what parts of the genome assembly were included, for example were heterochromatic regions included, and if so where is that data presented? This information would help with the interpretations, especially in Figure 4D.d) A related point, for Figure 4D it would be helpful to report the genomic locations (middle of euchromatin? Pericentromeric? X vs. autosomes?) for RNAs whose chromatin contacts show strong correlation with specific chromatin marks. Also, please explain how the correlation signals were aggregated in Figure 4D \u2013 the methods described using 2kb bins while the figure showing 100kb bins.e) Can the authors discuss how the use of PCR to amplify ligated RNA/DNA contacts, combined with normalization to expression levels, could exclude RNAs with lower transcription levels, even if they have many (potentially important) DNA contacts? I think they are being appropriately conservative, but as with all such screens, and to help others who will certainly try it themselves, it would be good to have a brief discussion about the tradeoffs.f) Some of the statements need quantitative support, such as:- Figure 2E \u2013 what is the threshold for identifying RNAs with more than expected chromatin interaction (how was the expectation calculated?- How were p-values for rox1 and rox2 (7.6 fold and 8.1 fold enrichment) calculated?- Figure 3E: correlation between the DNA contact locations from ChIRP and ChAR- seq \u2013.is this simply the Pearson correlation coefficient?- Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1: how was the base sequence similarity calculated and used to aggregate signals for different snRNAs?g) Using the correlations between ChIRP and ChAR-seq to assess the resolution of ChAR-seq does not seem to be appropriate, since the preparation of sequencing libraries may be very different between these two datasets. (Also, the curve actually goes down as window size increases?!) The authors should provide more reasoning for this approach.How were the replicates analyzed?.Were they merged? What are the correlations between replicates?h) How was the z-score was calculated? It seems like it is calculated as comparing between the values in each bin vs. the rest of the genome. If this is the case, there may be no need to calculate a z-score as every window will have the same denominator, and it may be just as informative as using the read counts. Also, it may be informative to use the chromosome-specific mean (instead of whole genome mean) to further identify interesting local events (the current analysis may be mainly identifying between chromosome differences). Essential revisions:The authors need to address the following main points:1) Compare CharSeq performance in more detail to previously published MARGI and ChIRP-Seq methods: what are the key difference, improvements? Can you quantify this?We have now quantitatively compared our data to ChIRP-seq and MARGI with new analysis in the main text and figures. We have also included a comparison to another recently published method called GRID-seq (described below).Comparison to ChIRP-seq:ChAR-seq produces multiplexed RNA-chromatin contact data for every RNA in the cell without any requirement for the identity of the RNA, whereas ChIRP-seq requires production of oligos against a single target RNA of known sequence. They are complementary technologies, in that ChAR-seq is suited for discovery of interactions and interaction patterns in an unbiased assay, while ChIRP-seq provides targeted, higher-coverage data to explore the contact profiles of RNAs that have already been identified as interesting targets.To address this point, we added a signal-to-noise calculation between ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq for both roX1 and roX2 (Figure 3F). Briefly (see subsection \u201cChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq signal-to-noise comparison\u201d), we used the same signal-to-noise (SNR) metric employed by Howard Chang\u2019s Lab in a related ChIRP-seq paper (Quinn et al., 2014). This metric considers the chrX bins or peaks with the most roX RNA binding events to be \u2018signal\u2019 and treats roX RNA binding in randomly chosen autosomal bins to be \u2018noise\u2019. To quantitatively compare these two very different methods (genome-wide vs single-RNA), we were careful to re-analyze published ChIRP-seq signal from the original paper (Chu et al., 2011) with identical filtering and random bin selection. This resulted in higher SNR values for ChAR-seq than ChIRP-seq (roX1: 49.8 to 3.9, roX2: 45.2 to 22.0), despite having ~100-fold fewer roX reads per data set. We believe this quantitative analysis demonstrates the high sensitivity of our genome-wide method, in addition to validating it as identifying specifically bound RNAs.In addition, we previously included several direct comparisons between ChIRP- and ChAR-seq, including genome-wide correlation plot for roX1 and roX2 across different bin sizes ranging over 5 orders of magnitude (Figure 3G) that revealed strong correlation over appropriate bin sizes (Spearman rho = 0.7-0.85). We also display roX1 and roX2 RNA binding signal across a 250kb region of chrX for both methods (Figure 3E).Comparison to MARGI:MARGI and ChAR-seq both ligate a 5-App oligonucleotide \u2018bridge\u2019 or \u2018linker\u2019 to the 3\u2019-end of RNA. In MARGI, the linker molecule is then ligated to either restriction digested genomic DNA or sonicated DNA. Beyond this, the methods differ greatly. In MARGI, the proximal RNA and DNA are attached via circularization, and the linker molecule is cut with a restriction enzyme to form templates for sequencing primers at the end of the molecule. We list the two primary advantages of our method over MARGI in the main text discussion: first, ChAR-seq is performed in situ in intact nuclei, whereas the MARGI proximity ligations are performed on beads. As with Hi-C, it is expected that in vitro based proximity ligation will have more spurious ligation events than those from intact nuclei. Second, in ChAR-seq the final RNA-bridge-DNA molecule is sequenced with long single-end reads, which preserves the original ligation junctions and allows us to detect multiple bridges and other aberrant ligation events.For many types of analyses, we cannot compare ChAR-seq directly to MARGI because MARGI analyzed mammalian cells, whereas we analyzed Drosophila cells. However, we did quantify signal-to-noise in MARGI by calculating the fold-enrichment of Xist on the X-chr as compared to autosomes:We used MARGI data from HEK293 cells, which contain two stable Barr bodies (Gilbert et al., 2000) and thus avoid uncertainties about incomplete X inactivation associated with stem cells. Because pxMARGI (proximal) data had insufficient association reads (only counting distal and inter-chromosomal contacts), we analyzed distal RNA (diMARGI) contacts on chr X vs. autosomes. We assumed that autosomal bound Xist constitutes noise because FISH in HEK293 cells does not show widespread localization of Xist RNA (Chow et al., 2007). Because the data were also too sparse to call high-confidence X association peaks within the X chromosome, we divided the genome into 1 Mb bins, keeping only bins that (a) contained at least 1 diMARGI Xist read, (b) did not contain any ENCODE blacklisted regions, and (c) were the full 1 Mb length. The X chromosome and autosomes contain similar fractions of bins with zero Xist reads: 31% and 26%, respectively. To account for chromatin accessibility or HaeIII site bias, autosomal bins were chosen to have similar accessibility (measured by ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP) and similar HaeIII site density to the chosen bins on the X chromosome.Open in a separate windowAuthor response image 1.Control bins on autosomes were chosen to match bins on the X chromosome in terms of HaeIII restriction sites and accessible chromatin, here measured using the proxy of H3K27ac data because direct measurements of accessibility such as ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data were not publicly available for HEK293 cells.Xist diMARGI contact counts in these matched bins are remarkably similar across autosomes and the X chromosome, indicating a signal to noise ratio of ~1. The ratio of the medians is 1 (2 counts per 1 Mb bin). The ratio of the means is 3.4 (X:autosome) which is largely due to a single outlier bin on the X chromosome with a count of 555, as opposed to the maximum count of 13 counts in sampled autosomal bins. This X chromosome bin contains the Xist locus and although proximal diMARGI contacts are excluded, the area around the Xist gene nevertheless contains a high density of contacts. This is not surprising, but the dramatic drop in Xist contact density from the locus of transcription to other sites on the X chromosome is not in agreement with FISH data which show Xist coating the entire Barr bodies (Chow et al., 2007). We conclude that, by this metric, the signal-to-noise in MARGI is low, and ChAR-seq may have distinct advantages as an approach to determine genome-wide RNA-DNA contacts (see Discussion).We have attached the MARGI signal-to-noise figures for reviewers, but decided not to put this analysis in the text because we did not directly analyze mammalian data.Open in a separate windowAuthor response image 2.diMARGI signal to noise estimate via X vs. autosome comparison in HEK293 cells.Plots of log2(diMARGI counts per megabase) for bins spanning the X chromosome and random, accessibility- and restriction site-matched bins on autosomes (left: box pot, right: scatter plot of same data).Comparison to GRID-seq:While this paper was in revision, another genome-wide RNA-DNA method was published (\u201cGRID-seq\u201d; Li et al., 2017) that uses a methodology similar to ChAR-seq. While many details differ, GRID-seq also involves proximity ligation of a directional bridge to RNA and DNA to construct an RNA-DNA contact map. One key difference is that GRID-seq uses the restriction enzyme MMeI to cut the cDNA and gDNA fragments distal to the linker/bridge, which produces identically sized fragments. This has the advantage over ChAR-seq of being able to size select and sequence only molecules with RNA and DNA information. A critical disadvantage, however, is that reads are 19-23bp, which have a greater chance of falsely mapping to the wrong place in the genome than the 20-100bp RNA and DNA fragments obtained via ChAR-seq. We now mention the above difference in the Discussion.The available GRID-seq data (from NCBI GEO:{\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE82312\",\"term_id\":\"82312\"}}GSE82312) is heavily processed and some contacts were removed via a background model subtraction. We attempted to perform a signal-to-noise analysis after aligning the raw reads from NCBI SRA and filtering repeats but were unable to determine an appropriate SNR metric as with ChIRP-seq. This is because GRID-seq has lower sequencing depth for roX2 reads, and therefore the vast majority of genomic bins on the autosomes have zero reads, precluding the proper calculation. However, we analyzed the correlation of signal density between GRID and ChAR, GRID and ChIRP, or ChAR and ChIRP for roX2 reads over 20kb chrX bins. GRID and ChAR-seq match well with ChIRP (GRID-ChIRP = 0.84, ChAR-ChIRP = 0.80) and with each other (GRID-ChAR = 0.79), suggesting that \u2013 at a coarse level \u2013 ChAR-seq and GRID-seq have similar ability to detect true RNA-DNA contacts. This analysis is now in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1, along with signal tracks along a 2Mb region of the genome.False RNA-DNA contact% calculation, and comparison to MARGI and GRID-seq:In addition to the above comparisons, we spiked in exogenous RNA species (GFP, HALO tag, and MBP) at varying levels relative to total RNA and identified their DNA contacts. This provides us with a measure of false positive contacts, which was always equal to or less than 0.5% in the condition where we spike in a contaminant up to 10% of the total RNA by mass (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6). This value compares favorably to the false positive values published by MARGI (~2.2%) and GRID-seq (human cells: 3.3%, fly S2 cells: 6.9%, mESCs: 4.7%), with the caveat that a cross-species analysis was used instead of exogenous RNAs.2) Can you add metrics describing sensitivity and specificity of the method?As mentioned above, we have performed a spike-in experiment to address this question about specificity where we added exogenous RNA to our lysed cells in order to mimic the RNA that might be released during our fragmentation step, and which could theoretically cross-ligate to distant sites owing to non-specific binding. In this experiment, we isolated the total soluble RNA after lysis and fragmentation, added back a percentage of spike in RNA by mass at 0.1, 1 and 10%, and then proceeded with our library prep and quantified the number of false positives by alignment to the reference sequences used to generate the in vitro transcribed RNAs. Even in the condition where 10% of the total RNA was a spiked in contaminant, our false positive rate was less than 0.5%, indicating that the subsequent washes and steps after fragmentation but before ligation are sufficient to efficiently remove the contaminating RNA.We have added signal-to-noise metrics and false-positive estimates, as described above, to the text. These reveal that ChAR-seq can detect RNAs with both high sensitivity (e.g., roX1 and roX2) and high specificity (e.g., roX1 and roX2 enrichment on chrX, and low percentage of DNA contacts by exogenous spike-in RNAs). In addition, we showed that roX1 and roX2 bind near previously identified dosage compensation peaks from ChIRP-seq data.Other evidence for high sensitivity and specificity are presented in the following figures:- Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4: 80% of ligation reads are specific to RNA.- Figure 2E: A large subset of RNAs, including roX1 and roX2, are found enriched on chromatin after controlling for expression levels (off-diagonal RNAs in red on plot).- Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2, and Figure 4C, D: When comparing female Kc167 cells to male CME-W1-cl8+ cells, roX1 and roX2 are clearly found enriched in male cells, as expected.- Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1: roX enrichment on chrX.3) Please clarify concerns about how many times experiments were performed and add details on statistical analysis of reproducibility of data and analyses.We have now explicitly stated the number of biological and technical replicates used. Critical information relevant to each ChAR-Seq library is now presented in Supplementary file 1. For the primary data set, 4 biological replicates were performed and sequenced, along with one technical replicate sequenced at much higher depth. Additional datasets generated during revision provide three new technical replicates.We also have added several graphs that show reproducibility of independent replicates, including a comparison between ChAR-seq replicates with respect to number of RNA-DNA contacts (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5), reproducibility of chromatin enriched RNAs across 3 different replicates, at 2 different expression levels (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2), and reproducibility across different cell lines (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2).Finnaly, we have included all details for statistical analysis in the main text, figure legends, or Materials and methods. These include the statistical tests, p-value, null hypothesis (where appropriate), as well as a text description of how the data inputs were generated or processed.4) Can you make the results available in a more user-friendly way, i.e. make the results available as a list of RNAs and loci they associate with.We have now deposited a user-friendly file into NCBI GEO (accession {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE97131\",\"term_id\":\"97131\"}}GSE97131) that contains all RNA-DNA contacts in BED format (RNA-chr, start, stop; and DNA-chr, start, stop). This file contains 39 additional columns with information regarding:- RNA transcript details (length, genome coordinates, transcript coordinates, flybase ID, transcription start site, etc.).- DNA contact details.- RNA alignment info (mapping quality, read length, read start position, CIGAR string, etc.).- DNA alignment information.This text file can be easily manipulated using bedtools or shell commands to extract answers to various questions related to the dataset as a whole (what are the 100 RNAs with the most DNA contacts?) or to specific RNA or DNA locations (where does my favorite RNA bind in the genome?). We expect such a file to be valuable to biologists with or without genomics analysis experience.In addition, we now include a supplementary table (Supplementary file 2) that lists 8822 unique RNAs, as well as: their total number of DNA contacts, RNA length, common name, Flybase ID, RNA-seq expression level, normalized RNA-DNA contact number, and chromatin enrichment (over expression level).Finally, we will provide the code for our of analysis pipeline (from raw reads to the above user-friendly file) in a publicly accessible format for download on Gitlab (https://gitlab.com/charseq/flypipe).5) Explore RNAs interacting with heterochromatin, rDNA etc. These are repetitive DNA sequences, but a meta-analysis of RNAs associating with defined repeats is of considerable interest and would enhance the paper.We agree that an analysis of heterochromatin and repeats would be of great interest, and a great use of the ChAR-seq method. We attempted to analyze which RNAs were bound to repetitive DNA sequences, but found that it was difficult to make any conclusions about data since: 1) much of the repetitive portion of the Drosophila genome is incomplete, including some centromeric sequence; 2) given 1, the sequence space covered by a given short repeat element is unknown, making it difficult to make any meaningful conclusion regarding DNA abundance after alignment to these RNAs; 3) repeats are not easily mapped, or mapped to, with current alignment tools. For example, we removed all non-uniquely mapping reads here, but would need to set different multi-mapping threshold parameters for different repeat classes. We also attempted to analyze where RNAs that emanate from DNA repeats (such as transposons) bind; specifically, do RNAs expressed by DNA repeats bind nearby, or to other repetitive DNA loci at a greater frequency? However, this analysis was also inconclusive, primarily due to the multi-mapping issue described above.My laboratory has a strong interest in repeat regions of the genome from our studies of vertebrate centromeres Thus, we are particularly interested in pursuing this analysis in human cells where high quality models for centromere repeats have been generated by Karen Miga, Jim Kent, David Haussler and Hunt Willard and long-read sequence information has enabled the first complete assembly of the human Y centromere. However, we feel that these experiments are outside the scope of this current manuscript.Reviewer #2:[\u2026] 1) Overall, the authors show that ChRA-seq works well to identify both RNAs that are nascent and thus still connected with DNA in cis, and RNAs that do not directly interact with DNA, but rather with chromatin factors in trans. The ChRA-seq approach is validated with the RNAs that are known to be functioning in chr. X dosage compensation, in fact these RNAs (roX1 and roX2) are found to bind chr.

In addition to the similarity of the ChRA-seq approach to the ChIRP-seq by Quinn et al., Nat Biotech 2014, which although is limited to RNA-chromatin interactions, as pointed out by the Authors, ChRA-seq is almost identical to the method used in Sridhar et al., 2017. Thus, the novelty of the study by Bell et al. is in part reduced because of this recent publication, which exploits a very similar ligation method to capture sites of RNA interaction with chromatin and DNA.Other points:2) What is described in the first paragraph of Results does not match perfectly with Figure 1A, because the RT step in the figure is shown after the bridge is ligated to DNA, while in the text it is described before the bridge is ligated to DNA. The text should match the figure description.We thank the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy in the figure. Figure 1A has been changed to reflect the protocol as described in the text.3) It would be good to add the polarity of the RNA molecule in red in the Figure 1A. It would be good also to explain that the approach captures the 3' RNA ends of RNA molecules. Also Figure 1A should be bigger to clearly show which RNA end is ligated to the bridge, to clearly indicate the polarity of ends and the structure at the junction. If the App has a free 3' end, and this is ligated to 3' end RNA, is this a 3'-3' ligation? Or is the App removed in the ligation process? This should be explained well because it is not evident.We have added a polarity indicator arrow to the illustration in Figure 1B, showing how the first-strand cDNA sequence (representing the RNA) is always 5\u2019 of the adaptor sequence top strand (which does not contain the biotin modification) and the DNA sequence is always 3\u2019 of the adaptor sequence top strand.4) The statement \"the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) enables increased ligation specificity for 3'-terminated ssRNA\" is not clear: 'increased specificity' relative to what?We have clarified the language in the manuscript to indicate that the ligation is performed without free ATP, making 5\u2019 adenylation a requirement for ligating the 5\u2019 ends. This adenylation and ligation scheme ensures that only bridge 5\u2019 ends are ligated to RNA, preventing non-specific ligation between non-adenylated RNA 5\u2019 ends and RNA 3\u2019 ends.5) Is the sequence of RNA and DNA oligos presented in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 provided? It is not clear what the molar excess of DNA over RNA is, please clarify. Also the legend of this figure should explain what is shown in every lane. In lane 1 there is a high mw band, what is this, what is its size? The ladder sizes are provided only for the bottom part of the gel, they should be provided also for the top part, considering that there is a high mw band. How many times was this experiment repeated? Is there any statistical analysis of these data? This, possibly, should be explained in the legend.We added the missing label to Lane 3 to indicate that it represents the reaction using R55K K227Q mutant T4 Rnl2tr ligase and added additional labels for the ladder used (a combination of NEB microRNA and low range ssRNA ladders). The high molecular weight band is most likely long concatemers of the ssDNA substrate created by the Thermostable 5\u2019App DNA/RNA ligase. It is possible that this enzyme is able to remove the 3\u2019 block from the ssDNA oligo used in this optimization experiment, or that the block was incomplete. This enzyme is known to have higher activity in ssDNA-ssDNA ligation than the other two. We have modified the figure legend to reflect this explanation and to provide more detailed information on the enzymes used. We only use these results to make a qualitative judgment about which enzyme performed best. Because the conclusion of the experiment would not be altered by further quantification, we proceeded with the approach based on this qualitative assessment. We have also updated the legend to state that the experiment was performed once.The DNA sequence used in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 is the universal miRNA cloning linker: CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT and the RNA sequence was that of the CENP-B box: TTTCGTTGGAAGCGGGA. These details have been added to the Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 legend.6) The statement: \"This RNase-treatment dramatically reduced in the number of bridge molecules identified, demonstrating that bridge ligation is indeed RNA-dependent (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5)\" is not strongly supported by the data shown in this figure. In addition to a typo in this statement, looking at the figure, there seems to be a factor of six reduction, which does not represent a 'dramatic' reduction. Importantly, there appears to be no repeats of this experiment and no statistical analysis of the data. Was this experiment reproducible, are there repeats that can be shown?We have changed the manuscript text to be more specific, indicating the fold-reduction in bridge ligation events. The experiment was performed once for this control. In response to reviewer 1, question 3, we discuss why an RNase treatment could still result in the low presence of bridge-containing sequences.7) Legend to Figure 1E has a typo: \"Zoomed in region of shown\".The figure legend has been updated to fix this typo.8) Typo in Results: \"we performed RNA-seq to for\".Thank you for pointing it out. This typo has been corrected in the manuscript.9) The correlation between expression level of the RNA and FPKM contacts is not very clear, because in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2 this does not seem to be the case.The correlation the reviewer describes can be observed in Figure 2E, in which we plot the total RNA expression (measured by RNA-seq) vs. RNA-to-DNA contacts (measured by ChAR-seq). For most RNAs, there is a strong correlation between expression level and ChAR-seq contacts observed. The red dots represent RNAs that are enriched by at least 10-fold in the ChAR-seq dataset over the average level of contacts for a given expression level. This correlation is already normalized in the bar plot on the right side of Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 and the quantity being displayed is fold-enrichment of ChAR-seq contacts over the expected contacts for a given expression level. The left bar plot is the raw expression level. What this figure illustrates is that the level of chromatin enrichment for a given RNA is not correlated with the total number of contacts we observe \u2013 enrichment is not merely a property of being above some limit of detection, it is a property of the RNA itself.Reviewer #3:[\u2026] 1) Data completeness and transparency:To provide a more complete resource for the community, all potentially interesting RNAs should be named/identified in a table, including those that were initially included but didn't match criteria for 'chromatin associated'.a) There should be a table listing the 1797 RNAs (Figure 2D), and relevant information, such as% and numbers of cis and trans contacts, RNA expression level, RNA-DNA contacts, and a way to access information about their genomic distributions, etc. \u2013 essentially anything that may be of use to scientists interested in whether or not their favorite RNA is present, or in performing their own analyses of the data.We agree that the 1797 (now 1952 after additional sequencing and analysis see revised Figure 2D) most abundant transcripts are of interest. We have now generated a 39 column \u2018masterfile\u2019 that contains all RNA-DNA contacts and related information, as described in our response to the editor\u2019s Essential revisions. These data are publicly available on NCBI GEO ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE97131\",\"term_id\":\"97131\"}}GSE97131), In addition, we provide Supplementary file 1 that includes the top 8822 unique RNAs, their RNA-DNA contact number (CPKM), RNA expression level, and chromatin enrichment values, which allows any scientist to search for a particular RNA of interest.b) I assume Figure 2E shows all 1797 as 'included', but the 'chromatin associated' RNAs in Figure 2E should be listed in a table. My impression is that some (73) but not all are listed in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 \u2013 are these the red dots in 2E? Even if all red dots are listed in the supplement, readers should be able to access identity and other data for all 1797, and especially the grey dots that are RNA-DNA contact outliers with high expression (I suspect that normalization to expression levels eliminates interesting candidates, see statistics discussion below). Similarly, there appear to be RNAs with low expression that may be chromatin enriched, yet are not highlighted in red.The red dots in revised Figure 2E are the 138 RNAs with contacts enriched 10-fold over the expression levels, and that have more than 100 CPKM (DNA contacts). As stated above, the most abundant RNAs can be extracted from Table 1, along with all RNAs above any desired fold enrichment threshold.2) Genomics, Analysis and Statistics:a) Figure 1D, 2A and elsewhere. I could not find a description of what the black circles and darker grey areas on the chromosome graphics indicate. I assume black=centromere, but the rest is unclear.We have clarified these graphics in the figure legends. The cartoon chromosomes depicted in Figure 1D, 2A, 3C, and 3D are scaled visual representations of the chromosomes. The black circles are the centromeres, the light gray regions are the primary chromosome scaffolds, and the dark gray regions are the heterochromatic scaffolds.b) Why was release 5 used, given that the more complete release 6 has been available for at least a year?Release 5 (dm3) was used for several reasons. First and foremost, the ChIRP-seq roX1 and roX2 datasets that we used to for validation and the modENCODE data that we used for deeper analysis were all generated with the dm3 build. Many available datasets in NCBI-GEO lack either the raw read files (e.g., fastq) or lack the necessary analysis pipelines to proceed from raw reads to the available processed genome coverage files. For the processed files that are not at single bp resolution, it would be difficult to convert genome coordinates from release 5 to release 6.Second, while major improvements on dm6 over release 5 exist in the heterochromatic scaffolds, the rest of the genome has only minor changes in dm6 compared to dm5 (http://flybase.org/static_pages/feature/previous/articles/2014_07/FB2014_04.html). Finally, coordinate conversion is generally easier going from an older build to a newer one, so for the small number of affected regions or genes, researchers for whom this is necessary can use readily available conversion tools to re-map the ChAR-seq dataset, provided in NCBI GEO.In addition, genomes from the cell lines used have not been assembled, and are likely rearranged (plus other variation, including DNA copy number) relative to the reference sequence, so the positions shown in the figures are likely to be incorrect, though we don't know where. No, the authors do not need to assemble the clone8 or Kc genomes, but they should acknowledge this issue.We agree that the genome assemblies are lacking for some of these cell lines and have added a sentence to the Materials and methods section to indicate that there may exist variation in the positions of some datasets due to genomic differences between cell lines. We took great care in selecting a suitable cell line for a genome wide RNA-DNA mapping method: The clone 8 cell line (CME-W1-cl8+) used for the majority of the data collection in this work has a normal and stable karyotype, and is male so we could analyze the roX genes for validation. In a recent study, 19 Drosophila cell lines had their DNA sequenced to determine ploidy across the genome (Lee et al., 2014). Of all 19 commonly used cell lines, the CME-W1-cl8+ line had, by far, the most optimum ploidy across the genome, which was very close to 1X throughout, whereas the commonly used S2 lines were largely 4X with variable regions up to 8X ploidy. The CME-W1-cl8+ line is also one of the modENCODE lines and maintained by the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center.c) It is unclear what parts of the genome assembly were included, for example were heterochromatic regions included, and if so where is that data presented? This information would help with the interpretations, especially in Figure 4D.We have now included which regions of the genome are included in each figure legend or extended Materials and methods, including Figure 4D. For the majority of analyses, chr2Het, chr3Het, and chrXHet were included, with exceptions noted in the figure legends or Materials and methods.d) A related point, for Figure 4D it would be helpful to report the genomic locations (middle of euchromatin? Pericentromeric? X vs. autosomes?) for RNAs whose chromatin contacts show strong correlation with specific chromatin marks. Also, please explain how the correlation signals were aggregated in Figure 4D \u2013 the methods described using 2kb bins while the figure showing 100kb bins.The whole reference genome was used, including the heterochromatin scaffolds; however, we filtered the regions of the build determined to have high frequency mapping artifacts (i.e., the so-called blacklisted regions) and repeats, which also produce mapping artifacts. The cluster analysis in Figure 4D is genome-wide, excluding only the chrU and chrUhet scaffolds, because those are of low quality and do not represent a real biological chromosome. The DpnII normalization (i.e., z-score calculation) of ChAR-seq tracks was performed using 2-kb windows, while the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated pairwise between each ChAR-seq track (i.e., columns in the clustergram) and each modENCODE track (i.e., rows). The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using 100 kb bins because we sought to use a window size slightly larger than our estimated resolution.e) Can the authors discuss how the use of PCR to amplify ligated RNA/DNA contacts, combined with normalization to expression levels, could exclude RNAs with lower transcription levels, even if they have many (potentially important) DNA contacts? I think they are being appropriately conservative, but as with all such screens, and to help others who will certainly try it themselves, it would be good to have a brief discussion about the tradeoffs.It is true that using PCR to amplify our molecules during the library prep could introduce biases. However, we minimized the number of PCR cycles performed by using a side PCR to estimate the minimum number of cycles required to reach a stable exponential phase. We note that by normalizing to expression levels, RNAs with lower transcription levels but many DNA contacts may actually be more likely to be called as \u201cchromatin-bound\u201d after our enrichment calculations. Although our current dataset may have missed some RNAs expressed at very low levels, sequencing at greater depth with sufficient library complexity can mitigate this issue, as it does with RNA-seq.f) Some of the statements need quantitative support, such as:- Figure 2E: what is the threshold for identifying RNAs with more than expected chromatin interaction (how was the expectation calculated?We used two cut-offs to call RNAs chromatin enriched. First, we excluded all RNAs with fewer than 10 DNA contacts based on the cumulative frequency distribution curve as well as the fact that 10 or fewer contacts is insufficient information to make biological conclusions about each RNA. Second, we required a 10-fold enrichment of ChAR-seq contacts over expression level (FPCM). We also required more than 100 ChAR-seq contacts, which we empirically found to be a rough minimum for which to explore various properties of the RNA-DNA contact (e.g., cis/trans% , broad chromosome distribution, etc.).- How were p-values for rox1 and rox2 (7.6 fold and 8.1 fold enrichment) calculated?This enrichment was calculated using a one-tailed cumulative binomial test. A full description of this calculation is included in the Materials and methods.- Figure 3E: correlation between the DNA contact locations from ChIRP and ChAR- seq \u2013 is this simply the Pearson correlation coefficient?This is Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, and this is now noted in the Materials and methods and new Figure 3 legend.- Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1: how was the base sequence similarity calculated and used to aggregate signals for different snRNAs?This is described in the Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 legend. In short, we used GeniousR7 to calculate a pairwise distance score, then clustered the data using R.g) Using the correlations between ChIRP and ChAR-seq to assess the resolution of ChAR-seq does not seem to be appropriate, since the preparation of sequencing libraries may be very different between these two datasets. (Also, the curve actually goes down as window size increases?!) The authors should provide more reasoning for this approach.ChIRP, RAP, and CHART are all well established RNA hybridization and chromatin pull down methods designed to map individual chromatin associated RNAs. ChIRP, in particular, has been applied in the CME-W1-cl8+ cell line, which is why we used this specific dataset to estimate our resolution. ChIRP data have a resolution of ~1-5kb, which provides a useful lower bound, and ChIRP peaks match well with 0.5-1kb ChIP-seq peaks for the dosage compensation complex protein MSL3. The reviewer is correct that the library preparation is very different, but this is advantageous for benchmarking our method: ChIRP was established as a method for mapping chromatin interaction patterns of single RNAs, and therefore comparing the performance of the highly multiplexed ChAR-seq protocol against ChIRP-seq by selecting the same target RNA from both data sets is the most direct comparison we can make.For both roX1 and roX2, the correlation curve increases, then plateaus. The small dip in correlation between a 250 kb bin size and a 1 Mb bin size after the plateau is likely due to the bin size being so large that differences in filtering, blacklisting, etc. between ChIRP and ChAR-seq data may cause different edge effects at ends of chromosomes or in large domains flanked by repetitive regions or heterochromatin.How were the replicates analyzed? Were they merged? What are the correlations between replicates?The replicates show excellent reproducibility and are now presented in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5. The replicates were merged for most of the analysis, as described in the Materials and methods and the statistics included in new Supplementary file 1.h) How was the z-score was calculated? It seems like it is calculated as comparing between the values in each bin vs. the rest of the genome. If this is the case, there may be no need to calculate a z-score as every window will have the same denominator, and it may be just as informative as using the read counts. Also, it may be informative to use the chromosome-specific mean (instead of whole genome mean) to further identify interesting local events (the current analysis may be mainly identifying between chromosome differences).We clarified this calculation in the extended Materials and methods section. The z-score is calculated to normalize ChAR-seq mapping events relative to the DpnII frequency for a given bin size.References:Chow JC, Hall LL, Baldry SEL, Thorogood NP, Lawrence JB, Brown CJ.
