Pneumonia can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2, 3], and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) can develop in patients with severe ARDS [4]. Severe ARDS complicated by DIC is a life-threatening condition and is associated with a poor prognosis, indicating the need for early treatment [4]. While various practice strategies for the management of pediatric ARDS have been proposed [5], the mortality in children with ARDS remains significant and an effective therapeutic strategy is needed.Recombinant human-soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) was primarily developed in Japan to treat DIC [6]. rTM is now administered to treat children with DIC and its safety has been shown [7, 8]. Recently, several clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of rTM as an adjunctive anti-inflammatory agent for various severe inflammatory conditions [9, 10]. Adjunctive rTM administration may be effective for ARDS complicated by DIC and sepsis in adult patients [10, 11]; however, there has been little research focusing on the safety and effects of rTM in children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC, while many therapeutic clinical trials that focused on all children with ARDS have been conducted [5]. We hypothesized that adjunctive rTM administration is feasible as a therapeutic strategy for children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC. This preliminary study was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of rTM in those critical children. We also investigated changes in plasma concentration of thrombomodulin (TM), cytokines/chemokines, and biomarkers associated with inflammation and lung epithelial or endothelial injury. MethodsPatients and case definitionsThis prospective preliminary study was carried out from January 2016 to May 2019 at the PICU in Vietnam National Children\u2019s Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. This study was approved by the ethics committee in National Children\u2019s Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam and National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. This study was registered in UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000020358, https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000023516) on 26 December 2015 and the first patient was enrolled on 27 January 2016.Children who met the following inclusion criteria within 72\u00a0h of PICU admission were enrolled: (1) admission to the PICU with infectious pneumonia; (2) age of 1\u00a0month\u201315\u00a0years; (3) DIC scores defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH)\u2009\u2265\u20095; (4) PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio)\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u00a0mm Hg (based on the Berlin definition of 2012) [12]; (5) No severe left ventricular dysfunction; (6) Chest X-ray showing an abnormal shadow (consolidation, ground-glass opacity, or nodular shadow); and (7) Written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate\u2009<\u200930\u00a0mL/min/1.73 m2) [13] or bleeding symptoms, or cyanotic heart diseases, or those whom the treating doctor deemed ineligible for any reason, were excluded from this study.ARDS treatmentsThe patients enrolled in this study received conventional therapies for ARDS using lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume, low static peak pressure and permissive hypercapnia. Ventilation modes were selected on the basis of the patients\u2019 status. In addition to lung-protective ventilation, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, antivirus agents and broad spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection were administered depending on the patients\u2019 conditions. Hemodynamics was managed with fluid management and vasoconstrictive agents. We observed respiratory variables including P/F ratio, mean airway pressure, base excess and radiographic findings. Oxygenation index (FiO2 x mean airway pressure\u2009\u00d7\u2009100/PaO2) was calculated.rTM administrationSimilar to the administration of rTM to adults, rTM (380 U/kg) was administered for a maximum of 6 consecutive days via intravenous drip infusion for 30\u00a0min after diagnosis of severe ARDS complicated by DIC. All necessary treatments performed by PICU doctors were acceptable, except administration or co-administration of anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents, and platelet aggregation inhibitors. Blood samples were taken on the day of admission to the PICU (day X), before the first administration of rTM, and on \u03b1 days after day X (day X\u2009+\u2009\u03b1). Blood samples were used to evaluate plasma concentrations of TM, cytokines/chemokines, biomarkers, blood cell counts, blood chemistry and DIC scores. The rTM administration was discontinued in case that patients developed severe renal dysfunction or bleeding in vital organs.Microbiological testsBlood and tracheal lavage fluid (TLF) were collected on the day of admission to the PICU. Microbiological cultures were prepared according to standard microbiological procedures. To detect and differentiate up to 25 pathogenic microbial DNA types in blood samples, the LightCycler SeptiFast Test (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used [14]. Total nucleic acids from the TLF samples were extracted with a MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit using a Roche MagNA Pure LC instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). The extracts were tested by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR) using the FTD Respiratory Pathogens 33 Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fast Track Diagnostics, Junglinster, Luxembourg) to screen 33 kinds of respiratory pathogens and by an in-house-developed conventional single-target rPCR to detect genomes of cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV).TM and biomarker assayThe plasma concentration of TM, soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and a microplate reader (Multiskan FC; Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Tokyo, Japan). ELISA kits for TM, sRAGE, SP-D and Ang-2 were purchased from R&D Systems (Tokyo, Japan) and for HMGB-1 from Shino-Test Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). All samples were run in duplicate and the average concentrations were used for statistical analysis.Cytokine and chemokine assayThe levels of cytokines/chemokines in the plasma were measured using the Human Cytokine Magnetic 25-Plex Panel Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a Magpix\u00ae system (Merck Vietnam Co., Ltd, Vietnam). All samples were run in duplicate and the average concentrations were used for statistical analysis.Statistical analysisDIC scores were shown as medians with the interquartile range (IQR), and the groups (day X and day X\u2009+\u20096) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were statistically analyzed using Prism 5.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) with a two-tailed hypothesis. ResultsPatientsSix children fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having severe ARDS and DIC. Although more than one virus genome was detected in each patient, the major causative pathogen of pneumonia in each case was estimated to be respiratory syncytial virus, tuberculosis, influenza A/H1N1pdm, Pneumocystis jirovecii / CMV, CMV and VZV, respectively (Table \u200b(Table1).1). No pathogenic microbial DNA was detected in blood samples, suggesting no bacteremia and fungiemia. Case 3 (1y5M) and Case 4(3\u00a0M) had past history of recurrent pneumonia. Case 4 was HIV positive. The other children had no significant past history.Table 1The characteristics of patientsGenderAgePRISM IIILowest P/F ratioMaximum DIC scorePathogen in TLF/NPA/blood on PICU admissionComplicatios and past historyPICU admission day from the onsetLOS in PICULOS in HospitalOutcomeCase 1F2\u00a0M10367RSV, CMVaNone61021AliveCase 2F2Y5M3356TB, CMVaNone203233AliveCase 3M1Y5M5777A/H1N1pdm, CMV*Recurrent pneumonia81327AliveCase 4M3\u00a0M10696PCP/CMV, HIVRecurrent pneumonia, HIV positive9834AliveCase 5F3\u00a0M10685CMVNone81717DeadCase 6F9Y5M12466VZV, RVNone121414DeadOpen in a separate windowPRISM Pediatric risk score for mortality, P/F ratio PaO2/FiO2 ratio, DIC disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, TLF tracheal lavage fluid, NPA; nasopharyngeal aspiration, RSV Respiratory syncytial virus, CMV cytomegalovirus, TB tuberculous, A/H1N1pdm Influenza A, subtype H1N1pdm, PCP pneumocystis jiroveci, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, VZV varicella zoster virus, RV Rhino virus, LOS Length of stayaCMV CMV latent infectionARDS statusAll patients received lung-protective ventilation. In addition to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support, volume-targeted pressure control (in Cases 1, 5, and 6), pressure-regulated volume control (in Cases 2 and 3), and high-frequency ventilation (in Cases 2 and 4) were applied depending on the patients\u2019 conditions. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids (except in Cases 2 and 4), antivirus agents and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. There was no patient who received surfactant therapy nor inhaled nitric oxide.In cases 1, 3, and 4, the status of ARDS, including the P/F ratio and oxygenation index, improved and they were successfully extubated within a week after conventional intensive care and adjunctive administration of rTM (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Case 2 required more time for improvement in the respiratory conditions due to tuberculous pneumonia, but this patient was later successfully extubated and survived [15]. Two patients, cases 5 and 6, died from their respiratory conditions that had not fully resolved (Table \u200b(Table2),2), although their DIC scores improved during administration of rTM. Case 5 developed severe hypoxia from respiratory failure, which occurred 7\u00a0days after completion of rTM administration (day X\u2009+\u200912). In case 6, her respiratory status deteriorated after multiple drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was cultured from TLF 5\u00a0days after completion of rTM administration.Table 2Changes in DIC Scores, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and oxygenation index before and after rTMPatient numberDIC scoresP/F ratio (mmHg)Oxygenation IndexExtubation (day)Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Survived patients\u00a0Case 162100Extubated15ExtubatedYes (day X\u2009+\u20093)\u00a0Case 265355061.520Yes (day X\u2009+\u200924)\u00a0Case 36293244214.7Yes (day X\u2009+\u20097)\u00a0Case 45382Extubated24ExtubatedYes (day X\u2009+\u20094)Non-survived patients\u00a0Case 55368431652No\u00a0Case 6531022072017NoOpen in a separate windowDIC disseminated intravascular coagulation, rTM recombinant human thrombomodulin administrationSafety of rTM administartionEach patient except case 3 was administered rTM for 6 consecutive days after enrollment in this study. In case 3, rTM was discontinued on day X\u2009+\u20093, because slightly bloody urine was detected after the fourth administration of rTM. The other cases showed no bleeding or other complications throughout the study. We did not find any adverse effects of rTM on liver or renal function during rTM administration (Table \u200b(Table3).3). We measured the plasma concentration of TM before rTM administration on day X and \u03b1 days after administration (on day X\u2009+\u2009\u03b1). Blood sampling days after the initiation of the administration of rTM were different among the patients because the blood sampling was limited to minimize the risk of anemia in pediatric patients. We decided the days of samplings depending on the patient\u2019s conditions. Consequently, blood samplings just after completion of rTM therapy were performed on day X\u2009+\u20095 in case 4, day X\u2009+\u20096 in cases 2, 5, 6 and day X\u2009+\u20097 in cases 1 and 3. On the days after completion of rTM administration, the plasma concentration of TM increased compared to that before rTM administration in all patients (Fig.\u00a01a). DIC scores after rTM administration were lower than those before rTM administration in all patients (Table \u200b(Table2).2). Median [IQR] of DIC score after rTM (3 [2.25\u20133]) was significantly lower than that before rTM (5.5 [5, 6]) (P\u2009<\u20090.05).Table 3Changes in biomarkers of liver function and renal function before and after rTM administrationPatient numberWBC (\u00d7\u20091000/\u03bcL)Plt (\u00d7\u20091000/\u03bcL)AST (U/L)ALT (U/L)BUN (mg/dL)Creatinine (\u03bcmol/L)Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDay X\u2009+\u20096Day XDayX\u2009+\u20096Survived Patients\u00a0Case 11912.442896549106277.413.63536\u00a0Case 26.712.21531427073161418185047\u00a0Case 312.15.9981432341424132154863161\u00a0Case 413.06.7142801757102874847.5124846Non-survived Patients\u00a0Case 511.525.227232883910234.520.33952\u00a0Case 67.79.224180131102106803.16.5919Open in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowFig. 1Changes in the plasma concentrations of biomarkers including thrombomodulin (a), soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) (b), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) (c), pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) (d), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) (e) before and after administration of recombinant human thrombomodulin (rTM) in 6 children. White circles and black circles indicate patients who survived and those who did not survive, respectivelyBiomarkers and inflammatory cytokines/chemokinesFigure\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a02 showed the changes in biomarkers (TM, sRAGE, HMGB-1, SP-D, Ang-2) and cytokines/chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IL-10, IP-10, IFN-\u03b3), respectively. Laboratory findings revealed that the levels of sRAGE after rTM administration was lower than that before rTM in all 6 children (Fig.\u00a01b). Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (Fig.\u00a02a), and IL-8 (Fig.\u00a02b) after rTM administration were also lower than that before rTM, except in case 5. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of the chemokine family, and regulates trafficking of monocytes from bone marrow to inflamed tissue in response to inflammatory signals [16]. Although plasma MCP-1 levels in the survived children (except on day X\u2009+\u20095 in case 4) decreased after rTM administration, those in the children who died increased (Fig.\u00a02c). However, there was variability in changes in other biomarkers, such as HMGB-1, SP-D and Ang-2 (Fig.\u00a01c\u2013e), and cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-10, and interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) among the patients (Fig.\u00a02d\u2013f).Open in a separate windowFig. 2Changes in the plasma concentrations of cytokines/chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) (a), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (b), Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (c), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (d), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) (e) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (f) before and after administration of recombinant human thrombomodulin (rTM). White circles and black circles indicate patients who survived and those who did not survive, respectively DiscussionThis preliminary study showed that the plasma concentration of TM increased and DIC scores decreased after administration of rTM in addition to conventional therapies for severe ARDS complicated with DIC compared to those before rTM administration in all patients.In all six children, levels of sRAGE after rTM administration were lower than those before rTM. In survived children, levels of cytokines/chemokines including IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 after administration of rTM were lower than those before rTM. These results may be due to both the anti-inflammatory effects of rTM and the treatments other than rTM, which suggest rTM may be a potential candidate for an adjunctive therapy for children with ARDS complicated by DIC.Previous studies in adults [17, 18] and children [7, 8] have shown the efficacy of rTM for DIC. We confirmed that rTM increased the plasma concentration of TM and DIC score decreased after rTM administration, consistent with previous studies. Based on the previous studies on the concentration of TM [19, 20], we considered that an increased plasma concentration of TM in our study might be induced by rTM administration and might be better for patients with DIC. Conversely, serum TM level can be increased by endothelial dysfunction and an increased TM level is associated with disease severity and mortality in pediatric patients [21, 22]. Thus, an increased concentration of TM in our study might represent intrinsic TM caused by endothelial damage, not by rTM administration. To validate the beneficial effects of increased TM concentration, detailed classification of TM (e.g., TM-alpha) might be required.In patients who survived, the P/F ratio and oxygenation index improved after administration of rTM. Notably, levels of sRAGE after rTM administration were lower than those before rTM. sRAGE is a marker of lung epithelial injury [23], and has good diagnostic value for ARDS and is associated with the severity of lung injury, the degree of lung epithelial injury, impaired alveolar fluid clearance, and prognosis in ARDS [24, 25]. Based on these studies, administration of rTM may be related with improvement or attenuation of lung epithelial injury. However, respiratory conditions did not improve after rTM in the patients who died. Recently, Jabaudon et al. reported that a higher baseline level of sRAGE was associated with development of ARDS [26]. In this study, on day X (just before administration of rTM), the plasma concentrations of sRAGE in patients 5 and 6, who later died, were 4715 and 8501\u00a0pg/mL, respectively, whereas the median concentration of sRAGE in the patients who survived was 1817 [IQR 1437\u20131904] pg/m. Thus, different degrees of damage in the lung epithelium in the patients who survived and those who did not survive may be involved in the different progress of ARDS and the subsequent outcomes.In the patients who survived, rTM may have helped to improve the ARDS status via anti-inflammatory effects. Recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of rTM have been highlighted, and rTM may improve not only respiratory dysfunction but also mortality rates in patients with severe sepsis and DIC [9\u201311, 27]. We previously published case reports on 3 of the patients who survived (cases 1, 2, and 4) in this study [15, 28]. Interestingly, MCP-1, which is one of the chemokines, decreased in 3 of the 4 patients who survived, but not in the patients who died, after administration of rTM. A previous study reported that a higher serum MCP-1 level was associated with a tenfold higher risk of death in ARDS [29]. In addition to sRAGE, these biomarkers may be useful for predicting the development of ARDS and outcomes. In contrast, changes in levels of biomarkers including IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 were not uniform in the patients who died, and there was variability in changes in other biomarkers, including several inflammatory biomarkers (HMGB-1, SP-D, and Ang-2) and cytokines/chemokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IP-10), that are associated with the development of ARDS [30]. To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of rTM in patients with severe ARDS, further large studies with patients without rTM administration and with simultaneous measurement of multiple inflammatory biomarkers and cytokines/chemokines may be required.This study has several limitations. First, this preliminary study is not a randomized trial, and there were no control patients, who were treated without rTM. On the basis of our results in 6 children, it may be difficult to state any definitive effects of rTM for severe pediatric ARDS complicated with DIC. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on the effects of rTM in children with severe ARDS complicated by DIC. To validate the efficacy of rTM for those children, further accumulation of clinical experiences and evidence including randomized controlled trials would be desirable. Second, we could not collect blood samples from the patients to evaluate the levels of biomarkers and cytokines/chemokines on the same days after administration of rTM because the children\u2019s conditions were different and the blood samples needed to be limited to avoid iatrogenic anemia. Third, our determinations of changes in biomarkers including cytokines/chemokines might not be clinically significant. The changes in those levels were evaluated by comparing the levels of biomarkers before and after administration of rTM. Thus, we have determined the \u2018increase\u2019 and \u2018decrease\u2019 of biomarkers by changes in each patient but not by any \u2018normal\u2019 level or general definition, because the normal level and/or definition of \u2018abnormal\u2019 in biomarkers measured in our study are different in previous reports depending on the methods of analysis. Finally, the patients enrolled in this study received multimodal therapies for severe ARDS and DIC. Thus, it is difficult to determine the definitive effects of rTM on the clinical status of ARDS and DIC. For example, the conventional therapies with lung-protective ventilations, intravenous immunoglobulin and antivirus agents or antibiotics might have improved the ARDS status in patients who survived.In conclusion, we investigated the feasibility of rTM as an adjuvant therapy for treatment of children with severe pneumonia-induced ARDS complicated by DIC. To determine the efficacy of rTM for those critical children, further accumulation of robust evidence will be required.
