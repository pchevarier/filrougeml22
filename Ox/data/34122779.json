Technologies detecting circulating cell\u2010free genomic tumour DNA mutations are, for example, showing great promise to evaluate treatment response and presence of residual disease in cancer (Cabel et\u00a0al., 2018; Cescon et\u00a0al., 2020; O'Leary et\u00a0al., 2018; Reece et\u00a0al., 2019). While large single\u2010stranded RNA transcripts are degraded in circulation, small\u2010RNA molecules, and in particular microRNAs (miRNA; \u223c22\u00a0nt long), remain intact and can be detected and measured to reflect pathological processes. MiRNAs are master transcriptional regulators that modulate the activity of specific mRNA targets and play important roles in a wide range of normal and pathological processes (Arroyo et\u00a0al., 2011; Cortez et\u00a0al., 2011; Larrea et\u00a0al., 2016; LeBleu & Kalluri, 2020; Shah et\u00a0al., 2018; Zlotorynski, 2019). Despite significant progress in detection of circulating miRNAs, the discovery of disease\u2010related miRNA biomarkers has been hindered by the low representation of these molecules within the large pool of circulating miRNAs, which originate from diverse cellular and tissue sources. Such limitation requires development of molecular assays with greater detection specificity and sensitivity. To address this issue, studies are now focused on the analysis of miRNA cargos encapsulated within circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), rather than total RNA purified from whole blood, serum, or plasma (Mitchell et\u00a0al., 2008; Rohan et\u00a0al., 2019). For example, a population of small\u2010EVs, namely exosomes, are showing great promise due to their active release by most cell types into the microenvironment and the circulation. These small\u2010EVs have been shown to participate in intercellular communications via targeted cellular uptake and cytoplasmic release of their miRNAs cargos, which have been implicated in the re\u2010programming of recipient cells (Fan et\u00a0al., 2018; O'Brien et\u00a0al., 2020; Simons & Raposo, 2009; Wang et\u00a0al., 2019; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015). Studies on exosomes have provided the basis for small\u2010EV purification but also highlighted the strong potential of their unique small\u2010RNA cargos for evaluation as circulating biomarkers from most biofluids (Armstrong et\u00a0al., 2015; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2019; Li et\u00a0al., 2015; Rodr\u00edguez et\u00a0al., 2017; Srinivasan et\u00a0al., 2019). These specific small\u2010EVs can be differentiated by both their unique size range (30\u2010150\u00a0nm in diameter) and their biogenesis (Colombo et\u00a0al., 2014). Produced via the endosomal pathway, exosomes are packaged with unique cellular material (RNA, gDNA, and proteins) and specifically enriched in membrane\u2010bound tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, CD37 and CD82 (Andreu & Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\u2010M\u00f3, 2014; Colombo et\u00a0al., 2014). These surface proteins can be targeted by immuno\u2010purification for global small\u2010EV analyses (Colombo et\u00a0al., 2014; Andreu & Y\u00e1\u00f1ez\u2010M\u00f3, 2014). However, during biogenesis these small\u2010EVs also inherit surface proteins from their cell of origin. Customizable antibody\u2010based purification assays targeting these cellular fingerprints have potential to improve detection of potentially unique and clinically relevant biomarkers (Larssen et\u00a0al., 2017; Mathivanan & Simpson, 2009; Wu et\u00a0al., 2019).Although major advances have been made over the last few years with the development of microfluidic\u2010based systems for purification of exosomes and other types of small\u2010EVs, very few have reached the commercial market and thus laboratory\u2010based techniques remain the gold standard for their purification and evaluation from biofluids. To date, four principal circulating exosomes/small EVs purification approaches have been developed, with a majority of them providing an averaged biomarker evaluation via a bulk small\u2010EV selection (Ludwig et\u00a0al., 2018; Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Yu et\u00a0al., 2018). Three classical approaches to purifying small\u2010EVs include ultracentrifugation, precipitation, and size\u2010exclusion (Ludwig et\u00a0al., 2018; Mac\u00edas et\u00a0al., 2019; Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Yu et\u00a0al., 2018). Although these methods result in pure preparations (with caveats for precipitation\u2010based methods), all of them produce a mix of small\u2010EV sub\u2010populations released into the circulation by various cell types and tissues, confounding and limiting subsequent analyses. The fourth method employs magnetic beads coated with monoclonal antibodies for immuno\u2010purification by selection of known surface biomarkers (Larssen et\u00a0al., 2017; L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017; Pugholm et\u00a0al., 2015). Although streptavidin magnetic\u2010beads may allow for a customizable biotinylated antibody\u2010based selection, this customization requires optimization, is highly dependent on the quality (surface polymer) and the chemistry (streptavidin and carboxylic acid coating) of the magnetic beads. The design of an easily customizable low background antibody\u2010selection assay may not only allow for more sensitive purification of small\u2010EV subpopulations, but may also provide a versatile tool for the selection of cell\u2010specific surface biomarkers and in turn fine\u2010tuned identification of unique disease biomarkers circulating in biofluids (Williams et\u00a0al., 2013). Finally, and most importantly, although a few low pH elution buffers have been described in the literature (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020; Hisey et\u00a0al., 2018; Hong et\u00a0al., 2014), very few manufacturers provide such buffers for release of the covalently\u2010bound antibodies and intact release of selected small\u2010EVs for downstream in vitro analyses (Hardin et\u00a0al., 2018; Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Peterson et\u00a0al., 2015; Theodoraki et\u00a0al., 2018; Velandia\u2010Romero et\u00a0al., 2020). A recent immunoaffinity\u2010based exosome isolation assay (exo\u2010PLA) addressed many of these issues by using an enzymatically degradable DNA linker between the exosome\u2010binding antibody and the magnetic bead, permitting release of intact exosomes (L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017). However, our initial evaluations strongly indicated that magnetic beads, used with this approach, could non\u2010specifically bind small\u2010RNAs to a degree significantly limiting detection of low\u2010abundance miRNA cargos.In addition to representing a valuable source of biomarkers, circulating exosomes/small\u2010EVs are also key players in multiple biological processes, particularly in the immune system (Barros et\u00a0al., 2018; Burkova et\u00a0al., 2019; Gutzeit et\u00a0al., 2014; Huang et\u00a0al., 2018; Mallegol et\u00a0al., 2007; Smith et\u00a0al., 2017). Notably, recent studies have suggested that exosomes, in particular, participate in antigen presentation to the immune system (Mallegol et\u00a0al., 2007; Smith et\u00a0al., 2017) and may mediate immune defense during viral infection (Barros et\u00a0al., 2018; Gutzeit et\u00a0al., 2014). The mechanistic role that exosomes play in immunity against well studied viruses (HIV, EBV, Ebola) has previously been evaluated (Mukhamedova et\u00a0al., 2019; Pleet et\u00a0al., 2016; Vallhov et\u00a0al., 2011). However, few studies have evaluated the potential roles or implications of circulating small\u2010EVs for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections. Our health care network (Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH)), which includes 17 hospitals, was located within the U.S. epicentre of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic where nearly half of all New Jersey Covid\u201019 patients were hospitalized. This allowed us to gain access to two different biorepository\u2010based cohorts of serum samples from Covid\u201019 patients for use in proof\u2010of principle pilot studies where we evaluated our customizable antibody\u2010based purification assay, which we designed for small\u2010RNA cargo analysis and intact release of functional small\u2010EVs purified from clinical specimens.In this methodology report we present a new small\u2010EV purification assay, termed Extracellular Vesicle Capture by AnTibody of CHoice and Enzymatic Release or EV\u2010CATCHER, which allows for customizable selection and release of immuno\u2010purified small\u2010EVs. We describe its step\u2010by\u2010step design and thorough evaluation by comparison to 11 different small\u2010EV purification methods. As proof\u2010of\u2010principle purification of circulating small\u2010EVs with EV\u2010CATCHER and for comparison to existing methods, we chose antibodies targeting tetraspanins expressed on small\u2010EVs (anti\u2010CD63, \u2010CD9, \u2010CD81 antibodies) for our analyses. Using EV\u2010CATCHER in combination with our highly\u2010sensitive small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparation protocol (Loudig et\u00a0al., 2017, 2018), designed for high\u2010throughput small\u2010RNA sequencing, we purified circulating small\u2010EVs of sera collected from Covid\u201019 patients at the time of their hospitalization (first set of clinical specimens) and identified differentially expressed miRNAs associated with severity of the disease, otherwise not significantly detectable in whole sera. Additionally, to evaluate integrity of the small\u2010EVs enzymatically released by EV\u2010CATCHER, we confirmed the neutralizing activity of small\u2010EVs purified from sera of recovered Covid\u201019 individuals (Second set of clinical specimens), which we had unexpectedly and initially identified by using ultracentrifuged small\u2010EVs from convalescent donors with high anti\u2010spike IgG titers. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Experimental and clinical specimensHuman MCF\u20107 and mouse RAWS 264.7 small\u2010EVs obtained from tissue culture media and purified by ultracentrifugation were purchased from System Biosciences (Cat#: EXOP\u2010100A\u20101 and EXOP\u2010165A\u20101 respectively). MCF\u20107 small\u2010EVs (30\u2010150\u00a0nm) for protein titration experiments were obtained by ultracentrifugation of media. Briefly, 60\u00a0ml of tissue culture media (comprised of DMEM (Gibco, #10566016) supplemented with 10% small\u2010EV depleted FBS (Gibco, #A2720801) and 1% PenStrep (Gibco, #15140122)), obtained from \u223c80% confluent MCF\u20107 cells, was refreshed 48 h before collection. Cells, dead cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min, 2,000 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min, followed by 10,000 \u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min, respectively. Ultracentrifugation of small\u2010EVs from culture media, human plasma, or serum was performed in 10\u00a0ml Ultraclear tubes (Beckman Coulter, #344059) in an Optima XE\u201090 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 2 h at 100,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS (Gibco, #10010023) and then subjected to a second round of ultracentrifugation for 2 h at 100,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C and final small\u2010EV pellets were resuspended in 50 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 PBS. Serum specimens from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infected patients, at the time of their hospitalization (first sample set used for pilot identification of differentially expressed miRNAs between mild and severe Covid\u201019 disease), were collected at Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) under IRB#Pro2018\u20101022 within the HMH Network. Serum samples were processed at the Biorepository (BioR) and stored as 500 \u03bcl aliquots at \u201080\u00b0C. Upon submission of an internal proposal (Proposal# BioRCOV4) and approval, 13 serum samples from patients who did not require mechanical ventilation and 17 samples from mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS were collected and both whole sera and EV\u2010CATCHER purified small\u2010EVs were subjected to RNA extraction. Original convalescent serum specimens (second sample set used for evaluation of viral neutralization by convalescent small\u2010EVs) were collected from recently recovered Covid\u201019 individuals enrolled in the convalescent plasma study lead by Dr. Michele Donato (IRB#Pro2020\u20100375/0378). Excess samples were transferred to the HMH BioR, after being de\u2010identified and were provided to the Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI) after review and approval by the Covid\u201019 Research Review Committee (proposal COVID\u201019#102). Provided samples were stored as 1,000 \u03bcl aliquots at \u201080\u00b0C. Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), using the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein as antigen, developed and optimized in the laboratory of Dr. David Perlin to identify high and low anti\u2010spike IgG serum titers were initially performed. Sera samples were then stratified as either high IgG (titer\u00a0>\u00a010,000) or low IgG (titer Below Limit of Quantification (BLQ)) titers. Three sera samples from high IgG and 3 from BLQ IgG convalescent individuals were subjected to CD63 purification using the EV\u2010CATCHER assay and evaluated for neutralization potential of their circulating small\u2010EVs. Two samples (one high and one BLQ) were ultracentrifuged for evaluation of small\u2010EVs from whole serum.2.2. Small\u2010EV Capture by AnTibody of CHoice and Enzymatic Release (EV\u2010CATCHER) assayThe release protocol described by L\u00f6f et\u00a0al. (2017) was further optimized and modified as follows (L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017); HPLC\u2010purified uracilated oligonucleotides (Integrative DNA Technology) for the 5\u2032\u2010Azide (5\u2032Az\u2010AAAAACGAUUCGAGAACGUGACUGCCAUGCCAGCUCGUACUAU CGAA) and 3\u2032\u2010Biotin (5\u2032Bio\u2010CGAUAGUACGAGCUGGCAUGGCAGUCACGUUCUCGAA UCGUUUU), adapted from L\u00f6f et\u00a0al. (2017) were resuspended in RNase\u2010free water at a concentration of 250\u00a0ng/\u03bcl. Equimolar amounts (1:1 ratios) of each oligo were annealed (90\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, 90\u201042\u00b0C for 40\u00a0min, 42\u00b0C for 120\u00a0min) in 1\u00d7 RNA annealing buffer (60\u00a0mM KCl, 6\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2\u00a0mM MgCl2), prior to separation on a 15% non\u2010denaturing polyacrylamide (PAGE) gel (0.5\u00d7 TBE (ThermoFisher, #15581044) at 450 volts for 90\u00a0min). The double stranded (ds) DNA linker was visualized on a blue light box with SYBR Gold dye (ThermoFisher, #S11494), excised, centrifugally crushed using a gel breaker tube (IST Engineering, #3388\u2010100) and resuspended in 400\u00a0mM NaCl and shaken overnight (O/N) on a thermomixer set to 4\u00b0C and 1,100 RPM. The solution was filtered, and the dsDNA linker was purified using the QIAEX\u00ae II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, #20021) according to manufacturer instructions. Purified dsDNA linker was evaluated on a NanoDrop 2000 and diluted to 250\u00a0ng/\u03bcl. Antibodies (1\u00a0mg/ml) used for exosome pulls (anti\u2010CD63 (Abcam, #ab59479), anti\u2010CD81 (Abcam, #ab233692) and anti\u2010CD9 (Abcam, #ab263023)) were activated using 5\u00a0\u03bcl of freshly prepared 4\u00a0mM DBCO\u2010S\u2010S\u2010NHS ester (Sigma Aldrich, #761532) and incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) in the dark, reactions were stopped by adding 2.5\u00a0\u03bcl of 1\u00a0M Tris\u2010Cl (pH 8.0) at RT for 5\u00a0min in the dark. DBCO\u2010activated antibodies were desalted onto pre\u2010equilibrated Zeba desalting columns (ThermoFisher, #89882) by incubation for 1\u00a0min and centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 g for 2\u00a0min. Antibodies were quantified on a Nanodrop 2000 instrument using protein A280 and antibody\u2010dsDNA (Ab\u2010dsDNA) stock solutions were prepared by conjugating 50 \u03bcg of activated antibody with 25 \u03bcg of purified DNA linker, O/N at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. Validation of Ab\u2010dsDNA binding was performed by PAGE where the Ab\u2010dsDNA (1 \u03bcg) product was run under non\u2010denaturing and non\u2010reducing conditions, followed by Coomassie (Bio\u2010Rad #1610786) staining to visualize the shift in Ab\u2010dsDNA migration. The next day, Ab\u2010dsDNA conjugates were bound to streptavidin coated 96\u2010well plates (Pierce, #15120). Either single anti\u2010CD63 antibody (1 \u03bcg) or a combination of anti\u2010CD63, \u2010CD81 and \u2010CD9 (1 \u03bcg of each antibody) (linker bound) was added to single wells in 100 \u03bcl 1x PBS. Streptavidin coated 96\u2010well plates with Ab\u2010dsDNA conjugates were placed on a plate shaker at 300 RPM at 4\u00b0C, for 8 h to allow for binding to the plate. Solutions were carefully removed, and wells were washed three times with cold 1\u00d7 PBS solution, prior to addition of RNase\u2010A (12.5 \u03bcg/ml) treated samples (100\u00a0\u03bcl). Plates were sealed using microAMP optical adhesive film (Applied Biosystems, #4311971) and placed on a shaker at 300 RPM at 4\u00b0C, O/N. Samples were carefully removed, wells were washed 3 times with cold 1x PBS and 100\u00a0\u03bcl of freshly prepared uracil glycosylase (UNG) enzyme (ThermoFisher, #EN0362) in 1x PBS (1x UNG buffer (200\u00a0mM Tris\u2010Cl (pH 8.0), 10\u00a0mM EDTA and 100\u00a0mM NaCl), with 1 unit of enzyme) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h on a shaker at 300 RPM for UNG digest of the dsDNA linker, and small\u2010EVs were recovered in this solution for further characterization and downstream analyses.2.3. Small\u2010EV purification comparisonsNon\u2010specific capture of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a and small\u2010EVs (10\u03bcg) from MCF\u20107 tissue cultured human breast cancer cells lines (Abcam Cat#ab239691) was performed by comparison of our optimized EV\u2010CATCHER assay to 10 different globally distributed commercial kits, which included: 1\u2010 Exosome Isolation CD63 kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Cat#130\u2010110\u2010918); 2\u2010 Mojosort Magnetic beads from Biolegends (Cat#480016); 3\u2010 MagCapture Tim 4 Exosome isolation kit from Fujifilm (Cat#293\u201077601); 4\u2010 Dynabeads MyOne T1 Carboxylic Acid beads from Thermofisher (Cat#65011); 5\u2010 ExoCap CD63+ from MBL International (Cat#MEX\u2010SA123); 6\u2010 Dynabeads Streptavidin MyOne T1 beads from ThermoFisher (Cat#10606D); 7\u2010 Exo\u2010Flow32 CD63 IP exosome purification kit from System Biosciences (SBI) (Cat#EXOFLOW32A\u2010CD63); 8\u2010 ExoEasy exosome purification kit from Qiagen (Cat#76064); 9\u2010 Plasma/serum exosome purification kit from N\u00f6rgen Biotek (Cat#57400); 10\u2010 ExoQuick purification reagent from SBI (Cat#EXOQ5TM\u20101); and Ultracentrifugation (Method#11) for sedimentation of small\u2010EVs as described in the \u2018Experimental and clinical specimens\u2019 section above. For all commercial kits, we followed manufacturer's instruction to purify small\u2010EVs directly, or by binding the same anti\u2010CD63 antibody (Mojosort, Dynabeads streptavidin and carboxyl beads, and ExoCap) used with EV\u2010CATCHER. For evaluation of non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA binding to magnetic\u2010beads (Methods 2, 4, 5 and 6), we used 100pg of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a (IDT) spiked into 100\u03bcl 1\u00d7 PBS and the RNA extractions were performed after three successive washes using the miRNeasy serum/plasma kit from Qiagen (Cat#217184). The non\u2010specific binding of 100pg ath\u2010miR\u2010159a spiked into 100 \u03bcl of human serum (Sigma Cat#H4522) was evaluated for all methods where all magnetic beads were conjugated to CD63 (Commercial kits #1,2,4,5,6 and 7), or Tim 4 (commercial kit # 3), following manufacturer's instruction, final elutions using kit provided elution buffers (ExoFlow elution buffer and including 1% formic acid pH3 solution), and RNA extraction using the miRNeasy serum/plasma kit from Qiagen. Non\u2010specific binding of small\u2010EVs to magnetic beads was also evaluated using small EVs from MCF\u20107 cells (SBI, Cat#EXOP\u2010100A\u20101) using unconjugated magnetic beads (Commercial kits# 2, 4, 5 and 6).2.4. RNA extractionsWhole sera, whole plasma, and small\u2010EVs isolated from biofluids were subjected to total RNA extraction using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen, Cat#217184) according to manufacturer's instructions with some modifications to improve total RNA yield. Briefly, QIAzol was added to 100\u00a0\u03bcl of whole plasma, whole serum, or small\u2010EVs purified from Biofluids, vortexed and incubated at RT for 5\u00a0min, after which chloroform was added to each sample. Samples were vortexed again and incubated at RT for 5\u00a0min. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g, at 4\u2070C for 15\u00a0min and the upper aqueous phase of each sample was carefully removed and transferred into new siliconized tubes, to which 100% ethanol was added. Samples were incubated on ice for 40\u00a0min prior to column purification. The clear upper phase was then passed twice through supplied RNeasy minElute columns, washed with RPE, and ice cold 80% ethanol. Columns were spun to remove residual ethanol and total RNA was eluted with 50\u00a0\u03bcl of RNase\u2010free water. Samples were then speed\u2010vacuumed to 10\u00a0\u03bcl for small\u2010RNA sequencing or to 20\u00a0\u03bcl for quantitative real\u2010time PCR (RT\u2010qPCR). For cDNA small\u2010RNA library preparation and next\u2010generation sequencing, 3\u00a0ng of size primers (1.5\u00a0ng \u2010 19\u00a0nt and 1.5\u00a0ng \u2010 24\u00a0nt; (Loudig et\u00a0al., 2018)) was spiked into each RNA extraction. For RT\u2010qPCR experiments, 1 pg of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a (IDT, rUrUrUGGArUrUGAAGGGAGCrUCrUA) was added to QIAzol prior to RNA extractions from MCF\u20107 and clinical specimens (mild vs. severe Covid\u201019 samples) prior to RNA separation and column purification and used as an exogenous technical normalization control.2.5. Western blot analysesWestern blot analyses were conducted to evaluate presence of surface protein biomarkers from purified small\u2010EV fractions. Purified small\u2010EVs were lysed and denatured in 1\u00d7 Laemmli buffer (Bio\u2010Rad, #161\u20100747) containing 355\u00a0mM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol, and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Denatured lysates were pulse centrifuged and separated on 4%\u201312% polyacrylamide precast mini\u2010PROTEAN TGX gel (Bio\u2010Rad, # 4561086) by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2010PAGE). Five microliters of Precision Plus Protein Dual Xtra Prestained Protein Standard (Bio\u2010Rad, #1610377) was loaded and used for gel orientation and determination of molecular weights of separated proteins. Samples were loaded and gels were run at 100 V and 400\u00a0mA for 90\u00a0min (Power Pac 300, Bio\u2010Rad) in 1\u00d7 Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer (Bio\u2010Rad, #1610732). After the SDS\u2010PAGE run, proteins were transferred to 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio\u2010Rad, #1704156) using a semidry electro\u2010transfer system (TransBlot Turbo v1.02, Bio\u2010Rad) for 30\u00a0min at 25 V. Membranes were visualized using the stain\u2010free blot protocol provided on a Chemi\u2010Doc MP (Bio\u2010Rad) system to evaluate protein transfer and non\u2010specific binding was prevented by blocking membranes in EveryBlot blocking buffer (Bio\u2010Rad, #12010020) for 30\u00a0min. Membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with TBS\u2010T (1x TBS, pH 6.8, 0.1% Tween20) diluted anti\u2010mouse primary antibodies (1:1000) targeted against Apolipoprotein B (Novus Biologicals, Cat#MAB4124), Alix (Life Technologies, #{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MA183977\",\"term_id\":\"1437208263\",\"term_text\":\"MA183977\"}}MA183977), Albumin (Novus Biologicals, Cat#MAB1455), CD63 (Abcam, Cat#ab59479), or with TBS\u2010T diluted anti\u2010rabbit primary antibodies (1:1000) targeted against Apolipoprotein A1 (Novus Biologicals, Cat#MAB36641), CD81 (Abcam, #ab233692), and CD9 (Abcam, #ab263023). Membranes were washed with TBS\u2010T (3 \u00d7 5\u00a0min) before incubation in either anti\u2010mouse or anti\u2010rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000) for 1 h, with gentle agitation at RT. Membranes were washed with TBS\u2010T (3 \u00d7 5\u00a0min) before proteins were detected using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce, #34095) and protein bands were visualized using ImageLab 4.0 software on a Chemi\u2010Doc MP (Bio\u2010Rad) imaging system.2.6. Transmission electron microscopyTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) of purified small\u2010EVs was performed by Charles River Laboratories (Pathology Associates (PAI), Durham NC) and at the analytical imaging facility at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. Briefly, purified small\u2010EVs were fixed using 2% Glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (Electron Microscopy Services, #6536\u201005) and stored at 4\u00b0C. 300 mesh formvar\u2010coated grids were inverted onto 20 \u03bcl of fixed exosome suspensions for approximately 2\u00a0min and wicked dry. Grids were then inverted onto 40 \u03bcl of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for approximately 1\u00a0min, and wicked dry. Samples were imaged on a JEOL JEM\u20101400+ transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd.; Tokyo, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 80\u00a0kV. High resolution TIFF images were acquired and saved using an AMT 16 MP digital camera system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp.; Woburn, MA).2.7. Nanoparticle trackingSize and particle concentration of purified small\u2010EVs were assessed using a Spectradyne nCS1 instrument. Briefly, 2\u00a0\u03bcl of purified small\u2010EVs were loaded onto TS400 microfluidic cartridges (Spectradyne, #TS400), which allows for the analysis of particles between 65\u2013400\u00a0nm. Loaded cartridges were primed in the instrument using 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm filtered buffer (1\u00d7 PBS containing 1% Tween\u201020) and particle acquisition was carried out. Acquired stats files were analysed for particle concentration and size distribution using Spectradyne Viewer software, where peak\u2010filtered CSD graphs were generated.2.8. Small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparationsSmall\u2010RNA sequencing from small\u2010EVs was performed using the cDNA library preparation protocol described by Loudig et\u00a0al. (2017), with modifications for low input RNA from biofluids and purified small\u2010EVs (Loudig et\u00a0al., 2018). For optimization of the sequencing method, titration experiments were performed in our laboratory using decreasing amounts of total RNA extracted from whole serum with as little as 1.5\u00a0ng of total RNA (see Figure\u00a04a). For small\u2010EVs separately purified from Covid\u201019 sera, the small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparation was performed using total RNA recovered from small\u2010EVs purified from 200 \u03bcl of serum (2 wells were prepared for each serum sample (100 \u03bcl per well) and pulls were pooled for RNA extraction. Briefly, 15 (each of the Covid\u201019 libraries for the first set of serum samples) to 18 (optimization experiments) ligations were set up individually by combining 9.5\u00a0\u03bcl of total RNA, 8.5\u00a0\u03bcl of the master\u2010mix and 1\u00a0\u03bcl of 50 \u03bcM adenylated barcoded 3\u2032 adapter (Integrated DNA Technologies, custom order). A master\u2010mix was prepared using 0.0052\u00a0nM calibrator cocktail (40\u00a0\u03bcl 10\u00d7 RNA ligase \u20102 buffer, 120\u00a0\u03bcl 50% DMSO, and 10\u00a0\u03bcl calibrator cocktail from (Loudig et\u00a0al., 2018)). Reactions were heated at 90\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, incubated on ice for 2\u00a0min, and 1\u00a0\u03bcl (1/10 diluted) truncated K227Q T4 RNA Ligase 2 (New England Biolabs, #M0351L) was added to each reaction, which were then incubated O/N on ice in a cold room. The next day, ligations were heat inactivated at 90\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, and individually precipitated by addition of 1.2\u00a0\u03bcl of Glycoblue mix (1\u00a0\u03bcl Glycoblue Co\u2010precipitant (15\u00a0mg/ml; ThermoFisher, #AM9516) in 26\u00a0\u03bcl 5\u00a0M NaCl (ThermoFisher, #AM9579)) and 63\u00a0\u03bcl of 100% ethanol was added to each tube. Reactions were combined, precipitated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 1 h at 14,000 RPM, at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was dried and resuspended in 20\u00a0\u03bcl nuclease\u2010free water and 20\u00a0\u03bcl denaturing PAA gel loading solution and separated on a 15% Urea\u2010PAGE gel. Size marker RNA oligonucleotides (IDT) were used as guide for gel excision. The gel piece was crushed using a gel\u2010breaker tube (IST Engineering, #3388\u2010100) and incubated in 400\u00a0mM NaCl O/N at 4\u00b0C, at 1,100 RPM on a thermomixer. The next day the solution was filtered and precipitated in 100% ethanol on ice for 1 h. RNA pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The 5\u2032 adapter was added to the resuspended pellet and T4 RNA Ligase 1 (New England Biolabs, #M0204L) was added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The ligated product was separated on a 12% Urea\u2010PAGE gel in the presence of 5\u2032 ligated size markers, as guide for size selection. The gel was spun in a gel breaker tube, after which the crushed gel was resuspended in 300\u00a0mM NaCl solution with 1 \u03bcl 100 \u03bcM 3\u2032 PCR primer, and incubated O/N on a thermomixer at 1100 RPM at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the solution was filtered, precipitated with 100% ethanol, incubated on ice for 1 h and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The RNA pellet was resuspended in nuclease free water for reverse transcription (3\u00a0\u03bcl 5\u00d7 first strand buffer, 1.5\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0M DTT, and 4.2\u00a0\u03bcl dNTP Mix (2\u00a0mM each; ThermoFisher, #R0241)) with 0.75\u00a0\u03bcl SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, #18080\u2010093) and incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. Reverse transcription was deactivated at 95\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, followed by addition of 95\u00a0\u03bcl nuclease\u2010free water. A pilot PCR reaction was set up (10\u00a0\u03bcl 10x PCR buffer, 10\u00a0\u03bcl dNTP Mix (2\u00a0mM each), 10\u00a0\u03bcl cDNA, 67\u00a0\u03bcl nuclease\u2010free water, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl 3\u2032 PCR primer, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl 5\u2032 PCR primer, and 2\u00a0\u03bcl Titanium Taq DNA Polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, #639208)). 12\u00a0\u03bcl aliquots were withdrawn at cycles 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22 for analysis on a 2.5% agarose gel, and identification of the optimal PCR amplification cycle. Six PCR reactions were then set up, run for the optimal number of amplification cycles, a portion (10\u00a0\u03bcl) was evaluated on a 2.5% agarose gel. The remaining solution was combined, precipitated, digested with PmeI for removal of size markers, and separated on a 2.5% gel. The 100\u00a0nt PCR library product was excised, purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, #28704) and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, #{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q32854\",\"term_id\":\"75280861\",\"term_text\":\"Q32854\"}}Q32854). cDNA libraries were then sequenced (single\u2010read 50 cycles) on a HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System (Illumina, #SY\u2010401\u20102501), after which FASTQ files containing raw sequencing data were processed for adapter trimming and small\u2010RNA alignment to the hg\u201019 genome. Read counts were normalized to total counts and subjected to statistical analyses (see below).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Small\u2010RNA sequencing of small\u2010EVs purified from biofluids. a.\u00a0Next\u2010generation sequencing and heatmap representation of the top expressed circulating miRNAs in human serum.

Duplicate libraries were obtained using newer (Repeats#1) and older (Repeats#2) 3\u2032 barcoded adapters. Data was analysed using dedicated Bioconductor packages in the R platform and heatmaps were generated using the \u2018NMF\u2019 package (a heatmap function)2.9. Quantitative PCR experimentsQuantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments were performed using TaqMan microRNA reverse\u2010transcription kits, TaqMan microRNA master mix PCR kits, and individual TaqMan microRNA assays following manufacturer's instructions (ThermoFisher). For evaluation of non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA binding to magnetic beads (Using uncoupled magnetic beads that included Dynabeads Streptavidin (ThermoFisher); ExoCap (MBL international); Dynabeads MyOne Carboxylic Acid (Thermofisher); and Mojosort Magnetic beads (Biolegends)) and our streptavidin coated 96\u2010well plates, we evaluated the non\u2010specific binding of one hundred picograms of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a RNA oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) and performed qPCR reactions of elutions from the different beads after three 1\u00d7PBS washes. For optimization experiments we quantified hsa\u2010miR\u201021 (ThermoFisher, Cat#000397) and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c (ThermoFisher, Cat#000505) with RNA extracted from MCF\u20107 exosomes (SBI). For validation of differentially expressed miRNAs identified by sequencing of RNA of small\u2010EVs from Covid\u201019 serum specimens, TaqMan miRNA primer assays for hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p (Cat#002228), hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a (Cat#002163), hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20105p (Cat#000451), hsa\u2010miR\u2010205 (Cat#000509) were used for qPCR detection. For these quantifications, one picogram of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a was added to the Covid\u201019 infected serum specimens prior to RNA extractions and used as a qPCR normalization control. For these qPCR reactions, reverse transcriptions were set up using 10% (2 \u03bcl out of 20 \u03bcl) of RNA extracted from combined CD63/CD81/CD9 small\u2010EV purifications from 100 \u03bcl of serum. For individual transcript quantifications, 1/3 of the RT reactions (5 \u03bcl) was used to set up the triplicate individual qPCR experiments. Quantitative PCR measurements were performed on a Step\u2010One\u2010Plus instrument using manufacturer's recommended 96\u2010well plates and sealing covers. Quantitative qPCR data was transferred to Excel sheet for statistical analyses, as described below.2.10. BSL\u20103 tissue culture and neutralization of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102Vero 76, clone E6 (Vero E6) cells (ATCC, #CRL\u20101586), maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, #26140079) and 1% Penicillin\u2010Streptomycin\u2010Amphotericin B (ATCC, #PCS\u2010999\u2010002), were seeded in wells of a 96\u2010well black, clear flat\u2010bottom culture plate (Corning, #07\u2010200\u2010565) at a density of 20,000 cells per well. Once plated, cells were maintained at an atmosphere of 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 humidity overnight to allow cells to attach and form a \u223c80% confluent monolayer. Prior to treatment and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 viral infection, cell monolayers were washed with pre\u2010warmed 1\u00d7 PBS and 50\u00a0\u03bcl of fresh media was added. Cell treatments were prepared, wherein, whole sera, small\u2010EVs purified using CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER or by ultracentrifugation from convalescent sera (using the second set of Covid\u201019 serum samples), were diluted (5 \u03bcl in 200 \u03bcl (40\u00d7 dilution) with pre\u2010warmed growth media. A total of 25\u00a0\u03bcl of the prepared treatment solutions was added in each wells with 50 \u03bcl of pre\u2010warmed growth media, cells were incubated at an atmosphere of 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 humidity for 2 h. After which, small\u2010EV\u2010treated Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 25\u00a0\u03bcl of mNeonGreen (mNG) infectious cDNA clone of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)) at a final concentration of 100\u00d7 TCID50 dilution in a BSL\u20103 laboratory. Final whole sera and small\u2010EV treatment concentrations achieved were at \u223c160x dilution of small\u2010EV stocks. After mNG\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections, the cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 humidity for 72 h. Cell monolayers were washed three times with pre\u2010warmed 1x PBS and live cells were stained using Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Invitrogen, #H3570) for 15\u00a0min. Plates were imaged on fluorescent plate reader (Tecan, Infinite 200 Pro) scanning at 488\u00a0nm (mNeonGreen) and 350\u00a0nm (Hoechst 33342). Cells were then fixed O/N at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde solution and fluorescent cell images were acquired on a Celigo Imaging Cytometer (Nexcelom).2.11. Data analysisFor sequencing data analysis, raw FASTQ data files obtained from an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer were processed using the RNAworld server from the Tuschl Laboratory at the Rockefeller University, including adapter trimming and read alignments and annotation. MiRNA counts were exported to spreadsheets for data analysis. Statistical analyses of miRNA counts were performed using dedicated Bioconductor packages in the R platform, as detailed below. Heat maps were generated from transformed counts using the \u2018NMF\u2019 package (aheatmap function). Differential expression was assessed using \u2018DESeq2\u2019 and \u2018edgeR\u2019. Differential expression models included a batch variable (library) to reduce batch biases. Interactions with sex and age were tested (Mens\u00e0 et\u00a0al., 2019). To maximize the discrimination ability of miRNA we computed a score for each sample (\u2018miRNA score\u2019, (Mazeh et\u00a0al., 2018)), assembled by summing the standardized levels (z\u2010values) of all significantly upregulated miRNA, and the negative of the z\u2010values of all significantly downregulated miRNA. For quantitative PCR (qPCR) we subtracted the threshold cycle (Ct) value of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a (exogenous normalization control) from the Ct value of each individual miRNA and calculated the \u0394\u0394Ct comparative method values. QPCR differential expression was assessed via t\u2010tests or Mann\u2010Whitney U tests of \u0394\u0394Ct values. For convalescent small\u2010EV neutralization assays, statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software, where data was assessed using mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). All in vitro experiments consisted of both technical (three separate wells) and biological (three separate experiments) replicates. One\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc test was conducted. A P\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Development of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay for purification of small\u2010EVs from human biofluidsWe endeavoured to optimize the customizable attachment of selective antibodies to a binding platform for specific purification of small\u2010EVs from biological fluids. Thus, using the design described by L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017 (Figure\u00a01a) we initially established optimal hybridizing conditions to generate the highest amount of the double\u2010stranded DNA linker for subsequent assays (Figure\u00a01b, lane 4) (L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017). In order to increase purity of the dsDNA and to prevent representation of single\u2010stranded 5\u2032 azide oligonucleotides, which could bind to the DBCO\u2010activated antibodies and prevent their binding to the platform, we purified the annealed dsDNA products on a non\u2010denaturing acrylamide gel. Using uracil\u2010glycosylase (UNG), we validated the degradable nature of the dsDNA linker through enzymatic digestion (Figure\u00a01b, lane 5). Next, we determined the optimal ratio between dsDNA\u2010linker and the DBCO activated antibodies, which was evaluated on a 12% PAGE (Figure\u00a01c, compare lanes c, d and e). The binding of the ds\u2010DNA linker modified the migratory pattern of the antibody, which could be restored upon UNG glycosylase treatment and digestion of the dsDNA linker (Figure\u00a01c, lanes f). These experiments were repeated with different antibodies and validated our optimized conditions for preparation of ds\u2010DNA linker and antibody duplexes.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Strategy developed for selectively purifying small\u2010EVs from human biofluids. a.\u00a0Schematic representation of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay designed for purification of small\u2010EVs from biofluids, which relies on binding of a degradable dsDNA\u2010linker (uracilated 5\u2032\u2010azide oligonucleotide annealed to complementary uracilated 3\u2032\u2010biotin oligonucleotide) to a DBCO\u2010activated antibody and to a streptavidin\u2010coated platform. b.

Experiments were replicated and imaged on a ChemiDoc MP imager3.2. Identification of a low non\u2010specific nucleic acid and small\u2010EV binding platformAlthough magnetic beads are extensively used for the isolation of small\u2010EVs and exosomes prior to the evaluation of their cargos, repeated experiments conducted in our laboratory suggested high\u2010levels of non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA binding in the absence of a capture antibody (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, we sought to investigate the small\u2010RNA and small\u2010EV non\u2010specific binding capacity of magnetic beads from several commercially available kits by comparison to the non\u2010magnetic streptavidin coated 96\u2010well plates used with EV\u2010CATCHER (wells; largely used for ELISA assays), as described in Figure\u00a02a. We chose commercial kits widely\u2010used in peer\u2010reviewed publications, which included magnetic\u2010beads of sizes ranging from 130\u00a0nm to 9\u03bcm, but also included global purification methods and kits (Figure\u00a02a., ExoEasy, ExoQuick, Ultracentrifugation) as controls. For our first evaluations on the non\u2010specific binding of small\u2010RNAs to magnetic beads we used a synthetic ath\u2010miR\u2010159a RNA oligonucleotide (100pg/assay), an Arabidopsis\u2010thaliana miRNA that is not found as a contaminant in the laboratory (control PCR experiments). We selected the four kits providing customizable magnetic\u2010beads (the manufacturer sells them without conjugated antibodies) including Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin and carboxylic acid T1 beads, MojoSort beads, and ExoCap beads, in comparison to Streptavidin\u2010coated 96 well\u2010plates (EV\u2010CATCHER), as displayed in Figure\u00a02b. Using qPCR as a sensitive measuring tool, we detected ath\u2010miR\u2010159a (fold change by comparison with control (total amount added)), for all methods following 3 washes and the final elution from the magnetic beads/wells. We tested the magnetic\u2010beads and wells as purchased without antibodies (Figure\u00a02b. left), in presence of BSA (Figure\u00a02b. centre), and in presence of BSA+ RNase\u2010A (Figure\u00a02b. right) and evaluated the non\u2010specific binding of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a by RT\u2010qPCR. Although the addition of BSA (1%) or BSA (1%) + RNase\u2010A decreased non\u2010specific binding of the ath\u2010miR\u2010159a (Figure\u00a02b. middle and right graphs), the Streptavidin\u2010coated 96 well\u2010plates used with EV\u2010CATCHER displayed the lowest non\u2010specific binding by more than 10 PCR cycles. Next, we sought to evaluate the non\u2010specific binding of 100pg ath\u2010miR\u2010159a spiked into 100\u03bcl of human serum, but this time by using all 11 selected methods, in their small\u2010EV purification configuration with magnetic\u2010beads conjugated to antibodies (anti\u2010Tim4 antibody for MagCapture, and anti\u2010CD63 antibody for customizable and customized methods, as displayed in Figure\u00a02a.), by comparison to our anti\u2010CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER assay (Figure\u00a02c). We also included global small\u2010EV purification methods such as ExoEasy, N\u00f6rgen Exosome kit, ExoQuick, and ultracentrifugation, as comparative controls. RT\u2010qPCR data of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a, spiked into serum by comparison to RNase\u2010free 1\u00d7PBS, suggests RNA degradation as Comparative Threshold detection (Ct) values increased from 10 to 22 in our control (See Figure\u00a02b, First black bar). However, globally, all methods and especially all magnetic\u2010beads selected for these analyses, demonstrated non\u2010specific purification of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a as Ct values ranged between 26\u201334, with the highest Ct values for ultracentrifugation (Ct\u00a0=\u00a035) and CD63+ EV\u2010CATCHER with a Ct of 38. These experiments further highlight the non\u2010specific capacity of magnetic\u2010beads to bind small\u2010RNAs, even when conjugated to their small\u2010EV purification antibody. Considering that small\u2010RNAs, protected from degradation in serum, can be found in small\u2010EVs, we then sought to determine if magnetic\u2010beads could also non\u2010specifically bind small\u2010EVs, and further increase small\u2010RNA non\u2010specific signal (Figure\u00a02d.). For these experiments we used the same four different commercial magnetic\u2010beads as described in Figure\u00a02b., since all other magnetic bead\u2010based methods came pre\u2010manufactured with capture antibodies targeting small\u2010EV surface markers (anti\u2010Tim4 antibody for MagCapture and antiCD63 antibody for other methods; See Figure\u00a02a.), which would interfere with our measures. We chose to perform RT\u2010qPCR detection of hsa\u2010miR\u201021 and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c, which we previously measured by small\u2010RNA sequencing in RNA extracts of small\u2010EVs from MCF\u20107 cells. The schematic displayed in Figure\u00a02d describes how we measured these two miRNAs: 1\u2010 for non\u2010specific binding to the platforms (wells (EV\u2010CATCHER) or magnetic\u2010beads) by elution after 3 washes, and 2\u2010 by measuring the amounts of these miRNAs remaining in solution after non\u2010specific capture. Considering that commercially purified MCF\u20107 small\u2010EVs likely underwent damage during processing, we expected free hsa\u2010miR\u201021 and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c in the small\u2010EV aliquoted solutions and thus pre\u2010treated all reactions with RNase\u2010A, so to only measure these small\u2010EV bound hsa\u2010miR\u201021 and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c (See Figure\u00a02d compare grey and black bars in all graphs). For non\u2010specific capture of small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a02d left graphs top and bottom), we observed that EV\u2010CATCHER and ExoCap provided the lowest detection of hsa\u2010miR\u201021 and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c and thus non\u2010specific capture of small\u2010EVs, by comparison to the three other magnetic\u2010bead purifications. Comparatively, when measuring the amounts of hsa\u2010miR\u201021 and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c remaining from the initial small\u2010EV solutions, we determined that EV\u2010CATCHER had the most amount of both miRNAs (See Figure\u00a02d right graphs top and bottom), and confirmed the low\u2010binding properties of the streptavidin coated 96 well\u2010plates used with our method. It is important to note that a portion of non\u2010specifically bound small\u2010EVs are removed during the three standard 1xPBS washes from the magnetic beads, and account for quantifiable losses that as previously identified by qPCR (see Supplementary Figure 2). We also observed that adding BSA (1%) lowered non\u2010specific capture of small\u2010EVs by all magnetic bead\u2010based methods, but the wells still retained the lowest amounts of small\u2010EVs as indirectly quantified by qPCR (See Supplementary Figure 3). Additionally, we performed an extensive evaluation of the small\u2010EVs purified by all 12 different methods (8 methods by immuno\u2010capture including EV\u2010CATCHER, 2 column\u2010based capture, ExoQuick, and Ultracentrifugation) using Western blotting and evaluated small\u2010EV proteins that included CD63, CD9, and CD81, as well as contaminant proteins that included Albumin, and both lipoproteins ApoA1 and ApoB (Figure\u00a02e.). Small amounts of ApoA1 and Albumin were detectable after EV\u2010CATCHER purification, however lower than with most commercial methods. We quantified the number and size of the small\u2010EVs purified from human serum by CD63+ EV\u2010CATCHER and 6 other methods (MagCapture CD63+, ExoFlow CD63+, ExoEasy, the N\u00f6rgen exosome purification kit, ExoQuick, and ultracentrifugation). Our analyses revealed the highest number of particles for ExoQuick and the N\u00f6rgen kits as anticipated, with particles of larger size due to bulk small\u2010EV purification (See Figure\u00a02f). EV\u2010CATCHER (enzymatic release of small\u2010EVs) appeared to release more small\u2010EVs than ExoFlow or MagCapture (See Figure\u00a02f). Finally, using TEM we evaluated the size and morphology of the small\u2010EVs purified from human serum and released by EV\u2010CATCHER and 3 other commercial methods including ExoCap, ExoFlow, Dynabeads, and including Ultracentrifugation as a control (Figure\u00a02\u00a0g). Altogether, our data show that EV\u2010CATCHER along with ExoFlow and ExoCap provided high\u2010quality small\u2010EVs. However, due to the non\u2010specific capture of small\u2010RNAs and small\u2010EVs by all magnetic bead\u2010based methods as measured in Figure\u00a02b. and\u00a02c., we selected streptavidin\u2010coated 96\u2010well plates for all subsequent experiments for immuno\u2010purification of small\u2010EVs, using the EV\u2010CATCHER assay.FIGURE 2Identification of a low\u2010background binding platform and comparison to 11 existing small\u2010EV purification methods. a.\u00a0Diagram comparing EV\u2010CATCHER to 10 commercially available kits and ultracentrifugation for purification of small\u2010EVs.

Evaluation of non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA binding to four commercially different customizable magnetic beads (130\u00a0nm to 4.5 \u03bcm diameter), including both streptavidin\u2010coated (3 methods) and Carboxyl\u2010coated beads (1 method), by comparison to wells used for the EV\u2010CATCHER assay. A 1xPBS solution containing 100 pg ath\u2010miR\u2010159a RNA oligonucleotide was incubated with wells (1\u2010 EV\u2010CATCHER in triplicate) or the four different types of customizable magnetic\u2010beads (2\u2010 MojoSort, 3\u2010 Carboxyl\u2010Dynabeads, 4\u2010 ExoCap, 5\u2010 Streptavidin\u2010coated Dynabeads) in triplicate. Wells and magnetic\u2010beads were washed 3 times and the eluted RNA was quantified by RT\u2010qPCR (Left graph). Two additional conditions were tested to prevent non\u2010specific binding of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a including a pre\u2010treatment with BSA (1%) (middle graph), and a combined pre\u2010treatment with BSA (1%) and RNase\u2010A (12.5 \u03bcg/ml) (Right graph). c.\u00a0Evaluation of non\u2010specific binding of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a as a contaminant in 100 \u03bcl of human serum for all 10 commercial kits (#2 to #11) and the ultracentrifugation method (#12). All magnetic\u2010bead kits were tested in their \u2018Exosome\u2019 purification commercial forms with antibodies on their surface (anti\u2010Tim4 for Fujifilm and CD63 for all other techniques) and compared to anti\u2010CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER (#1). Following manufacturer's instructions, small\u2010EVs were eluted and RNA was extracted prior to RT\u2010qPCR quantification of ath\u2010miR\u2010159a. All experiments were repeated three times. The averaged comparative thresholds (Ct) values are added above the standard deviation bars in the graph, for each commercial kit and method. d.

The experimental collection of non\u2010specifically bound small\u2010EVs or small\u2010EVs remaining in solution after non\u2010specific capture with EV\u2010CATCHER and the 4 magnetic bead\u2010based commercial kits is displayed in the schematic (above). RNase A (12.5 \u03bcg/ml) was added prior to all experiments, to remove free\u2010floating miRNAs (Compare grey bars to black bars in all graphs).

Reproducibility and sensitivity of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay for purification of small\u2010EVs from biological fluidsFor these proof\u2010of\u2010principle experiments, we used an anti\u2010CD63 antibody for purifications performed with the EV\u2010CATCHER assay and thus evaluated CD63+ small\u2010EVs from three different biological sources (tissue culture media of a human cell line (MCF\u20107), human plasma, and human serum) (Figure\u00a03). We performed these purifications in the presence of decreasing amounts of total protein inputs (quantified by Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer) and evaluated the reproducibility of the CD63 purifications by Western blotting, using anti\u2010Alix, \u2010CD63, \u2010CD9 and \u2010CD81 antibodies for protein expression in the small\u2010EV elutions (Figure\u00a03a). Small\u2010EV purification from serum was performed with a single volume of 100 \u03bcl, due to limited availability. We also evaluated the presence of protein contaminants including ApoB, Albumin, and ApoA1 by Western blotting of small\u2010EVs purified from MCF\u20107 small\u2010EVs (SBI), human plasma, and human serum (Figure\u00a03b). We then used transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure\u00a03c) to reveal the presence of intact small\u2010EVs with size and morphology consistent between the different purifications (Williams et\u00a0al., 2013). Finally, using a Spectradyne nCS1 nanoparticle tracker we evaluated the size distribution of the CD63+ purified and released small\u2010EVs, which revealed the presence of nanoparticles with sizes ranging between 65\u2013150\u00a0nm for small\u2010EVs from MCF\u20107 cell media (3.30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 particles/ml), human plasma (6.93\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 particles/ml, and human serum (2.27\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 particles/ml) by comparison to UNG digested Ab\u2010DNA linker from the wells incubated with 1x PBS (Figure\u00a03d). Collectively these analyses revealed uniform reproducibility of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay for purifying small\u2010EVs from different biofluids using an anti\u2010CD63 antibody, with specificity provided by the selection antibody (Supplementary Figure 4).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Evaluation of small\u2010EV purification reproducibility using EV\u2010CATCHER with different biological fluids. a.\u00a0Western blot evaluation of small\u2010EV surface markers using anti\u2010Alix, \u2010CD63, \u2010CD9, and \u2010CD81 antibodies.

Small\u2010RNA sequencing using RNA extracted from CD63+ small\u2010EVs purified with EV\u2010CATCHERConsidering that our previous small\u2010RNA sequencing experiments using total RNA extracted from small\u2010EVs purified from serum with unconjugated magnetic beads (Supplementary Figure 1) indicated the presence of high small\u2010RNA background, we sought to evaluate the specificity of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay using the same small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparation protocol (Loudig et\u00a0al., 2017; Loudig et\u00a0al., 2018). As an initial test we validated the applicability of our cDNA library preparation protocol to the detection of circulating small\u2010RNAs using decreasing amounts of total RNA extracted from whole serum (Figure\u00a04a). Duplicate experiments demonstrated the reproducibility of our sequencing pipeline with small\u2010amounts of circulating small\u2010RNA. Next, we compared small\u2010RNA sequencing data of total RNA extracted from whole plasma (same human plasma as the one detailed in Figure\u00a03) or from small\u2010EVs ultracentrifuged from human plasma (Supplementary Figure 5) and identified specific miRNA expression differences (Figure\u00a04b), which further corroborated that the RNA extraction method influences the expression output (El\u2010Khoury et\u00a0al., 2016). As a measure of control, we validated detectability of specific small\u2010RNA expression differences between mouse cell culture and human plasma small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a04b). Finally, we sought to determine if we could specifically select a sub\u2010population of small\u2010EVs from a biofluid using EV\u2010CATCHER. For these experiments we chose to spike human plasma with commercial mouse RAWS264.7 small\u2010EVs (SBI). We customized the EV\u2010CATCHER assay with an anti\u2010mouse CD63 antibody, without cross\u2010reactivity to human CD63, and carried out the purification of CD63+ mouse small\u2010EVs from human plasma. For sensitive evaluation of the purified miRNA cargos, we used our cDNA library preparation protocol and sequenced the small\u2010RNA content of the selected small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a04c). For these experiments, all libraries were duplicated using fresh (Repeats #1, 3 years old) and older (Repeats #2, 6 years old) 3\u2032 barcoded adapters to accentuate inherent variabilities of the cDNA library preparation protocol. As observed in Figure\u00a04c, small\u2010RNA expression data from mouse CD63+ small\u2010EVs (columns III and IV) captured from human plasma using the EV\u2010CATCHER assay contained mouse\u2010specific small\u2010RNA sequences (Tags), identified solely in mouse RAWS264.7 small\u2010EVs (columns V and VI). We also noted that miRNAs differentially detected in total RNA from whole human plasma (Figure\u00a04c, columns I and II) were not detected within our mouse CD63+ small\u2010EVs purified by EV\u2010CATCHER (Figure\u00a04c, columns III and IV). Interestingly, some miRNA expression differences were noted between total RNA from RAWS264.7 small\u2010EVs (representing a pool of all small\u2010EVs present in the sample; Figure\u00a04c, columns V and VI) and total RNA extracted from CD63+ small\u2010EVs (representing a subset of all small\u2010EVs; Figure\u00a04c, columns III and IV), which represented specific miRNAs from non\u2010captured CD63\u2013 mouse RAWS264.7 small\u2010EVs. These next\u2010generation sequencing experiments demonstrate the reproducible detection of circulating small\u2010RNAs and specificity of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay for antibody\u2010based selected capture of a CD63+ small\u2010EV subpopulation from biofluids.3.5. MiRNA analysis of small\u2010EVs purified from the serum of mildly and severely ill Covid\u201019 patientsThe location of our institute and its parent hospital network within the early U.S. epicentre of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic, afforded us with the unique opportunity to explore pressing biological questions and further investigate the potential clinical utility of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay for identification of miRNA biomarkers in serum samples from Covid\u201019 patients admitted within our network. An important question with Covid\u201019 infection (which has been associated with a wide range of patient outcomes) was to evaluate if circulating miRNA expression changes could be useful for early identification of patients at risk of severe disease. As such we established our first pilot study where we purified circulating CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ small\u2010EVs, a subset of small\u2010EVs positive for these tetraspanins and of all small\u2010EVs, from the serum of mildly and severely affected hospitalized Covid\u201019 patients (serum collection at time of hospitalization) and evaluated their miRNA expression content by next\u2010generation sequencing. For this proof\u2010of\u2010principle study, we chose to use a combination of anti\u2010CD63, \u2010CD81, \u2010CD9 antibodies for capture of small\u2010EVs from whole serum. To measure the sensitivity of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay we measured miRNA expression differences between mildly and severely ill patients using total RNA extracted from circulating small\u2010EVs (EV\u2010CATCHER) by comparison to total RNA from whole serum. Mildly ill patients (n\u00a0=\u00a013) were hospitalized but did not require mechanical ventilation while severely ill patients (n\u00a0=\u00a017) displayed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS; following Berlin classification standards (El\u2010Khoury et\u00a0al., 2016)) and required mechanical ventilation, and both groups had PCR\u2010confirmed infection with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus. Clinical data was obtained from these patients (Supplementary Table 1). Small\u2010RNA cDNA libraries were prepared with 15 individual samples from RNA extracted from serum small\u2010EVs (30 samples; 2 libraries) or from whole serum (30 samples; 2 libraries) with each library having even representation of mild and severe RNA samples, to minimize batch effects. Our expression analyses identified 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between mild and severe sample groups using total RNA from CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ small\u2010EVs purified from serum with EV\u2010CATCHER (Figure\u00a05a; hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.00041), hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.0024), hsa\u2010miR\u2010424 (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.00454), hsa\u2010miR\u2010151\u20103p (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.012), hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20105p (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.00017), hsa\u2010miR\u2010627\u20105p (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.011), hsa\u2010miR\u2010145 (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.015), hsa\u2010miR\u2010205 (0.00049), and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.01)) whereas only two differentially expressed miRNAs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between mild and severe sample groups were identified when using total RNA from whole serum (Figure\u00a05a; hsa\u2010miR\u2010550\u20105p (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.026), hsa\u2010miR\u2010629* (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.0088)). As shown in Figure\u00a05b, the 10 differentially expressed miRNAs from CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ small\u2010EVs purified by EV\u2010CATCHER, between the two groups appeared in low abundance but reproducibly detectable. We established an integrative miRNA signature using the 10 differentially expressed miRNAs detected in serum small\u2010EVs between mild and severe patients (Figure\u00a05c). Evaluation of this signature between the two different small\u2010EV small\u2010RNA libraries (i.e. 15 samples per library) validated expression differences observed between mild and severe sample groups (Figure\u00a05c). Interestingly, when we evaluated this integrative miRNA signature for both CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ serum small\u2010EVs and whole sera (Figure\u00a05d), we confirmed the significant difference between mild and severe sample groups in serum purified small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a05d, p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a02e\u201007) but also surprisingly in whole sera (p\u2010val\u00a0=\u00a00.011), where these 10 miRNAs individually did not display expression differences between the two patient groups. Finally, we utilized gold\u2010standard quantitative RT\u2010qPCR approach to evaluate the top 4 differentially expressed miRNAs identified in serum small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a05e). In order to enable full technical validation of our findings, we activated fresh anti\u2010CD63, \u2010CD81 and \u2010CD9 antibodies, which had been initially used for purification of serum small\u2010EVs, and prepared fresh small\u2010EV purifications using EV\u2010CATCHER from the same 30 whole sera samples (mild n\u00a0=\u00a013, severe n\u00a0=\u00a017) and extracted total RNA again. Using TaqMan\u00ae assays we evaluated expression differences of hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a, hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010205 and successfully validated the top two differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a (pval\u00a0=\u00a00.0023) and hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p (0.036)) (Figure\u00a05e, top two box plots). To evaluate a possible reason for the lack of validation (p\u2010val\u00a0>\u00a00.05) for the two other miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p and hsa\u2010miR\u2010205), we calculated the mean of the Ct values for qPCR reactions on the 30 specimens for all 4 miRNAs. We observed that only the two miRNAs with the lowest Ct values (most expressed) could be validated (Figure\u00a05e top box plots, see Ct values), whereas the two with the highest Ct values could not be validated, which suggested that these miRNA transcripts were below qPCR detection thresholds. Altogether, our sequencing analyses demonstrated that the purified subset of small\u2010EVs harbouring \u2010CD63, \u2010CD81 and \u2010CD9 tetraspanins, purified from serum, contain low\u2010abundance specific miRNA transcripts that can be captured using the EV\u2010CATCHER assay and be validated by qPCR for the most abundant transcripts. Our analyses also suggest a differential miRNA expression between CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ serum small\u2010EVs from mildly and severely ill Covid\u201019 hospitalized patients, which will require further evaluation.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5The EV\u2010CATCHER assay allows for identification of miRNA expression differences between total RNA from small\u2010EVs and whole serum. a.\u00a0Individual box plot analyses of the 10 differentially expressed miRNAs identified from total RNA extracted from CD63+/CD9+/CD81+ small\u2010EVs purified from serum with EV\u2010CATCHER (green square; hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a, hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010424, hsa\u2010miR\u2010151\u20103p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010627\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010145, hsa\u2010miR\u2010205, and hsa\u2010miR\u2010200c) and 2 differentially expressed miRNAs identified from total RNA from whole serum (orange square; hsa\u2010miR\u2010550\u20105p, hsa\u2010miR\u2010629*) of the same mildly and severely ill Covid\u201019 hospitalized patients (first set of Covid\u201019 serum samples), by next\u2010generation small\u2010RNA sequencing. b.

Small\u2010EVs purified from convalescent sera with EV\u2010CATCHER maintain neutralizing properties for in vitro analysesConsidering that our previous TEM analyses suggested that a large proportion of the small\u2010EVs released after EV\u2010CATCHER purification were intact, we sought to determine if small\u2010EVs purified from biofluids maintained their biological properties for in vitro analyses. For these proof\u2010of\u2010concept experiments, we established a second pilot study (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 convalescent serum sample set, second Covid\u201019 sample set), where we purified CD63+ circulating small\u2010EVs from sera of six individuals who had recently and fully recovered from SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (enrolled in the convalescent plasma study at HUMC and evaluated for anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by ELISA, targeting the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein as antigen (IgG)). Three of the serum samples were obtained from individuals with high anti\u2010spike IgG titers (High; as defined by positive signal detectable at\u00a0>\u00a010,000 fold dilution of sera) and 3 serum samples from individuals with anti\u2010spike IgG levels below limit of quantification (BLQ; not detectable) as shown in Figure\u00a06a. We used our EV\u2010CATCHER assay to purify CD63+ small\u2010EVs from the different serum samples and evaluated uniform purity between samples by Western blot analyses of ApoB, Alix, Albumin, ApoA1, CD9, CD63 and CD81 proteins (Figure\u00a06b). These experiments revealed homogeneous purification of small\u2010EVs between high anti\u2010spike IgG (Figure\u00a06b, lanes 1\u20133) and BLQ anti\u2010spike IgG sera (Figure\u00a06b, lanes 4\u20136). Next, using TEM we assessed the size, morphology, and integrity of the purified small\u2010EVs (Figure\u00a06c) from both high anti\u2010spike IgG and BLQ IgG serum samples after enzymatic release. The small\u2010EV size distribution was also evaluated by nanoparticle tracking (Figure\u00a06d) and revealed similar nanoparticle distributions between 65\u2013150\u00a0nm and similar quantities between high anti\u2010spike IgG (average concentration: 1.99\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 particles/ml) and BLQ anti\u2010spike IgG (1.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 particles/ml) serum small\u2010EVs. Then, we performed mNeonGreen SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reporter virus (viral replication results in production of measurable green fluorescent protein signal) infection and propagation using gold standard Vero E6, African green monkey kidney cells, which harbour high\u2010levels of the ACE\u20102 receptor (Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2020), to evaluate the neutralizing properties of the different sera and small\u2010EVs purified from serum (Figure\u00a06e) (Ng et\u00a0al., 2003; Xie et\u00a0al., 2020; Yamate et\u00a0al., 2005). Treatment of VeroE6 cells with whole convalescent sera from individuals with high anti\u2010spike IgG titers, prior to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, resulted in neutralization of the virus (Figure\u00a06e, High IgG), which was not observed when using whole sera from individuals with BLQ IgG titers (Figure\u00a06e, BLQ IgG). In order to evaluate potential neutralizing properties of circulating small\u2010EVs, we initially obtained highly\u2010purified small\u2010EVs by the gold\u2010standard ultracentrifugation (UC) approach (Supplementary Figure 6) (Burkova et\u00a0al., 2019). In order to prevent serum IgG carry\u2010over, we performed successive ultracentrifugation steps and washes, which we estimated resulted in a \u223c1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u2010fold dilution of the initial sera (Figure\u00a06e; 1 high, 1 BLQ). Our experiments revealed that Vero E6 cells pre\u2010treated with small\u2010EVs purified by UC from a high anti\u2010spike IgG titer serum sample lead to a similar neutralization of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus (Figure\u00a06e, third column) as to that observed with whole sera treatment, whereas cells treated with small\u2010EVs purified by UC from the BLQ anti\u2010spike IgG titer serum sample displayed no neutralizing effect on the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus (Figure\u00a06e, fourth column). To confirm that the observed neutralizing effect was solely due to small\u2010EVs and not carry\u2010over IgG, we subjected the purified small\u2010EVs (at different steps of the centrifugation/ultracentrifugation and washes) to our ELISA test for detection of anti\u2010spike IgG (Supplementary Figure 7) and found that there was no detectable IgG in the final product of the UC experiment. Our data suggested that the neutralization of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus in vitro was attributable to small\u2010EVs purified by UC from the high anti\u2010spike IgG titer sera. Next, we sought to determine if intact small\u2010EVs purified using our EV\u2010CATCHER assay could reproduce the neutralization observed with small\u2010EVs purified by UC from high anti\u2010spike IgG sera, but not from BLQ anti\u2010spike IgG sera, in vitro. First, we evaluated that our EV\u2010CATCHER assay similarly to UC provided pure small\u2010EVs, and subjected small\u2010EVs purified from high\u2010 and low\u2010 anti\u2010spike IgG sera to our ELISA assay. We determined that no detectable anti\u2010spike IgG was purified with the small\u2010EVs (Supplementary Figure 7). Our analyses of Vero E6 cells treated with small\u2010EVs purified with anti\u2010CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER from high anti\u2010spike IgG titer sera (Figure\u00a06f. samples 1\u20133) showed a similar neutralizing effect against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in vitro, as to that observed with small\u2010EVs purified by UC from high anti\u2010spike IgG titer serum but not from BLQ anti\u2010spike IgG serum (Figure\u00a06f. samples 4\u20136). These neutralizing observations were further validated by the differential detection of fluorescent viral particles by imaging (Figure\u00a06\u00a0g). Although these unexpected data are suggestive of neutralizing properties for circulating small\u2010EVs purified from convalescent sera with high anti\u2010spike IgG titers, the mechanism of action remains to be identified. As further inquiry on small\u2010EV viral neutralization, we also evaluated small\u2010EVs purified from mildly and severely ill patients (from our first cohort of Covid\u201019 serum samples obtained at an early stage of the infection by comparison to convalescent serum for the second Covid\u201019 serum sample cohort). Our analyses of CD63+ small\u2010EVs purified with anti\u2010CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER from 6 mildly ill and 6 severely ill patients indicated no neutralization of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus in\u2010vitro (Supplementary Figure 8), suggesting that small\u2010EVs with viral neutralizing properties may be acquired at a later stage of the immune response, as observed when using convalescent serum but requiring further investigation. However, our analyses demonstrate that circulating small\u2010EVs purified from Covid\u201019 convalescent sera and enzymatically released by the EV\u2010CATCHER assay maintain their neutralizing property comparably to that observed with small\u2010EVs obtained by ultracentrifugation from one of the convalescent serum samples.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 6The EV\u2010CATCHER assay releases functional small\u2010EVs. a.\u00a0Six convalescent serum samples (Second set of covid\u201019 serum samples) distributed in two groups based on presence of immunoglobulins (IgG) targeting the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein as antigen.

Scale bars on images was at 500 \u03bcM 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONIn this study we developed the EV\u2010CATCHER assay, a sensitive, customizable antibody\u2010based extracellular vesicle purification procedure. We applied it to the high\u2010throughput identification of small\u2010RNA cargos from small\u2010EVs of a first set of serum samples, and evaluated the intact and functional release of purified small\u2010EVs from a second set of serum samples.A significant issue for identification of circulating miRNA biomarkers is the inherent high\u2010level of surrounding miRNA noise, which results in the \u201cdampening\u201d of their signal in biofluids, especially for the detection of miRNA expression changes by next\u2010generation sequencing from a population of cells within a large organism (Williams et\u00a0al., 2013). The evaluation of circulating small\u2010EVs provides a unique opportunity to evaluate compartmentalized miRNA cargos released by specific cells, however, current laboratory\u2010based technologies have major caveats (Larssen et\u00a0al., 2017; L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017; Ludwig et\u00a0al., 2018; Mac\u00edas et\u00a0al., 2019; Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Pugholm et\u00a0al., 2015; Yu et\u00a0al., 2018). To address these limitations, we optimized the EV\u2010CATCHER assay with the intent of minimizing RNA background/noise during small\u2010EV purification and identified a streptavidin\u2010coated 96\u2010well plate as our binding platform, as we determined by extensive comparisons with commercially available purification kits where our analyses revealed that magnetic beads capture small\u2010RNAs and small\u2010EVs non\u2010specifically and in turn interfere with downstream molecular analyses. Furthermore, using our optimized small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparation protocol, we demonstrated the specificity of EV\u2010CATCHER, for purifying species\u2010specific small\u2010EVs, by sequencing total RNA extracted from mouse CD63+ small\u2010EVs selectively purified from human plasma that was initially spiked with mouse RAWS264.7 total small\u2010EVs. These data strongly suggest a significant potential for use of the EV\u2010CATCHER assay by selection of small\u2010EV subpopulations and identification of circulating small\u2010RNA biomarkers.Thus, we proposed that a focused selection of encapsulated small\u2010RNA biomarkers circulating in small\u2010EVs may allow for fine\u2010tuned detection of low\u2010abundance RNA transcripts, due to background noise reduction. Considering that our research institute and its parent institution were located within the early U.S. epicentre of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic, and that no molecular studies evaluated predictive biomarkers for risk of severe disease from Covid\u201019 serum specimens, we sought to apply EV\u2010CATCHER, in a proof\u2010of\u2010principle study, to a first set of serum samples obtained from Covid\u201019 hospitalized patients with active infections. Our data analyses of small\u2010EVs purified from the serum of newly infected and hospitalized Covid\u201019 patients strongly support the principle that circulating small\u2010EVs may provide access to encapsulated low\u2010abundance miRNA biomarkers not significantly detectable from total RNA obtained from whole serum. Indeed, small\u2010RNA sequencing analyses performed on a circulating subset of CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ small\u2010EVs, purified by EV\u2010CATCHER, allowed identification of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs between mildly and severely ill Covid\u201019 hospitalized patients, which were not detectable as significantly differentially expressed with small\u2010RNA from whole sera (first Covid\u201019 serum sample set). Interestingly, when we evaluated these 10 miRNAs as an integrative miRNA signature using whole sera miRNA expression sequencing data, we then found that we could discriminate the two patient groups (integrated p\u2010val\u00a0>\u00a00.0011). These observations reinforce the idea that inherent miRNA expression differences detectable from encapsulated small\u2010EVs are dampened when evaluated within a whole\u2010biofluid, and further demonstrate the need for focused evaluation of specifically purified small\u2010EVs for discovery of low\u2010expressed potentially robust and clinically relevant miRNA biomarkers. Considering that qPCR remains one of the gold\u2010standards for detection of RNA transcripts in clinical assays, it is important to note that it had significant limitations when working with total RNA extracted from circulating small\u2010EVs purified from small serum sample volumes (100 \u03bcl). For example, during qPCR validations of our findings using this first Covid\u201019 serum sample set, we observed that the top two differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a and hsa\u2010miR126\u20103p) retained statistical significance between the two patient groups (mild vs. severe), whereas hsa\u2010miR\u2010205 and hsa\u2010miR126\u20105p lost significance with comparative detection thresholds \u223c38\u201039 amplification cycles. These evaluations would suggest that the detection of low abundance biomarkers will require; 1\u2010 the use of more cell\u2010specific antibodies for the selective enrichment of small\u2010EV sub\u2010populations, 2\u2010 larger biofluid material inputs, and 3\u2010 a pre\u2010amplification step to improve qPCR detection thresholds.Our comparative CD63+/CD81+/CD9+ small\u2010EV (subset of all small\u2010EVs) miRNA expression analyses between Covid\u201019 mildly affected (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and severely ill hospitalized patients (n\u00a0=\u00a017), who required mechanical ventilation (first set of clinical specimens), allowed for identification and qPCR validation of two downregulated miRNAs, hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a and hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p. Although on a small\u2010scale these data suggest that downregulated expression of these miRNAs may be associated with severity of the Covid\u201019 infection in these patients. Interestingly, previous studies implicated both of these miRNAs as being immune and vascular regulatory miRNAs, associated with inflammation and injurious vascular events ( Alexandru et\u00a0al., 2020; Arroyo et\u00a0al., 2020; Benbaibeche et\u00a0al., 2020; Boldin et\u00a0al., 2011; Gao et\u00a0al., 2015; Taganov et\u00a0al., 2006). For example, studies by Taganov et\u00a0al. suggest that hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a is a molecular brake on inflammation (Taganov et\u00a0al., 2006). Studies on hsa\u2010miR\u2010126 revealed it to be a vascular miRNA, which regulates angiogenesis (Kuhnert et\u00a0al., 2008) in part via activation of VEGF signalling (Nicoli et\u00a0al., 2010). More precisely, studies demonstrated that exosomes, a specific population of small\u2010EVs, secreted by human endothelial progenitor cells were beneficial to lipopolysaccharide\u2010induced acute lung injury in mice, in part through the delivery of hsa\u2010miRNA\u2010126 (both hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p and hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20105p) into the injured alveolus (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2019). Although on a small\u2010scale, our observations that both hsa\u2010miR\u2010146a and hsa\u2010miR\u2010126\u20103p may be downregulated in severely ill COVID\u201019 hospitalized patients on mechanical ventilators, when compared to mildly ill hospitalized patients, are consistent with reported anti\u2010inflammatory and vascular health\u2010promoting properties of these regulators. These observations suggest that a larger\u2010scale evaluation of serum circulating small\u2010EVs from Covid\u201019 hospitalized patients may help identify prognostic circulating miRNAs, which could be useful to strategically improve clinical outcome.Although we developed EV\u2010CATCHER, a targeted EV purification assay, for the fine\u2010tuned discovery of small\u2010RNA biomarkers associated with disease, we also ensured it allowed intact release of these small\u2010EVs for subsequent in vitro molecular analyses, which may not preclude in vivo analyses as well. As such, we chose to include an enzymatically degradable DNA linker (modified from L\u00f6f et\u00a0al. 2017) between the capture antibody and our low non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA binding platform (L\u00f6f et\u00a0al., 2017). We used TEM and nanoparticle tracking experiments to evaluate the intact release and enrichment of size\u2010specific small\u2010EV sub\u2010populations. Considering that circulating small\u2010EVs have been implicated in the immune response during viral infections (Bedford et\u00a0al., 2020; Gu et\u00a0al., 2020; Jeon et\u00a0al., 2017; Urbanelli et\u00a0al., 2019; Yao et\u00a0al., 2018), with studies demonstrating that specific small\u2010EVs (exosomes) can harbour proteins that inhibit viral replication (e.g. against HIV (Khatua et\u00a0al., 2009)) or contain proteins that can induce B lymphocyte proliferation (e.g., exosomes released from Epstein\u2010Barr Virus (EBV) infected cells (Gutzeit et\u00a0al., 2014)), we tested the EV\u2010CATCHER assay to evaluate the potential role of circulating small\u2010EVs in viral neutralization of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. For these analyses, we used a second set of Covid\u201019 serum samples, which included convalescent serum samples from Covid\u201019 patients recovered from the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (i.e., no active viral infection) and that was independent from the first sample set that was tested for small\u2010RNA sequencing of purified small\u2010EVs. Our initial experiments showed that highly\u2010purified small\u2010EVs obtained by successive ultracentrifugations, from the serum of patients containing high anti\u2010spike IgG titers, exhibited neutralizing activity against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in vitro, whereas small\u2010EVs purified from the serum of patients with anti\u2010spike IgG titers below quantification level did not. We found that when using small\u2010EVs captured and released by the EV\u2010CATCHER assay from sera with high anti\u2010spike IgG titer, our in vitro analyses confirmed this small\u2010EV\u2010associated viral\u2010neutralizing activity, which again could not be observed with small\u2010EVs purified from sera with anti\u2010spike IgG titers below quantification level, or with small\u2010EVs purified by anti\u2010CD9/CD63/D81 EV\u2010CATCHER from patients at early stages of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (12 serum samples tested from the first set of Covid\u201019 samples; Supplementary Figure 8). Several biological mechanisms may be at play to exert this neutralizing activity. Some groups, for example, have demonstrated that small\u2010EVs can transport or harbour immunoglobulins, which may explain the strong association between CD63+ small\u2010EV neutralization and the presence of high neutralizing anti\u2010spike IgG titers, however, no anti\u2010spike IgG was detectable by ELISA in our small\u2010EV purifications either by ultracentrifugation or with the anti\u2010CD63 EV\u2010CATCHER assay (Burkova et\u00a0al., 2019; Huang et\u00a0al., 2018). Additional mechanisms of viral neutralization have also been proposed, which could include an indirect cloaking strategy wherein convalescent circulating small\u2010EVs of patients, who elicited an immune response, may bind to cells targeted by the virus and prevent viral re\u2010entry (Gu et\u00a0al., 2020), or a direct cloaking strategy where small\u2010EVs themselves may harbour host receptors for the viral spike protein (i.e. ACE2, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 receptor) to cloak viral particles and prevent their cellular re\u2010entry (Burkova et\u00a0al., 2019; Huang et\u00a0al., 2018; Wang et\u00a0al., 2020). Whereas the exact neutralizing mechanism of Covid\u201019 convalescent circulating small\u2010EVs requires further evaluation, our observation that small\u2010EVs isolated from high anti\u2010spike IgG titer sera possess anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 neutralizing activity has important implications for enhancement of convalescent plasma therapy or design of novel therapies. It is important to note that recent studies have demonstrated that immuno\u2010purified small\u2010EVs can maintain their functional properties (cellular uptake, signalling) with the purifying antibody attached to their surface (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020; Hardin et\u00a0al., 2018; Hisey et\u00a0al., 2018; Hong et\u00a0al., 2014; Patel et\u00a0al., 2019; Peterson et\u00a0al., 2015; Theodoraki et\u00a0al., 2018; Velandia\u2010Romero et\u00a0al., 2020). However, due to the possibility that some small\u2010EV functions may be compromised by antibody presence, for every new immuno\u2010purification protocol, it is necessary to initially evaluate their functionality by using small\u2010EVs purified by ultracentrifugation,\u00a0as controls.In summary, our proof\u2010of\u2010principle study demonstrates that in combination with a sensitive small\u2010RNA cDNA library preparation, our reproducible, customizable, and low non\u2010specific small\u2010RNA and small\u2010EV binding antibody\u2010based selection assay, EV\u2010CATCHER, can be successfully applied to the selective capture of small\u2010EVs. Interestingly, we found that our assay was generally more affordable (See Supplementary Table. 2) and that overall, it performed better than the majority of the 11 different small\u2010EV purification techniques assessed (displays low\u2010background, affords laboratory\u2010based customization, provides easy enzymatic release of intact small\u2010EVs) and more particularly it performed better than the 7 commercial magnetic bead\u2010based small\u2010EV purification kits. Based on its performance and sensitivity, EV\u2010CATCHER may help identify low\u2010expressed small\u2010RNAs encapsulated circulating biomarkers associated with disease, as suggested in previous small\u2010EV studies (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018; Lai et\u00a0al., 2018; Mathivanan et\u00a0al., 2010; Vallabhajosyula et\u00a0al., 2017). However, considering that the enzymatic release of the selected small\u2010EVs can only be performed once, due to remaining UNG activity present after elution, it may prevent use of a second antibody selection using EV\u2010CATCHER due to potential digestion of the uracylated DNA\u2010linker Thus, we propose that the addition of an initial ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation step may provide an intact bulk isolation of small\u2010EVs from a sample, which may subsequently be subjected to antibody selection(s) by EV\u2010CATCHER. This initial ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation step may also help decrease large\u2010sample volumes and thus prevent the use of multiple wells, where antibody\u2010capture is limited to 100\u2013200\u03bcl samples per well. But importantly, the 96\u2010plex format of our assay, may allow streamlined automation for the purification and evaluation of diverse sub\u2010populations of circulating small\u2010EVs (based on the specific antibodies), with significant prospect for sequential small\u2010EV sub\u2010population capture and analysis from a single biofluid sample.
