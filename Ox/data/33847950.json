{"title": "Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Proteins in the Archaea", "pubDate": "2021;2281:23-47.", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-0716-1290-3_2", "PMID": "33847950", "abstract": "Single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding proteins are found in all three domains of life where they play vital roles in nearly all aspects of DNA metabolism by binding to and stabilizing exposed ssDNA and acting as platforms onto which DNA-processing activities can assemble. The ssDNA-binding factors SSB and RPA are extremely well conserved across bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively, and comprise one or more OB-fold ssDNA-binding domains. In the third domain of life, the archaea, multiple types of ssDNA-binding protein are found with a variety of domain architectures and subunit compositions, with OB-fold ssDNA-binding domains being a characteristic of most, but not all. This chapter summarizes current knowledge of the distribution, structure, and biological function of the archaeal ssDNA-binding factors, highlighting key features shared between clades and those that distinguish the proteins of different clades from one another. The likely cellular functions of the proteins are discussed and gaps in current knowledge identified.", "author": [{"author": "Najwa Taib", "affiliation": ["Unit Evolutionary Biology of the Microbial Cell, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.", "Hub Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, Department of Computational Biology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."], "href": "/?term=Taib+N&cauthor_id=33847950"}, {"author": "Simonetta Gribaldo", "affiliation": ["Unit Evolutionary Biology of the Microbial Cell, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France."], "href": "/?term=Gribaldo+S&cauthor_id=33847950"}, {"author": "Stuart A MacNeill", "affiliation": ["Biomedical Sciences Research Complex, School of Biology, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK. stuart.macneill@st-andrews.ac.uk."], "href": "/?term=MacNeill+SA&cauthor_id=33847950"}], "refPMID": ["22976174", "12598368", "27838363", "14718065", "15159541", "10473346", "9242902", "22918586", "23070815", "19996105", "19942684", "19116208", "20515430", "19605351", "27217471", "9843941", "9757822", "21976728", "22719738", "30582424", "28777382", "8688087", "23487778", "10497247", "14676214", "16291661", "16923882", "18586938", "24050175", "22973163", "30212908", "24292079", "16176594", "23532412", "16969339", "17903038", "24244547", "20978540", "18801373", "22018741", "11971263", "11160923", "11526322", "12773373", "25367669", "20080104", "28074284", "26578575", "16181640", "14872062", "15673717", "30464174", "31168618", "22106294", "24744237"], "citedInPMID": ["33847950", "34355021", "34283091"], "body": ""}
