So far, more than 127 million cases were confirmed worldwide, with more than 2.7 million deaths [1]. Covid-19 typically affects respiratory tracts, leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory failure (ARF). [2] Morbidity and mortality related to Covid-19 are due to complications, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occur in up to 15% of cases. [3,4].The ratio of arterial (PaO2) to inspired (FiO2) partial pressure of oxygen (P/F ratio), is currently utilized to assess the severity of respiratory failure in patients with ARDS [5] and correlates to mortality rate [6], [7], [8]. P/F ratio has been recently proposed as a prognostic marker in Covid-19 [9,10]. However, P/F ratio may be poorly representative of the severity of hypoxemia in patients with ARDS [11,12] and does not consider the level of respiratory muscles effort and hyperventilation of hypoxemic patients and do not discriminate patients according to their degree of hypocapnia [13]. In addition, considerable evidence supports that alteration of ventilation perfusion rate assessed as pulmonary dead space fraction [14] or ventilatory ratio [3] are associated with mortality in ARDS [15] and severity of COVID-induced ARDS [3].In a seminal paper, Mays emphasized the axiom that PaO2 and arterial carbon dioxide tensions (PaCO2) are inversely related [16] and suggested that estimation of the severity of ventilation/perfusion mismatch may be optimized standardizing PaO2 for PaCO2 by using the formula: standardized PaO2 (STPaO2)\u00a0=\u00a01.66*PaCO2\u00a0+\u00a0PaO2 - 66.4 [17]. In the current pilot observational study we evaluated if substituting PaO2 with STPaO2 in calculating P/F ratio may better stratify patients according to outcome failure, defined as needs of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or death in patients with COVID-19. 2.\u2003Material and methodsThe Institutional Ethical Committee approved the study protocol and patients had to sign written informed consent before enrollment. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline [18].Patients were prospectively recruited in the period October 31th 2020-January 31th 2021 after admission to pulmonology wards of the following hospitals: IRCCS S.Orsola-Malpighi (Alma Mater University of Bologna); Policlinico Umberto I, (Sapienza University of Rome) and Central Hospital of Bolzano. Inclusion criteria were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay from either nasal or pharyngeal swabs, or lower respiratory tract aspirates); presence of consolidation and/or ground glass opacities at Chest X-ray and/or at computed tomography of lungs [19] and presence of acute respiratory failure. Acute respiratory failure was identified when pO2 was <60\u00a0mmHg at FiO2\u00a0=\u00a021%. [20] Exclusion criteria were needs of endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation before Pulmonology wards admission and history of chronic respiratory failure. For each study subject we collected clinical history, arterial blood gas analysis (ABGs) data (PaO2, PaCO2, pH, HCO3, FiO2) at hospital admission and at the time of admission to the Pulmonology Unit, respiratory supports applied throughout hospital stay and date of death or recovery from respiratory failure. PaO2 was standardized for PaCO2 by using the formula: standardized PaO2 (STPaO2)\u00a0=\u00a01.66*PaCO2\u00a0+\u00a0PaO2 - 66.4 [17]. P/F, STPaO2 and STP/F were calculated for each subject. For STP/F and P/F, we use data from ABG collected on the first day of admission in Pulmonology Unit with the study subject that had inspired oxygen at a fixed FiO2 for at least 10 minutes [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Occurrence of ARF, was identified when PaO2 was < 60\u00a0mmHg with FiO2\u00a0=\u00a00.21. Outcome failure was defined as needs of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or death. We also evaluated the relationship between duration of ARF and P/F and STP/F. Recovery from ARF occurred before pulmonology ward discharge of the study subjects. Duration of ARF was expressed in days from emergency room (ER) admission to the first day of recovery from ARF (subjects died during hospital stay were censored). End of follow-up for each study subject was fixed hospital stay discharge (for survivors) or date of death.Continuous variables are presented as mean value and standard deviation (\u00b1SD), median, minimum and maximum values. Categorical ones are expressed by frequencies and percentages. To define accuracy of PF and STPF to predict study outcomes we used the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and compared the area under curve (AUROC) deriving from the use of conventional P/F vs. STP/F ratio. Comparisons between AUROC of PF and STPF for the study outcomes were made by De Long's test [26] and Best threshold for the ROC analysis was calculated using the Youden index point [27]. Categorical variables were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or \u03c72-square test, when appropriate. Associations between parameters were calculated using Spearman correlation test. P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21. Using Buderer's formula, we empirically calculated a minimum sample size of 284 subjects to reach 70% of sensitivity and 70% of specificity [28]. In previous studies the average prevalence of outcome failure and mortality, respectively, were 43,7% and 19,6%. [[29], [30], [31], [32],]. 3.\u2003ResultsWe enrolled 349 consecutive patients. Characteristics of the study population and outcomes are described in Tables\u00a01\nA and \u200band1B.1B. Outcome failure was observed in 113 patients (32,4%) and 58 patients died (16.6%). Median survival was 18.5 days (range 4-65, mean 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4) and 13.0 days (range 0-65, mean 16.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3) calculated, respectively, from symptoms start to date of death and from ER admission to date of death. All deaths were caused by acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19. Median duration of ARF was 23 days (range 2-58, mean 21.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9).Table 1A \u2013 Characteristics of the study population and arterial blood gas analysis data at the time of Emergency Room (ER) admission.nTot.% of nMeanDSAge34969,2013,40Sex349Male23266,5%Female11733,5%Smoking277Never23584,8%Former/current4215,2%Comorbidities349Systemic arterial hypertension or Chronic Atrial fibrillation23968,5%Diabetes mellitus6919,8%Cerebrovascular\u00a0accidents\u00a0and/or\u00a0ischemic heart disease5816,6%Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma4512,9%Chronic kidney failure3510,0%Active neoplasm (or diagnosis <5 years)318,9%Obesity298,3%Immunodepression and/or autoimmune disease216,0%Venous thromboembolism72,0%Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)72,0%Interstitial lung disease20,6%Miscellaneous13939,8%\u22652 comorbidities34917249,3%Symptoms349Fever29183,4%Dyspnea22464,2%Cough15945,6%Dysgeusia/ageusia329,2%Anosmia3911,2%Diarrhea5214,1%Abdominal pain267,1%Headache369,8%Fatigue Mental confusion/delirium132 2935,9% 8,3%ER admissionFiO23490,240,11FiO2 > 0,21349257,2%SpO226091,85,9ABG/PaO2 and P/F available30888,3%ABG/PaO2, PaCO2 and P/F available30587,4%pH7,470,05PaO2 (mmHg)63,816,4STPaO2 (mmHg)50,618,5PaCO2 (mmHg)32,15,0HCO3- standard (mmol/L)24,03,2PF286,779,3STP/F225,880,5PF<2003083110,1%STP/F <20030511738,4%Days from symptoms start to ER admission6,12,0Days from symptoms start to Pulmonology Unit admission9,67,7Days from ER admission to Pulmonology Unit admission3,55,7Table\u00a01.

Age and Respiratory Rate at the time of admission were positively related with duration of ARF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Table 3Differences in terms of PaO2, PaCO2, standard PaO2 (STPaO2), P/F and STP/F by outcome failure and deaths in the study population (ANOVA).nMeanSDMinMaxp valueOutcome failurePaO2 (mmHg)no23687,326,350240yes11382,623,151200tot34985,725,450240.105PaCO2 (mmHg)no23635,64,92061yes11334,85,02355tot34935,55,02061.057STPaO2 (mmHg)no23680,427,830225yes11373,924,231183tot34978,326,830225.034P/Fno236209,184,360629yes113148,461,960357tot349189,482,760629.000STP/Fno236192,283,141623yes113131,155,749340tot349172,480,141623.000DeathsPaO2 (mmHg)no29186,725,450,0240,0yes5880,124,851,0200,0tot34985,725,450,0240,00.112PaCO2 (mmHg)no29135,84,920,061,0yes5834,35,326,055,0tot34935,55,020,061,0.037STPaO2 (mmHg)no29179,626,930,0225,0yes5871,425,431,0183,0tot34978,326,830,0225,0.032P/Fno291197,383,360,0629,0yes58149,967,560,0357,0tot349189,482,760,0629,0.000STP/Fno291181,081,741,0623,0yes58129,858,449,0306,0tot349172,480,541,0623,0.000Open in a separate windowTable 4Association between age, respiratory rate, PaO2, PaCO2, standard PaO2 (STPaO2), P/F, STP/F and ARF duration in days (Spearman's correlation)Duration of ARFAge Respiratory Rate PaO2 (mmHg)Correlation coefficient sig. n Correlation coefficient sig n Correlation coefficient0.136 0.061 191 0.286 0.000 172 -.022sig..764n191PaCO2 (mmHg)Correlation coefficient-.066sig..362n191STPaO2 (mmHg)Correlation coefficient-.040sig..583n191P/FCorrelation coefficient-.385sig..000n191STP/FCorrelation coefficient-.396sig..000n191Open in a separate window 4.\u2003DiscussionThe main finding of the current investigation is that accuracy of STP/F to predict death was higher than conventional P/F (0.710; 95% CI 0.638-0.782 vs. 0.688; 95% CI 0.650-0.846, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a02. Interestingly, STP/F is accurate and superior to P/F in predicting in-hospital mortality, but not outcome failure (defined as deaths or need of IMV), as if the need of IMV is not affected by STP/F or P/F values. STP/F can predict mortality in all patients of our study population.Mean PaCO2 of the study population was inferior to 40\u00a0mmHg, and mean respiratory rate was 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 breaths per minute (Table\u00a01B). This confirms the hypocapnic compensation of hypoxemia in Covid-19, mainly obtained by increase of tidal volume. Moreover, mean value of PaCO2 of the subgroup died for ARF due to Covid-19 was inferior to the one of the survivors subgroup (Table\u00a03), p\u00a0=\u00a00.037, as if low PaCO2 might suggest risk of further ARF worsening, even if AUROC curve of paCO2 is not enough accurate to predict outcome failure.Prevalence of never smokers in our study population was 85%; this reflects data emerged from literature about Covid-19 [[33], [34],]. Smoking can modulate immunity reducing its effectiveness. Thus could result in a less reactive inflammatory response during Covid-19, preventing the cytokine storm responsible of the progression of the disease in ARF due to Covid-19 and explain the lower prevalence of current or former smokers in Covid-19 reported studies. [[33], [34],]. We can speculate, in addition, that usually a fraction of current smokers or former smokers may be affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Having a respiratory chronic disease, COPD patient might have a more preventive social behavior strategy and respect strictly rules such as wearing masks and to respect physical distances. Moreover COPD patients could probably early recognize Covid-19 related respiratory symptoms and signs, leading them to have an early access to medical consultation and/or ER.According to our findings, STP/F better describes ARF due to Covid-19 in its hypocapnic nature. Using STPaO2 instead of PaO2 (standard P/F versus P/F) better describes this phenomenon and could better relate to prognosis, in particular in-hospital mortality.Defining all mechanisms responsible for ARF during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with one parameter is not simple, since pathophysiology of lung injury due to Covid-19 is multifactorial and the impact of every single compensatory mechanism varies between subjects and through the course of the disease. [35], [36], [37] In Covid-19, inflammation and oedema in alveoli are the main responsible of hypoxemia in the early phases of disease, so that P/F reasonably relate to severity of diffusing impairment here. With the progression of disease (consolidation phase), V/Q mismatch and shunt mechanism become prevalent, so that hypoxemic ARF becomes less responder to implementation of FiO2 due to incapacity to improve PaO2 in non-ventilated alveoli. In lung regions where shunt is prevalent, P/F could be not so representative of severity of the disease. [[38], [39],] Reducing partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) represents a protective mechanism: low values of PaO2 increase minute ventilation in response to chemoreceptor stimulation. Hyperventilation is a feedback mechanism to correct hypoxia at the expense of PaCO2 reduction and left shift of the HbO2 dissociation curve. In this way, tachypnea and hyperpnoea, generated by a rise of minute ventilation through increasing respiratory rate and tidal volume, compensate both hypoxemia and prevent blood acidosis [40].Notably, the presence of microvascular thrombosis in subjects with Covid-19 ARF, highlighted by the increase of D-dimer and alveolar dead space; may contribute to the severity and progression of hypoxia observed in Covid-19 [41]. Several data showed that outcome is related to dead space through measurement of ventilatory ratio in typical ARDS and in Covid-19 [3]. These measurements in subjects in spontaneous breathing are not obtainable, so that STPF could represent a surrogate of the ventilatory ratio.There is an urgent need to identify patients at higher risk of intubation and death, since de novo ARF plays a central role in Covid-19, being responsible for morbidity and mortality [4,42,43]. In addition, defining the best setting where to allocate patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia could play a central role in this emergency era for health care resources worldwide. Finding a parameter which could help clinicians to detect early which patient will need more resources, in particular the need of respiratory support and so Pulmonology Unit hospitalization, may optimize Covid-19 outcomes and improve costs-benefits ratio.This is the first study assessing the role of standard paO2 in relationship to prognosis in acute respiratory failure: this pilot study identifies STPF as a better predictor of mortality than PF in Covid-19 ARF. We propose the use of STP/F because, from a pathophysiological point of view, it better describes the compensatory mechanism present in hypoxemic ARF typical of Covid-19 and our study showed that is more accurate in discriminating prognosis. STPaO2 is a parameter obtainable simply in standard practice using a formula validated since years [17].Limits of this study are its observational nature and the short enrollment phase due to its pilot nature. Moreover it does not take into account patients with ARF due to Covid-19 admitted directly from ER to ICU; this could explain the relatively low outcome failure and mortality ratio seen in our study (respectively 32.4% and 16.6%). However, outcome failure, as defined by need for invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death, was online with previous literature describing patients outside ICU setting [[29], [30], [31], [32],]. Outcome failure results could be affected to the decision to start IMV according to PF value of the patient (for example a rapid decline of P/F), so that this could represent a bias of this study, while mortality is independent. To avoid selection bias we enrolled all consecutive patients with ARF due to Covid-19, all admitted at our Units managed by pulmonologists due to a worsening of their clinical condition. Maybe differences emerged from our pilot study are not enough to change the clinical practice, but it may be helpful in considering the pathophysiological features leading to the calculation of this index (P/F).Clinical use of STP/F as a predictor of in-hospital mortality could be used to allocate patients in the right setting. Enlarging sample size in an extension future study, and, if properly uniformed, considering uniformed ABGs at the time of ER admission, could better define the impact of using STP/F in hypoxemic Covid-19 ARF and its management. In addition, the prognostic significance of STP/F could be compared in future with other Covid-19 prognostic indices such as C-reactive protein, blood leukocyte count and D-dimer, simpler to obtain in clinical practice.More prospective studies are needed to validate the value of STP/F as a marker of outcome in Covid-19 and to define its severity cut-offs. In future, STP/F could also be studied in other ARF settings such as acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases and pneumonia due to other infectious agents than Covid-19.
