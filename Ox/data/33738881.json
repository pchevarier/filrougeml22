The data suggest that MSCs improved intestinal barrier function and reduced intestinal infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Further, depletion of intestinal bacterial communities with antibiotics significantly improved the therapeutic effects of MSCs.\n 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONSepsis\u2010related acute lung injury (ALI), the early pathophysiological change in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has a high mortality rate due to lack of effective therapies.\n1\n, \n2\n ALI/ARDS can progress to multiple organ failure, which is characterized by increased lung permeability, pulmonary oedema and infiltration of inflammatory cells.\n3\n, \n4\n Despite much research, the mortality rate is 36\u201044%,\n5\n and there is no effective therapeutic strategy.\n6\n\nA connection between the lungs and gut has been demonstrated in human and animal studies.\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n A disturbance in the intestinal bacterial communities will disrupt the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thereby increasing the risk of bacterial translocation, activating systemic immune system and aggravating immune damage to the lung.\n11\n For instance, stimulation of mouse lungs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes acute changes in the structure and function of intestinal microflora, resulting in bacterial and endotoxin translocation and eventually lung injury, which is an important factor that initiates ARDS.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n Under physiological conditions, the intestinal mucosal barrier, gut microbiota and their metabolites together form the intestinal microecology, which maintains in a dynamic balance.\n15\n However, the mechanism of how intestinal microflora changes affect lung injury during ARDS remains unclear. In addition, pneumonia induces intestinal injury and decreases the proliferation of gut mucosal epithelial cells.\n16\n The mechanisms are likely related to the local inflammatory factor microenvironment and the immune response.\n17\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are multipotent and immunoregulatory, have therapeutic potential in lung diseases.\n18\n They can repair LPS\u2010induced ALI, pneumonia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and systemic sepsis in animal models.\n7\n, \n19\n They protect against ALI by reducing inflammatory cytokine secretion, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and regulating T\u2010cell differentiation.\n20\n, \n21\n Importantly, systemic administration of MSCs affects the gut epithelium and significantly ameliorates intestinal mucosal inflammation.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n The gut epithelium functions as a protective barrier against LPS under normal conditions. Small\u2010intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are the first line of defence and are activated by inflammatory signals to eliminate infected epithelial cells.\n25\n The CD8+ T cells infiltrating IELs produce interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3), which is correlated with the severity of intestinal damage.\n26\n Moreover, the activation state of CD4+ T cells reflects the intestinal immune response.\n27\n However, the mechanisms of MSC and IEL recruitment are unclear. Although MSCs have an immunomodulatory effect in ALI,\n28\n, \n29\n we propose that they not only have an immunomodulatory effect but also alter the intestinal microbiome in a manner that promotes barrier integrity.In this study, we investigated the efficacy of MSCs in a mouse model of LPS\u2010induced ALI. Specifically, studies were done to investigate in greater detail the mechanisms by which MSCs may ameliorate the lung and intestinal injuries in ALI, including their effects on intestinal healing and faecal microbiome populations, as well as inflammation and immune response. The results indicate the important effects of MSCs on lung and gut healing by regulating the immune response of the lungs and intestines and gut microbiota, providing strong support for the use of MSCs as a uniform and sustainable source of cells for ALI therapy. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. AnimalsMale wild\u2010type 6\u2010 to 8\u2010week\u2010old C57 BL/6J mice were purchased from Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. The same specific pathogen\u2010free room was used to house all mice. All animal experimental procedures were conducted according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (No. 2015\u2010130).2.2. Animal model of LPS\u2010induced acute lung injuryLipopolysaccharide (derived from Escherichia coli 0111: B4, Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Poole, United Kingdom) was given intratracheally as a model of direct lung injury. The ALI model was induced by 20\u00a0mg/kg LPS as described previously,\n30\n and negative control mice received an equal volume of phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS; PBS group; n\u00a0=\u00a010). Four hours after LPS administration, mice with ALI were randomly divided into the LPS/PBS (n\u00a0=\u00a040) and LPS/MSC (n\u00a0=\u00a040) groups. MSCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice compact bone were characterized by induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation (Supplemental Materials and Methods) and analysed the surface marker expression using flow cytometry (Figure\u00a0S1). MSCs at passages 3\u20105 were used in subsequent experiments. MSCs (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105, 20\u00a0\u03bcl total volume) were intratracheally instilled into mice in the LPS/MSC group; the mice in the LPS/PBS group received an equal volume of PBS, while mice in the negative control group were injected with PBS (PBS group; n\u00a0=\u00a010). Mice in the LPS/MSC group were randomly selected and anaesthetized at day 1 (M1d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08), day 3 (M3d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and day 7 (M7d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08). Likewise, mice were randomly selected from the LPS/PBS group and anaesthetized at day 1 (L1d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08), day 3 (L3d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08) and day 7 (L7d group, n\u00a0=\u00a08). Mortality was recorded every 24\u00a0hours until 12\u00a0days post\u2010transplantation. To deplete gut bacterial communities, mice were treated with broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin 1\u00a0g/L, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China; neomycin sulphate 1\u00a0g/L, Sangon Biotech; metronidazole 1\u00a0g/L, Sangon Biotech and vancomycin 0.5\u00a0g/L, Sangon Biotech) in drinking water for 3\u00a0weeks as described.\n31\n Two days after cessation of the antibiotics, the mice were treated as described above.2.3. Mouse tissue collection and processingMice were sacrificed for removal of the lungs, small\u2010intestinal segments and cecum and colon contents. Portions of the lung and intestinal tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin to prepare paraffin\u2010embedded sections, and sliced into 5\u2010\u03bcm\u2010thick sections. Another set of mice was sacrificed. The lungs were washed three times with 800\u00a0\u00b5l ice\u2010cold PBS through a tracheal cannula as described previously,\n32\n and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected and centrifuged at 800\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was stored at \u221280\u00b0C for subsequent assay of cytokines and protein concentration, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl for cell counting and cell smear generation. The total protein content of BALF was quantified using the Pierce\u2122 BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc).2.4. Cytokine analysesBALF and small\u2010intestinal tissue homogenate supernatants were harvested and analysed for their contents of tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3), interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), IL\u20101\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 by bead\u2010based multiplex LEGENDplex\u2122 assay (Multi\u2010Analyte Flow Assay Kit, BioLegend, Koblenz, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.5. Lung and intestinal histologyFor histopathologic analyses, formalin\u2010fixed lung and ileum samples were paraffin\u2010embedded, sectioned (5\u00a0\u03bcm thickness) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The sections were evaluated by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to the group assignment. Images were scanned using a NanoZoomer 2.0\u2010RS scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) captured at a magnification of 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0or 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0using NDP.view.2 software (Hamamatsu Photonics KK).2.6. Isolation of pulmonary immune cells, IELs and PPsLung tissues were harvested, cut into 1\u00a0cm pieces, transferred to a gentleMACS C tube (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) containing an enzyme mixture (Mouse Lung Dissociation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec), homogenized and digested at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0minute. Pulmonary immune cells were obtained after density gradient centrifugation.Peyer's patch (PP) single\u2010cell suspensions were prepared by mashing the organs through 70\u2010\u03bcm cell strainers (JET Biofil, Guangzhou, China). Small\u2010intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were isolated as described previously.\n33\n Briefly, PPs were removed, and the small intestine was opened longitudinally and washed three times with Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Gibco, CA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Next, intestinal tissues were shaken in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5\u00a0mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Sangon Biotech) and 5% FBS at 175\u00a0rpm and 37\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. This step was repeated four times, and the supernatants were discarded. Pelleted cells were directly suspended in 5\u00a0ml 40% Percoll and overlaid onto 3\u00a0ml 70% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden); the cells layering between the 40% and 70% fractions were collected as IELs.2.7. Mass cytometry antibody stainingMass cytometry was used to evaluate the CD8+ T\u2010cell populations in mouse lung. Pulmonary immune cell suspensions were washed once in 1\u00a0ml staining buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.02% NaN3) and incubated with 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM cisplatin (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) on ice for 5\u00a0minute to label dead cells. Next, the cells were labelled with a mixture of metal isotope\u2010conjugated antibodies against cell surface markers for 30\u00a0minute on ice. Then, 0.03\u00a0\u03bcM Ir nucleic\u2010acid intercalator (Fluidigm) in Fix and Perm Buffer was added, and the cell suspensions were placed at 4\u00b0C overnight. The cells were washed twice and incubated with a metal isotope\u2010conjugated intracellular antibody cocktail for 30\u00a0minute on ice. The cells were resuspended in distilled water containing 20% EQ. 4 beads (Fluidigm) and acquired on a CyTOF instrument with a Helios system (Fluidigm) at 500 events per second.2.8. Flow cytometryThe single\u2010cell suspensions of IELs and PPs were stained using standard procedures for cell surface markers. The following monoclonal antibodies were used for flow cytometry: FITC\u2010CD45 (30\u2010F11; BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), BV395\u2010CD3e (145\u20102C11; BD), PECy7\u2010TCR\u03b3\u03b4 (GL3; BioLegend), BV605\u2010CD4 (RM4\u20105; BD), PerCPcy5.5\u2010CD8\u03b1 (53\u20106.7; BD), APC\u2010CD11b (M1/70; BD) and PE\u2010F4/80 (T45\u20102342). Dead cells were excluded using Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD). Flow cytometry analyses were performed using an LSR Fortessa (BD).2.9. DNA extractionFollowing homogenization of the mouse cecum and colon contents using glass beads in a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny, France), bacterial DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA extracts were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until use.2.10. 16S rRNA gene amplification and DNA sequencingBacterial community diversity was analysed via single\u2010molecule real\u2010time PacBio sequencing (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA).\n34\n, \n35\n The full\u2010length 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the bacteria\u2010specific primers 27 F (5\u2032\u2010AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and 1492 R (5\u2032\u2010TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT). The quality and concentration of the PCR products were determined via electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0\u2010SPv3 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pacific Biosciences).No sequences contained ambiguous bases. Details of the sequencing output, such as raw reads, clean reads and average read lengths, are summarized in supplemental Table\u00a0S1. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was performed using a 99% similarity cut\u2010off to represent one species per OTU. After sequencing data were rarefied, the alpha and beta diversities were calculated, and differences in relative abundance were compared using Statistical Analyses of Metagenomic Profiles (STAMP) software.2.11. Statistical analysesWe used the Kaplan\u2013Meier log\u2010rank test to compare survival between groups (GraphPad Prism 8). Two\u2010tailed, unpaired Student's t\u2010tests were performed for comparing two groups. Quantification of immunohistochemical assays was performed using National Institutes of Health image analysis software ImageJ bundled with 64\u2010bit Java 1.8.0_172. The alpha diversity, including the indexes of Shannon, Chao1 and observed species, was calculated using QIIME (Version 1.9.1). Unweighted uniFrac principal coordinates analysis and weighted uniFrac principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) were performed after rarefaction and log standardization of OTU table using R version 2.15.3 and the package stats and ggplot2. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was used to evaluate differences in overall microbiota composition between the groups using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size was utilized to evaluate differentially abundant bacterial taxa and predicted function between the animal groups. Data are presented as means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of the mean (SEM). We set three levels of statistical significance (*P\u00a0<.05; **P\u00a0<.01; ***P\u00a0<.001). 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. MSCs improve survival and attenuate lung injury in LPS\u2010induced ALI miceWe constructed a stable ALI mouse model via intratracheal injection of 20\u00a0mg/kg LPS. Mouse MSCs were characterized as shown in Figure\u00a0S1. The ALI mice were administered LPS; after 4\u00a0hours, MSCs or PBS was given orotracheally (Figure\u00a01A). To determine how MSCs ameliorate LPS\u2010induced ALI, mice were divided into three groups: PBS, LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups. Twelve days after LPS exposure, the survival rate in the LPS/MSC group was significantly greater than that in the LPS/PBS group (75% vs. 40%; P\u00a0<.05) (Figure\u00a01B). The degree of lung injury was assessed based on the lung histology (Figure\u00a01C), BALF total cell count (Figure\u00a01D) and BALF protein concentration (Figure\u00a01E). Diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltration and thickening of the alveolar walls and interstitium were evident in the LPS/PBS group. By contrast, the alveolar walls and interstitium were thinner and immune cell infiltration was reduced in the LPS/MSC group (Figure\u00a01C). Total cell count and total protein concentration in BALF were significantly reduced, by MSCs, confirming that these cells attenuate lung injury in LPS\u2010induced ALI mice (Figure\u00a01D and \u200band1E1E).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2010induced lung injury (ALI).

On days 1 and 3 after LPS treatment, many immune cells infiltrated the alveolar interstitium, which was thickened; by contrast, MSCs treatment reduced immune cell infiltration and alveolar interstitium thickness.

BALF total cell count peaked in the LPS/PBS group at day 1 and decreased at day 7 and was lower in the LPS/MSC group. The BALF protein concentration peaked at day 3 and decreased at day 7 in the LPS/PBS group and was markedly lower in the LPS/MSC group (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, n\u00a0=\u00a05 or 6). **P\u00a0<.01, ***P\u00a0<.001 by Student's t\u2010test3.2. MSCs reduce intestinal mucosal injury and improve intestinal barrier integrityStimulation of mouse lungs with LPS has been shown to alter microbial diversity and abundance, which plays a vital role in preventing the invasion of pathogenic bacteria and maintaining the immune homeostasis of the gut mucosa as a microbial barrier,\n16\n, \n36\n, \n37\n and therefore, we investigated intestinal barrier integrity in this study. Histological inspection of ileal mucosal tissues in the LPS/PBS group demonstrated villus atrophy and breakage, and intestinal epithelial destruction. In contrast, MSCs restored a normal villus length and muscular\u2010layer architecture (Figure\u00a02A). The microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells in the LPS/PBS group were sparse and shortened at day 1, and these changes were substantially ameliorated in the LPS/MSC group (Figure\u00a02B). We assayed the expression of the tight junction protein ZO\u20101 by immunohistochemistry staining and qPCR. Immunohistochemistry staining showed increased ZO\u20101 expression on the ileal membrane in the LPS/MSC group at day 1 (Figure\u00a02C and 2D). At days 1 and 3, the ZO\u20101 mRNA level in the LPS/MSC group was higher than that in the LPS/PBS group (Figure\u00a02E). At day 7, the structure of the gut gradually returned to that of normal in both LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups. Therefore, MSCs protected the intestinal epithelial barrier in LPS\u2010induced ALI mice in the early stages of the disease.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2MSCs improved intestinal barrier function.

MSCs attenuate lung and intestinal inflammation caused by LPSWe assayed the levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 in the lung and small intestine. LPS induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by increased IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 levels in BALF at days 1 and 3 compared with the PBS group (Figure\u00a03A). LPS also induced small\u2010intestinal inflammation: IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 levels in the small intestine were increased at days 1 and 3 (Figure\u00a03B), suggesting that LPS\u2010induced lung injury resulted in low\u2010grade gut inflammation. MSCs significantly alleviated the LPS\u2010induced inflammatory response in BALF. Similarly, intestinal inflammatory cytokine levels were downregulated to almost the level of the control in the LPS/MSC group. Therefore, MSCs attenuated tissue injury by inhibiting increased expression of cytokines in the lung and gut.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Therapeutic effects of MSCs on cytokines in the lung and gut in LPS\u2010induced acute lung injury. The IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106 concentrations were determined at days 1, 3 and 7 in the PBS, LPS/PBS, LPS/MSC groups by bead\u2010based multiplex LEGENDplex\u2122 assay.

Effects of MSC administration on lung and gut immunoregulationTo determine the effects of MSCs on immune responses in the lung and small intestine in ALI, we analysed CD45+ (lymphocyte common antigen) cells in LPS\u2010treated mice. CD8+ T cells in the lungs were analysed by mass cytometry using the reasonable gating strategy. The populations of CD3+ T cells and Ly6C+CD8+ T cells in lung immune compartments were significantly increased in the LPS/PBS group compared with the PBS group (Figure\u00a04A). In mice treated with MSCs, the populations of CD3+ T cells and Ly6C+CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced compared with LPS\u2010treated mice at day 7, and F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages were recruited to the injured lung in the LPS/MSC group at day 3 (Figure\u00a04B). Therefore, MSCs regulate systemic immunity by modulating the CD8+ T\u2010cell response and macrophage recruitment to the injured lung.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in the lung.

(B) Frequency of CD45+ immune cells in lung tissue at days 3 and 7 in the PBS, LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups.

Compared to the PBS group, the numbers of IELs and PPs were decreased in the LPS/PBS group and increased in the LPS/MSC group at day 1 (Figure\u00a05B). In addition, the population of CD8+ T cells in IELs was drastically increased, but that of CD4+ T and F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages was decreased, in the LPS/PBS group compared with the PBS group (Figure\u00a05C and 5D). MSCs restored the CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2013macrophage balance in ALI mice. By contrast, the changes in the CD8+ T\u2010cell populations in PPs were consistent with those in the intestinal epithelium (Figure\u00a05E). Next, we sought to establish whether MSCs influenced T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) \u03b3\u03b4+ T\u2010cell recruitment in IELs and PPs. TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells were mostly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and expressed at a low level in PPs in PBS group (Figure\u00a0S2). However, unexpectedly, their levels were markedly increased in IELs in the LPS/PBS group at day 3, as were CD8\u03b1\u03b1TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T levels (Figure\u00a05C and 5D). By contrast, at day 3 the population of TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells in IELs was reduced, as was that of CD8\u03b1\u03b1TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells, in the LPS/MSC group, suggesting that MSCs ameliorated intestinal T\u2010cell infiltration. Therefore, MSCs reduced intestinal epithelial inflammation by regulating the immune cell populations in lung and gut tissues.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in the intestine.

Gut bacterial community composition is altered by MSCsLipopolysaccharide\u2010induced lung injury has been shown to alter gut bacterial communities.\n12\n Thus, we analysed the effects of MSCs on intestinal microbial communities by sequencing full\u2010length 16S rDNA amplicons from 56 faecal samples from ALI mice. Rarefaction curves for the observed species in all samples approached a plateau, indicating that the PacBio sequencing covered all OTUs (Figure\u00a0S3). To characterize the global differences in microbial communities between groups, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on unweighted UniFrac distances and weighted UniFrac distances. The PCoA plots showed significant separation at days 1 and 3, but not at day 7, between the LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups (Figure\u00a06A), based on weighted UniFrac distances. Furthermore, ANOSIM revealed a significant difference in beta diversity among the groups (Figure\u00a0S4A). At day 1, the number of species was decreased in the LPS/PBS compared with the PBS group (Figure\u00a0S4B). In addition, the Shannon and Chao1 indices suggested a significantly decreased diversity in the LPS/PBS group (Figure\u00a06B). In addition, the MSC\u2010treated groups shared more OTUs with the control group than the LPS/PBS group at day 1 (Figure\u00a0S4C).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 6Intestinal bacterial community composition was altered following lung injury.

Histogram of the LDA scores for differentially abundant bacterial taxa in the PBS, LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08)The dominant phyla in all mice were Bacteroidetes, Deferribacteres and Firmicutes (~88\u201097% combined total relative abundance). Other phyla detected included Melainabacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria (Figure\u00a06C). At the family level, there were trends of differential abundance in members of the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes) and certain members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Deferribacteres at different time points. Notably, the abundance of the family Deferribacteraceae increased at day 1 after LPS exposure, whereas that of the family Lachnospiraceae increased in MSC\u2010treated mice. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analyses were conducted to identify differentially abundant bacterial taxa (Figure\u00a06D\u20136G). In all, 26 bacterial groups were differentially abundant (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.01, LDA score >4.0) between the PBS, LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups at day 1 (Figure\u00a06D). LPS treatment resulted in significantly decreased relative frequencies of the families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Defluviitaleaceae\u00a0(class Clostridia; phylum Firmicutes) in the LPS/PBS group compared with the PBS group (Figure\u00a06E). At day 3, the abundance of several genera, mostly the class Bacteroidia, was increased in the LPS/MSC group compared with the LPS/PBS group (Figure\u00a06F and 6G). The results of LEfSe analyses of the LPS/PBS and LPS/MSC groups at days 1, 3 and 7 are shown in Figure\u00a0S4D. Together, the findings indicate that MSCs restored a healthy intestinal bacterial community composition.3.6. The impact of gut microbiota depletion on the efficacy of MSCs in ALI miceThe gut bacterial community composition is associated with peripheral immunity homeostasis.\n38\n, \n39\n Therefore, bacterial community dysbiosis may modulate the therapeutic effects of MCSs. We treated C57/BL mice with four broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole and vancomycin) (ABX) in drinking water for 3\u00a0weeks before LPS injection to deplete the gut microbiota (Figure\u00a07A). Subsequently, mice received a single dose of LPS (20\u00a0mg/kg) to induce ALI. After 4\u00a0hours, half of the LPS\u2010treated mice received MSCs. Mice in the negative control group were injected with PBS after ABX treatment. Mice were assigned to the A\u2010PBS (n\u00a0=\u00a06), A\u2010LPS/PBS (n\u00a0=\u00a030) and A\u2010LPS/MSC (n\u00a0=\u00a030) groups. The survival rate in the A\u2010LPS/MSC group was significantly greater than in the A\u2010LPS/PBS group (56% vs. 22%, P\u00a0<.05) (Figure\u00a07B), indicating that lung injury was severe during ALI in antibiotic\u2010treated mice and was significantly alleviated after administration of MSCs. Moreover, the survival curve also showed that, compared to the LPS/PBS group, the A\u2010LPS/PBS group had a higher mortality rate (78% vs. 60%, P\u00a0<.05). Antibiotic administration altered the gut mechanical barrier in mice, which resulted in gut villus separation and gut mucosal damage (Figure\u00a07C). These changes were evident in the A\u2010LPS/PBS group compared with the LPS/PBS group. The histopathological changes also showed the same trend in the lung; that is, compared to the LPS/PBS group, the lung of the A\u2010LPS/PBS group exhibited a more severely distorted structure (Figure\u00a07C). A large number of inflammatory cell infiltrations were observed in the pulmonary interstitium, and many red blood cells were observed in the lung vasculature, while leakage occurred in the bronchial lumen at day 3 and day 7 in the A\u2010LPS/PBS group.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 7Effects of MSCs on antibiotic\u2010treated ALI mice.

ABX/A: mice treated with antibioticsThe number of IELs decreased significantly at day 1 in the A\u2010LPS/PBS group and was similar to those in the other groups (Figure\u00a07D). The CD3+ T\u2010cell population, in particular CD8+ T, CD8\u03b1\u03b1TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells, was dramatically altered (Figure\u00a07E). In addition, CD8+ T\u2010cell populations among IELs were significantly increased, and those of F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages were reduced, in the A\u2010LPS/PBS group. The percentages of CD8+ T cells and CD8\u03b1\u03b1TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells were lower in the A\u2010LPS/MSC group, similar to mice that were not treated with antibiotics (Figure\u00a07F).Next, we analysed IELs from the LPS/MSC and A\u2010LPS/MSC groups at three time points. The effect of MSCs on T\u2010cell populations and macrophages was more apparent in antibiotic\u2010treated mice compared with MSCs alone (Figure\u00a07G). Therefore, the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on ALI were mediated by changes in bacterial community composition in the gut. 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONThere is substantial evidence on the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in ALI,\n40\n which is mediated via amelioration of lung inflammation and immunosuppression.\n41\n However, although crosstalk between the gut and lung occurs in pulmonary diseases,\n42\n, \n43\n the gut\u2013lung axis is not fully understood. Moreover, the means by which MSCs regulate intestinal immunity and their relationship with intestinal bacterial communities are unclear. Therefore, we assessed the protective effects of MSCs in the lung and gut of LPS\u2010induced ALI mice. The survival rate and histopathology analyses indicated that tissue injury was severe at day 1 and day 3 after ALI; the tissue gradually returned to normal by day 7, and MSC treatment improved the survival of ALI mice. Days 1, 3 and 7 were therefore chosen to represent the initial inflammatory phase and resolution phase, respectively. The data suggest that MSCs enhanced survival, attenuated lung and gut inflammation, improved intestinal barrier function and reduced intestinal infiltration of CD8+ T cells in ALI mice with or without antibiotic treatment during the initial inflammatory phase. Further, depletion of intestinal bacterial communities with antibiotics could thus contribute to development or severity of the pulmonary disease as evidenced by the increased lung and gut damages and mortality (Figure\u00a07).The gut barrier mainly includes a mechanical barrier, a microbial barrier, a chemical barrier and an immune barrier.\n44\n The mechanical barrier is the first line of defence against infection, which mainly includes the gut epithelial cell layer and tight junctions.\n45\n The mucus layer has an important role in inhibiting the invasion and adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to epithelial cells.\n46\n Various gut microbiota also play an essential role in preventing the invasion of pathogenic bacteria and maintaining the immune homeostasis of the gut mucosa.\n36\n In our study, histological examination, 16S analysis and flow cytometry results showed that LPS\u2010induced ALI damaged the intestinal barrier, while the application of MSCs helped prevent or ameliorate ALI.An unresolved issue is how LPS affects intestinal inflammation and injury. In this study, LPS\u2010induced ALI mice were in a classic pulmonary inflammatory state during ALI progression. However, survival, lung pathological lesions and inflammatory cells and total protein in BALF were markedly decreased by MSCs. Interestingly, histological examination of the ileum revealed a mild lesion characterized by an impaired intestinal barrier at days 1 and 3 after LPS exposure. The ALI mice with an imbalance in the gut microbiota showed more obvious gut damage and increased mortality; in contrast, MSCs were shown to reduce gut damage (Figure\u00a07). Therefore, MSCs enhanced the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa.The anti\u2010inflammatory properties of MSCs have been described.\n32\n, \n47\n In this study, MSCs ameliorated inflammatory response in BALF, as indicated by decreased levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u20106. Our results are consistent with the previous studies on the anti\u2010inflammatory effects of MSCs in ALI.\n20\n, \n48\n Similarly, cytokine levels in ileal tissues were increased in the LPS/PBS group, suggesting that LPS\u2010induced lung injury results in low\u2010grade gut inflammation, and MSCs significantly ameliorated these increases. Kusaka et al reported that Ly6C+CD8+ T cells produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 during the acute phase of infection.\n49\n The downregulation of inflammatory cytokine expression may be related to the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs.Modulation of the mucosal immune response shows promise for alleviating the pulmonary and intestinal inflammatory injury induced by LPS. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs in the respiratory system involve T\u2010cell differentiation.\n32\n In this study, the therapeutic effects of MSCs were found to be mediated by reduced infiltration of Ly6C+CD8+ T cells, in line with the lower IFN\u2010\u03b3 level in the LPS/MSC group, since excessive IFN\u2010\u03b3 synthesized by large numbers of CD8+ T cells can aggravate tissue injury.\n50\n Moreover, enhanced macrophage phagocytosis in MSC\u2010treated mice contributed to repair of injured tissue, which is consistent with a prior report.\n48\n\nThe gastrointestinal mucosal immune system is important for maintaining host immune homeostasis.\n51\n IELs regulate epithelial cell function; most express the CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer, and 40 to 60% are TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells.\n52\n CD8+ T cells of IELs are similar to the effector memory CD8+ T cells that maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier.\n53\n Inhibition of CD8+ T cells has been shown to regulate immune responses and ameliorate disease in pulmonary inflammation.\n54\n We analysed the percentage of CD8+ T and CD8\u03b1\u03b1TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ T in IELs and PPs. CD8+ T\u2010cell infiltration of the intestinal mucosa was decreased by MSCs, ameliorating injury, which is consistent with the changes in the lung. Therefore, MSCs have an immunosuppressive effect in the lung and gut in ALI.MSCs may also promote intestinal healing by altering the intestinal bacterial community composition. Their interactions with the microbiota influence the functions of MSCs, including immunomodulation.\n55\n In this study, the changes in the bacterial community were reversed by MSCs. For example, MSCs increased the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes abundance. Lachnospiraceae, in the phylum Firmicutes, attenuated colitis in mice.\n56\n MSCs improved intestinal healing by increasing the gut microbial community diversity.The complex relationship between intestinal bacterial communities and peripheral T\u2010cell immunity during infection is of interest.\n57\n, \n58\n However, further studies are needed to determine how the intestinal microflora or activated immune response affects ALI in the complex intestinal microecological environment. We found that when antibiotics depleted the bacterial communities in ALI mice, the imbalance in intestinal microbiota aggravated lung and intestinal damage and immune response. Importantly, the damage to the lung and intestine structure was reduced by the MSC treatment. In addition, compared with the LPS group, our study demonstrated that the intestinal microbes contributed to the local host defence against pathogenic stimulus such as LPS. Immunomodulation is an important aspect of MSC therapy, so we analysed the T\u2010cell response of IELs over time. Interestingly, the results in antibiotic\u2010treated mice were similar to those in mice that were not treated with antibiotics. MSCs reduced the percentage of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to alleviate inflammation in mice, which is consistent with a previous study.\n59\n Indeed, the percentages of CD8+ T and CD8T\u03b1\u03b1CR\u03b3\u03b4+ T cells in our ALI mice treated with MSCs were dramatically decreased. The anti\u2010inflammatory activity of MSCs likely promotes recovery of ALI by modulating the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines by T cells and macrophages.\n60\n, \n61\n The dysregulation of the intestinal microflora increased the immune response to LPS, which may aggravate immune damage to the lung, while MSCs have the potential to serve as a therapeutic approach for lung injury due to their immunosuppressive activity.In summary, LPS caused increased mortality, damage to the lung structure and intestinal barrier, and dysregulation of the intestinal microflora, while MSCs significantly attenuated lung and gut injury in the LPS\u2010induced ALI mice. Moreover, the effects of MSCs were multifactorial, involving improvement of intestinal epithelial integrity, suppression of lung and intestinal inflammation, beneficial changes in the bacterial community and enhanced lung and intestinal immunity. Our findings may have clinical implications. The widespread use of broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics to control lung infections may lead to an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota and a subsequent aggravation of ALI in the clinic, while early administration of MSCs may reduce the deterioration of ALI by adjusting the gut barrier and immune response. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for the protective effect of MSCs on ALI in the clinic. CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors declare no competing interests.
