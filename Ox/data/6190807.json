{"title": "Genes and pseudogenes for mouse U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs", "pubDate": "1983", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "", "PMID": "6190807", "abstract": "Regions of the mouse genome homologous to U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs have been isolated. The U1 regions are identified as pseudogenes on the basis of: 1) insertions, deletions, and substitutions in the sequence of the DNA as compared with that of U1 RNA; 2) absence of complementary RNA in mouse tissues; and 3) lack of expression upon microinjection in Xenopus oocyte nuclei. A U2 region is identified as a gene on the basis of near identity of sequence with U2 RNA and capacity to direct the synthesis of U2-like RNA in Xenopus oocyte nuclei. Both U1 and U2 sequences are repeated in the mouse genome, the U2 sequences analyzed here in an inverted repeat arrangement.", "author": [{"author": "H Nojima", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Nojima+H&cauthor_id=6190807"}, {"author": "R D Kornberg", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Kornberg+RD&cauthor_id=6190807"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["6190807", "6208531", "6203126", "6201719", "6194507", "6084809", "6084596", "6083551", "3837185", "3480532", "3459149", "3458178", "3437891", "3116273", "3027665", "2999705", "2944114", "2582371", "2422631", "2411548", "2410858", "2410771"], "body": ""}
