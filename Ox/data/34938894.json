Vast regional differences in disease burden have been reported along with variable mortality rates.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Sweden has received media attention for its pandemic strategy and demonstrated in late 2020, an eight\u2010times higher mortality rate than the most affected Scandinavian neighbour, Denmark.\n7\n Furthermore, the health care system in Sweden is divided into 21 almost autonomous regions that may display outcome differences.To date, most published reports on outcomes from COVID\u201019 ICU patients have been either multicenter studies, many of which nationwide and registry\u2010based,\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n or studies from large tertiary hospitals.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n5\n Tertiary hospitals have, compared to smaller secondary hospitals, better access to advanced care such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and, possibly, a greater capacity to expand and reorganize intensive care in terms of staff and facilities. In accordance, one recent nationwide COVID\u201019 study from the United States (US) indicated that ICUs with fewer beds were associated with higher mortality.\n9\n\nV\u00e4ster\u00e5s Hospital provides secondary care in the region of V\u00e4stmanland and has an ICU with one of the lowest ICU capacities per capita in the country.\n13\n Before the pandemic, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Hospital provided a single ICU with eight beds, in a catchment area consisting of approximately 275\u2009000 residents, equivalent to 2.9 ICU beds/100 000 inhabitants. The average national ratio is 5.1 ICU beds/100 000 inhabitants,\n13\n compared to an average of 11.5 in Europe, although there is a substantial spread.\n14\n This observational study aimed to describe patient characteristics and definitive outcomes from the entire cohort of patients with COVID\u201019 receiving intensive care in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Hospital during the first phase of the pandemic. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Study design and participantsThis prospective observational cohort study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Uppsala (approval number 2020\u201002315) with a waiver of informed consent. It was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04382417\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04382417\"}}NCT04382417) and conducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.All patients with respiratory failure and a positive real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain\u2010reaction (RT\u2010PCR) test admitted to the ICU between 24 March and July 22, 2020 were included in the study. Patients with negative RT\u2010PCR but with radiological or clinical suspicion of COVID\u201019 were excluded. The time of recruitment corresponded to the complete first wave of the pandemic in this region. The last patient with COVID\u201019 treated in the ICU was discharged on July 22, 2020. An individual 90\u2010day follow\u2010up was carried out for each patient, starting from the date of admission to the ICU. The study end point, October 20, 2020, thus represented the 90\u2010day follow\u2010up for the last patient admitted to the ICU during this phase.2.2. SettingV\u00e4ster\u00e5s Hospital is a public, secondary care hospital situated approximately a one\u2010hour drive from the capital city of Stockholm. As for all ICUs in Sweden, the care provided is entirely government\u2010funded. Patients in need of ECMO, cardiac\u2010, or neurosurgery are referred to tertiary hospitals in Stockholm or Uppsala.During the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020, the viral transmission in the region exhibited an approximate 2\u2010week delay compared to Stockholm. This enabled a substantial reorganization, to prepare for the anticipated surge of patients requiring intensive care. Elective non\u2010malignant surgery was postponed, and overall, elective surgery capacity was reduced to 50% to enable expanded ICU cohort care. One of the post\u2010anesthesia care units in the hospital was rearranged to create a separate enclosed ICU with 14 beds dedicated to COVID\u201019 patients. The general ICU capacity for non\u2010COVID\u201019 patients was reduced from eight to five beds. Physicians and nurses without intensive care training from other parts of the health care system were relocated to assist in the new ICU. Anaesthetic ventilators from the operating theatre were brought in and rationing of syringe pumps became necessary. Commonly used sedatives like propofol and remifentanil were intermittently out of stock and substituted for longer\u2010acting agents such as midazolam and morphine. Frequent prioritization of patients eligible for either continuous renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis had to be done according to availability and hemodynamic stability.2.3. Hospital organizationA temporary triage tent with a tailored algorithm for COVID\u201019 related symptoms was established in conjunction with the Emergency Department. Depending on the severity of symptoms, test results, and clinical suspicion, patients were either transferred to dedicated COVID\u201019 hospital wards, triage isolation, or directly to the ICU. Worsening hypoxemia [defined as peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) <95% despite high flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO) 45\u2009L/min with 70% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or oxygen reservoir mask >10\u00a0L/min] and the practice of awake prone positioning on the ward prompted a clinical and individual assessment to investigate eligibility for intensive care. Thus, not all patients fulfilling the above criteria were admitted to the ICU.2.4. Data collection and variablesAll patients fulfilling study inclusion criteria were continuously enrolled and double\u2010checked through the Swedish Intensive Care Registry, using the code for COVID\u201019, U07.1, as stipulated in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Clinical and laboratorial data were retrieved from the existing electronic medical record (Cosmic R82.05, Cambio Health Care Systems, Sweden).Clinical data regarding patient characteristics, pre\u2010existing comorbidities, symptom onset prior to hospitalization, medications and complications during intensive care, ventilator settings, laboratory results, 90\u2010day mortality, and hospital length of stay were collected.Registered comorbidities were defined as: obesity (Body Mass Index, BMI >30), hypertension (use of antihypertensive medication), diabetes mellitus (use of antidiabetic medication), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma (use of inhalers and verified by spirometry), ischemic heart disease (history of myocardial infarction, previous coronary stenting, stable or unstable angina pectoris), immunocompromise (use of any systemic immunosuppressive medication), heart failure (ejection fraction <40% and/or New York Heart Association Classification of stage 3 or 4), chronic kidney disease (GFR \u226460\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2) and cancer (with ongoing active treatment).2.5. OutcomesPrimary outcome was defined as all\u2010cause mortality at 90\u2010day follow\u2010up starting from ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included 90\u2010day hospital discharge, patient characteristics, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, number of days with invasive ventilation, need for vasopressors/inotropes, and number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). Data were supplemented with a gross functional outcome and 6\u2010minutes walking distance (6MWD) from surviving patients treated in the ICU more than 4\u2009days, and who accepted an invitation to the post\u2010ICU reception. As a further secondary outcome, one\u2010year mortality was also added.2.6. Statistical methodsMere descriptive statistics were used due to the size of the study population. Data are described using median (range), median (interquartile range), and count (percentage). 3.\u2003RESULTSFifty\u2010three patients with COVID\u201019 admitted to the ICU between 24 March and July 22, 2020 were included in this study. Four patients were excluded, as outlined in the CONSORT diagram (Figure\u00a01).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1CONSORT diagram for confirmed cases of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 admitted to V\u00e4ster\u00e5s hospital during the study period (between 24 March and July 22, 2020).

ICU, intensive care unit. Four patients remained in hospital at 90\u2010day follow\u2010up.\nAmong the entire cohort, 27/53 patients were eligible for a return visit at the post\u2010ICU reception (10 patients had not been treated for more than 4\u2009days in the ICU and 16 were deceased). Unfortunately, 11/27 did not respond when contacted by phone and mail. For the remaining 16 patients, medical consultations could be made with a median (range) follow\u2010up time of 33 \u2009(22\u201060) weeks after ICU admission. Of these 16 patients, 5 declared by phone that they were not interested or dared visiting the hospital at this stage of the pandemic. Three experienced a full physical and mental recovery and 2 reported nearly full physical recovery. One of these patients also suffered from symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress syndrome. The remaining 11 patients paid a physical visit at the post\u2010ICU reception and 6 of them had a reduced 6MWD, with values below 571\u2009m.\n19\n At the 1\u2010year follow\u2010up, no additional deaths had occurred compared to the follow\u2010up at 90 days.Documentation was inadequately registered for one patient regarding BMI, three patients regarding smoking habits, and one patient regarding the day of symptom onset. Remaining data were complete for the entire cohort. 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONThis prospective observational cohort study describes the definitive outcome of the complete first wave of patients treated in the ICU of a secondary hospital with a pre\u2010pandemic low ICU capacity.The mortality rate in this cohort (30%) was lower than rates reported in early studies from China, Italy, and the United States,\n2\n, \n3\n, \n20\n but comparable with data from similar government\u2010funded health care systems in Sweden and Denmark.\n8\n, \n10\n However, comparing mortality data between different ICUs is difficult. Several factors are at play, most important criteria for ICU admission and how intensive care is defined.\n14\n, \n21\n In general, mortality rates for COVID\u201019 ICU patients have decreased since the beginning of the pandemic,\n1\n possibly due to increased knowledge about the disease and the introduction of new or adjusted therapies, for example intensified anticoagulant therapy\n22\n and widespread treatment with dexamethasone.\n16\n The results from this study reflect the early phase of the pandemic, since only the last two patients to be admitted received dexamethasone in accordance with The RECOVERY Collaborative Group study.\n16\n\nOne factor that has been suggested to affect mortality is ICU capacity.\n9\n Gupta et al reported a higher risk of death for COVID\u201019 patients admitted to US hospitals with <50 ICU beds compared to hospitals with \u2265100 ICU beds. A direct comparison with the Swedish health care system is difficult. However, it is presumable that larger hospitals are better equipped to reorganize and expand intensive care, not least regarding the ability to increase staffing. In Europe, ICU capacity ranges from 4.2 to 29.2 beds per 100\u2009000 inhabitants, with an average of 11.5 beds per 100\u2009000 inhabitants.\n14\n, \n21\n Heterogeneous definitions, especially regarding the distinction between intermediate and intensive care, are probably a major factor explaining the wide range.\n14\n, \n21\n Nevertheless, ICU capacity certainly differs between countries and regions, and the pre\u2010pandemic capacity of 2.9 ICU beds per 100\u2009000 inhabitants in the studied region was indeed low. Although the sample size was small, the mortality data in this study do not support that low ICU capacity correlates with higher mortality in critically ill COVID\u201019 patients. However, it is likely that the health care system benefitted from the 2\u2010week delay in the spread of the virus, compared to nearby regions. This enabled a substantial reorganization before the first patient was admitted to intensive care. This contributed to the fact that ICU capacity was not exceeded at any time during the study period and perhaps calls for a more dynamic definition of ICU capacity.Similar to most ICU studies, the majority of the patients in the study were men above middle age (Table\u00a01).\n2\n, \n3\n, \n10\n, \n11\n Obesity and hypertension were the predominant comorbidities. Notably, a considerable proportion of patients (23%) had no known systemic disease prior to ICU admission. Moreover, there were no patients with pre\u2010existing heart failure, active cancer, or chronic kidney disease in the data, which might reflect pre\u2010ICU decisions on limiting life support in some patients. However, data on COVID\u201019 patients treated in the hospital outside ICU were not collected in this study. Most of the included patients (57%) developed severe ARDS. RRT for acute kidney injury was used in 28% of the cases. Interestingly, none of the patients who received dialysis during their ICU stay and were still alive at 90\u2010day follow\u2010up had a residual need, suggesting a totally reversible acute kidney injury among survivors.Several previous studies have shown a higher incidence of severe COVID\u201019 in need of intensive care among patients of some ethnic groups.\n9\n, \n23\n, \n24\n This study has a similar finding, with a disproportionate percentage of patients being born outside Sweden. Of the ICU cohort, 55% of the patients, compared to 23% of the corresponding age\u2010group in the region of V\u00e4stmanland, were born abroad.\n25\n Socioeconomic factors have been suggested to be important but do not fully explain the association between ethnicity and severity of COVID\u201019.\n26\n\nThe study has important limitations. The sample was small and did not allow statistical analyses to be performed of, for example, factors associated with poor outcome. The small sample size and the regional nature of the data naturally enable limited generalization. The strength of this study is its prospective nature with the inclusion of every available patient and complete 90\u2010day follow\u2010up for the entire cohort. The record of patient characteristics had almost no missing data. To increase our understanding of COVID\u201019 and difficulties in delivering intensive care during a pandemic, long\u2010term outcomes are needed, and national and regional differences should be considered. Therefore, reports from secondary hospitals constitute a complement to studies from large, tertiary hospitals. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONWe conclude that mortality rates from this secondary hospital ICU were low compared to early studies in China, Italy, and the United States, but comparable to other government\u2010funded hospitals in Scandinavia. With timely reorganization, the number of ICU beds, and thus surge capacity, can increase substantially also in smaller hospitals.
