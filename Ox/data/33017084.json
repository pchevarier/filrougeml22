Cervicovaginal secretions may be collected by swab, tampon, or other methods, or secretion components may be liberated by a buffered wash solution and collected as cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). In addition to utility as biomarkers, constituents of cervicovaginal secretions, including proteins, certain microbes, and metabolites, exert function, for example, by playing protective roles in wound healing [11] and against HIV\u20101 infection [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. A large and important body of work has thus examined biomarker potential and functional roles of numerous entities in the cervicovaginal compartment.Compared with secreted proteins, metabolites, and the microbiome, however, several components of cervicovaginal fluids are less well understood, including extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) and their carriers, such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) and extracellular ribonucleoprotein complexes (exRNPs). EVs are potential regulators of cell behavior in paracrine and endocrine fashion due to their reported abilities to transfer proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and lipids between cells [23]. EVs comprise a wide array of double\u2010leaflet membrane extracellular particles, including those of endosomal and cell\u2010surface origin [24, 25], and range in diameter from 30\u00a0nm to well over one micron (large oncosomes) [26]. EV macromolecular composition tends to reflect, but is not necessarily identical to, that of the cell of origin [27]. EVs have been isolated from most cells, as well as biological fluids [23, 28], including cervicovaginal secretions of humans [29] and rhesus macaques [30].MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the most studied classes of exRNA. These noncoding RNAs average 22 nucleotides in length and, in some cases, fine\u2010tune the expression of target transcripts [31, 32]. Released from cells by several routes, miRNAs are among the most frequently examined biomarker candidates in biofluids and, along with some other RNAs, are reported to be transmitted via EVs [33, 34, 35, 36]. miRNAs are found not only in EVs, but also in free Argonaute\u2010containing protein complexes; the latter may outnumber the former, at least in blood [37, 38]. Many miRNAs are also highly conserved [32], and abundant species typically have 100% identity in humans and nonhuman primates [39]. [For this reason, we will refer to hsa\u2010 (Homo\u00a0sapiens) and mml\u2010 (Macaca\u00a0mulatta) miRNAs without the species designation unless otherwise warranted by sequence disparity.] While miRNAs have been profiled in cervicovaginal secretions and menstrual blood, mostly in the forensics setting [4, 40, 41], their associations with EV and exRNP fractions require further study. A recent publication reported that EVs from healthy vaginal secretions inhibited HIV\u20101 infection [29]. Another report found that CVL EVs (styled \u201cexosomes\u201d) were present at higher concentrations in cervical cancer and that two miRNAs were also upregulated [5]. Our laboratory described a reduction of CVL EVs in a severe endometriosis case compared with reproductively healthy primates [30]. However, our study, along with others, was limited by the absence of molecular profiling of EV cargo [30].Many immunocompetent cell types populate the female reproductive tracts, among which are vaginal\u2010resident macrophages. These cells reside in the lamina propria and participate in the host's innate immune responses via specialized phagocytic elimination and limited antigen\u2010presenting capability [42, 43]. Once activated, for example, by sensing interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) from Th1 effectors cells [43], vaginal macrophages increase their degradative ability. The recruitment of vaginal macrophages is sex hormone\u2010dependent, and their phagocytotic capability is not impaired by the low pH of the microenvironment [43, 44]. Numerous papers have demonstrated that CD68+ macrophages express receptors CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4, indicating that they are susceptible to infection by both R5 and X4\u2010tropic HIV\u20101 virus during genital infection and transmission [42, 43, 45, 46, 47].Here, we performed targeted miRNA profiling of EV\u2010enriched and EV\u2010depleted fractions of CVL and vaginal secretions collected from healthy and retrovirus\u2010infected rhesus macaques. We queried how CVL EVs and miRNAs are affected by the menstrual cycle, an important potential confounder of biomarker studies [48]. Similarly, we assessed possible associations with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. We report an association of miR\u2010186 levels with SIV infection and find that this miRNA also appears to have antiretroviral effects in HIV\u2010infected macrophages. These studies provide baseline information for easily accessed CVL markers including EVs and miRNAs that may become useful tools in the clinic. Materials and methodsSample collectionCervicovaginal lavage and whole blood samples were collected weekly for 5\u00a0weeks from two uninfected (control) and four SIVmac251\u2010infected (infected) rhesus macaques (M.\u00a0mulatta) as previously described [30]. All macaques were negative for simian T\u2010cell leukemia virus and simian type D retrovirus and were inoculated intravenously. Animals were sedated with ketamine at a dose of 7\u201310\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u22121 prior to all procedures. CVL was performed by washing the cervicovaginal cavity with 3\u00a0mL of PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA. Cat #: 14190\u2010144) directed into the cervicovaginal canal and re\u2010aspirated using the same syringe. Materials and procedures for sample collection are depicted in Fig.\u00a0S1. Volumes of CVL yield across collection dates were documented in Table\u00a0S1. Whole blood (3\u00a0mL) was collected by venipuncture into syringes containing acid citrate dextrose (ACD) solution (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. Cat #: C3821).Study approvalsAll animal studies were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance with the Weatherall Report, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the USDA Animal Welfare Act.Sample processingSample processing began within a maximum of 60\u00a0min of collection and utilized serial centrifugation steps to enrich EVs as described previously [30], based on a standard EV isolation protocol [49]. Specifically, fluids were centrifuged: (a) 1000\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C in a tabletop centrifuge; (b) 10\u00a0000\u00a0g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C; and (c) 110\u00a0000\u00a0g for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C with a Sorvall Discovery SE ultracentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an AH\u2010650 rotor (k factor: 53.0; Fig.\u00a0S1B). Following each centrifugation step, most supernatant was removed, taking care not to disturb the pellet. After each step, supernatant was set aside for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA; 200\u00a0\u00b5L) and RNA isolation (200\u00a0\u00b5L) following the second and third steps. The pellet was resuspended in 400\u00a0\u00b5L of PBS after each centrifugation step. After the final step, the remaining ultracentrifuged (UC) supernatant was concentrated to approximately 220\u00a0\u00b5L using Amicon Ultra\u20102 10\u2010kDa molecular weight cutoff filters (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Cat #: UFC201024). Two hundred microliter of the concentrate was used for RNA isolation, and the remainder was retained for NTA. All samples reserved for RNA isolation were mixed with 62.6\u00a0\u00b5L of RNA isolation buffer (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark. Cat #: 300112. Lot #: 593\u201084\u20109n) containing three micrograms of glycogen and 5\u00a0pg of synthetic cel\u2010miR\u201039 as previously described [50]. Processed samples were analyzed immediately or frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until further use.For plasma, whole blood was centrifuged at 800\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Supernatant was centrifuged twice at 2500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The resulting platelet\u2010poor plasma was aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.Hormone analysisLevels of progesterone (P4) and estradiol\u201017b (E2) were measured in plasma samples shipped overnight on dry ice to the Endocrine Technology and Support Core Lab at the Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health and Science University.Nanoparticle tracking analysisExtracellular particle concentration was determined using a NanoSight NS500 NTA system (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). CVL samples were diluted as needed and specified in Table\u00a0S2 to ensure optimal NTA analysis. At least five 20\u2010s videos were recorded for each sample at a camera setting of 12. Data were analyzed at a detection threshold of two using nanosight software version 3.0.Western blotWestern blot was used to detect the presence of EV protein markers and the absence of nucleoporin (nuclear marker) in CVL and enriched CVL EVs. Twenty microliter of samples from each fraction was lysed with 5\u00a0\u00b5L 1\u00a0:\u00a01 mixture of RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA. Cat #: 9806S) and protease inhibitor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA. Cat #: sc29131). Eight microliter of Laemmli 4\u00d7 sample buffer (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA. Cat #:161\u20100747 Lot #: 64077737) was added per sample, and 30\u00a0\u00b5L of each was loaded into a Criterion TGX 4\u201315% gel (Bio\u2010Rad. Cat #: 5678084 Lot #: 64301319) after 5\u00a0min of 95\u00a0\u00b0C incubation. The gel was electrophoresed by application of 100\u00a0V for 100\u00a0min. The proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio\u2010Rad. Cat #: 1620177, Lot #:31689A12.), which was blocked with 5% milk (Bio\u2010Rad. Cat #: 1706404. Lot #: 64047053) in PBS\u00a0+\u00a00.1%Tween\u00ae20 (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Cat #: 274348 Lot #: MKBF5463V) for 1\u00a0h. The membrane was subsequently incubated with mouse anti\u2010human CD63 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, Cat #: 556019 Lot #: 6355939) and mouse monoclonal IgG_2b CD81 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat #: 166029 Lot #: L1015) primary antibodies, at a concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 overnight. After washing the membrane, it was incubated with a goat anti\u2010mouse IgG\u2010HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat #: sc\u20102005 Lot #: B1616) at a 1\u00a0:\u00a05000 dilution for 1\u00a0h. The membrane was then incubated with a 1\u00a0:\u00a01 mixture of SuperSignal West Pico Stable Peroxide solution and Luminol Enhancer solution (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA, Cat #: 34080 Lot #: SD246944) for 5\u00a0min. The membrane was visualized on Azure 600 imaging system (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA, USA). The second blot was done in a reducing environment using 10\u00a0mm DTT (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, Cat #: P1171 Lot #: 0000198991). Same procedures were followed with rabbit anti\u2010human TSG101 (Cat #: ab125011 Lot #:{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GR180132\",\"term_id\":\"238446261\",\"term_text\":\"GR180132\"}}GR180132\u201014), rabbit polyclonal antinucleoporin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, Cat #: ab96134 Lot #: GR22167\u201018) primary antibodies. Subsequent incubation with goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG\u2010HRP secondary antibody (Abcam, Cat #: sc\u20102204 Lot #: B2216). All antibodies were used at the same concentration as the first blot. Membrane was visualized on the Azure imaging system.Single\u2010particle interferometric reflectance imagingBoth CVL\u2010derived and dendritic cell LK23\u2010derived EVs were diluted 1\u00a0:\u00a01000 and incubated on ExoView (NanoView Biosciences, Brighton, MA, USA) chips that were printed with anti\u2010CD63 (BD Biosciences, Cat#: 556019) and anti\u2010CD81 (BD Biosciences, Cat #: 555675) antibodies. After incubation for 16\u00a0h, chips were washed as per the manufacturer's protocol and imaged in the ExoView scanner by interferometric reflectance imaging.Electron microscopyGold grids were floated on 2% paraformaldehyde\u2010fixed CVL\u2010derived samples for 2\u00a0min and then negatively stained with uranyl acetate for 22\u00a0s. Grids were observed with a Hitachi 7600 transmission electron microscope in the Johns Hopkins Institute for Basic Biomedical Sciences Microscope Facility.Total RNA isolation and quality controlRNA isolation workflow is shown in Fig.\u00a0S1C. RNA lysis buffer was added into each sample as described above prior to freezing (\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C). Total RNA was isolated from thawed samples using the miRCURY RNA Isolation Kit\u2010Biofluids (Exiqon, Cat #: 300112. Lot #: 593\u201084\u20109n) as per the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications as previously described [50]. Total RNA was eluted with 50\u00a0\u00b5L RNase\u2010free water and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. As quality control, expression levels of several small RNAs (sRNAs) including snRNA U6, miR\u201016\u20105p, miR\u2010223\u20103p, and the spiked\u2010in synthetic cel\u2010miR\u201039 were assessed by TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [51].miRNA profiling by TaqMan low\u2010density arrayA custom 48\u2010feature TaqMan low\u2010density array (TLDA) was ordered from Thermo Fisher, with features chosen based on results of a human CVL pilot study (GVH and KWW, unpublished data). Stem\u2010loop primer reverse transcription and preamplification steps were conducted using the manufacturer's reagents as previously described [52] but with 14 cycles of preamplification. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was performed with a QuantStudio 12K instrument (Johns Hopkins University DNA Analysis Facility). Data were collected using sds software and C\nq values extracted with expression suite v1.0.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw C\nq values were adjusted by a factor determined from the geometric mean of 10 relatively invariant miRNAs. Normalizing to the geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping miRNAs is a biologically relevant and recommended normalization method [53]. The selection process for these invariant miRNAs was to (a) rank miRNAs by coefficient of variation; (b) remove miRNAs with high average C\nq (>\u00a030), non\u2010miRNAs, and those with low amplification score; (c) select the lowest\u2010CV member of miRNA families (e.g., the 17/92 clusters); and (d) pick the top 10 remaining candidates by CV: let\u20107b\u20105p, \u2010miR\u201021\u20105p, \u201027a\u20103p, \u201028\u20103p, \u201029a\u20103p, \u201030b\u20105p, \u201092a\u20103p, \u2010197\u20103p, \u2010200c\u20103p, and \u2010320a\u20103p.Individual RT\u2010qPCR assaysIndividual TaqMan miRNA qPCR assays were performed as previously described [52] on all UC pellet samples from all animals across all weeks for miRs\u201019a\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #000395), \u2010186\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002285), \u2010451a\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #001105), \u2010200c\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002300), \u2010222\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002276), \u2010193b\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002367), \u2010181a\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #000480), \u2010223a\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002295), \u201016\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #000391), \u2010106a\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #002169), and \u2010125b\u20105p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #00449). We also measured miR\u2010375\u20103p (Thermo Fisher Assay ID #00564), which was not included on the array. Data were adjusted to Cqs of miR\u201016\u20105p.Blood cell isolation and monocyte\u2010derived macrophage cultureTotal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from freshly drawn blood from human donors under a Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine IRB\u2010approved protocol (JHU IRB #CR00011400). Blood was mixed with 10% ACD (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Cat #: C3821 Lot #: SLBQ6570V) with gentle mixing by inversion. Within 15\u00a0min of draw, blood was diluted with equal volume of PBS\u00a0+\u00a02% FBS and gently layered onto room temperature Ficoll (Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden, Cat #:17\u20101440\u201003 Lot #: 10253776) in Sepmate\u201050 tubes (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Cat #: 15450 Lot #: 06102016) and centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 1200\u00a0g. Plasma and PBMC fractions were removed, washed in PBS\u00a0+\u00a02% FBS, and pelleted at 300\u00a0g for 8\u00a0min. Pellets from five tubes were combined by resuspension in 10\u00a0mL red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (4.15\u00a0g NH4Cl, 0.5\u00a0g KHCO3, 0.15\u00a0g EDTA in 450\u00a0mL H2O; pH adjusted to 7.2\u20137.3; volume adjusted to 500\u00a0mL and filter\u2010sterilized); total volume was brought to 40\u00a0mL with RBC lysis buffer. After incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, the suspension was centrifuged at 400\u00a0g for 6\u00a0min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in macrophage differentiation medium with macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (M\u2010CSF) and 20% FBS (MDM20) to a final concentration of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells\u00b7mL\u22121. PBMCs were plated at 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells per well in 12\u2010well plates and cultured in MDM20 for 7\u00a0days. One half of the total volume of medium was replaced on day 3. On day 7, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove nonadherent cells. The medium was replaced with macrophage differentiation medium with M\u2010CSF and 10% serum (MDM10) and cultured overnight prior to transfection.miRNA mimic transfectionDifferentiated macrophages were transfected with 50\u00a0nm miRNA\u2010186\u20105p (Qiagen, Foster City, CA, USA. Cat #: MSY0000456 Lot #: 286688176) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat #: 11668\u2010019 Lot #:1467572) diluted in OptiMEM Reduced Serum Medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA, Cat #: 31985\u2010070 Lot #: 1762285). Controls included mock transfections and transfection of 50\u00a0nm double\u2010stranded siRNA oligo labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Fredrick, MD, USA, Cat #: 14750\u2010100 Lot #: 1863892). Plates were incubated for 6\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After incubation, successful transfection was confirmed by examining uptake of labeled siRNA with an Eclipse TE200\u2010inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Transfection medium was removed. The plates were washed with PBS and refed with 2\u00a0mL fresh MDM10 medium.HIV infectionHIV\u20101 BaL stocks were generated from infected PM1 T lymphocytic cells and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C. 24\u00a0h after mimic or mock transfections; macrophages were infected with HIV BaL and incubated overnight (stock, 80\u00a0\u03bcg p24\u00b7mL\u22121, diluted to 200\u00a0ng p24\u00b7mL\u22121). At days 3, 6, and nine postinfection, 500\u00a0\u03bcL supernatant was collected for p24 release assays and cells were lysed with 600\u00a0\u03bcL mirVana lysis buffer for subsequent RNA isolation and analysis.HIV p24 antigen ELISASupernatant samples were lysed with Triton X (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat #: NEK050B001KT Lot #: 990\u201017041) at a final concentration of 1%. The DuPont HIV\u20101 p24 Core Profile ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer, Cat #: NEK050B001KT Lot #: 990\u201017041) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions to measure p24 concentration based on the provided standard.Total RNA isolationTotal RNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion, Vilnius, Lithuania. Cat #: AM1560 Lot #: 1211082). Note that this procedure yields total RNA, not just sRNAs. After elution with 100\u00a0\u03bcL RNase\u2010free water, nucleic acid concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA isolates were stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.HIV Gag RNA RT\u2010qPCRReal\u2010time one\u2010step reverse transcription\u2013quantitative PCR was performed with the QuantiTect Virus Kit (Qiagen, Cat #:211011 Lot #: 154030803). Each 25\u00a0\u03bcL reaction mixture contained 15\u00a0\u03bcL of master mix containing HIV\u20101 RNA standard, 100\u00a0\u03bcm of FAM dye, and IBFQ quencher labeled Gag probe (5\u2032 ATT ATC AGA AGG AGC CAC CCC ACA AGA 3\u2032), 600\u00a0nm each of Gag1 forward primer (5\u2032 TCA GCC CAG AAG TAA TAC CCA TGT 3\u2032) and Gag2 reverse primer (5\u2032 CAC TGT GTT TAG CAT GGT GTT T 3\u2032), nuclease\u2010free water, and QuantiTect Virus RT mix, and 10\u00a0\u03bcL serial\u2010diluted standard or template RNA. No\u2010template control and no reverse transcriptase controls were included. Linear standard curve was generated by plotting the log copy number versus the quantification cycle (C\nq) value. Log\u2010transformed Gag copy number was calculated based on the standard curve.Data analysisData processing and analysis were conducted using tools from Microsoft Excel (geometric mean normalization), Apple Numbers, GraphPad Prism, the MultiExperiment Viewer, and r/BioConductor packages including pheatmap (http://CRAN.R\u2010project.org/package=pheatmap; quantile normalization, Euclidean distance, self\u2010organizing maps, self\u2010organizing tree algorithms, k\u2010means clustering). ResultsAbnormal menstrual cycle of SIV\u2010infected macaques and ovulation\u2010associated changes in CVL EV\u2010enriched particlesPlasma and CVL were collected from two control and four SIV\u2010infected macaques over the course of 5\u00a0weeks (Fig.\u00a0S1). Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) was observed for infected subjects (K. Mulka, et al, unpublished data). By NTA, CVL EV concentration in control animals increased during ovulation (Fig.\u00a01A). Transmission electron microscopy was performed for representative fractions of CVL, revealing bacteria and large particles in the 10\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet (Fig.\u00a01B). The 100\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet included apparent EVs up to 200\u00a0nm in diameter (Fig.\u00a01C). EV markers (shown: CD63, CD81, and TSG101) were confirmed by Western blot (Fig.\u00a01D). The nuclear marker nucleoporin was detected only in tissue samples (Fig.\u00a01D). The relative EV tetraspanin profiles of both CVL and control EV samples were corroborated with single\u2010particle interferometric reflectance imaging: CVL EVs had a higher CD63 expression, and dendritic cell EVs had higher CD81 expression.Open in a separate windowFig. 1EV composition during the menstrual cycle. (A) Nanoparticle concentrations of CVL UC pellets monitored weekly over 5\u00a0weeks for two SIV\u2010negative (\u201ccontrol\u201d) and four SIV\u2010infected rhesus macaques (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD). Red arrows indicate time of ovulation for two control animals, which were absent for SIV\u2010infected animals. (B) Transmission electron micrographs of CVL pellets from the 10\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet (left) and 110\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet (right) confirm presence of bacteria and EVs/EV\u2010like particles, with several respective diameters indicated. Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0nm. (C) Western blot analysis suggests enrichment of EV markers CD63, CD81, and TSG101 in 110k pellet fraction of CVL from uninfected animals (n\u00a0=\u00a02). Vaginal tissue homogenate and DC (LK23) 110k pellet controls were also positive for CD63 and CD81. Nuclear marker nucleoporin was detected in tissue homogenate but not in putative EV samples. Dashed lines were added to indicate the grouping of the ladder and the samples on the TSG101 and nucleoporin blots. (D) SP\u2010IRIS confirmation of EV markers on CVL and DC EVs. Shown are averages of tetraspanin\u2010positive particles bound to anti\u2010CD63 and anti\u2010CD81 antibodies and detected by label\u2010free imaging (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD).TLDA reveals an extracellular miRNA profile of the cervicovaginal compartmentBased upon preliminary findings from a study of human CVL (Hancock and Witwer, unpublished data), we designed a custom TLDA to measure 47 miRNAs expected to be present in CVL, along with the snRNA U6. CVL from all subjects and at all time points was fractionated by stepped centrifugation to yield a 10\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet (10\u00a0K pellet), a 100\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet (UC pellet), and 100\u00a0000\u00a0g supernatant (UC supernatant). Total RNA from all fractions was profiled by TLDA. Raw (Fig.\u00a0S2A), quantile normalized (Fig.\u00a0S2B), and geometric mean\u2010adjusted C\nq values (Fig.\u00a0S2C) were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering. This clustering did not reveal broad miRNA profile differences associated with sample collection time, menstruation, or SIV infection.Distribution of miRNAs across CVL fractionsAcross the three examined CVL fractions (p10, p100, S100), the 10 most abundant miRNAs (lowest C\nq values) were miRs\u2010223\u20103p, \u2010203a\u20103p, \u201024\u20103p, \u2010150\u20105p, \u201021\u20105p, \u2010146a\u20105p, \u201092a\u20103p, \u2010222\u20103p, \u201017\u20105p, and \u2010106a\u20105p. The average normalized C\nq value for each miRNA was greater (i.e., lower abundance) in the p100 than the s100 fraction (Fig.\u00a02A and inset) and indeed in p10 and p100 combined (Fig.\u00a02B), suggesting that most miRNA in CVL, as reported for various other body fluids, is found outside the EV\u2010enriched fractions. Considering all fractions, the differences between the EV\u2010enriched and EV\u2010depleted fractions were significant even after Bonferroni correction for all features except U6. On average, the s100 fraction contained 86.5% of the total miRNA from these three fractions. In the p10 fraction, the average miRNA was detected at 10.5% its level in the s100 fraction (SD\u00a0=\u00a05.7%). miR\u201034a\u20105p had the lowest (5.9%) and miR\u201028\u20103p the highest (33.7%) abundance compared with s100. In the p100 fraction, miRNAs were on average 5.6% (SD\u00a0=\u00a02.4%) as abundant as in s100. The least represented in p100 was miR\u201027a\u20103p (2.3%), and the best represented was again miR\u201028\u20103p (13.4%). Together, the content of the EV\u2010enriched fractions (p10 and p100) as a percentage of the total is shown in Fig.\u00a02B for individual miRNAs. miRNA rank was significantly correlated across fractions, despite minor differences in order (Fig.\u00a02C).Open in a separate windowFig. 2Relative abundance of miRNAs in different CVL fractions from all subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a06). (A) Abundant miRNAs in descending order based on C\nq values normalized to the geometric mean for each sample. Inset: average of all miRNAs in UC pellet and UC supernatant. Error bars: SEM. (B) miRNA expression in EV\u2010enriched fractions (p10, p100) as a percentage of total estimated expression (p10\u00a0+\u00a0p100+S100 by C\nq) in ascending order, from miR\u201027a\u20103p (7.9%) to miR\u201028\u20103p (32.0%). (C) miRNAs in each fraction (10\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet\u00a0=\u00a0p10, 110\u00a0000\u00a0g pellet\u00a0=\u00a0p100, 110\u00a0000\u00a0g supernatant\u00a0=\u00a0S100, and) are significantly correlated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, Spearman).qPCR ValidationIndividual stem\u2010loop RT/hydrolysis probe qPCR assays were used to verify TLDA results for eleven selected miRNAs plus miR\u2010375\u20103p (not included on the array), which was also measured because of a reported association with goblet cells [54]. Some miRNAs were chosen due to high expression levels. miR\u2010181a\u20105p was measured due to its association with endometrial cells [55, 56]. miR\u2010125b\u20105p has been reported as a diagnostic marker of endometriosis [57]. Other miRNAs (miRs\u2010186\u20105p, \u2010451a\u20105p, \u2010200c\u20103p, \u2010222\u20103p, \u2010193b\u20103p) were selected based on our previous experience and results from other studies evaluating miRNAs in the context of HIV\u20101 and SIV infections. Results of qPCR assays, adjusted by miR\u201016\u20105p for each sample (since we found relatively low qPCR variation of miR\u201016\u20105p, a commonly used normalizer [58]), are shown in Fig.\u00a03A. Figure\u00a03B compares miRNA ranks (1\u201311) by TLDA and individual qPCR, which are generally in concordance. Note that expression of RBC miRNA miR\u2010451a\u20105p was low, suggesting minimal contamination from blood for most samples.Open in a separate windowFig. 3miRNA qPCR validation.

(B) Ranks of abundant miRNAs by qPCR and TLDA.miRNA association with retroviral infection statusAn association of miRNA abundance with infection status could yield novel biomarkers as well as clues to roles of miRNA in modulating infection. However, the small number of subjects in our study was a challenge. Nevertheless, by considering all subjects and time points together for both infected and uninfected subjects, microarray data suggested a slightly reduced abundance of miRs\u2010186\u20105p, \u2010222\u20103p, and \u2010200c\u20103p in infected samples (Fig.\u00a04A) based on statistical analysis of \u2206C\nq values, while qPCR revealed differential abundance of miRs\u2010186\u20105p and \u2010125b\u20105p (Fig.\u00a04B). miR\u2010186\u20105p was thus identified by both techniques as potentially associated with retroviral infection.Open in a separate windowFig. 4miR\u2010186\u20105p downregulation: SIV. miR\u2010186\u20105p fold change for all infected animals (n\u00a0=\u00a04) was determined using \u2206\u2206C\nt method using miR\u201016 and uninfected animals (n\u00a0=\u00a02) as controls. Log2 (fold change) for both TLDA and qPCR analyses was plotted for 11 selected validation miRNAs. Statistical analyses were performed on \u2206C\nt values. For TLDA, miRs\u2010186, \u2010222, and \u2010200c were significantly less abundant in the CVL p100 fraction of infected subjects (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, multiple t\u2010test, Bonferroni\u2013Dunn correction), **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001. For qPCR analysis, miRs\u2010186 and \u2010125b were significantly less abundant (multiple t\u2010test, Bonferroni\u2013Dunn correction), **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.miR\u2010186\u20105p transfection has minimal effects on cellular HIV RNA abundance but reduces p24 release from monocyte\u2010derived macrophagesTo assess a possible influence of miR\u2010186\u20105p (\u201cmiR\u2010186\u201d) on retroviral replication, we introduced double\u2010stranded miR\u2010186\u20105p mimic or control RNA into monocyte\u2010derived macrophages derived from three donors 24\u00a0h before infecting the cells or not with HIV. Upon M\u2010CSF stimulation, the primary macrophages should be activated toward the alternative M2 phenotype [59, 60, 61]. Post\u2010infection, EVs and miRNAs were mostly likely released from uninfected and infected macrophages alike. At days 3 and 6 postinfection, we quantitated full\u2010length HIV\u20101 transcript using a gag qPCR with standard curve. In cells from only one of three donors were fewer HIV\u20101 copies associated with miR\u2010186\u20105p mimic transfection (Fig.\u00a05). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in HIV RNA between the conditions.Open in a separate windowFig. 5miRNA\u2010186\u20105p mimic transfection inconsistently suppresses HIV\u20101 gag mRNA production. Apparent downregulation of gag mRNA (qPCR assay with standard curve) was observed in miR\u2010186\u2010transfected monocyte\u2010derived macrophages from only one of three donors compared with mock miRNA\u2010transfected cells. Overall, results were insignificant by t\u2010test (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM), P\u00a0>\u00a00.1, with multiple replicates of cells from human donors (n\u00a0=\u00a03).However, at the same time points and also out to 9\u00a0days postinfection, a different result was seen for capsid p24 release into the supernatant. For infected but untransfected cells, measurable p24 was observed by 3\u00a0dpi, and p24 counts increased by twofold or more by 9\u00a0dpi (Fig.\u00a06A) for multiple replicate experiments with cells from three donors. Compared with infected, untreated controls, mock\u2010transfected cells (not shown), and cells transfected with a negative control RNA (labeled with a fluorophore to assess transfection efficiency), miR\u2010186\u20105p transfection was associated with a significant decline of released p24 at all time points (ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; Fig.\u00a06B\u2013D). The negative control condition showed a suppressive trend that reached nominal significance at 9\u00a0dpi. However, miR\u2010186\u2010associated suppression was significantly greater at all time points.Open in a separate windowFig. 6miRNA\u2010186\u20105p inhibits p24 release. Monocyte\u2010derived macrophages from human donors were infected with HIV\u20101 BaL. (A) p24 production increased >\u00a02\u2010fold for all donors from 3 to 9\u00a0days postinfection (dpi), untreated cells. (B\u2013D) Transfection of miR\u2010186\u20105p mimic was associated with a decrease of p24 release compared with untransfected controls and mock miRNA mimic\u2010transfected controls at the indicated time points; ns\u00a0=\u00a0not significant, *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ****P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple tests). Results were from a total of eight to 11 replicate experiments with cells from all human donors (n\u00a0=\u00a03).p24 inhibition by miR\u2010186\u20105p is correlated with transfection efficiencyDespite the statistical significance of miR\u2010186\u20105p\u2010associated p24 inhibition, substantial variability was observed, including between donors/experiments; we therefore hypothesized that either donor\u2010 or experiment\u2010specific factors were responsible for the variability. The transfection experiments were repeated using macrophages from five additional donors (labeled 1\u20135). While significant but variable inhibition of p24 release after miR\u2010186\u20105p transfection was observed for three donors (1, 2, and 5), little or no inhibition was seen for donors 3 and 4 (Fig.\u00a07). It should be noted that miR\u2010186\u20105p antisense inhibitors were also introduced in these experiments. While they did not significantly increase HIV p24 release (Fig.\u00a07), they also did not achieve a consistent knockdown of native miR\u2010186\u20105p (Fig.\u00a08A).Open in a separate windowFig. 7miRNA\u2010186\u20105p inhibits p24 release in a donor\u2010specific manner. Monocyte\u2010derived macrophages from human donors were infected with HIV\u20101 BaL. (A\u2013C) Compared with mock\u2010transfected controls, transfection of miR\u2010186 mimic was associated with a significant decrease of p24 production from 3 to 9\u00a0days postinfection, respectively (dpi) in donors 1, 2, and 5 (biological replicate n\u00a0=\u00a03, technical replicate n\u00a0=\u00a02). (D, E) For donors 3 and 4, transfection of miR\u2010186 mimic was ineffective in inhibiting p24 release compared with mock\u2010transfected controls (biological replicate n\u00a0=\u00a03, technical replicate n\u00a0=\u00a02); ns\u00a0=\u00a0not significant, *P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ****P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, two\u2010way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple tests).Open in a separate windowFig. 8miR\u2010186\u20105p abundance post\u2010transfection and correlation with p24 release. (A) Abundance of miR\u2010186\u20105p in macrophages post\u2010transfection, as assessed by qPCR and compared (fold change) with the average of control macrophages (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD). (B) Correlation of macrophage miR\u2010186\u20105p and p24 concentration released in supernatant 3\u00a0days postinfection. P(two\u2010tailed)\u00a0=\u00a00.0019 (correlation), R\n2\u00a0=\u00a00.9731 (linear regression).One experimental variable that could affect the degree of inhibition is the efficiency with which the miRNA mimic is delivered into the cells. Since this variable was not assessed in our previous experiments, we measured it for the five new experiments. Despite using the same nominal concentrations of miRNA mimics for our experiments, a nearly 100\u2010fold range of miR\u2010186\u20105p concentration was observed between the lowest and highest efficiency transfections (Fig.\u00a08A), which increased miR\u2010186\u20105p levels from around 5\u2010fold to nearly 500\u2010fold, respectively. Strikingly, the miR\u2010186\u20105p level was inversely correlated with released p24 across these five donors (Fig.\u00a08B). DiscussionCervicovaginal lavage EVs and exRNPs, like EVs in the uterus [62, 63], may offer information about the health of the reproductive tract and may also facilitate or block transmission of infectious agents. Proteomic analyses of human [64] and rhesus macaque [65] CVL have suggested a core proteome and a highly variable proteome that responds to changes in pregnancy status, menstruation, infection, and other stressors. However, exRNA and EV profiles are less understood in this compartment. Thus, one major finding of this study is a partial profile of miRNAs of EV\u2010enriched and EV\u2010depleted fractions of CVL fluid of primates. We report that EVs can be liberated from vaginal secretions by lavage and that these EVs can be concentrated using a standard stepped centrifugation procedure, with enrichment of positive (membrane\u2010associated) markers while a cellular negative control was not detected.Both EV\u2010replete and EV\u2010depleted fractions of CVL contained abundant miRNA. As reported for other biological fluids [37, 38], miRNA concentration was highest in the EV\u2010depleted CVL fractions, not in EV\u2010enriched UC pellets, consistent with packaging of most extracellular miRNA into exRNPs; the function, if any, of extracellular miRNAs in the cervicovaginal tract of healthy individuals remains to be determined. We observed minimal differences in extracellular miRNA profiles between SIV\u2010infected and uninfected subjects or, surprisingly, even during the menstrual cycle, suggesting a certain stability of extracellular miRNA in the compartment. Correlation of miRNA concentrations in EV\u2010depleted and EV\u2010replete fractions was also apparent. Based on relative abundance compared with miRNAs of other cellular/tissue origins (e.g., heart\u2010 and lung\u2010specific miR\u2010126, kidney\u2010specific miR\u2010196b, and liver\u2010specific miR\u2010192) [66, 67], miRNAs in EVs and exRNPs of CVL are likely derived from epithelial cells (including goblet cells) and cells of the immune system (as suggested, e.g., by myeloid\u2010enriched miR\u2010223 and lymphocyte\u2010enriched miR\u2010150) [68]. Of the most abundant miRNAs we identified, some have been ascribed tumor\u2010suppressive roles in cancers [69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. Also, miR\u2010223 and miR\u2010150 have been described as \u201canti\u2010HIV\u201d miRNAs [76] among a variety of reported antiretroviral sRNAs, both host and viral [77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]. Given their relative abundance in the vaginal tract, a common site for HIV infection, these miRNAs may contribute to antiviral defenses.Along these lines, a second major finding of this study is a possible role for miR\u2010186\u20105p in antiretroviral defense, bolstered by the observation that exogenous miR\u2010186\u20105p transfection efficiency correlates inversely with HIV p24 release. Previous publications have identified protein constituents in the CVL with anti\u2010HIV efficacies (e.g., [7, 21, 22]). Our identification of miRNA as a potential anti\u2010HIV agent adds an element of complexity to the picture of tissue\u2010specific antiretroviral defense. In contrast with an early report of direct binding of host miRNAs to retroviral transcripts and subsequent suppression [76], it now appears that this mechanism of suppression may be relatively uncommon [83]. Anti\u2010HIV miRNAs may be more likely to exert effects through control of host genes instead (e.g., [84]). Our data also support the conclusion that reduction of HIV RNA levels is not the main mechanism for miR\u2010186\u2010mediated suppression of HIV release.How, then, might miR\u2010186\u20105p, whether endogenous or exogenous (therapeutically introduced) contribute to antiretroviral effects? Combining several miRNA target prediction, validation, and enrichment analysis approaches [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91], we noticed a few putative miR\u2010186\u20105p targets and related pathways that may merit follow\u2010up. One target of miR\u2010186\u20105p that was validated experimentally by multiple methods is FOXO1 [92], an important contributor to apoptosis but also immunoregulation via IFN\u03b3 pathways. Another prominent validated target, P2X7R [93], is involved in membrane budding, T\u2010cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity, cellular response to extracellular stimuli, and T\u2010cell homeostasis/proliferation. There is also evidence that miR\u2010186\u20105p targets the HIV coreceptor CXCR4 [94]. Pathway enrichment analyses [90, 91] suggest that miR\u2010186\u20105p targets participate significantly in infection\u2010related networks, including prion diseases, viral carcinogenesis, and responses to measles and herpes simplex virus infections. Although miRNA target prediction algorithms are imperfect, and validation efforts are of varying quality [95, 96], these findings may shed some light on how miR\u2010186\u20105p is involved in responses to HIV.We would like to emphasize several aspects of the study that open the door to future research:\nWe used stepped ultracentrifugation without density gradients because of the small sample volumes available. Although stepped ultracentrifugation remains a widely used method for EV enrichment [49, 97], subsequent gradients or alternative isolation methods could be attempted with larger volume samples to increase purity in future. Possibly, our study overestimates the abundance of miRNAs in CVL EVs, and differential packaging into EVs and exRNPs is masked by contamination of our EV preps with exRNPs.Our qPCR array approach and focus on miRNAs leaves room for additional work. While we are confident that our array captured most of the abundant miRNAs in CVL, sequencing short and longer RNAs could reveal additional markers.The small number of subjects and the absence of obvious menstrual cycle in infected subjects preclude strong conclusions about EV or miRNA associations with either infection or the menstrual cycle. For example, we did not observe the expected increase in miR\u2010451a or other RBC\u2010specific miRNAs during menstruation. However, since only two animals showed evidence of cycling, experiments with more subjects and larger sample volumes are needed.Our previous criticisms of miRNA functional studies [98] also apply to our results here. Additional work is needed to assess the potential of miR\u2010186\u20105p to regulate retrovirus production at endogenous levels, for example by showing that it is present in active RNPs [99] and that it interacts directly with specific host or viral targets. However, it is also important to note that miR\u2010186\u20105p could have therapeutic benefit even if it must be delivered at supraphysiologic concentrations. Finally, it is possible, but must be demonstrated, that miR\u2010186\u20105p acts in a paracrine fashion via EV or exRNP shuttles.We have investigated the effects of miR\u2010186\u20105p only in monocyte\u2010derived macrophages. We chose to begin with this cell type because of the abundance of miR\u2010223 and the known role of macrophages in the epithelium. We would like to reiterate the importance of other cell types in the vaginal tissue during HIV\u20101 infection [100, 101]; thus, this antiviral effect of miR\u2010186\u20105p should also be investigated in other cell types.\nOverall, the results presented here support further development of CVL and its constituents as a window into the health of the cervicovaginal compartment in retroviral infection and beyond. Furthermore, delivery of miR\u2010186\u20105p could act to suppress retrovirus release. Conflicts of interestThe authors have no competing interests to declare.
