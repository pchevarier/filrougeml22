Although it is well known that tyrosine phosphorylation is important for signal transduction at the plasma membrane, the role of nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation in nuclear events is poorly understood (3, 4).Human genome encodes 518 protein kinases, which consist of 428 serine and threonine kinases and 90 tyrosine kinases (5). Receptor-type tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the extracellular milieu to the inside of the cell. On the other hand, the function of non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases is influenced by their intracellular localization (6). Src family kinases (SFKs),3 which belong to a family of non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases, consist of proto-oncogene products and structurally related proteins, such as c-Src, Lyn, and Fyn (7, 8). Recently, we showed that SFKs are imported into and rapidly exported from the nucleus (9, 10). Brk (breast tumor kinase), an Src-related kinase, is localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleus (11). The proto-oncogene product c-Abl, a non-receptor-type tyrosine kinase, can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (12). ErbB4, a member of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases, is cleaved upon ligand stimulation, and the intracellular domain is released into the cytoplasm and the nucleus (13).Recently, we reported that nucleus-localized tyrosine kinases, such as SFK, Abl, Chk, and ErbB4, play roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and histone modifications through tyrosine phosphorylation (10, 14\u201317). To substantiate the involvement of nuclear tyrosine kinases in chromatin structural changes, we constructed mutants with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Compared with the intact form of tyrosine kinases, NLS-SFK, NLS-c-Abl, and NLS-4ICD (NLS-tagged ErbB4\nintracellular domain) have strong effects on chromatin structural changes (10, 16, 17). NLS-tagged tyrosine kinases help us to understand the relationships between tyrosine kinases and chromatin structural changes. However, it is still unclear how chromatin structure is regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation.In this study, we sought to identify nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that are related to chromatin structural changes and found a candidate protein called KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1/TIF1\u03b2/Trim28). We revealed that three tyrosine residues of KAP1 are the common tyrosine phosphorylation sites for various tyrosine kinases localizing in the nucleus. We further showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreases the amounts of chromatin-bound KAP1 and HP1\u03b1. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 is involved in transcription of p21 upon DNA damage. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids Intact c-Src, c-Src (c-Src-HA), and NLS-Src were constructed from cDNA encoding human wild-type Src (18) (provided by D. J. Fujita) as described (10, 19). Intact Lyn, Lyn (Lyn-HA), Lyn-K275A (Lyn(KD)-HA, KD indicating kinase-dead), NLS-Lyn, and NLS-Lyn-K275A (NLS-Lyn(KD)) were constructed from cDNA encoding human wild-type Lyn (20) (provided by T. Yamamoto) as described (10, 19). To construct pOZ-NLS-Lyn, cDNA encoding human wild-type Lyn was subcloned into the XhoI-NotI site of the pOZ-FLAG-HA-N vector (21) (provided by A. Iwama). NLS was inserted between the HA epitope and Lyn. The sequence GGL was inserted between the HA epitope and the NLS. The sequence LDPAQWRPRDPLCWTRPAAPKLSPRAGN was inserted between the NLS and Lyn. pOZ-NLS-Lyn-K275R/Y508F(KD), in which the ATP binding site and the negative regulatory site were mutated, was created by PCR using pOZ-NLS-Lyn as a template. Intact Fyn and NLS-Fyn were constructed from cDNA encoding human wild-type Fyn (22) (provided by T. Yamamoto) as described (10, 19). NLS-4ICD was constructed from cDNA encoding human ErbB4 CYT-1 (23) (provided by S. Yokoyama) as described (17). NLS-c-Abl was constructed from cDNA encoding human wild-type c-Abl-1b (24) (provided by E. Canaani) as described (16). NLS-Syk was constructed from cDNA encoding human wild-type Syk (25) (provided by E. A. Clark) as described (10). cDNA encoding human Brk (Open Biosystems) was subcloned into the pcDNA4/TO-FH vector (16). Myc-JMJD2a was constructed from cDNA containing human wild-type JMJD2a and subcloned into the Myc-pcDNA3 vector. Wild-type KAP1 (FLAG-KAP1-wt), FLAG-KAP1(N1)(1\u2013469), and FLAG-KAP1(C)(469\u2013835) were gifts from H. Ariga (26). FLAG-KAP1(N2)(1\u2013380) was constructed from FLAG-KAP1(N1)(1\u2013469) by digesting with BamHI, blunting, and ligation. The Tyr \u2192 Phe mutants of KAP1 were created by PCR using KAP1-wt as a template with the primers (supplemental Table S1).RNA Interference Knockdown of KAP1 was performed with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for silencing KAP1 (5\u2032- gcatgaaccccttgtgctg-3\u2032) (27). The nucleotides for shRNA were annealed and subcloned into the BglII-XbaI site of the pENTR4/H1 vector (provided by H. Miyoshi) (28, 29). To establish a KAP1-stable knockdown cell line, HeLa S3 cells were co-transfected with pENTR4/H1/shKAP1 and a plasmid containing the hygromycin-resistant gene and selected in 250 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin. To replace endogenous KAP1 with KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF mutant, KAP1 knockdown cells were transfected with knockdown-resistant KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF, and cell clones expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF were selected in 300 \u03bcg/ml G418. shRNA-resistant KAP1 constructs were made by mutation of the shRNA target site by PCR using KAP1 as a template with the sense primer 5\u2032- acacaagcatgaaccactagtactgttttgtgagagctgtgatactc-3\u2032 and the antisense primer 5\u2032-ctctcacaaaacagtactagtggttcatgcttgtgtacgttgcaata-3\u2032.Antibodies The following antibodies were used: Tyr(P) (4G10 and polyclonal antibody; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; provided by T.

The protein band corresponding to p110 was cut out and digested with trypsin (Trypsin Gold; Promega). After the digestion, molecular mass analysis of trypsin fragments was performed by LC/MS/MS. Identification of the protein was carried out by comparison between the molecular weights determined by LC/MS/MS and theoretical masses.Semiquantitative RT-PCR Total RNAs were isolated from cells with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of each RNA preparation using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TakaraBio, Shiga) as described (16). To avoid saturation of PCR products, conditions of PCR were optimized before semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out. The primers used for PCR are as follows: p21, 5\u2032-actctcagggtcgaaaacgg-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-cttcctgtgggcggattagg-3\u2032 (antisense); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5\u2032-accacagtccatgccatcac-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3\u2032 (antisense) (16, 17). The sizes of PCR products are 104 bp for p21 and 452 bp for GAPDH. Amplification was carried out using an MJ mini thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) with Ex TaqDNA polymerase (TakaraBio) under the following conditions: for p21, initial heating at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 27 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 63 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; for GAPDH, initial heating at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 56 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. The products of RT-PCR were electrophoresed on a 2.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The density of each amplified fragment was quantitated using a ChemiDoc XRSPlus image analyzer and Quantity One software. The relative amount of p21 represents the mean \u00b1 S.D. from three independent experiments. An asterisk indicates the significant difference (*, p < 0.05) calculated by Student's t test (Fig. 4H). RESULTSTyrosine Phosphorylation of KAP1 To identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the nucleus, we established cell lines expressing Lyn tyrosine kinase tagged with a nuclear localization signal (NLS-Lyn). Affinity-purified proteins using anti-Tyr(P) antibody were excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to proteolytic cleavage followed by LC/MS/MS. The peptide derived from p110 exhibited 100% identity with the amino acid sequence of human KAP1 (Fig. 1, A\u2013C, and supplemental Table S2), a component of chromatin structure (43).To verify tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1, we transfected COS-1 cells with NLS-Lyn or NLS-Lyn(KD) and immunoprecipitated endogenous KAP1 from cell lysates. Endogenous KAP1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by NLS-Lyn but not NLS-Lyn(KD) (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, cells were cotransfected with KAP1-wt plus NLS-Lyn or KAP1-wt plus NLS-Lyn(KD) and cultured in the presence or absence of the SFK inhibitor SU6656. Expressed KAP1-wt was also tyrosine-phosphorylated by NLS-Lyn but not NLS-Lyn(KD), and treatment with SU6656 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1-wt (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 is induced by NLS-Lyn. Furthermore, we tested whether Lyn directly phosphorylated KAP1 at tyrosine residues. KAP1-wt, Lyn, and Lyn(KD) were immunoprecipitated from respective transfected cells and subjected to in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1, F and G). Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1-wt by Lyn was observed in a kinase activity-dependent manner, suggesting that Lyn directly phosphorylates KAP1 at tyrosine residues.To examine whether the other SFK members were able to phosphorylate KAP1 at tyrosine residues, we cotransfected cells with KAP1-wt in conjunction with NLS-Lyn, NLS-Src, or NLS-Fyn, which are all localized to the nucleus (10) (Fig. 1A). Unlike NLS-Fyn, NLS-Src and NLS-Lyn were able to phosphorylate KAP1 at tyrosine residues (Fig. 1H). Previously, we showed a strong relationship between various tyrosine kinases and chromatin structural changes (10, 16, 17). Next, we examined whether the other families of tyrosine kinases were able to phosphorylate KAP1. NLS-c-Abl, NLS-Syk, and NLS-4ICD were found to phosphorylate KAP1-wt at tyrosine residues, irrespective of various levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1-wt (Fig. 1I).Next, to examine the effect of the NLS sequence per se on KAP1 phosphorylation, we cotransfected cells with KAP1-wt in conjunction with intact c-Src, intact Lyn, or intact Fyn. Like NLS-Src, intact c-Src strongly phosphorylated KAP1-wt at tyrosine residues (Fig. 1, H and J\u2013L). Intact Lyn also phosphorylated KAP1-wt at tyrosine residues despite the low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1J). The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 were increased when NLS-Lyn was used in place of intact Lyn (Fig. 1, compare H with J). However, neither NLS-Fyn nor intact Fyn phosphorylated KAP1-wt at tyrosine residues (Fig. 1, H and J). Brk, a non-receptor-type tyrosine kinase that localizes in the nucleus, also phosphorylated KAP1-wt at tyrosine residues (Fig. 1L). These results suggest that KAP1 is a substrate for various tyrosine kinases that localize in the nucleus, and their nuclear localization is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1.Tyrosine Phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 To determine the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1, we constructed several deletion mutants of KAP1 (Fig. 2, A and C). Cells were cotransfected with NLS-Lyn plus KAP1-wt or KAP1 deletion mutants, and we found that NLS-Lyn induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1(N1)(1\u2013469) but not KAP1(C)(469\u2013835) and KAP1(N2)(1\u2013380) (Fig. 2, B and D). In addition, phospho-Tyr-517 on KAP1 was detected by mass spectrometry (supplemental Table S2). Given that KAP1 has only two tyrosine residues at positions 449 and 458 (Tyr-449 and Tyr-458) in the region between 380 and 469, we constructed KAP1 mutants, which are mutated at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 to phenylalanine (KAP1-Y449F, KAP1-Y458F, KAP1-Y517F, and KAP1\u20133YF) (Fig. 2E). Cotransfection of cells with NLS-Lyn plus KAP1-wt or NLS-Lyn plus KAP1 mutants showed that Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 were phosphorylated to a similar extent (Fig. 2, F and G). Importantly, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1\u20133YF was barely detected (Fig. 2H). Similar results were obtained with in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2I). These results suggest that Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2.Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517.\nA, C, E, a schematic representation of KAP1.

B, D, and F\u2013H, COS-1 cells cotransfected with NLS-Lyn plus the indicated plasmids were cultured for 24 h. KAP1-wt and its mutants were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting (WB) was performed with the indicated antibodies. I, KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF immunoprecipitates were incubated with Lyn immunoprecipitates, as described in the legend to Fig. 1G. Immunoblotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. J, COS-1 cells cotransfected with KAP1-wt plus NLS-Lyn or KAP1\u20133YF plus the indicated plasmids were cultured for 24 h. KAP1-wt and KAP1\u20133YF were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Asterisks show degradation products.Next, we examined whether various tyrosine kinases phosphorylated the same tyrosine residues of KAP1. In fact, we found that NLS-Lyn, NLS-c-Abl, NLS-Syk, and NLS-4ICD did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1\u20133YF in cells cotransfected with KAP1\u20133YF plus each tyrosine kinase (Fig. 2J; see Fig. 1I), indicating that Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 are the common tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1 for various tyrosine kinases.Inhibitory Role of Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Recruitment of KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 to Chromatin KAP1 binds to chromatin and acts as a scaffold for the assembly of heterochromatin proteins, including heterochromatin protein 1\u03b1 (HP1\u03b1), that participate in heterochromatin formation (44\u201346). To examine the state of chromatin-bound proteins, cells were extracted with high salt buffer before fixation and immunostained for KAP1 and HP1\u03b1. Consistent with previous studies (37, 47), immunostaining showed that both endogenous KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 were strongly stained within heterochromatic condensed chromatin, compared with decondensed chromatin (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we established KAP1 knockdown cell lines (HeLa S3/shKAP1) and immunostained for HP1\u03b1. KAP1 knockdown was found to decrease the levels of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 (Figs. 3A and \u200band44B). These results substantiate the co-association of KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 within heterochromatin.To examine the effect of nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation on KAP1 binding to chromatin, we transfected HeLa S3 cells with NLS-Lyn and immunostained for chromatin-bound KAP1. Intriguingly, the levels of chromatin-bound KAP1 were decreased upon NLS-Lyn expression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we immunostained for chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 and found that upon NLS-Lyn expression, the levels of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 were decreased within heterochromatic condensed chromatin as well as those of chromatin-bound KAP1 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits recruitment of KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 to heterochromatin.Effect of Tyrosine Phosphorylation on the Association of KAP1 with Heterochromatin To examine whether nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation inhibited KAP1 association with heterochromatin, cells were subfractionated into the low salt soluble fraction, the high salt soluble fraction, and the insoluble fraction (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d). The low salt soluble fraction contained the cytosolic protein cPLA2, and the high salt soluble fraction contained the chromatin-binding protein Ku70 (Fig. 3D). The insoluble fraction, which we focused on, contained the nuclear matrix protein lamin A/C and the heterochromatin protein HP1\u03b1. KAP1 was distributed into the low salt soluble fraction, the high salt soluble fraction, and the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3D), confirming that KAP1 is a component of heterochromatin, but not all of KAP1 associates with heterochromatin. In fact, nearly 25% of KAP1 binds to highly compacted heterochromatin (48). We subfractionated parental and NLS-Lyn-expressing cells and found that the amounts of endogenous KAP1 were decreased in the insoluble fraction upon NLS-Lyn expression, although the protein levels of KAP1 in whole cells were almost unchanged irrespective of NLS-Lyn expression (Fig. 3E; see also Fig. 3K). These results suggest that the association of KAP1 with heterochromatin is inhibited upon NLS-Lyn expression.Next, we examined the inhibitory role of NLS-Lyn kinase activity in the association of KAP1 with heterochromatin. Treatment with SU6656 inhibited the NLS-Lyn-mediated decrease in the amounts of endogenous KAP1 in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3F). Upon NLS-Lyn(KD) expression, the amounts of endogenous KAP1 were not decreased in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3G). These results suggest that the tyrosine kinase activity is critical for a decrease in the levels of KAP1 association with heterochromatin.Next we examined whether c-Src, which strongly phosphorylated KAP1 (see Fig. 1J), decreased the amounts of KAP1 in the insoluble fraction. We subfractionated HeLa S3 cells inducibly expressing v-Src, a highly activated variant of c-Src. The amounts of endogenous KAP1 were decreased in the insoluble fraction when v-Src was induced, and the decrease was inhibited by SU6656 treatment (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, we found that the amounts of HP1\u03b1 were decreased in the insoluble fraction in a kinase activity-dependent manner as well as those of KAP1 (Fig. 3I). These results suggest that nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation decreases the association of KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 with heterochromatin.To examine whether tyrosine-phosphorylated KAP1 decreased its association with heterochromatin, we compared the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of KAP1 in the soluble fraction with those in the insoluble fraction. The tyrosine phosphorylation levels of endogenous KAP1 in immunoprecipitates from the soluble fraction were about 2 times as high as those from the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3, J and K). Then we examined the effect of NLS-Lyn on KAP1 association with HP1\u03b1 and H3K9me3 (44, 45, 49). HP1\u03b1 and H3K9me3 were coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous KAP1, and we found that the amounts of HP1\u03b1 and H3K9me3 coimmunoprecipitated with KAP1 were decreased when KAP1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3L). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 impairs its association with heterochromatin.Inhibitory Role of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 in HP1\u03b1 Association with Chromatin Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreased the amounts of chromatin-bound KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 (Fig. 3, B and C). To examine the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 on HP1\u03b1 association with chromatin, endogenous KAP1 was complemented by stable expression of shRNA-resistant KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF in HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells. We confirmed the expression of shRNA-resistant KAP1 in these cell lines with immunostaining and Western blotting (Fig. 4, A and F). HeLa S3 cells, HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells, and HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF were immunostained for HP1\u03b1. KAP1 knockdown decreased the amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 (Fig. 4B; see also Fig. 3A). It is of note that the levels of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 in KAP1\u20133YF-expressing cells were significantly increased compared with those in KAP1-wt-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). To further ascertain the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 on HP1\u03b1 association with chromatin, HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF were transfected with NLS-Lyn. The amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 were decreased in KAP1-wt-expressing cells upon NLS-Lyn expression, and the decrease was inhibited in KAP1\u20133YF-expressing cells (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 has an inhibitory role in HP1\u03b1 association with chromatin.Next, HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF were transfected with c-Src or Fyn. c-Src, which strongly phosphorylated KAP1, induced a decrease in the amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 in KAP1-wt-expressing cells, and the decrease was inhibited in KAP1\u20133YF-expressing cells (Fig. 4D; see also Fig. 1J). In contrast to c-Src, Fyn, which did not phosphorylate KAP1, had no effect on HP1\u03b1 association with chromatin (Fig. 4E; see also Fig. 1J). Intriguingly, tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by c-Src was detected in the nucleus, but tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Fyn was detected largely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, D and E). These results suggest that c-Src decreases HP1\u03b1 association with chromatin through phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 in the nucleus.KAP1 phosphorylation at serine 824 (Ser(P)-824) by ATM and at serine 473 (Ser(P)-473) by Chk2 plays important roles in DNA damage responses (27, 37, 50), and the tyrosine kinases Lyn and c-Abl are activated in DNA damage responses (51, 52). We thus examined the effect of KAP1 tyrosine phosphorylation on KAP1-Ser(P)-824 and KAP1-Ser(P)-473. HeLa S3 cells, HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells, and HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF were treated with the DNA-damaging agent ADR. The levels of Ser(P)-824 and Ser(P)-473 of KAP1\u20133YF were found to be lower than those of KAP1-wt (Fig. 4F, compare lane 7 with lane 8, lane 11 with lane 12, and lane 15 with lane 16). However, the levels of KAP1-Ser(P)-473 were not changed without DNA damage, irrespective of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 (Fig. 4G). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 is involved in phosphorylation of KAP1 at Ser-824 and Ser-473 in DNA damage responses.Because phosphorylation of KAP1 at Ser-824 and Ser-473 is required for transcription of p21 in DNA damage responses (50), we analyzed the expression levels of the p21 mRNA in HeLa S3/shKAP1 cells expressing KAP1-wt or KAP1\u20133YF treated with ADR. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the levels of p21 gene expression were decreased in KAP1\u20133YF expressing cells compared with KAP1-wt expressing cells (Fig. 4H). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 is involved in DNA damage responses. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show that KAP1 is phosphorylated at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517. These three tyrosine residues are the common tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1 for various tyrosine kinases that are localized within the nucleus. We further show that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreases its association with heterochromatin, which is accompanied by a decrease in the amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1.Previous reports showed post-translational modifications of KAP1 and its importance for proper functions. Phosphorylation of KAP1 at Ser-473 decreases its association with HP1, and phosphorylation at Ser-824 relaxes chromatin structure (27, 53). SUMOylation of KAP1 is required for gene silencing (54). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 is reported to be induced by c-Fes tyrosine kinase (55) and PDGF stimulation (56), the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1 have not been identified thus far, and the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 are largely unknown.We have been studying nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation and the effect of nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation on chromatin structural changes. Chk tyrosine kinase localizes within the nucleus and brings about growth retardation and aberrant chromosome movement leading to multinucleation (14, 57). SFK and c-Abl tyrosine kinase localized in the nucleus induce chromatin structural changes (10, 16). In this study, to understand the regulatory mechanism of chromatin structural changes through tyrosine phosphorylation, we tried to identify nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by mass spectrometry. Tyrosine phosphorylation induced by NLS-Lyn was barely detected without Na3VO4, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases (Fig. 1C). We thus incubated NLS-Lyn-expressing cells in medium supplemented with Na3VO4 (Fig. 1C), because tyrosine phosphatases may be abundant in the nucleus (4). Taken together with the fact that Na3VO4 treatment greatly increases nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation (10), these results suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins may be rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. In addition to Na3VO4 treatment, to further inactivate tyrosine phosphatase activities, cell lysates were boiled before immunoprecipitation (also see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d). These methods enabled us to identify KAP1 as a nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (supplemental Table S2). Tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 was induced by various tyrosine kinases (Fig. 1). In addition to the tyrosine kinases that we examined in this study, the other tyrosine kinases may also phosphorylate KAP1.To find the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1, we tried to predict the sites with Web-based programs. NetPhos version 2.0 predicts three tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-208, Tyr-458, and Tyr-755, on KAP1. Scansite predicts the other tyrosine phosphorylation sites Tyr-242 and Tyr-517 besides Tyr-755. Although both computer programs predict Tyr-755 as a tyrosine phosphorylation site, in fact our results indicate that Tyr-755 is not the main tyrosine phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation at Tyr-755 was not detected by mass spectrometry, and KAP1(C) containing Tyr-755 was weakly phosphorylated (supplemental Table S2 and Fig. 2, A\u2013D). In the PhosphoSitePlus proteomics database, the phosphorylation sites of KAP1 at Tyr-458 and Tyr-517 are most frequently shown in SW480 cells, Jurkat T cells, K562 cells, etc., and the phosphorylation site at Tyr-449 is also listed. As indicated in the PhosphoSitePlus database, we detected that the two tyrosine residues Tyr-458 and Tyr-517 on KAP1 are the major phosphorylation sites and that Tyr-449 is heavily phosphorylated as well (Fig. 2, F and G). We therefore conclude that the three tyrosine residues Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1 (Fig. 2).NLS-Lyn induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 much more strongly than intact Lyn (Fig. 1, F\u2013J), suggesting that nuclear localization is important to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Recently, we reported that Lyn mutants lacking the lipid modification sites are accumulated in the nucleus, compared with Lyn-wt (9). At present, myristoylation and palmitoylation are known as the major forms of lipid modification of tyrosine kinases (58). c-Src and Brk are not palmitoylated, whereas Lyn and Fyn are palmitoylated (11, 59). Intriguingly, c-Src and Brk induced high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1, compared with Lyn and Fyn (Fig. 1, J\u2013L). Immunostaining showed that c-Src but not Fyn induces tyrosine phosphorylation in the nucleus (Fig. 4, D and E). It is possible that palmitoylation negatively regulates nuclear localization of SFK and tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 are determined by the substrate specificity, because unlike NLS-Src and NLS-Lyn, NLS-Fyn did not phosphorylate KAP1 (Fig. 1H).KAP1 is a component of chromatin structure (43). We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 decreases its association with heterochromatin (Fig. 3, B and E\u2013L), leading to an intriguing hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 takes place in highly compacted heterochromatin (the insoluble fraction), and tyrosine-phosphorylated KAP1 can be released from the insoluble fraction into the high salt soluble fraction. Previous studies showed that KAP1 directly associates with HP1\u03b1 and plays important roles in chromatin binding of HP1\u03b1 (43, 60). KAP1 knockdown affects the level of histone H3 Lys-9 methylation that is required for chromatin binding of HP1\u03b1 (61) and compromises recruitment of HP1\u03b1 to DNA damage sites (62). Although our results showed that the levels of H3K9me3 are not drastically changed, we substantiated that KAP1 knockdown decreases the amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 (Figs. 3A and \u200band55A). When the histone demethylase JMJD2a is expressed, the levels of H3K9me3 and the amounts of chromatin-bound HP1\u03b1 are drastically decreased (Fig. 5, B and C), consistent with previous studies (63). We revealed that JMJD2a expression also decreases the amounts of chromatin-bound KAP1 as well as those of HP1\u03b1 (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the association of KAP1 and HP1\u03b1 with chromatin is regulated by chromatin structure. However, the interaction of KAP1 and HP1 was not affected by chromatin structure (Fig. 5E). Therefore, KAP1 could strengthen the association of HP1\u03b1 with heterochromatin.The association of HP1\u03b1 with heterochromatin is evidently decreased through phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 (Fig. 4, B\u2013D). Previous studies showed that KAP1 associates with HP1\u03b1 through the HP1-binding motif (PXVXL, amino acids 486\u2013490), and the mutation of this motif to PEESL (amino acids 486\u2013490) abolishes the interaction of KAP1 with HP1 (44, 60). The tyrosine phosphorylation sites of KAP1 identified in this study are located close to the HP1-binding motif (Fig. 2E), leading to the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 affects HP1 binding to KAP1 (see also Fig. 3L). Although the association of KAP1 with HP1\u03b1 is disturbed also by phosphorylation of KAP1 at Ser-473 (53), the level of KAP1-Ser(P)-473 was not increased by tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 without ADR treatment (Fig. 4G). These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 on the association of KAP1 with heterochromatin was not due to the induction of Ser(P)-473.Upon ADR treatment, the levels of Ser(P)-824 and Ser(P)-473 of KAP1\u20133YF were lower than those of KAP1-wt (Fig. 4F). Given that the levels of Ser(P)-824 and Ser(P)-473 of KAP1 with mutation in the HP1-binding motif are higher than those of wild-type KAP1 (64), we can speculate that an increase of the association of KAP1\u20133YF with heterochromatin and HP1\u03b1 may cause a decrease in the levels of Ser(P)-824 and Ser(P)-473 on KAP1\u20133YF, which leads to repression of p21 (Fig. 4H).Although Jak2 tyrosine kinase phosphorylates histone H3 at Tyr-41 and excludes HP1 from chromatin (65), we are able to present another type of evidence for HP1 exclusion from chromatin. It is known that KAP1 is a critical regulator of development and differentiation through gene silencing and heterochromatin formation (43). KAP1 knock-out embryos are arrested in their development at the early egg cylinder stage (66). KAP1 is therefore required for epigenetic stability during the mouse oocyte-to-embryo transition (67). Furthermore, association of KAP1 with HP1, which is also important for heterochromatin formation and gene silencing (46), is required for corepressor functions of KAP1 (68). Taken together, tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 at Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 may be related to development and differentiation. Generation of KAP1\u20133YF knock-in mice might enable us to investigate a role of tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 in development and differentiation.In conclusion, we show that Tyr-449, Tyr-458, and Tyr-517 on KAP1 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites for various tyrosine kinases, including SFKs. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 has inhibitory roles in its association with heterochromatin. Further studies will help us to understand the relationship between nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation and chromatin structure.
