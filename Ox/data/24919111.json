A secondary analysis of the LOVS and ExPress trials", "pubDate": "2014", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1164/rccm.201404-0688OC", "PMID": "24919111", "abstract": "Rationale:                       Previous trials of higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) failed to demonstrate mortality benefit, possibly because of differences in lung recruitability among patients with ARDS.                  Objectives:                       To determine whether the physiological response to increased PEEP is associated with mortality.                  Methods:                       In a secondary analysis of the Lung Open Ventilation Study (LOVS, n = 983), we examined the relationship between the initial response to changes in PEEP after randomization and mortality. We sought to corroborate our findings using data from a different trial of higher PEEP (ExPress, n = 749).                  Measurements and main results:                       The oxygenation response (change in ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen: P/F) after the initial change in PEEP after randomization varied widely (median, 9.5 mm Hg; interquartile range, -16 to 47) and was only weakly related to baseline P/F or the magnitude of PEEP change. Among patients in whom PEEP was increased after randomization, an increase in P/F was associated with reduced mortality (multivariable logistic regression; adjusted odds ratio, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.89] per 25-mm Hg increase in P/F), particularly in patients with severe disease (baseline P/F [less-than-or-equal-to] 150 mm Hg). Changes in compliance and dead space were not associated with mortality. These findings were confirmed by a similar analysis of data from the ExPress trial.                  Conclusions:                       Patients with ARDS who respond to increased PEEP by improved oxygenation have a lower risk of death. The oxygenation response to PEEP might be used to predict whether patients will benefit from higher versus lower PEEP.", "author": [{"author": "Ewan C Goligher", "affiliation": ["1 Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care Medicine."], "href": "/?term=Goligher+EC&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Brian P Kavanagh", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Kavanagh+BP&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Gordon D Rubenfeld", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Rubenfeld+GD&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Neill K J Adhikari", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Adhikari+NK&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Ruxandra Pinto", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Pinto+R&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Eddy Fan", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Fan+E&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Laurent J Brochard", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Brochard+LJ&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "John T Granton", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Granton+JT&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Alain Mercat", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Mercat+A&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Jean-Christophe Marie Richard", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Marie+Richard+JC&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Jean-Marie Chretien", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Chretien+JM&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Graham L Jones", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Jones+GL&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Deborah J Cook", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Cook+DJ&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Thomas E Stewart", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Stewart+TE&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Arthur S Slutsky", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Slutsky+AS&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Maureen O Meade", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Meade+MO&cauthor_id=24919111"}, {"author": "Niall D Ferguson", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ferguson+ND&cauthor_id=24919111"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["24919111", "34599691", "34384488", "34280657", "34270967", "34266460", "34175182", "34081643", "33784416", "33496887", "33237346", "33206201", "33173856", "33156382", "33112644", "33073217", "32907701", "32895160", "32751791", "32654210", "32479112", "32172276", "32150460", "31842915", "31809278", "31770398", "31728356", "31532227", "31312921", "31197492", "31060090", "30664057", "30447683", "30247273", "30157955", "30143835", "29947879", "29641219", "29595185", "29568488", "29420904", "29293150", "29134246", "28973075", "28899408", "28794694", "28785882", "28730554", "28653135", "28623930", "28372575", "28350644", "28150228", "28146639", "28101605", "27923979", "27821065", "27790273", "27518321", "27057912", "27040103", "27000388", "26781952", "26399891", "26162279", "25805653", "25792200", "25692125", "25136186"], "body": ""}
