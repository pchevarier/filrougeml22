Rapid and transient pausing of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is indeed critical to restrict the production of aberrant transcripts from damaged loci and to prevent deleterious collisions between transcription and repair machineries. Yet, how DNA lesions signal to the transcription machinery to coordinate DNA repair with transcriptional silencing is not fully elucidated. In this issue of EMBO Reports, Awwad et al\n1 bring a new piece to the puzzle by identifying the negative transcription elongation factor NELF as a critical player in this process. They demonstrate that NELF is recruited to DNA double\u2010strand breaks (DSBs) near transcriptionally active genes in a poly(ADP\u2010ribose)\u2010 and RNAPII\u2010dependent manner to promote transcriptional repression and facilitate DSB repair.Subject Categories: DNA Replication, Repair & Recombination Transcription is a potential source of genome instability and needs to be turned off during repair of DNA damage 2. While bulky DNA lesions directly interfere with the progression of the transcription machinery, other lesions, like DSBs, inhibit transcription through complex and not yet fully elucidated mechanisms that involve the DNA damage sensor kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) 3 and DNA\u2010dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2010PK) 4, as well as poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase (PARP) 5. These enzymatic activities promote transcription silencing at DSBs through the recruitment of repressive chromatin modifying complexes 5, 6, 7, 8. However, it is still unclear how DSBs signal to the transcription machinery to trigger silencing.In this issue of EMBO Reports, Awwad et al\n1 uncover a hitherto unknown role for the negative elongation factor NELF in blocking transcription of genes close to DSBs in human cells. NELF is a four subunit protein complex, comprising NELF\u2010A, B, C/D, and E, which cooperates with DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) to repress transcription elongation by RNAPII 9. Focusing on one of the essential subunits for transcriptional pausing, NELF\u2010E, Awwad et al\n1 take three complementary approaches for assessing the role of NELF in transcriptional silencing upon DSBs in human cells: a global strategy consisting in labeling nascent transcripts upon cell exposure to ionizing radiation, and two targeted approaches for analyzing gene transcription upon site\u2010specific DSB induction. For this, they make use of a previously established reporter cell line, allowing them to study the effect of DSB induction by the I\u2010SceI endonuclease upstream of a tetracycline\u2010responsive MS2 gene. In addition, they establish a novel Cas9\u2010based system for inducing a sequence\u2010specific DSB upstream of the A20 gene, whose transcription is induced in the presence of tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1. Combining these approaches with NELF\u2010E knock\u2010down, they demonstrate that NELF\u2010E is required for transient transcriptional silencing in response to DSBs and more specifically for repressing the transcription of genes lying next to DSBs. These results indicate that NELF\u2010E likely contributes to short\u2010range transcriptional silencing in cis to DSBs. Future work will characterize the possible role of DSIF in this silencing pathway, to determine whether this repressive factor cooperates with NELF to silence the activity of RNAPII in response to DSBs as observed in unchallenged conditions.This first set of data suggests that NELF\u2010E acts locally to switch off genes close to DSBs. In line with this hypothesis, Awwad et al\n1 investigate NELF\u2010E recruitment to damaged DNA, using once again three complementary approaches: laser\u2010induced damage, I\u2010SceI cut, and Cas9\u2010mediated DSB. Thus, they establish that both NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010A relocalize to DSBs. Interestingly, they do not observe the recruitment of other NELF subunits, suggesting the existence a NELF subcomplex at damage sites that is fully functional for transcription inhibition. Furthermore, by employing deletion mutant analyses, they demonstrate that NELF\u2010E localizes to laser\u2010 and nuclease\u2010induced DSBs through its amino\u2010terminal leucine zipper domain. Mechanistic studies further establish that NELF\u2010E recruitment to DSBs is independent of ATM but requires PARP1 activity, as shown both by inhibiting and knocking\u2010down PARP1. Accordingly, PARP inhibition phenocopies NELF\u2010E knock\u2010down by alleviating transcriptional repression at DSBs. Also consistent with a dependency on PARP, NELF\u2010E recruitment to DSBs is rapid and transient and relies on PAR binding by NELF\u2010E amino\u2010terminal domain. This domain contains a putative PAR\u2010binding motif identified by in silico analyses. Further studies will be needed to test the relevance of this motif for NELF\u2010E recruitment to DSBs. Importantly, while NELF\u2010E recruitment to damaged DNA is mediated by an interaction with PARylated proteins, PARylation of NELF\u2010E itself, which inhibits its transcription pausing activity 10, is dispensable.Remarkably, further exploitation of the reporter cell lines in which DSBs are induced upstream of inducible genes reveals that NELF\u2010E is preferentially recruited to DSBs close to transcriptionally active genes. Moreover, NELF\u2010E recruitment requires the presence of RNAPII, and NELF\u2010E association with RNAPII large subunit is disrupted upon PARP inhibition, which raises the possibility that PARylated RNAPII recruits NELF\u2010E to DSBs. However, the contribution of other PARylated targets cannot be excluded.Rescue experiments with wild\u2010type and truncated mutants of NELF\u2010E show that both NELF\u2010E recruitment to DSBs and its repressive activity are required for transcriptional silencing at damage sites. Awwad et al also shed light on a possible interplay between different silencing mechanisms at DSBs. Epistasis analyses indicate that ATM, PARP, and NELF\u2010E may function in the same pathway, with PARP also regulating the recruitment of additional silencing factors like Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase and Polycomb Group proteins to DSBs 1. It will be important to further clarify potential cross talks between ATM\u2010, DNA\u2010PK\u2010, and PARP\u2010mediated silencing at DNA breaks, to understand in which context these signaling pathways are activated and fully grasp the complexity of the process.Finally, Awwad et al investigate the physiological relevance of NELF\u2010mediated silencing in response to DNA damage by assessing the importance of NELF\u2010E for DSB repair. NELF\u2010E knock\u2010down moderately increases cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and impairs DSB repair by homologous recombination and non\u2010homologous end\u2010joining 1. These results suggest that NELF\u2010E silencing activity at DSBs may be critical to promote repair, although this still needs to be formally demonstrated. Whether NELF\u2010E facilitates repair of only a subset of DSBs, as shown for other silencing factors 8, is an interesting hypothesis that deserves further investigation.Altogether, the results put forward NELF as a new player in the response to DSBs, a subcomplex of NELF\u2010A and NELF\u2010E being recruited to DSBs close to transcriptionally active genes to repress transcription and facilitate DSB repair (Fig \u200b(Fig1).1). This study thus brings a new piece to the puzzle of transcription regulation following DNA damage and also provides mechanistic insights into a possible tumor suppressive function for NELF.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Model for NELF\u2010mediated transcriptional silencing near DSBsUpon DSB induction near a transcriptionally active gene, PARP1 modifies RNAPII (1), which in turn recruits a NELF subcomplex comprising NELF\u2010A and E subunits (2). NELF blocks transcription elongation (3), thus facilitating DSB repair (4).It is worth pointing out that, in addition to DSB\u2010induced transcription silencing, small non\u2010coding RNAs are generated from the damaged locus in mammalian cells, promoting damage signaling and repair 2. It will be of major interest to investigate how silencing pathways activated in response to DSBs still allow the production of non\u2010coding transcripts at damage sites to shed new light on the complex relationship between transcription and the DNA damage response.
