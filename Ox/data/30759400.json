In BriefThe essential, uncharacterized Ipa1 protein was recently discovered to\ninteract with the Ysh1 endonuclease of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation\nmachinery. Pearson et al. propose that the Ipa1/Ysh1 interaction provides the\ncell with a means to coordinate and regulate transcription elongation with\n3\u2032 end processing in accordance with the cell\u2019s needs. Graphical Abstract INTRODUCTIONRNA polymerase II (Pol II) is responsible for synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA\nand several classes of non-coding RNAs. The Pol II transcription cycle on\nprotein-coding genes consists of three discrete stages (initiation, elongation, and\ntermination) that are distinguished from one another by the recruitment of specific\nsets of transcription co-factors, which differentially influence the behavior of Pol\nII and chromatin (Guo and Price, 2013; Porrua et al., 2016; Shandilya and Roberts, 2012). Upon productive initiation,\nthe Pol II transcription complex enters the elongation stage with the recruitment of\nfactors that assist in maintaining highly processive Pol II transcription throughout\nthe body of a gene. Once the poly(A) site at the gene\u2019s end is transcribed,\nPol II experiences a shift in processivity that is associated with the eviction of\nelongation factors and recruitment of termination and prem-RNA 3\u2032\nend-processing factors. The 3\u2032 end factors promote dismantling of the\ntranscription complex as well as polyadenylation of mRNAs of almost all genes in the\ntermination stage of the transcription cycle. Efficient removal of Pol II from\nchromatin requires cleavage of RNA at the poly(A) site by the yeast Ysh1 protein or\nits mammalian homolog CPSF73 to create an entry site for the Rat1/Xrn2 exonuclease\nthat co-transcriptionally degrades the polymerase-associated RNA (Eaton et al., 2018; Kim\net al., 2004b).Analysis of the association and dissociation of individual transcription\nfactors at a genome-wide level has enhanced our understanding of transcription cycle\ncontrol and has provided an intricate picture of rising and falling gradients of\ntranscription factors that associate with Pol II in a tightly coordinated\ntemporal-spatial manner (Kim et al., 2010;\nMayer et al., 2010). Transcriptome-wide\nstudies have revealed additional layers of regulation by illuminating the widespread\nuse of alternative polyadenylation sites to produce mRNAs subject to different\npost-transcriptional fates (Elkon et al.,\n2013; Tian and Manley, 2017).\nManipulating the levels of core components of the cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P)\ncomplex affects these poly(A) site choices in ways that resemble normal changes seen\nin different cell states. Our understanding about how sequences around poly(A) sites\ndetermines susceptibility to alterations in specific C/P subunits is growing but\nincomplete.In addition, newly discovered factors are enriching our perspective of the\ntranscriptional and co-transcriptional regulation paradigm. For example, mutation of\nthe previously uncharacterized, essential yeast IPA1 (Important for\nPolyAdenylation) gene causes defects in pre-mRNA 3\u2032 end processing in\naddition to a slow growth phenotype (Costanzo et al.,\n2016). Ipa1 physically interacts with only the Ysh1 and Mpe1 subunits of\nthe 15-subunit cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF), and IPA1\nmutants share many genetic interactions in common with genes involved in mRNA\n3\u2032 end processing (Casa\u00f1al et al.,\n2017; Costanzo et al., 2016). Ipa1\nshares sequence homology with HECT-like E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (Lutz et al., 2018) and has orthologs in higher\neukaryotes, indicating that it is evolutionarily conserved. UBE3D, the human\northolog, may be involved in cell-cycle regulation (Kobirumaki et al., 2005) and the immune response (Huang et al., 2015; Offenbacher et al., 2016). However, the mechanism by which Ipa1 affects\nmRNA synthesis has not been clarified.In our current work, we show that Ipa1 participates in both 3\u2032 end\nformation and transcript elongation and importantly could facilitate coordination of\nthese activities. Ipa1 promotes transcription termination and co-transcriptional\n3\u2032 end processing by maintaining wild-type levels of Ysh1, the conserved\nsubunit of CPF that cleaves pre-mRNA, and by contributing to proper CPF recruitment.\nLoss of Ipa1 function affects most mRNA genes to some extent but most strongly\naffects those with specific configurations of polyadenylation signals. Our findings\nalso reveal that Ipa1 mutation results in deficient transcription elongation.\nRestoration of Ysh1 levels rescues some but not all of the defects of the\nipa1-1 mutant, supporting a larger role for Ipa1 in addition to\nmaintenance of Ysh1 expression. We propose a model in which Ipa1 likely functions as\nan elongation factor while also serving as a molecular chaperone to deliver the Ysh1\nendonuclease to the poly(A) site for 3\u2032 end processing and transcription\ntermination. RESULTSLoss of Ipa1 Function Leads to Transcriptome-wide Reduction in\nPolyadenylation Activity and a Correlated Increased Average Length of\nmRNAsTo determine global changes in poly(A) processing caused by the\nipa1-1 mutation, we acquired the previously published\ngenome-wide poly(A) site mapping data for ipa1-1 and wild-type\n(WT) cells (Costanzo et al., 2016). This\nstudy showed a significant bias toward use of downstream poly(A) sites in the\nipa1-1 mutant, but features that determined an\nIpa1-responsive site were not evaluated. Because such information could give\nin-sights into how use of alternative poly(A) sites is regulated, we re-analyzed\nthese data as described below. All comparisons below were made based upon three\nipa1-1 samples and four WT samples. Previous genomic\nanalyses of poly(A) sites in S. cerevisiae have shown that the\nmajority map to the 3\u2032 UTR (Graber et\nal., 2013; Johnson et al.,\n2011; Liu et al., 2017; Ozsolak et al., 2010; Yoon and Brem, 2010), and we focused our analysis on\nthis category. For statistical robustness, we restricted analysis of 3\u2032\nUTR features to 4,377 genes that exceeded an arbitrary cutoff of at least 250\nsequence tags summed across all seven samples.We first characterized changes in the poly(A) site positions for each\ngene in order to derive the average 3\u2032 UTR length for that gene. After\ncalculating a genotype-specific weighted average 3\u2032 UTR length for each\ngene (STAR Methods), we used t test\n(2-sided, unequal variance) to compare the average 3\u2032 UTR lengths of the\nipa1-1 samples to the WT samples on a gene-by-gene basis.\nMore than half of the genes (2,399) passed a false discovery rate (FDR)\nthreshold of <0.2. Of these, 2,367 showed increased 3\u2032 UTR length\nin ipa1-1, while only 32 were decreased (Figure 1A), indicating that the dominant effect of the\nipa1-1 mutation is a general extension in transcript\nlength. This change is also evident when the transcriptome-wide distribution of\n3\u2032 UTR lengths is plotted for mutant and WT (Figure 1B). The 3\u2032 UTR lengths extend from a WT\nmedian length of 124 nt to an ipa1-1 median of 138 nt.\nSimilarly, the average length increased from 148 nt in WT to 164 nt in\nipa1-1 samples. The measured WT values are consistent with\nprevious studies (Graber et al., 2013;\nLiu et al., 2017). This analysis\nindicates that the ipa1-1 mutation results in an extension of\nthe 3\u2032 UTR length of over half of all genes on average.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Loss of Ipa1 Function Leads to Transcriptome-wide Reduction in\nPolyadenylation Activity and a Correlated Increased Average Length of\nmRNAs(A) Plot of change in the average 3\u2032 UTR length for each gene.\nEach gene is represented by a single point, with the change in 3\u2032 UTR in\nthe ipa1-1 mutant on the y reaxis and the WT average on the x\naxis. A t test on the average 3\u2032 UTR length was performed, followed by an\nFDR correction. Genes that pass a threshold of FDR <0.2 are highlighted\nin red.

The\nnumber of genes in each 10 nt bin of 3\u2032 UTR length is plotted for WT\n(black) and ipa1-1 (red). For the two plots in Figure 1B, a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test on the average 3\u2032 UTR lengths gives a D-statistic\n= 0.091, which for matched sample sizes of 4,377, gives a significance level for\nrejection of the null hypothesis (that the two length distributions are equal)\nof approximately 1.0e-16, indicating a significant difference in the WT and\nipa1-1 datasets.(C) Site-specific changes in polyadenylation processing probability\n(represented on the y axis as base-2 logarithm of the ratio of\nipa1-1 to WT probabilities) plotted against the WT\n3\u2032 UTR length. Each point represents a single poly(A) site. Significantly\naltered sites were identified based on a t test of calculated probabilities for\nfour WT replicates versus three ipa1-1 samples, followed by an\nFDR adjustment. Sites with an FDR <0.2 are highlighted as blue triangles.\nThose without significant changes are indicated in gray.(D) The span of poly(A) site distribution within each gene for WT cells\nis plotted, using the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 CPD, as described in (E), to\nmeasure the nucleotide separation between the 10th and\n90th percentiles.(E) Examples of the CPD of genes from each operational\nclasses\u2014tight unchanged, spread unchanged, tight elongated, and spread\nelongated. The average CPD illustrates how poly(A) site usage shifts in the\nipa1-1 mutant compared to WT. The CPD profiles were\ngenerated from genome-wide poly(A) site mapping of mRNA from WT and\nipa1-1 cells (Costanzo et\nal., 2016). TIpa1 Promotes Pol II Transcription Terminationhe CPD\nplot for each gene reads from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 through the gene and\nrepresents the empirical likelihood of polyadenylation at or before each\nposition in the transcript. The four WT replicates are traced in gray and the\nthree ipa1-1 replicates in light red, and the average is shown\nin black or red. The yellow bar represents the CDS.We also used the poly(A) sequence data to calculate how site-specific\npolyadenylation processing probability changed with the ipa1-1\nmutation. In brief, our model presumes 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 processing, such\nthat each site\u2019s processing probability can be estimated from the ratio\nof tag counts at the site to sum of tag counts for all sites further downstream\nwithin the same gene. We restricted the analysis to 14,965\n\u201cstrong\u201d poly(A) sites, defined as sites that had an average\nprocessing probability of greater than 0.10 in WT samples. We then used a t test\n(2-sided, unequal variance) to identify sites with a significant difference in\nestimated processing probability in ipa1-1 compared to WT.\nUnder these stringent restrictions, 637 sites had a significant variation (FDR\n<0.2), with 627 sites (from 534 genes) showing suppression (a reduction\nin polyadenylation processing probability) and 10 sites (from 8 genes) showing\nenhancement in the ipa1-1 mutant (Figure 1C). Thus, while the majority of sites could not pass a\nstringent test for variation, the subset that did pass were almost all\nsuppressed rather than enhanced. Suppression of sites, as well as lengthening of\nthe 3\u2032 UTR described above, is consistent with the general reduction in\nthe efficiency of polyadenylation in the ipa1-1 mutant that we\nhave reported previously (Costanzo et al.,\n2016).Specific Configurations of Poly(A) Signals Characterize Sites that Are Most\nSusceptible to the ipa1-1 MutantThe yeast poly(A) control sequence has been studied extensively (Graber et al., 2002; Shalem et al., 2015; Tian and Graber, 2012) and has been successfully modeled as a\nfive-component sequence element, as depicted in Table 1. (In the description that follows, analysis was performed on\ngenomic sequences, and we replace U with T in sequence descriptions.) These\ncomponents are (1) the \u201cefficiency element\u201d with optimal sequence\nTATATA and a broad positioning distribution that peaks 35\u201340 nt upstream\nof the poly(A) site, (2) the \u201cpositioning element\u201d with optimal\nsequence AATAAA and a location focused 10\u201330 nt upstream of the poly(A)\nsite, (3) an upstream T-rich element with optimal sequence TTTTTT 5\u201315 nt\nupstream of the poly(A) site, (4) the cleavage site, optimally a pyrimidine\nfollowed by one or more A residues, and (5) the downstream T-rich element, with\noptimal sequence TTTTTT, located 1\u201320 nt downstream of the poly(A) site.\nPrevious computational and mutagenesis studies (Graber et al., 2002; Guo and\nSherman, 1996; Moqtaderi et al.,\n2013; Shalem et al., 2015)\ndemonstrated that while an optimal configuration can be defined in terms of\nsequence and positioning, the sequences can be highly variable, with the total\nefficiency of a poly(A) signal being a complex mixture of all elements that\nremains poorly understood. Additionally, little is known in yeast about how\nspecific variations in sequence correlate with altered poly(A) site use caused\nby mutations of processing factors or changes in growth conditions.Table 1.Percentage of Sequences that Match Optimal Poly(A) Signal ElementsOpen in a separate windowipa1-1 VariationWT Poly(A) ConfignEfficiency \u221260 to \u221220\nTATATAPositioning \u221230 to \u221210\nAATAAAUpstream \u221215 to \u22125 TTTTTTCleavage Y-ADownstream +1 to +20 TTTTTTSuppressed site (elongated\ntranscript)spread77223.7 (L)a,b7.16.551.6 (L)a6.7 (L)a,btight17644.9 (H)a,b11.4 (H)a,b6.8 (H))a50.0 (L)a9.1Unchanged site (unchanged\ntranscript)spread91727.9 (L)a,b7.24.855.812.3 (H)a,btight39149.1 (H)a,b5.4 (L)a5.158.3 (H)a12.5 (H)aUnion of all sites2,25631.57.25.654.310.295% confidence interval29.6\u201333.46.1\u20138.24.6\u20136.552.3\u201356.48.9\u201311.4Open in a separate windowThe first row shows the optimal yeast poly(A) control elements and\nspacing.aValues that are higher (H) or lower (L), respectively, than the 95%\nconfidence interval calculated for the union of all sites.

The cases that are outside the 95% confidence interval, but\nnot p < 0.05, are all in the range 0.1 < p < 0.2, with\nthe exception of the upstream signal in suppressed-tight, where the\nrelatively smaller number of sites (176) is likely the cause.To determine which cis elements select a site for\nsusceptibility to Ipa1 deficiency, we segregated the 4,377 genes described above\nbased on two criteria. First, we classified genes into two categories (tight or\nspread) based on the distribution of their ensemble of poly(A) sites in WT\nsamples. For this classification, we used the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 cumulative\npolyadenylation distribution (CPD) (Graber et\nal., 2013) to measure the separation in nucleotides between the\n10th and 90th percentiles. Examples of CPD plots are\nshown in Figure 1E. Genes with a tight WT\nconfiguration (SSB1 and RPS3) have a single\ndominant poly(A) site (or cluster of closely spaced sites), whereas genes with a\nspread distribution (RPL26A and ARF1) have\nmultiple sites spread over a larger distance. Based on manual inspection of the\ndistribution of poly(A) site separation (Figure\n1D), we selected a threshold value of 15 nt to separate genes with a\n\u201ctight\u201d configuration from those with a \u201cspread\u201d\nconfiguration of poly(A) sites.We also segregated genes according to the mutationinduced change in\naverage 3\u2032 UTR length as either \u201celongated,\u201d\n\u201cunchanged,\u201d \u201ctruncated,\u201d or\n\u201cindeterminate,\u201d with \u201cindeterminate\u201d used for genes\nthat have too much within-genotype variability to pass a statistical test for a\nchange in 3\u2032 UTR length, but that also are too divergent to classify as\n\u201cunchanged.\u201d We focused on the following sets of genes: 2,010\nelongated genes (with 176 in a tight configuration and 1,834 in a spread\nconfiguration), and 1,319 unchanged genes (with 400 tight and 919 spread). We\ndid not pursue analysis of the 1,021 genes in the indeterminate category because\nof their variability and did not examine genes in the truncated category (32\ntotal) due to the low number of such genes.To further focus our sequence analysis, we reduced each gene to a single\npoly(A) site, using the specific poly(A) site within each gene that had the\nhighest calculated average poly(A) processing probability. For\nipa1-1 elongated genes in spread configuration, we added an\nadditional constraint, choosing only to work with sites that had both the\nhighest poly(A) probability in WT and the largest change in poly(A) probability\nin ipa1-1 compared to WT. This restriction reduced the size of\nthe elongated and spread dataset from 1,834 to 772 (and total number of\nelongated genes to 948) but increased the rigor of our analysis. Genes with a\ntight configuration are more highly expressed on average than those in the\nspread group, for both unchanged and elongated transcripts (Table S1).Motif analysis of yeast poly(A) signals with generalized pattern\nrecognition tools is difficult since the composite signal is a complex of\nAT-rich signals on the AT-rich background of 3\u2032 UTR sequences. Because we\nknow the optimal elements from previous studies, we focused our analysis to\nsearch sequences flanking poly(A) sites for the fraction of sequences that match\nthe known poly(A) control elements described above. For ease of presentation, we\ndiscuss the results of a search for the optimal variants (Table 1). However, searches for more divergent\nmatches showed consistent results (Table S2).A prominent overall feature of tight poly(A) sites is the high\npercentage of sites with an exact match to a TATATA efficiency element. This\ncharacteristic is seen regardless of whether the poly(A) site is suppressed or\nunchanged by the ipa1-1 mutation (45% and 49%, respectively,\nversus 31.5% of all sites, Table 1). In\ncontrast, spread poly(A) sites overall are less likely to have this element (24%\nfor suppressed sites and 28% for unchanged sites). Differences in other\ncomponents of the poly(A) signal are found when inspecting the elongated and\nunchanged gene sets. Suppressed spread sites, which give rise to elongated\ntranscripts, are characterized by a decreased likelihood to have a downstream\nT-rich element compared to unchanged spread sites (6.7% and 12.3%,\nrespectively). The suppressed tight sites are most notable for the increased\npresence of the AATAAA positioning element compared to unchanged tight sites\n(11.4% and 5.4%, respectively).In summary, our analysis indicates that the primary difference between\ngenes with a spread or tight configuration is the presence of a strong\nefficiency element (TATATA) in the tight group, suggesting that this motif\ncontributes to a strong overall poly(A) site and therefore a tight gene\ndistribution. The defining features of spread poly(A) sites that are suppressed\nby the ipa1-1 mutation are a significantly weaker downstream\nT-rich element and a some-what weaker efficiency element but a normal\npositioning and upstream T-rich elements. Interestingly, tight suppressed sites\nhave a stronger positioning element. Implications of these poly(A) sequence\ndifferences are further explored in the Discussion.The ipa1-1 Mutation Causes Pol II Enrichment Downstream of Most Poly(A)\nSitesGiven that the ipa1-1 mutant causes defects in cleavage\nand polyadenylation, we suspected that Ipa1 would participate in proper Pol II\ntranscription termination, as termination and processing are intricately\ncoordinated. To determine whether ipa1-1 exhibited termination\ndefects, we conducted a genome-wide survey of Pol II occupancy by performing\nchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments. To analyze the\ndata, we normalized the Pol II coverage in WT and ipa1-1 mutant\nbackgrounds to their respective inputs and generated log2 ratio profiles.Our analysis for four representative genes (RPS13,\nPMA1, ADE5,7, and\nGPM1) is shown in Figure\n2 and integrates the previously generated genome-wide poly(A) site\nmapping data (Costanzo et al., 2016) with\nour ChIP-seq analysis. For each gene, the top panel shows the\n5\u2032-to-3\u2032 CPD across each gene, with positions of the major poly(A)\nsites evident from a sharp increase in polyadenylation probability downstream of\nthe stop codon. The middle panel gives the Pol II occupancy across the gene for\nWT and ipa1-1. As expected, each gene shows a decline in Pol II\nbeyond the poly(A) site, indicative of transcription termination. The\nipa1-1 mutation causes gene-specific changes in average Pol\nII occupancy, decreasing for some such as PMA1, increasing for\nothers such as ADE5,7 and\nGPM1, or remaining the same, as with\nRPS13. Overall, there is a modest transcriptome-wide trend\ntoward decreased Pol II occupancy, with 58.6% of the genes showing a loss and\n41.4% showing an increase due to the ipa1-1 mutation. On the\nwhole, however, it is a small change, in that 84.4% of the genes show less than\n10% difference in Pol II enrichment (ipa1-1 versus WT) and 95%\nshow less than 20% difference. If we examine those with \u201clarger\nchange\u201d in Pol II occupancy, it is still modestly biased toward a loss in\nPol II enrichment, with 2.7% (157 out of 5,837 genes) showing a decrease of more\nthan 20% but only 2.3% (132 out of 5,837 genes) showing an increase of more than\n20%. Reduction in Pol II levels within the gene body has been previously\nobserved with mRNA 3\u2032 end-processing mutants (Eaton et al., 2018; Kuehner et al., 2017; Luna et al.,\n2005; Mapendano et al., 2010),\nand the decrease in some genes in ipa1-1 may be related to its\nprocessing defect.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.The ipa1-1 Mutation Causes Pol II Enrichment Downstream of\nMost Poly(A) Sites(A\u2013D) Analysis of poly(A) site distribution and Pol II occupancy\nof the RPS13 (A), PMA1 (B),\nADE5,7 (C), and GPM1 (D) genes using RNA\nsequencing data and ChIP-seq analysis.Top panel: the average CPD illustrates poly(A) site usage in the\nipa1-1 mutant compared to WT.

Plots are shown as the\naverage across all genes, with the lightly shaded areas representing the error\nbars shown as SEM.(F) Metagene analysis of differential Pol II occupancy at snoRNA genes\nin WT and ipa1-1 cells.To focus our analysis on changes in Pol II processivity rather than\noccupancy levels, we calculated the average Pol II enrichment across each\ngene\u2019s coding sequence for both WT and ipa1-1 and then\nused this ratio to scale the ipa1-1 plot, effectively\nnormalizing to equal Pol II occupancy. Examination of this normalized difference\nin Pol II occupancy reveals that the zone of termination expands downstream in\nipa1-1 for each gene (Figures\n2A\u20132D, bottom panels). To\nglobally assess termination defects, we generated anchor plots aligning the\nipa1-1:WT difference in Pol II occupancy to the poly(A)\nsite position for genes with unchanged sites and for those with suppressed sites\n(Figure 2E). Accumulation of Pol II\ndownstream of poly(A) sites is evident in the mutant for both sets of sites and\nextends until ~400 bp. It has been reported that in WT yeast, termination\noccurs within ~200 bp from the poly(A) site (Baejen et al., 2017; Schaughency et al., 2014). Our analysis shows that, in\nipa1-1, termination is delayed on most mRNA genes, as might\nbe expected if release of Pol II is delayed because 3\u2032 end cleavage is\nless efficient.Mutations in proteins needed for mRNA 3\u2032 end processing can also\ncause defects in termination at genes encoding small nucleolar (sno) RNAs (Garas et al., 2008; Mischo and Proudfoot, 2013). These genes are\ntranscribed by Pol II but their 3\u2032 ends are generated by termination or\nby RNase III-mediated cleavage, followed by exonuclease-mediated trimming of the\n3\u2032 end, and not by the cleavage machinery that acts on the yeast\nprotein-coding transcripts (Peart et al.,\n2013). We analyzed Pol II distribution on the 76 yeast snoRNA genes\nand found that, in the ipa1-1 mutant, the occupancy of Pol II\nincreased downstream of mapped snoRNA ends (Figure\n2F). Thus, Ipa1 is important for termination of both mRNA and snoRNA\ngenes.Ipa1 Promotes Pol II Transcription Termination on a Naked DNA\nTemplateTo assess the mechanisms by which Pol II termination is altered in the\nipa1-1 mutant, we first performed a multi-round in\nvitro transcription termination assay (Mariconti et al., 2010) using extracts prepared from\nthe WT and ipa1-1 strains. This assay uses two transcription\ntemplates constructed by Mariconti et al.\n(2010), which contain five tandem G-less cassettes of varying\nlengths. On one of the templates, the first two cassettes are separated from the\nlast three by a functional CYC1 poly(A) sequence element known\nto terminate transcription in vivo and in\nvitro (Figure 3A). Body\nradio-labeled RNAs transcribed from this template in extracts were digested with\nRNase T1, which cleaves only 3\u2032 of guanosines, and the resulting RNase\nT1-resistant G-less fragments were resolved by denaturing gel electro phoresis\n(Figure 3B). To measure transcriptional\nreadthrough, the radioactive signals of the bands corresponding to the cassettes\ndownstream of the CYC1 poly(A) element were normalized to that\nof the band corresponding to the 100 nt upstream cassette (Figure 3C). As shown previously (Mariconti et al., 2010; Pearson and Moore, 2014), the CYC1\npoly(A) element directs transcription termination, with only 5% of the\ntranscripts extending past the poly(A) site in the WT extract. However, roughly\n25% of the transcripts are extended in the ipa1-1 extract,\nindicating that Pol II termination in vitro is much less\nefficient in the mutant background and is defective in the absence of chromatin.\nExamination of a template lacking a CYC1 poly(A) site showed\nthat WT and ipa1-1 extracts have similar levels of Pol II\nprocessivity on a non-chromatin template (Figures\n3B and \u200band3D),3D), with no difference\nin signal even at the 145 nt cassette, which is located approximately 1.3 kb\nfrom the transcription start site.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Pol II Termination In Vitro Is Less Efficient in the\nipa1-1 Mutant(A) Tandem G-less cassette transcription template. The transcription\nstart site, the position, and lengths of the G-less cassettes, the position of\nthe inserted CYC1 terminator and location of the poly(A) site,\nand the distance in kilobases (kb) from the transcription start site to the end\nof the last cassette are indicated.

We examined the\nRPS13 gene, which shows a clear accumulation of Pol II\ndownstream of its poly(A) site in our ChIP-seq analysis but identical levels of\nPol II across the gene body (Figure 2A).\nChromatin immunoprecipitated by Pol II antibody was analyzed by qPCR using\nprimer pairs across RPS13 (Figure\n4A, top panel) to generate a snapshot of Pol II distribution along\nthis gene. Consistent with the ChIP-seq pattern for RPS13,\nthere was a 2- to 3-fold increase in Pol II occupancy 150 and 440 bp past the\npoly(A) site in ipa1-1 (primer pairs 1220 and 1507, Figure 4A).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.The ipa1-1 Mutant Causes Changes in Phosphorylation of Pol\nII CTD and Recruitment of the CPF 3\u2032 End-Processing Factor(A) Pol II occupancy in WT (solid gray) and ipa1-1\n(wavy lines) strains at indicated RPS13 positions. The top\npanel shows positions of primer pairs used in the ChIP analysis in base pairs\ndownstream of the start codon. Pol II signals were obtained with the 4H8\nantibody, which recognizes both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the\nCTD. The y axis indicates fold enrichment over the non-transcribed background\nsignal at the intergenic region on Chromosome V (ChrV), and error bars show SE\ncalculated from two or three independent biological replicates, each with two\ntechnical replicates.(B) Endogenous Ysh1 is depleted in the absence of functional Ipa1.\nWestern blots of extracts prepared from WT and ipa1-1 strains\nharboring either pRS315 or pRS315-Myc-YSH1 plasmids show the abundance of\nendogenous Ysh1, exogenous Myc-Ysh1, Pta1, and Rna15. Actin is included as a\nloading control. The Myc-Ysh1 band detected with the Ysh1 antibody is marked\nwith an asterisk.(C) Ser5P:Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 strains at\nRPS13 positions.(D) Ser2P:Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 strains at\nRPS13 positions.(E) Pta1:Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 strains at\nRPS13 positions.(F) Rna15:Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 strains at\nRPS13 positions.For (C\u2013F), ChIP was conducted with antibodies against Pta1,\nRna15, or Pol II CTD, and qPCR signals were normalized to that of Pol II. For\nthese and ChIP analyses presented in Figures\n5 and \u200band6,6, error bars show SE from\ntwo to four independent experiments.We also used ChIP to analyze the phosphorylation patterns of Ser2 and\nSer5 of the heptad repeat of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). This\nphosphorylation is coupled to transitions in transcription elongation to\ntranscription termination (Heidemann et al.,\n2013; Hsin and Manley, 2012).\nThe level of Ser5 phosphorylation, which does not affect C/P factor recruitment,\nis similar on RPS13 in WT and mutant backgrounds (Figure 4C). However, we found that Ser2\nphosphorylation levels, which are coupled to C/P factor recruitment, are reduced\nin the mutant throughout the RPS13 open reading frame (ORF) and\nespecially in the region downstream of the poly(A) site (Figure 4D).We next determined how well the C/P factors were recruited to\nRPS13 by examining the occupancy of Pta1, a subunit of CPF,\nand of Rna15, a subunit of CF IA, another factor needed for 3\u2032 end\nprocessing (Figures 4E and \u200band4F).4F). The Pta1 and Rna15 signals were normalized to Pol\nII in Figure 4A. Consistent with previous\nreports (Kim et al., 2004a; Mayer et al., 2012; Nedea et al., 2003), in WT cells, Pta1 and Rna15 are\nfound at low levels in the gene body and spike to a much higher level at the\ngene\u2019s 3\u2032 end. Interestingly, Pta1 recruitment to Pol II is\nstrongly reduced in the ipa1-1 mutant downstream of the poly(A)\nsite of RPS13 (Figure 4E).\nHowever, Rna15 is recruited to WT levels (Figure\n4F) in spite of the decrease in Ser2 phosphorylation. In summary, the\ntermination defect at RPS13 is correlated with a severe\nreduction in Ser2P and in CPF, but not in CF IA recruitment.Overexpression of the Ysh1 Endonuclease Rescues the ipa1-1 Termination\nDefectWe next confirmed by western blot with antibodies against Pta1 that the\nchange in recruitment of Pta1 to the RPS13 poly(A) site was not\ndue to a change in its relative abundance in ipa1-1 cells\n(Figure 4B, lanes 1 and 2). The Rna15\nlevel is also unchanged in ipa1-1. Recent work has demonstrated\na physical interaction between Ipa1 and Ysh1 (Casa\u00f1al et al., 2017; Costanzo\net al., 2016). Western blotting reveals that Ysh1 abundance is\nseverely reduced in ipa1-1 cells (Figure 4B, lanes 1 and 2). By poly(A) tag counts, the relative\namount of YSH1 mRNA, however, is not decreased in the\nipa1-1 mutant (Costanzo et\nal., 2016). In work to be described elsewhere (S.D.L. and C.L.M.,\nunpublished data), we find that Ysh1 is the only subunit of the processing\ncomplex that is decreased in the ipa1-1 mutant, and it is\nlikely that the Ipa1-Ysh1 interaction has a stabilizing effect on the Ysh1\nprotein. Introduction of additional copies of Myc-tagged YSH1\n(Myc-Ysh1) on a low-copy plasmid into WT and ipa1-1 cells\nincreases the level of the Ysh1 protein (Figure\n4B). When YSH1 is overexpressed in this way, the amount of Pol II\ndownstream of the RPS13 poly(A) site, as measured by ChIP-qPCR,\nis reduced almost to WT levels (Figures 5A\nand \u200band5B).5B). This result indicates that\nadditional copies of Ysh1 can restore transcription termination in the absence\nof functional Ipa1.Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Overexpression of the Ysh1 Endonuclease Rescues the ipa1-1\nTermination Defect(A and B) Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 strains\nharboring either pRS315 (A) or pRS315_Myc-YSH1 (B), respectively, at indicated\nRPS13 positions.(C and D) Myc-Ysh1:Pol II occupancy \u00a9 and Pta1:Pol II occupancy\n(D), respectively, in WT and ipa1-1 strains harboring\npRS315-Myc_YSH1. Error bars show standard error from two to four independent\nexperiments.To further dissect the connection between the Ipa1-Ysh1 interaction and\ntranscription termination, we examined the Myc-Ysh1 and Pta1 ChIP-qPCR profiles\nin WT and ipa1-1. Normalized to Pol II occupancy, Myc-Ysh1 is\nenriched in WT and mutant backgrounds downstream of the poly(A) site of\nRPS13 (Figure 5C),\nsuggesting that Myc-Ysh1 is recruited to the 3\u2032 end in the absence of\nfunctional Ipa1. Overexpression of YSH1 increases the\nrecruitment of Pta1 to the 3\u2032 end of RPS13 in the\nipa1-1 mutant (Figure\n5D), with the amount of Pta1 in this region now exceeding that seen\nin WT cells. This result is not due to an overall increase in the steady-state\nlevels of Pta1 in the cell (Figure 4B).\nThese findings indicate that while Pta1 occupancy and appropriate transcription\ntermination is recovered upon introduction of exogenous Myc-Ysh1 in\nipa1-1 cells, functional Ipa1 is necessary for balanced\nPta1 recruitment to Pol II.Ipa1 Facilitates Proper Transcription Elongation KineticsAlong with examining recruitment of processing factors, we determined\nwhether Ipa1 was recruited to actively transcribed chromatin in a pattern\nsimilar to that of the processing factors, as might be expected from the\nphysical interaction between Ipa1 and Ysh1 (Costanzo et al., 2016). We tagged a chromosomal copy of\nIPA1 with Myc and performed ChIP-qPCR. Using the\nPMA1 gene as an example, we found that Ipa1 localizes to\nthe coding sequence and 3\u2032 UTR of the PMA1 locus (Figure 6B) and is thus associated with\ntranscriptionally active chromatin. Subunits of the C/P complex typically show\nsome ChIP signal in the body of actively transcribed genes but spike in\noccupancy at the 3\u2032 end (Kim et al.,\n2004a; Nedea et al., 2003). We\nobserved this pattern for Pta1 and Rna15 on PMA1, with the\nspike occurring at position 3347 (Figure\n6B). However, unlike Pta1 and Rna15, Ipa1 occupancy begins to decline at\nposition 3347, a point where there is also a large decrease in Pol II occupancy\n(Figure 6C).Open in a separate windowFigure 6.IPA1 Facilitates Proper Transcription Elongation\nKinetics(A) Positions of primer pairs used in ChIP analysis in base pairs\nrelative to the start codon of PMA1.(B) Pta1, Rna15, and Ipa1-Myc occupancy across the\nPMA1 gene in WT cells.(C) Pol II occupancy across the PMA1 gene in WT\ncells.(D) Serial dilution spot assay of WT and mutant strains on media in the\nabsence or presence of 6-AU at the indicated temperatures.(E) Overexpression of exogenous Ysh1 cannot rescue the 6-azauracil\nsensitivity in the absence of Ipa1. A serial dilution spot assay was performed\nusing IPA1 and ipa1-1 strains harboring the 2\nmm, high-copy pRS425 or pRS425-YSH1 plasmids on media in the absence and\npresence of 6-AU.(F) Schematic of the galactose-inducible YLR454 locus.(G and H) Pol II occupancy in WT and ipa1-1 at the\nindicated YLR454 positions in (G) galactose (0\u2019 glucose)\nand or (H) 4 min after glucose addition (4\u2019 glucose).Error bars show standard error from two to four independent\nexperiments.The similarity between the chromatin occupancy patterns of Ipa1 and\nknown elongation factors (Kim et al.,\n2004a; Mayer et al., 2010)\nsuggests that Ipa1 might influence transcription elongation in addition to\ntermination. To address this question, we spotted serial dilutions of WT and\nipa1-1 cells on a medium containing 6-azauracil (6-AU), a\nchemical that depletes intracellular GTP and UTP pools and can exaggerate\ntranscription elongation defects (Gaillard et\nal., 2009; Powell and Reines,\n1996; Riles et al., 2004). The\nipa1-1 strain is very sensitive to 6-AU, suggesting that\ntranscription elongation is affected on a global scale in this mutant (Figure 6D). To further delineate the defect,\nwe examined two mRNA 3\u2032 end-processing mutants\n(cft2\u20131 and pcf11\u20132) that\nhave the same strain background as our ipa1-1 mutant. All three\nmutants are thermosensitive for growth at 37\u00b0C (Figure 6D, right-hand panel), and we have previously\ndemonstrated that these mutants are all defective for cleavage and\npolyadenylation in vitro, with cft2\u20131\nbeing much more impaired compared to ipa1-1 and\npcf11\u20132 (Costanzo et\nal., 2016). We found that 6-AU sensitivity does not correlate with\nthe 3\u2032 end-processing defect, as cft2\u20131 shows no\ngrowth inhibition, pcf11\u20132 shows intermediate\ninhibition, and ipa1-1 shows severe inhibition (Figure 6D, middle panel).To confirm an effect on elongation, we employed a ChIP-based in\nvivo transcription assay, which measures Pol II kinetics (Mason and Struhl, 2005). This assay relies\non the GAL1 promoter fused to a naturally occurring, long ORF\nin yeast, YLR454, as a means to activate transcription via\ngalactose induction and to shut off transcription via addition of glucose (Figure 6F). Using primer pairs at 2 kb\nintervals, the last wave of transcribing Pol II molecules along\nYLR454 can be observed upon glucose shutoff. In the\npresence of galactose, Pol II occupancy is observed at relatively even levels\nalong the ORF in the WT and ipa1-1 backgrounds (Figure 6G). This result suggests that Pol II\nprocessivity through chromatin is similar between the two strains and\ncorroborates the observation that Pol II has similar processivity on a naked DNA\ntemplate in both WT and mutant extracts (Figure\n3). Four minutes after glucose addition, Pol II occupancy in WT is\nreduced 5- to 6-fold over the entire length of the gene, when compared to that\nin galactose, as transcription is shut off (Figure\n6H). In ipa1-1, Pol II occupancy is reduced at the\n5\u2032 end of the ORF compared to growth in galactose but increases toward\nthe 3\u2032 end of the ORF (Figure 6H).\nThis striking Pol II occupancy pattern represents the last wave of Pol II\nmolecules transcribing to the end of the ORF once transcription has been shut\noff. This observation is in agreement with the observed 6-AU sensitivity and\nindicates that Ipa1 participates in maintaining proper Pol II transcription\nelongation in vivo.To determine whether restoration of Ysh1 expression could also rescue\nthe ipa1-1-mediated elongation defect, we tested the growth of\ncells expressing plasmid-borne YSH1 on a 6-AU-containing\nmedium. Extra copies of Ysh1 produced from a high-copy plasmid could not relieve\nthe 6-AU sensitivity of ipa1-1 (Figure 6E), suggesting that, while the transcription termination\nactivity is dependent upon Ysh1 (and can be restored without functional Ipa1),\nfunctionally intact Ipa1 is critical for transcription elongation. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe an unexpected interaction by which the cell uses\nthe Ipa1 protein to coordinate and balance transcription and pre-mRNA processing,\nthus insuring proper gene expression. Ipa1 was originally identified as important\nfor mRNA polyadenylation (Costanzo et al.,\n2016), but the mechanism by which it exerted this effect was not known.\nHere, we show that inactivation of Ipa1 causes a severe reduction in Ysh1, the\nendonuclease that cleaves the pre-mRNA precursor at the poly(A) site. This loss of\nYsh1 leads to diminished recruitment of CPF to the 3\u2032 ends of genes and to\ntermination defects. Importantly, we find that the role of Ipa1 extends beyond\nacting at the 3\u2032 end of genes, with Ipa1 promoting the elongation phase of\nthe Pol II transcription cycle. Restoring expression of Ysh1 to\nipa1-1 mutant cells permits accumulation of CPF in the\n3\u2032 UTR and concomitant rescue of the defective termination phenotype. Despite\nthe recovered termination activity, the restoration of Ysh1 alone is insufficient to\nrescue the 6-AU sensitivity of ipa1-1, which may instead reflect a\nfunction of Ipa1 at other steps in gene expression.Ipa1 Associates with Chromatin in the Manner of an Elongation Factor and Loss\nof Ipa1 Function Impairs ElongationWe have shown that Ipa1 is recruited to chromatin over the entire length\nof a gene\u2019s ORF, with reduction in occupancy beyond the poly(A) site. We\ninterpret this result to mean that Ipa1 associates with actively transcribed\nchromatin during early elongation and dissociates during pre-mRNA 3\u2032 end\nprocessing and termination, a pattern that resembles that of known elongation\nfactors (Kim et al., 2004a; Mayer et al., 2010). The defect in\nelongation kinetics that we observe in ipa1-1 is also\nconsistent with Ipa1 functioning at the elongation step. We do not observe an\nelongation defect in transcription assays using cell extract, indicating that\nloss of Ipa1 function impedes Pol II progression through chromatin but not on a\nnaked DNA template. In further support of the role of Ipa1 in elongation, loss\nof the Cdc73 subunit of the Paf1 complex (Paf1C), a crucial elongation factor,\ndisplays a synthetic lethal genetic interaction with the ipa1-1\nmutation (van Pel et al., 2013),\nsuggesting that Ipa1 and Paf1C operate in overlapping or parallel pathways. The\nipa1-1 mutant also exhibits a negative genetic interaction\nwith the capping enzyme subunit Ceg1 (Costanzo et\nal., 2016). Ceg1 recruits a second subunit, Cet1, which in turn\npromotes the transition to elongation (Sen et\nal., 2017).By serving as an elongation factor, Ipa1 might facilitate the coupling\nof transcription and mRNA 3\u2032 end maturation. Insight into how this could\nhappen comes from recent structural analysis of CPF showing that the nuclease,\npoly(A) polymerase, and phosphatase activities of CPF are organized into three\nmodules (Casa\u00f1al et al., 2017). An\nearlier study has shown that Cft1, a key scaffolding protein of the polymerase\nmodule, physically interacts with Paf1C (Nordick\net al., 2008). As an elongation factor (Costa and Arndt, 2000; Squazzo et al., 2002; Tomson and Arndt, 2013; Tous et al.,\n2011), Paf1C closely associates with the transcription complex\nshortly after promoter escape and dissociates near the poly(A) site (Kim et al., 2004a; Mayer et al., 2010). Similar to Ipa1, Paf1C also\ninfluences 3\u2032 end activities and is needed for proper levels of CTD Ser2\nphosphorylation (Chen et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2004; Nordick et al., 2008; Penheiter et al., 2005; Yu et al.,\n2015). Nordick et al. proposed that Paf1C recruits Cft1 early on to\nthe elongation complex, travels with the transcriptional apparatus in a complex\nwith Cft1, and then dissociates, leaving Cft1 behind with the transcription\ncomplex once the poly(A) site has been transcribed. Similarly, the CF IA factor\nmay be assembled only after the poly(A) site is reached. A study of the\ninteraction of the CF IA subunit Pcf11 with the export factor Yra1 suggests that\nPcf11 hands off Yra1 to the mRNP assembly apparatus before joining Clp1, Rna14,\nand Rna15 (the remaining CF IA subunits) to function in processing at the\npoly(A) site (Johnson et al., 2011). An\nassociation with the Spt5 elongation factor helps bring Rna14, Rna15, and Clp1\nto transcribed genes to promote termination (Baejen et al., 2017; Mayer et al.,\n2012).Ipa1 associates with the Ysh1 and Mpe1 subunits of the CPF nuclease\nmodule, but not with Cft2, the remaining component of this module, or with other\nproteins in the C/P complex (Casa\u00f1al et\nal., 2017; Costanzo et al.,\n2016). These studies suggest that Ipa1 is not a stable component of\nCPF but exists in a complex with Ysh1, Mpe1, and possibly other\nnot-yet-identified proteins. In a fashion analogous to those described above,\nthe Ipa1 elongation factor may travel with the transcription machinery in a\ncomplex with Ysh1 and Mpe1 and subsequently deliver these proteins to the\npoly(A) site once it is exposed. Timely delivery would allow tightly coordinated\nassembly of the rest of the CPF into a fully functional processing\napparatus.A consequence of the ipa1-1 mutation is increased\nretention of Pol II beyond poly(A) sites, and overexpression of\nYSH1 can rescue this defect on the RPS13\ngene. This finding supports the conclusions drawn from other studies that\nmutation or loss of Ysh1 or its CPSF73 mammalian homolog causes termination\ndefects on mRNA-encoding genes (Baejen et al.,\n2017; Eaton et al., 2018; Garas et al., 2008; Nojima et al., 2013; Schaughency et al., 2014). Ysh1/CPSF-73 is also important for\ntermination of snoRNA genes in budding yeast (Garas et al., 2008) and in fission yeast (Larochelle et al., 2018). Therefore, the Ysh1\ndepletion caused by the Ipa1 mutation may explain the delayed termination of Pol\nII at both mRNA and snoRNA genes.Sequence Dependency of Poly(A) Processing in Response to Ipa1 Mutation\nSuggests a Mechanism for Site-Specific TuningEfficient mRNA 3\u2032 end processing requires several contacts\nbetween the processing complex and specific RNA sequences surrounding the\npoly(A) site, as depicted in Table 1 for\nyeast. A composite of these elements will determine the strength of a particular\nsite, and variations likely affect how well the processing complex assembles\naround the poly(A) site and how Ysh1 is positioned to carry out its function in\ncleavage. The UAUAUA efficiency element has been shown to most strongly\ncorrelate with the amount of protein expression (Shalem et al., 2015), and our analysis indicates that it is also\ncritical in determining whether cleavage of the mRNA 3\u2032 end is tightly\nfocused or instead spread over tens or hundreds of nucleotides. We also found\nthat sites most likely to be resistant to the ipa1-1 mutation,\nregardless of whether they have a tight or spread configuration, have a good\nmatch to the downstream U-rich motif. As evident from the tightly focused\nipa1-1-suppressed sites (Table 1), even a combination of strong UAUAUA and A-rich elements\ncannot compensate for a poor downstream element. In yeast, mRNA polyadenylation\nis performed by a complex of Hrp1, which binds to the UAUAUA motif, and two\nmulti-subunit factors, CPF and CF IA. If the ipa1-1 mutation\ncauses a scarcity of intact CPF, those sites that can most stably recruit CPF\nare likely to be processed more efficiently and accurately in the mutant. Our\nanalysis indicates that the downstream U-rich motif is critical for this\nrecruitment, possibly through interaction the Cft2 subunit of CPF and Rna15 of\nCF IA, which crosslink to this element in vivo (Baejen et al., 2014).Several mammalian studies have shown that alternative polyadenylation\ncan be regulated by the amount of core C/P subunits, and that the poly(A) sites\nmost affected by loss of subunits such as hFip1 and CFIM 68 are\nenriched in the binding sites for these factors, and therefore more dependent on\nthese proteins for 3\u2032 end processing (Lackford et al., 2014; Li et al.,\n2015; Tian and Manley, 2017).\nAlternatively, affected poly(A) sites may have poorer matches to the preferred\nbinding sequence, as has been seen for CstF64/CstF64\u03c4 depletion (Yao et al., 2013). In agreement with these\nstudies, our analysis indicates that the 3\u2032 end processing of a\ngene\u2019s transcript can be exquisitely tunable depending on the nature of\nthe polyadenylation signals that specify each poly(A) site.Historically, studies and modeling of multi-partite regulatory sequences\nhave necessarily treated variation from the optimal sequence as random noise.\nHowever, our results and those described above suggest that such variations are\npart of regulatory mechanisms that facilitate changes in gene expression. In our\nexperimental system, Ipa1 and Ysh1 expression was lost through mutation, but\ntheir expression might also be modulated naturally by the cell in response to\nenvironmental change. Our findings suggest that these changes would target a\nspecific subset of all poly(A) sites as part of the cellular response. It will\nbe interesting in the future to determine whether mutations in other RNA-binding\nsubunits of the yeast C/P complex affect specific subsets of genes, and whether\nrubrics developed from such analyses will allow prediction of which specific C/P\nproteins are likely to be regulated when the cell state changes.In summary, we propose that the Ipa1/Ysh1 interaction provides the cell\nwith a means to coordinate transcription elongation with pre-mRNA 3\u2032 end\nprocessing and perhaps simultaneously regulate both of these steps in mRNA\nsynthesis according to the cell\u2019s needs. In our current study, we have\nfound that inactivation of Ipa1 impairs elongation. Thus, if the cell needs to\nslow mRNA synthesis, a decrease of Ipa1 and the subsequent decrease of Ysh1\nwould correspondingly slow both elongation and processing. We have recently\nreported that a mutation in Ysh1 that is defective for 3\u2032 end processing\nalso causes slower elongation (McGinty et al.,\n2017). This finding, together with earlier studies showing that\nmutations in CF IA also cause elongation defects (Luna et al., 2005; Tous et al., 2011), suggests that a poorly functioning processing\ncomplex can also feedback to slow elongation.Ipa1 is conserved in higher eukaryotes, including humans, and the human\northolog of Ipa1, UBE3D, was found to physically interact in quantitative\nproteomics screens (Hein et al., 2015;\nHuttlin et al., 2017) with CPSF73,\nthe ortholog of Ysh1. This evidence points to the potential of a highly\nconserved mechanism of transcriptional and 3\u2032 end RNA processing control\nimparted by the interaction between Ipa1/UBE3D and Ysh1/CPSF73. Future\ninvestigations may reveal a widespread \u201cmolecular chaperone\u201d\nmechanism in which critical subunits of co-transcriptional complexes are\naccompanied by transcription elongation factors and are subsequently delivered\nto their specific sites of action in a spatially and temporally coordinated\nmanner.

Yeast were grown in YPAD (YPD supplemented with adenine)\nrich medium or in Complete Media minus uracil or leucine at 30\u00b0C and\nas indicated, shifted to the non-permissive temperature of 37\u00b0C for 1\nhour. For spot growth assays, 5 or 10-fold dilutions were prepared in a 96\nwell plate prior to using a replica pin plater to spot cultures onto agar\nplates. For the YSH1 overexpression studies, yeast were\ntransformed with the indicated plasmids and transformants selected on\nselective medium.Bacterial strains DH5\u03b1 cells were grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C and used to\npropagate plasmids.METHOD DETAILSIn vitro transcription assay To generate extract for in vitro transcription,\nyeast (1 l) were grown to an OD600 of 2.0\u20135.0. The cells were\nharvested and resuspended in one volume of AGK buffer [20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH\n7.9; 200 mM KCl; 1.5 mM Mg2Cl; 10% glycerol; 0.5 mM Dithiotreitol\n(DTT)] supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).\nCells were frozen in droplets in liquid nitrogen and lysed with\ncryo-grinding. The thawed lysate was cleared with ultracentrifugation first\nat 31,000 rpm in the TLA 100.3 rotor for 30 minutes and then at 65,000 rpm\nin the same rotor for 1 hour. Proteins in the cleared lysate were\nprecipitated with 0.24 mg/ml finely ground ammonium sulfate (40% saturation)\nwith stirring on ice for 30 minutes. The ammonium sulfate pellet was\ncollected with ultracentrifugation at 31,000 rpm in the TLA 100.3 rotor for\n20 minutes and was carefully resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of D-alternative\nbuffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 75 mM potassium acetate; 1.5 mM magnesium\nacetate; 20% glycerol; 1 mM DTT) per ml of sample prior to ammonium sulfate\nprecipitation. The resuspension was dialyzed three times against 600 mL of\nD-alternative buffer, for one hour each time, and cleared with\ncentrifugation for 2 minutes at 15,000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nThe extracts were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at\n\u221280\u00b0C. Addition of ammonium sulfate (final concentration of\n0.5 M) to the freshly lysed cells and incubation at 4\u00b0C, with\nrocking, prior to centrifugation resulted in transcriptionally inactive\nextract. Transcription reactions were performed as described previously\n(Mariconti et al., 2010), except\nthat 100 mg extract and 0.5 mg plasmid DNA were used. The\ntranscription-template plasmids pKS708 and pKS710 were kind gifts of\nBernhard Dichtl (Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich). RNA products were\ndigested with T1 RNase, and the fragments resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide/7\nM urea gel. After Phosphorimager detection, the radioactive intensities of\neach band were measured using ImageQuant software and were normalized to the\n100 nt G-less cassette band to calculate the termination efficiency at each\ndownstream G-less cassette. Averages were generated from three independent\nexperiments.Yeast extract preparation and western blotting For determination of total protein levels, cell extracts were\nprepared as described by Zhao et al. (Zhao\net al., 1999) from cell cultures grown to mid-log phase at\n30\u00b0C. Fifty micrograms of each extract was resolved onto a 10%\npolyacrylamide/Bis-Tris-MOPS gel (https://openwetware.org/wiki/Sauer:bis-Tris_SDS-PAGE,_the_very_best#Running).\nThe electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blots\nwere probed with the indicated antibodies against Ysh1, Myc, Pta1, Rna15 and\nactin.Chromatin Immunopreciptation (ChIP), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and\nChIP-seq Yeast cells (50 ml) were grown to OD600 of 0.5, shifted\nto 37\u25cbC for 1 hour, fixed with 1.035% formaldehyde for 15\nminutes and neutral-ized with 0.135 M glycine for 5 minutes. Washed cells\nwere lysed in FA-lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9; 150 mM NaCl; 1%\nTriton X-100; 1 mM EDTA; 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) with grinding\nin liquid nitrogen. Crosslinked chromatin was sheared in a final volume of\n500 \u03bcL FA-lysis buffer in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube using a Branson\nwater bath sonicator at 4\u00b0C for 8 minutes. Two hundred ml of\npre-cleared sheared chromatin were immunoprecipitated with 15 \u03bcL\nprotein A beads pre-equilibrated with the respective antibody, as indicated\nin the figure legends. For the IgM H5 anti-Ser2P antibody, Anti-mouse IgM\n\u2013 Agarose beads were used. Antibodies used in the ChIP analysis\ninclude the anti-pan CTD mouse monoclonal antibody, 4H8 (Santa Cruz); the\nanti-Rna15 rabbit polyclonal antibody and the anti-Pta1 rabbit polyclonal\nantibody (generous gifts of Horst Domdey); the anti-Myc clone E10 mouse\nmonoclonal antibody (in house); the 3E8 anti-Ser5P antibody (Active Motif);\nand the H5 anti-Ser2P antibody (Covance). Five microliters of each Ab was\nused per IP. SamSamples were rotated 4\u20135 hours at 4\u00b0C. The\nbeads were washed once with each of the following buffers: FA-lysis buffer +\n275 mM NaCl; FA-lysis buffer + 500 mM NaCl; LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM\nEDTA, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0); and 10 mM\nTris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA. Upon washing, chromatin was eluted with 250 \u03bcL TE\n+ 1% SDS with incubation at 65\u00b0C for 20 minutes followed by a rinse\nin 250 \u00b0L TE. Samples were treated with Proteinase K for 1 hour at\n42\u00b0C and de-crosslinked at 65\u00b0C overnight. LiCl (to 0.4 M) and\n20 mg glycogen were added prior to DNA purification. DNA was purified with\nphenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was resuspended\nin 200 \u03bcL qPCR-grade water.Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted in 20 \u03bcL reaction\nvolumes consisting of SYBR Green PCR master mix (BioRad), 0.5 mM primers\n(Table S4) and\n2 \u03bcL of IP or input samples. Up to 40 cycles were used for each\nexperiment. The relative occupancy was calculated as a percentage of input\nusing the equation: \u0394Ct = 2^-(IPCt \u2212\ninputCt). Average relative occupancy values are presented,\nand the error bars represent the standard deviation from these average\nvalues generated from two to four independent experiments.For ChIP-seq experiments, yeast cultures were scaled up to 400 mL\nand were fixed and lysed as described above. The resulting 4 mL chromatin\nwere incubated with 40 \u03bcL 4H8 antibody and 200 \u03bcL pre-washed\nprotein G beads for 5 hours at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed as\ndescribed above and were then eluted in two steps: 1) in 150 \u03bcL TE +\n1% SDS at 65\u00b0C for 15 minutes, and 2) in 150 \u03bcL TE + 0.67% SDS\nat 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Samples were de-crosslinked overnight at\n65\u00b0C and then treated with Proteinase K for 2\u20134 hours at\n42\u25cbC. LiCl (to 0.4 M), 20 mg glycogen and 1 mL 100%\nethanol were added to precipitate the DNA. The DNA pellets were washed in\n70% ethanol and were further purified using MinElute columns (QIAGEN). The\neluted DNA was submitted to the Tufts Genomics Core Facility for TruSeq ChIP\nlibrary preparation and for 50 nt single-end sequencing on the Illumina\nHiSeq 2500 system.For the in vivo RNA Pol II elongation assay,\nexperiments were performed essentially as described previously (Mason and Struhl, 2005). To assay\nelongation on the YLR454 gene, two strains were created\nfrom the WT and ipa1-1 strains by single-step integration\nof a TRP1 plasmid containing the GAL1\npromoter fused to the 5\u2032-most 300 bp of the YLR454w\nopen-reading frame into the YLR454w locus. These strains\nwere grown to early mid-log in raffinose-containing minimal medium, induced\nwith 2% galactose for 2.5 hours, shifted to the non-permissive temperature\nfor 1 hour and spiked with 2% glucose for 4 minutes before fixation with 1%\nformaldehyde. ChIP was performed with the anti-pan CTD mouse monoclonal\nantibody.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISComputational analysis of poly(A) site usage FASTQ file pre-processing For all analyses, we used the poly(A) site mapping datasets\nobtained previously for IPA1 and\nipa1-1 cells (Costanzo et al., 2016). All comparisons below were made\nbased upon three ipa1-1 samples (labeled TS1248 in the\noriginal data) and four BY4741 wild-type (WT) (labeled BY in the\noriginal data) samples. These samples showed a minor batch effect (data\nnot shown), but all were used in our analysis. In brief, the sequence\ntags were preprocessed to reduce them to a non-redundant set, aligned to\nthe yeast genome (sacCer3), and then post-processed to generate\nsample-specific maps of the poly(A) sites for each yeast protein-coding\ngene. For statistical robustness, we restricted analysis of\n3\u2032-UTR features to 4377 genes that exceeded an arbitrary cutoff\nof at least 250 sequence tags summed across all seven samples.Because poly(A)-site sequences have a very different\ndistribution than standard RNaseq data, specifically in that the poly(A)\nsite sequence data have much higher redundancy, we used the following\nprocedure for our analysis. Each sequence fragment is putatively a\nreverse-complement read with the first base corresponding to the last\nbase before addition of the poly(A) tail with subsequent reads\nprogressing upstream of the poly(A) site. Sequences were first trimmed\nof any leading T bases because they are ambiguous as to whether they are\nof genomic origin, and then trimmed to a common length of 30 nt, a\nlength chosen as a tradeoff between uniqueness and ease of computational\nmanipulation. Each sequence set was then condensed to only its unique\nsequence \u201ctags\u201d while retaining the exact count of how\nmany times the sequence occurred in the set. This removal of sequence\nredundancy necessarily means that quality scores were discarded, but we\noperated from the presumption that the statistics of the occurrence of\neach tag and its near matches (representing putative errors) would\nadequately compensate for the absence of quality data. Sequence tags\nwere sorted in decreasing order of occurrence and relabeled according to\nthe pattern \u201cseq_N_C\u201d where N was the rank in terms of\nabundance, and C was the count. The resulting dataset was stored as a\nfasta sequence file.Alignment to the yeast genome The reduced sequence tag set was aligned with the sensitive\nalignment program blat (Kent,\n2002) using custom parameters \u201c-t=dna -q=dna\n-tileSize=10 -stepSize=3 -minIdentity=85 -minScore=24\u201d which were\nmanually optimized to align the maximal number of short tags. The target\nfor alignment was a composite file consisting of the\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome, version 3\n(saccer3), combined with the sequence of the yeast 2 micron plasmid.Alignment post-processing to count tags at putative poly(A)\nsites Custom perl and c++ programs were created to post process the\nblat-produced psl files through the following steps. (1) count and\nrecord the number of times each tag aligned to the genome, (2) count and\nrecord the number of tags that aligned at each position in the genome,\n(3) merge the results of the first two steps with the count of each tag\nin the dataset to finally generate a file that scored each putative\npoly(A) site in the genome by the total number of tags that aligned\nthere, the total number of distinct sequences represented within those\ntags, and the average number of times this set of tags aligned across\nthe genome. For statistical robustness, we restricted analysis of\n3\u2032-UTR features to 4377 genes that exceeded an arbitrary cutoff\nof at least 250 sequence tags summed across all seven samples.Assignment of putative sites to genes and other genomic\nfeatures The genomic locations of putative poly(A) sites were assigned in\ntwo distinct manners. First the closest properly oriented mRNA gene was\nchosen, based up on the distance to the stop codon. Second the closest\ngenomic feature of any type was also identified. Annotations were taken\nfrom the table SGD_features.tab, downloaded from the yeastgenome.org website in January\n2013, and merged with the set of SUT and CUT genes as reported by Xu et\nal. (Xu et al., 2009). In this\nfirst assignment, no distance restrictions were imposed.We examined various means of assigning aligned tags to\nneighboring genes, specifically comparing using only protein-coding\ngenes versus using protein-coding genes combined with known CUT and SUT\ntargets and concluded that use of protein-coding genes was more likely\nto be an accurate reflection of the molecular changes in\nipa1-1 mutants. This conclusion was based on manual\nexamination of the CUT and SUT transcripts that were identified as\nsignificantly changed between samples in a preliminary analysis\nperformed with DEseq2 (Love et al.,\n2014). In nearly all cases, the SUT or CUT transcript (a) was\nincreased in apparent expression in ipa1-1 compared to\nWT, (b) showed very low expression in the WT, and (c) was situated on\nthe genome in a configuration downstream on the same strand and\nrelatively close (typically tens of nucleotides) to a relatively highly\nexpressed protein-coding gene. These findings, taken in the context of\nour broader finding that ipa1-1 mutation leads to a\ngeneral lengthening of transcripts from the majority of yeast genes, led\nus to conclude that the sequence tags in question were more likely to\nhave been generated from extended transcripts of the coding gene than\nincreased initiation at the SUT or CUT genes. Accordingly, we\nsubsequently carried out all subsequent analysis with assignment of\npoly(A) sequence tags to the nearest properly oriented protein-coding\ngene.Extraction of flanking sites and filtering of putative false priming\nevents and restriction by distance to genes For final analysis of expression levels and poly(A) site usage,\nputative processing sites were limited to those which had 8 or fewer A\nor G residues in the next 10 nucleotides downstream. In addition, sites\nwere limited to those that occurred between 80 nt upstream of the start\ncodon and 1000 nt downstream of the stop codon. While these limitations\nmight eliminate some true sites, previous studies (Graber et al., 1999; van Helden et al., 2000) suggest that the\nfraction lost will be well below 10%. Finally, multi-alignment tags were\nnot eliminated, but were instead scaled through multiplication by the\ninverse of the average number of genomic alignments for tags at the\nsite.Calculation of average UTR length for each gene For each individual gene within each sample dataset, the average\n3\u2032-UTR length was computed as a weighted average of the\n3\u2032-UTR length of all transcripts associated with the gene,\nrestricting the analysis to only tags in the 3\u2032-UTR, with Equation 1, where\n<U> is the average 3\u2032-UTR\nlength, the summations are all over all 3\u2032-UTR polyA sites, and\nUi and\nni are respectively the\n3\u2032-UTR length and number of sequence tags associated with polyA\nsite i.\u2329U\u232a=\u2211i=sitesUini\u2211i=sitesniequation 1Calculation of site-specific polyadenylation probability For each putative poly(A) site within each individual gene\nwithin each sample dataset, a poly(A) probability was calculated based\non the rationale that transcripts are processed from 5\u2032 to\n3\u2032 and that at each site, the probability represents the choice\nbetween 3\u2032 end processing or extension of the transcript further\nin the downstream (3\u2032) direction. In this model, the processing\nprobability is independent of upstream (5\u2032) sites, and is\nestimated by the ratio of the count of tags at the current site to the\nsum of all tags counted from the current site to the 3\u2032-most site\nassociated with the gene. For numerical robustness, a Bayesian prior was\nincorporated, using the same counts (at the site and downstream) summed\nfor the same gene across all samples in the experiment and down-weighted\nby a factor of 0.01, as shown in Equation 2, where\nni is the tag count at\nthe current site (i) in the sample of interest,\nnis and\nnjs are the tag counts\nat site i (or j) in sample\ns, the summation j is over all\nsites from the current site to the 3\u2032-most site assigned to this\ngene, and the summation s is over all samples in the experiment.pi=ni+0.01\u2211s=samplesnis\u2211j=sitesnj+0.01\u2211j=sites,s=samplesnjsequation 2Calculation of expression levels and transcript-truncation\nprobabilities based on poly(A) tags expression level estimates of each gene\u2019s expression\nwithin each sample were obtained using the summation of all counts\nclassified as within the 3\u2032-UTR (corresponding to transcripts\nwith a complete coding sequence). In addition, each gene was scored for\nthe fraction of transcripts that were either CDS-truncated (a properly\noriented tag occurring upstream of the stop codon) or promoter-proximal\n(a properly oriented tag occurring within the 5\u2032-UTR or less than\n100 nt (arbitrarily chosen) downstream of the start codon. The\nnormalizing denominator in each case was the total count of tags\nassigned to the gene (5\u2032-UTR, CDS, or 3\u2032-UTR) for a given\nsample.Sequence analysis of poly(A)-site flanking sequences to investigate putative poly(A) control sequence elements, we\nextracted sequences spanning 100 nt upstream to 100nt downstream of the\nputative sites, using custom C++ programs. Sequence analysis was\nrestricted to only one representative site per gene in order to reduce\nthe likelihood of biased results due to highly similar sequences.\nOccurrence of common regulatory element hexamers was measured with\ncommand-line scripts.Analysis of RNA Polymerase II ChIP-seq datasets Fastq sequence files were imported to the public Galaxy server\n(Afgan et al., 2016)\n(https://usegalaxy.org/) and analyzed\nin the following sequence.Sequences were analyzed for quality control with the\nprogram fastqc, revealing no issues.All sequences were then aligned to the S.\ncerevisiae genome (sacCer3 as provided in Galaxy),\nusing BWA (ID https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bwa/bwa/0.7.15.1)\nusing default parameters (Li and\nDurbin, 2009, 2010).The resulting BAM output files were converted to bigwig\ncoverage using the DeepTools Bam Coverage program (ID toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/deeptools_bam_coverage/deeptools_bam_coverage/2.5.0.0),\nusing bin-size = 1 (every base independent) (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2016)but with\naveraging over a window 21 nt wide centered on the current base,\nbut with all other parameters left at default values.\nNormalization was set to \u201cconstant coverage on the\ngenome\u201d such that the total coverage across all samples\nis forced to be equal.The bigwig files for each pair of PolII and matched\ninput dataset were compared with the Deep Tools bigwigCompare\nprogram (ID https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/deeptools_bigwig_compare/deeptools_bigwig_compare/2.5.0.0)\n(Ram\u00edrez et al.,\n2016), producing a log2ratio of the Pol II to input\ncoverage, again using window size = 1The four resulting Pol II-enrichment files (representing two\nreplicates for the wild-type (WT) and two replicates for the\nipa1-1 mutant) were downloaded and processed with\ncommand-line tools to generate a joined file that included calculation\nof the average value at each genomic position\n(chromosome-nucleotide-position), as well as the difference between\nthem, represented as ipa1-1 average minus WT\naverage.Since we are interested in the relative distribution of Pol II\nalong each gene (because ipa1-1 has been associated\nwith polyadenylation), we decided to normalize each gene\u2019s local\nneighborhood independently for meta-gene analysis. Conventional wisdom\nholds that polII enrichment correlates well with expression level, so we\ncalculated the average value of the difference in enrichment within the\ncoding region of each gene, using the gene CDS boundaries from yeastgenome.org to define the region\nof interest, and used the ratio of the WT and ipa1-1\naverages to scale ipa1-1 enrichments before comparing\nwith WT values.Pol II enrichment anchor plot generation Plots anchored at the poly(A) site were generated for\n\u201clocally normalized\u201d data (as described above), by\naligning related sites that were oriented 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 in\nterms of transcription direction of the gene. Mean and standard error of\nthe mean values at each position were calculated and plotted using\nMicrosoft Excel.Composite polyA and ChIp-Seq plot generation The composite cumulative polyadenylation distribution (CPD) and\nPol II enrichment plots were generated from the output text tables\ndescribed above. Bash shell scripts were written to generate a display\nscript to be interpreted and displayed by the plotting program Gnuplot,\nversion 5.2.Statistical analysis Gene-specific features (such as average 3\u2032-UTR length)\nand polyadenylation site-specific features (such as polyadenylation\nprocessing probability) were all computed separately for each of the\nfour WT and 3 ipa1-1 samples and then compared with a two-sided t test,\nassuming unequal variances. Calculations were made on tables stored in\nMicrosoft Excel.
