In pemphigus foliaceus (PF), the blisters are observed at superficial layers of the epidermis (granular and corneal layers) and the major autoantigen is desmoglein 1 (DSG1).1, 2 The rare sporadic form of PF occurs across the globe; however, this disease is endemic in Central and Southeastern Brazil, where it is popularly known as fogo selvagem (which means \u2018wild fire\u2019). In some areas, the disease reaches the astonishing prevalence of 1\u00b75% to 3%,3 the highest ever reported for an autoimmune disease. Even so, it still is a neglected disease and represents a significant public health challenge. Endemic PF has been also reported in Tunisia4, 5 and in other South American countries, such as Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.6\nBoth endemic and sporadic PF exhibit similar clinical, immunological and histological characteristics.7 PF is a complex disease triggered by ill\u2010defined environmental factors. It has been suggested that salivary antigens inoculated by hematophagous insects (such as Simulium nigrimanum) may trigger endemic PF in Brazil by inducing cross\u2010reactive autoantibody responses against DSG1 in genetically susceptible individuals.8, 9 Nevertheless, the involvement of salivary proteins of the insects or of infectious triggers is a hypothesis that remains to be further investigated.10\nVariants of numerous genes influence susceptibility to PF. The first genetic associations reported were variants within the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes, with strong associations with alleles of HLA\u2010DRB1 and HLA\u2010DQB1.11, 12, 13 Furthermore, our group has demonstrated several other associations of PF with genes involved in immune responses.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nThe focus of this study is to analyze variants within the leucocyte receptor complex (LRC) searching for associations with PF. The LRC is located at the 19q13.42 genomic region and contains more than 45 genes, including some immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) receptor genes: the polymorphic killer\u2010cell immunoglobulin\u2010like receptors (KIR), leucocyte immunoglobulin\u2010like receptors (LILR), leucocyte\u2010associated immunoglobulin\u2010like receptors (LAIR),21 among others. Further in the LRC centromeric region, in the so\u2010called extended LRC, there are additional genes that encode receptors expressed in several immune system cells.22, 23\nPreviously, we identified the LRC as an important region for pemphigus susceptibility, with strong associations for polymorphisms in KIR,24\nLAIR1 and LAIR2.25 The presence of three or more activating KIR and some KIR\u2010HLA combinations were associated with PF,24 and the presence of both KIR3DL2*001 and the ligand HLA\u2010A3 or HLA\u2010A11 increases susceptibility to PF.26 Our group also performed a genome\u2010wide expression profiling with over 50\u2005000 probes that revealed that genes in 19q13 (CD33, NALP12, NKG7, LILRB2) were differentially expressed in CD4+ lymphocytes when comparing patients and controls, as well as between different clinical forms.27 Together, these results indicate that variation within the LRC region is relevant for PF susceptibility.We hypothesized that variants within the 19q13.42 region impact the expression or the structure of coding and non\u2010coding LRC gene products, with functional consequences that might influence susceptibility to pemphigus. We used genotype data of over 520 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region and performed a case\u2010control association study, and we integrated our results with functional genomics data from public databases to reveal the most likely candidate variants. Materials and methodsPatient and control population samplesTwo\u2010hundred and twenty\u2010nine unrelated patients with a PF diagnosis based on clinical, histopathological and/or immunohistochemical criteria were recruited at hospitals from endemic areas as described in Cipolla et al.18 The control sample encompassed 194 unrelated individuals with no known history of autoimmune diseases who lived in endemic areas. Both the patient and the control samples were of predominantly European ancestry. All individuals signed informed consent. This study was performed according to Brazilian federal laws, and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Paran\u00e1.Microarray genotypingDNA was obtained from peripheral blood and extracted by phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol protocol.28 Genotyping was performed by microarray DNA Human Infinium\u00ae CoreExome\u201024 Beadchip (Illumina\u00ae, San Diego, California, EUA), according to manufacturer instructions.Selection of 19q13.42 region markers and statistical analysisFrom microarray DNA data, we extracted 527 SNPs within the 19q13.42 region (chr19: 54\u2005000\u2005000\u201355\u2005400\u2005000, GRCh37/hg19), considering ZNF331 and FCAR as the LRC flanking genes. After standard quality controls,29 we filtered by minor allele frequency higher than 2% (MAF\u2005>\u20050\u00b702) and by SNPs in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the control sample (P\u2005>\u20050\u00b701), and then performed the case\u2010control study with the 176 remaining SNPs (Table S1).Association analysis was performed by logistic regression with the two\u2010first components from principal component analysis as covariant to correct for possible population stratification. Because the effect of genetic variants on disease susceptibility may not differ between the heterozygote and the homozygote genotypes, we also applied the dominant and recessive models of the less frequent allele in the population (the minor allele), in addition to the standard additive model. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and the HWE was analysed with PLINK software v1.9.30 The P\u2010value 0\u00b701 was considered as the significance limit for the additive, dominant and recessive models. For the haplotype model association analysis, haplotypes with a frequency higher than 5% in patients or controls were considered, and P\u2005=\u20050\u00b705 was adopted as the significance limit.\nIn silico analysisThe SNP and gene annotations were performed with UCSC31 and Ensembl32 genome browsers. To visualize the SNP distribution along chromosome 19, the additive and dominant association results were evaluated by the LocusZoom33 online tool. We evaluated LD between SNPs analysed in our study with the merged European sample (CEU, TSI, FIN, GBR, IBS) from the 1000 Genomes project using SNiPA34 and LDLink.35 The possible structural and regulatory impacts of the genetic variants and their expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects were observed with SNiPA,34 HaploReg,36 RegulomeDB37 online tools and GTEx Portal38 database. ResultsSNPs within the LRC are associated with pemphigusWe found two SNPs (rs465169 and rs35336528) associated with PF in the additive and dominant models, and a third SNP, rs1865097, associated in the dominant model (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1;1; Table \u200bTable1).1).

The intergenic SNP rs465169 is located between the calcium voltage\u2010gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 6 (CACNG6) and V\u2010set transmembrane domain containing 1 (VSTM1) genes (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1),1), and the rs35336528 SNP is in exon 11 of the leucocyte receptor cluster member 8 (LENG8) gene. The minor allele A of the intronic rs1865097 SNP in the FCAR (Fc fragment of IgA receptor) gene was associated with decreased susceptibility to PF (Table \u200b(Table11).31, 32\nAlthough those SNPs are in the same chromosomal region, there was no LD among these three SNPs (r\n2\u2005\u2248\u20050) in the studied population. However, strong LD among these SNPs and approximately 15 others (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b79) was observed in European populations from the 1000 genomes project (Table S3). Therefore, the three SNPs (rs465169, rs35336528, rs1865097) are useful tag SNPs for genetic variation along genomic segments of 4, 19\u00b75 and 2\u00b76\u2005kb, respectively.Significant associations with LILR and KIR haplotypesIn order to explore the possible effect of cis combinations of SNPs on PF susceptibility, we performed a haplotype association analysis. We found four haplotypes with variants in KIR family genes, LAIR2 and LILRB1 genes, and the LILRP2 pseudogene associated with PF. None of them included SNPs individually associated with PF; however, for several of them a borderline P\u2010value was seen (0\u00b71\u2005>\u2005P\u2005>\u20050\u00b701). The SNPs, gene annotation and haplotype frequencies in patients with PF and controls are described in Table \u200bTable22.Table 2Four haplotypes are associated with increased or decreased susceptibility of PFHaplotypeSNP 1SNP 2SNP 3HaplotypePF F (%)CTR F (%)OR\nP\nH1\nrs1325158\n\nrs4806527\n\nrs2075731\nTGC6\u00b732\u00b752\u00b7560\u00b7023\nLILRP2 downstream\nLILRP2 downstream\nKIR3DL3\nH2\nrs4806768\n\nrs61737870\nTC36\u00b7644\u00b730\u00b7730\u00b7030\nLAIR2\n\nLAIR2\nH3\nrs1654644\n\nrs11665986\nTT23\u00b7218\u00b731\u00b7460\u00b7037\nKIR3DL2\n\nFCAR upstreamH4\nrs10423364\n\nrs1061680\n\nrs61739173\nACA5\u00b728\u00b710\u00b7580\u00b7041\nLILRB1 upstream\nLILRB1\n\nLILRB1\nOpen in a separate windowCTR, controls samples; F, frequency; H, haplotype; OR, odds ratio; PF, pemphigus foliaceus patients; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.The haplotypes H1 and H3 were associated with increased risk to PF (OR\u2005=\u20052\u00b756 and OR\u2005=\u20051\u00b746, respectively; P\u2005<\u20050\u00b705), and are nearby the KIR family genes. The haplotype TGC (H1) was composed of three SNPs; two (rs1325158 and rs4806527) are located downstream of the LILRP2 pseudogene and one (rs2075731) is within exon 3 of KIR3DL3 gene. The haplotype TT (H3) was composed of the rs1654644 SNP in intron 6 of KIR3DL2 gene and rs11665986 SNP upstream of FCAR gene. Although the SNPs from the two associated haplotypes (H1 and H3) did not show strong LD with each other (r\n2\u2005<\u20050\u00b72), strong LD (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b79) was seen between H1 and 16 SNPs, and between H3 and 17 SNPs in European populations from the 1000 genomes project (Tables S4 and S6). Thus, those SNPs can be considered tag SNPs for genetic variation along genomic segments of 1\u00b77 and 11\u2005kb (H1) and 61\u2005kb (H3). Despite the short distance (7\u2005kb) between KIR and FCAR genes, the SNPs of H3 (rs1654644\u2010rs11665986) were not in LD with the FCAR SNP rs1865097 individually associated with PF (r\n2\u2005<\u20050\u00b71; Europeans of the 1000 genomes project).We found two other haplotypes (H2 and H4) associated with PF (OR\u2005=\u20050\u00b773 and OR\u2005=\u20050\u00b758, respectively; P\u2005<\u20050\u00b705). They are located in LAIR2 and LILRB1 genes, respectively. The haplotype TC (H2) was composed of the rs4806768 T allele in intron 2 and rs61737870 C allele in exon 3 of the LAIR2 gene, which were not in LD (r\n2\u2005<\u20050\u00b72). These H2 SNPs were in strong LD (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b79) with, respectively, six and 11 other SNPs within LAIR2 in European populations from the 1000 genomes project (Table S5). Lastly, the haplotype ACA (H4) was composed of rs10423364 upstream of LILRB1 and two SNPs (rs1061680 and rs61739173) in exons 6 and 8 of the LILRB1 gene, respectively. We identified strong LD between rs10423364 and rs1061680 SNPs (r\n2\u2005=\u20050\u00b787), while the other SNP pairs of the same haplotype were not in LD (r\n2\u2005<\u20050\u00b72) in our dataset. Moreover, those SNPs (rs10423364, rs1061680, rs61739173) were in strong LD (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b79) with, respectively, 26, 11 and three other SNPs within LILRB1, in European populations from the 1000 genomes project (Table S7). Thus, the haplotypes H2 and H4 SNPs tag genetic variation of the LAIR2 and LILRB1 genes along genomic segments of 5 and 26\u2005kb, respectively (Tables S5 and S7).Variants associated with PF might influence expression levels of LRC genesIn order to understand the possible regulatory impact of the SNPs associated with PF, we performed in silico analysis using several public databases and tools (see \u2018\nIn silico analysis\u2019). We found several variants within transcription factor binding sites (MAF, NK\u2010kB, AIRE, among others), regulatory motifs or sites of chromatin modification that could impact the expression of a variety of LRC genes (Tables S3\u2013S7). Although the mechanisms that could explain the impact of the associated alleles or haplotypes on gene expression levels remain unknown, the H3 haplotype (rs1654644 T\u2010 rs11665986 T) and the rs10423364 G allele in the H4 haplotype upregulate, respectively, the KIR3DL1/2, KIR2DS4 and LILRB1 genes in whole blood, according to GTEx Portal38 (Figs S1 and S2). DiscussionPrevious findings demonstrated associations of PF with variants in the LAIR2 and KIR genes, and with expression of several LRC genes.24, 25, 26, 27 Here, we describe three variants associated with PF (intergenic rs465169, rs35336528 in LENG8 and rs1865097 in FCAR) that have never been associated with any disease. One possible reason is that genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) usually exhibit low SNP density in this region. This is caused by the numerous sequence repeats and homologous genes with high sequence similarity that impose technical difficulties for genotyping. Moreover, uncommon variation in extension occurs as a consequence of variable numbers of LRC genes among haplotypes. Because stringent P\u2010values are needed to avoid false\u2010positives in such studies (usually P\u2005<\u20055\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u22128 or P\u2005<\u20055\u2005\u00d7\u200510\u22127), many statistically weak associations that may be relevant for disease are missed in GWAS. Additionally, despite involvement of LRC gene products in immune responses, variants within the LRC were rarely analysed as candidates for autoimmune and other complex diseases. Our results confirm that the LRC is a hot spot for pemphigus susceptibility and may help to reveal still unknown molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the LRC should be investigated in other diseases that involve alterations of immune responses.The rs465169 SNP is an intergenic variant located within a regulatory region. The risk allele rs465169 A can potentially amplify the binding of the transcript factor avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue (MAF), which can activate or repress transcription depending on the binding site and the protein\u2010binding partner39 (Table S3). Although the impact of the rs465169 variants (A or G allele) on interaction between MAF and its DNA binding site remains unclear, this protein is considered a key regulatory factor of epidermal differentiation in upper layers in non\u2010pathological conditions.40, 41 Therefore, association of this SNP with a skin disease characterized by detachment of the upper skin layers could have a plausible biological explanation. In addition, MAF is involved in T\u2010cell apoptosis as well as activation of IL\u20104 expression in T helper 2 (Th2) cells. IL\u20104 is cytokine that participates in B\u2010cell activation and production of IgG1.42\nFurthermore, the rs465169 SNP might influence the regulation of several LRC genes: VSTM1, NLRP12, LAIR1, LILRA3, LILRA5, LILRA6, LILRB2, LENG8, according to online tools (Table S3). We have previously shown that the expression levels of LILRB2, LILRA5, LAIR1, VSTM1 and NLRP12 were increased in patients with PF when compared with controls.27 Therefore, our results suggest rs465169 as a strong candidate for functional validation.In LENG8 gene, the variant rs35336528 G was associated with 3\u00b74 times increased risk of PF. It is a missense variant that results in an isoleucine to valine replacement in LENG8. This protein is potentially involved in glycosylated protein recognition and RNA transport.23, 43\nApart from the amino acid change caused by this SNP, rs35336528 is located within a regulatory region. The presence of the rs35336528 G allele may alter the cyclic AMP\u2010dependent transcription factor (ATF3) regulatory motif. ATF3 is known for repressing transcription by stabilizing the binding of inhibitory cofactors to promoters, while its isoform 2 activates transcription by sequestering inhibitory cofactors.44\nIn silico analysis also evidenced that the region where rs35336528 is located exhibits numerous chromatin state and histone modifications in foreskin fibroblasts cells. Besides, rs35336528 is in strong LD with other SNPs that might regulate KIR, LILR and other LRC genes (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b78; Table S3). Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the rs35336528 SNP has a cis\u2010eQTL effect on the LENG8 natural antisense RNA 1, LENG8\u2010AS1. Indeed, antisense long non\u2010coding RNAs (lncRNAs) potentially regulate the expression of their sense counterparts.45 Both LENG8 and LENG8\u2010AS1 appear to be highly expressed in lymphocytes and skin tissue in non\u2010pathogenic conditions.38, 46 Thus, it would be worth checking if rs35336528 in fact impacts expression of LENG8, of its antisense RNA, as well as of other LRC genes, and if it is a functional SNP influencing pemphigus pathogenesis.The intronic variant rs1865097 in the FCAR gene could influence FCAR, CTB\u201061M7.2 and KIR gene expression. According to GTEx Portal,38 the protective genotype rs1865097 A/A increases FCAR expression levels. FCAR (also named CD89) encodes a receptor for the Fc region of IgA (Fc\u03b1RI) and acts as a regulator of anti\u2010 and pro\u2010inflammatory responses mediated by IgA.47, 48 IgA\u2010Fc\u03b1RI interactions can play a harmful role in inflammatory and autoimmune skin\u2010blistering diseases, including linear IgA bullous disease, dermatitis herpetiformis and IgA pemphigus. IgA autoantibodies are rarely detected in serum and skin of patients with PF; however, Fc\u03b1RI signals can be induced independently of IgA, by interaction with pentaxins.48 Additionally, rs1865097 is in strong LD with numerous SNPs that may regulate KIR genes, which have been previously associated with PF.24, 26\nWe found four haplotypes associated with PF that contain variants in KIR, LAIR2 and LILRB1 genes, and in flanking regions of the LILRP2 pseudogene and the FCAR gene. Despite the fact that none of those SNPs was associated with PF individually, low P\u2010values (0\u00b71\u2005>\u2005P\u2005>\u20050\u00b701) were observed for several of them. It is reasonable to suppose that certain combinations of SNPs exhibit a stronger phenotypic effect than each variant individually, because of additive interactions or of LD between the haplotype and a causal variant of another locus. Moreover, SNPs may not be associated individually due to epistatic interaction with other polymorphisms. It will be necessary to deeply explore that genomic region and to perform functional analyses, searching for the reasons for these associations.The KIR haplotype rs1654644\u2010rs11665986 TT (H3) increases the KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2 and KIR2DS4 expression levels in whole blood, according to the GTEx Portal38 (Fig. S1). In addition, SNPs from H1 (rs4806527) and H3 (rs1654644, rs11665986) are in strong LD with other variants that can potentially influence the expression of the inhibitory KIR2DL1, KIR2DL3/4, KIR3DL1/3, the activating KIR2DS4, as well as FCAR (Tables S4 and S6). These findings corroborate the role of KIR genes in pemphigus recognized by a former study of our group, which demonstrated that the presence of three or more activating KIR genes protect from PF (OR\u2005=\u20050\u00b749; P\u2005=\u20050\u00b7003).24 Additionally, the non\u2010synonymous variant at position 1190 (rs3745902 T) of the inhibitory KIR3DL2 marks low expression levels and was associated with protection against PF.26 Here we observed that the KIR3DL2 low\u2010expression\u2010associated variant rs3745902\n26 is in moderate LD (r\n2\u2005=\u20050\u00b751, D\u2032\u2005=\u20050\u00b783; European populations from 1000 genomes project) with rs1654644 SNP from H3, which was also associated with PF.LAIR\u20102 (leucocyte\u2010associated immunoglobulin\u2010like receptor 2, also known as CD306) is a secreted receptor that competes with the homologous membrane\u2010bound LAIR\u20101 by binding the same collagenous ligands.49 The disruption of the inhibition of immune responses by LAIR\u20101 can lead to loss of self\u2010tolerance in a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus50, 51 and rheumatoid arthritis.52, 53 We observed that rs4806768 SNP from H2 is in strong LD with rs2277974 (r\n2\u2005=\u20050\u00b797; Table S5); a SNP within a LAIR2 haplotype previously associated with PF and with differential expression levels.25 The rs4806768 T allele occurs in cis with rs2277974 T allele, previously associated with LAIR2 lower expression levels. Interestingly, the rs4806768 SNP alters a binding motif for the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein. AIRE is an important regulator of central tolerance that interacts with histones and chromatin, inducing the expression of a wide array of otherwise tissue\u2010restricted self\u2010antigens genes in the thymus. AIRE can inactivate CD4+ T cells and change the TCR repertoire and functions of peripheral CD8+ regulatory T cells.54, 55 Thus, the H2 haplotype that is associated with lower risk of PF includes a regulatory motif and marks LAIR2 expression, and therefore should be explored in forthcoming studies.This is the first study that shows association of polymorphisms of LILRB1 with PF. LILRB1 (also named ILT2, LIR1, MIR7, CD85, CD85J) is a highly polymorphic member of the LILR gene family.56, 57 It encodes the inhibitory receptor leucocyte immunoglobulin\u2010like receptor subfamily B member 1 (LIR\u20101, LILRB1) whose ligands are HLA class I molecules.58, 59, 60\nAs shown, the LILRB1 haplotype (H4) rs10423364\u2010rs1061680\u2010rs61739173 ACA was associated with decreased susceptibility to PF. The rs10423364 G allele that increases the LILRB1 expression levels in whole blood (Fig. S2) is in strong LD (r\n2\u2005>\u20050\u00b798) with haplotype AGG (rs1004443\u2010rs3760860\u2010rs3760861) in the LILRB1 promoter (Table S7). These three promoter SNPs are in absolute LD and form two haplotypes denoted AGG and GAA. The AGG haplotype was associated with lower LILRB1 expression on B and T lymphocytes and monocytes.56 Interestingly, the same AGG haplotype was associated with an increased number of NK cells that express LILRB1 and with higher LILRB1 expression levels in NK cells.57 The rs10423364 SNP is within a binding site for the nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB), whose pleiotropic function can be stimulated by immune, inflammation and apoptosis signals.61, 62, 63 Moreover, the rs10423364 is in strong LD with SNPs that may regulate several other LRC genes, such as NLRP12, LAIR1, LAIR2, LILRA4, LILRP2 (r\n2\u2005\u2265\u20050\u00b799; Table S7). The missense rs1061680 C allele that occurs in LD with rs10423364 A results in a threonine at amino acid position 142 and is associated with low expression of LILRB1 on the NK cell surface.57 Thus, although the observed association of PF with the ACA LILRB1 haplotype H4 may be explained by differential expression levels of LILRB1 (and other LRC genes), the results of previous work about the specific effect of polymorphisms indicate that LILRB1 expression varies among cell types, so the functional impact of the H4 polymorphisms should be clarified in future studies. ConclusionOur results indicate an important role of the LRC genes in PF etiology. It is interesting to notice that most of the variants associated with PF are potentially involved in gene regulatory mechanisms and differential expression levels. We found four unsuspected genes or regulatory elements whose variants are associated with differential susceptibility to PF: an intergenic regulatory region, LENG8, FCAR and LILRB1. Altogether, our results provide clear\u2010cut evidence that variants of the 19q13.42 region are involved in pathogenesis of pemphigus, possibly due to their effect on regulation of gene expression. This agrees with results of a genome\u2010wide gene expression profiling that revealed several LRC genes differentially expressed in patients with PF compared with controls.27 Although our focus was on genetic variation, we discussed several possible consequences of the polymorphisms that should be further evaluated in functional studies.
