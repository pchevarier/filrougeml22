To this end, significant research effort has been devoted to the identification of factors associated with disease progression and the construction of predictive models, including clinical, laboratory or radiological parameters.\n5\n Nonetheless, inconsistent results have been reported leading to remarkable heterogeneity of the existing risk scores. In addition, the risk of bias and concerns about overfitting often exist, rendering the proposed models overoptimistic and limiting their direct clinical applicability.\n6\n As a result, the optimal screening model for the prediction of critical illness remains still under investigation.The present study aims to comprehensively assess the clinical and laboratory characteristics at the admission of patients with COVID\u201019 and identify those linked to worse prognosis and disease progression. A novel risk score is constructed by applying machine learning methodology in order to improve variable selection and effectively recognise patients at higher risk of severe disease. At the same time, traditional pneumonia severity scores are estimated and their predictive performance is compared with the proposed risk model. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Study designAll consecutive adult patients with COVID\u201019 admitted to our department in \u201cSotiria\u201d General and Chest Diseases Hospital of Athens from 11 March to 1 June 2020 were prospectively enrolled. The diagnosis was based on the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCT) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Non\u2010laboratory\u2010confirmed cases were excluded. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital and all patients or their next of kin gave written informed consent.Reporting of outcomes was performed in accordance with the TRIPOD (Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) guidelines.\n7\n\n2.2. ProceduresPre\u2010specified variables about clinical history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory tests on admission and treatment were registered in a comprehensive database. Variables of interest were baseline characteristics, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, cancer, hematologic malignancy and immunodeficiency), clinical symptoms (fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, hemoptysis, fatigue, headache, diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting) and laboratory tests (complete blood count, coagulation tests, renal and liver function tests, serum electrolytes, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, troponin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, C\u2010reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin and blood lactate levels). Derived neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) was defined as: dNLR\u00a0=\u00a0Neutrophil count/(White blood cell count\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Lymphocyte count)).\n8\n Arterial blood gases were assessed on admission, calculating the PaO2/FiO2 ratio.Furthermore, three clinical scores were measured on admission: CURB\u201065 (Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years),\n9\n CRB\u201065 (Confusion, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years)\n10\n and PSI/PORT (Pneumonia Severity Index/Pneumonia Outcome Research Trial\u2010PSI/PORT).\n11\n The main outcome of interest was set to be the transfer from the isolation ward to the intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\n12\n systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)\n13\n and acute kidney injury.\n14\n In addition, the maximum values of SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment),\n15\n APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II)\n16\n and MEWS (Modified Early Warning Score)\n17\n scores during hospital stay were calculated.2.3. Data analysisStatistical analysis was conducted in R\u20103.6.3 (\u201csurvival,\u201d\n18\n \u201cglmnet,\u201d\n19\n and \u201cpROC\u201d\n20\n packages). Statistical significance was defined as P value < .05. Normality of continuous variables was tested by the Shapiro\u2010Wilk test because of the moderate sample size.\n21\n The possible linear correlation amongst laboratory variables was assessed by the Spearman correlation coefficient, because of the presence of skewed distributions. Strong correlations were detected by Spearman \u03c1 < \u22120.6 or\u00a0>\u00a00.6.\n22\n Potential missing values were planned to be statistically imputed by the k\u2010nearest neighbour method.\n23\n Survival analysis was performed aiming to identify clinical and laboratory factors on admission associated with subsequent ICU admission. To avoid overfitting, the Cox's proportional hazard's model with elastic net penalty was implemented. The elastic net penalty was defined by the following equation: P\u03bb,\u03b1\u03b2=\u2211j=1p\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2j+121\u2010a\u03b2j2(1)\nwhere \u03b2 represents the regression coefficient, \u03bb the shrinkage parameter and \u03b1 the elastic net mixing parameter, with 0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b1 \u22641. Values of \u03b1 equal to 0 and 1 correspond to the ridge and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression models, respectively.\n24\n The values of \u03b1 and \u03bb were selected by 10\u2010fold cross\u2010validation. Specifically, the \u03bb value providing minimum deviance (\u03bb\nmin) was chosen for the analysis and the \u03b1 value providing the lowest mean cross\u2010validation error at \u03bb\nmin was selected. A risk prediction model was constructed by including the parameters with nonzero coefficients; hence, a risk score was calculated according to the following equation: Riskscore=\u2211i=0n\u03b2i\u03c7i(2)\nwhere \u03b2i refers to the regression coefficient and \u03c7i the value of the parameter. The Harrell concordance C\u2010index was used to evaluate the discrimination of the model. The estimated risk score was compared between patient subgroups based on age (\u226465/>65\u00a0years), day from symptom onset (\u22647/>7\u00a0days) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (\u2264200, 201\u2010300, >300) using the Mann\u2010Whitney U test and was incorporated in a multivariate Cox's proportional hazard's model including the above parameters. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the risk score was tested by plotting the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). The optimal threshold was specified by estimating the Youden index\n25\n and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity were reported. The diagnostic accuracy of the risk score was compared with those of CURB\u201065, CRB\u201065 and PSI/PORT scores. Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves stratified by the outcomes of the four clinical scores were also constructed, using the log\u2010rank test to evaluate statistically significant differences.Concerning secondary outcomes, the accuracy of the risk score in predicting the occurrence of ARDS, SIRS and acute kidney injury was estimated by performing ROC analysis and calculating the respective AUCs. In addition, the potential correlation of the risk score with the worst SOFA, APACHE II and MEWS scores was assessed by the Spearman rank correlation test. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Clinical characteristicsA total of 67 patients were included in the present study. Fifteen of them were transferred to the ICU, needing intubation and mechanical ventilation, while three of them subsequently died. Their demographic and clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01. The source of exposure to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was known for 27 cases (40.3%), while seven patients were healthcare workers. The mean age of patients was 59.04\u00a0years (standard deviation: 17.45, range: 19 to 92) and 44 of them (65.7%) were male. Fifteen patients (22.4%) were obese (body mass index\u00a0\u2265\u00a025\u00a0kg/m2), while 18 patients (26.9%) reported that they were ever\u2010smokers. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (29.9%), followed by coronary artery disease (8.9%), heart failure (8.9%) and history of malignant disease (8.9%). The majority of patients presented with cough (62.7%), fever (59.7%), or fatigue (55.2%), while approximately half of them (52.2%) reported shortness of breath. Diarrhoea was reported by 26.9% of patients, but nausea and vomiting were rare (7.5%).TABLE 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of the included patientsClinical characteristicsPatients (N\u00a0=\u00a067)\nDemographics\nAge (years)59.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.45\u22646546 (68.7%)>6521 (31.3%)Male gender44 (65.7%)Obesity15 (22.4%)History of smoking18 (26.9%)Known source of exposure27 (40.3%)Day of symptoms on admission8 [5\u201010]\nComorbidities\nHypertension20 (29.9%)Coronary artery disease6 (8.9%)Heart failure6 (8.9%)Cancer6 (8.9%)Asthma5 (7.5%)Diabetes mellitus3 (4.5%)Immunodeficiency3 (4.5%)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease3 (4.5%)Hematologic malignancy2 (3.0%)Chronic liver disease0 (0%)\nSymptoms at admission\nCough42 (62.7%)Fever40 (59.7%)Fatigue37 (55.2%)Shortness of breath35 (52.2%)Chills19 (28.4%)Diarrhoea18 (26.9%)Headache13 (19.4%)Sputum production10 (14.9%)Nausea and vomiting5 (7.5%)Hemoptysis1 (1.5%)\nVital signs \u2013 ABGs at admission\nMean arterial pressure (mm Hg)90 [83.33\u201096.67]Heart rate (beats/minute)82.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.84PaO2/FiO2 (mm Hg)338.1 [266.3\u2010370.7]PaCO2 (mm Hg)34 [31\u201035]HCO3 (mmol/L)24.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.12Arterial\u2010alveolar gradient (mm Hg)38.93 [31.33\u201080.80]\nTreatment\nAntimicrobial50 (74.6%)Azithromycin43 (64.2%)Hydroxychloroquine39 (58.2%)Oseltamivir26 (38.8%)Glucocorticoids9 (13.4%)Tocilizumab1 (1.5%)Convalescent plasma therapy1 (1.5%)\nComplications\nBacterial pneumonia23 (34.3%)Acute respiratory distress syndrome17 (25.4%)Systemic inflammatory response syndrome16 (23.9%)Acute kidney injury15 (22.4%)Pulmonary embolism3 (4.5%)Acute coronary syndrome1 (1.5%)Cerebrovascular accident1 (1.5%)Admission to ICU15 (22.4%)Death3 (4.5%)Open in a separate windowThis article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

In addition, oseltamivir therapy (38.8%) was initiated in patients because of suspected influenza co\u2010infection, but was subsequently discontinued in most cases, as influenza co\u2010infection was confirmed only in two patients. Bacterial pneumonia was assumed to complicate the clinical course of 23 patients based on clinical, microbiological and/or radiological criteria.\n26\n Moreover, ARDS complicated the clinical course of 17 cases (25.4%), SIRS of 16 (23.9%), acute kidney injury of 15 (22.4%), pulmonary embolism of 3 (4.5%) cases, while ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 1 patient.3.2. Laboratory findingsThe outcomes of laboratory tests are presented in Table\u00a02. The most common abnormality was the elevation of inflammation markers, especially C\u2010reactive protein (91%), ferritin (76.1%) and fibrinogen (85.1%). Coagulation disorders were observed as increased activated partial thromboplastin time and D\u2010dimer levels occurred in 38.8% and 58.2% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase levels were above the normal range in 64.2% of patients, creatinine phosphokinase in 25.4% and troponin in 19.4% of patients. Liver damage was present in 25 (37.3%) patients, as reflected by increased aspartate aminotransferase values. Lymphopenia was detected in 22 (32.8%) cases, while the median neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio was estimated to be 3.20 (interquartile range: 2.43 to 4.91). The coefficients of correlation amongst laboratory variables are illustrated in Figure\u00a01. The Spearman rank test indicated strong correlation of procalcitonin with C\u2010reactive protein (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.67, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001), ferritin (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.64, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and troponin (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.66, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001), of C\u2010reactive protein with ferritin (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.74, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and fibrinogen (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.69, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001), as well as of lactate dehydrogenase with ferritin (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.66, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.65, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and D\u2010dimers (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.64, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001).TABLE 2Laboratory findings of the included patientsLaboratory findingsNormal valuesPatients (N\u00a0=\u00a067)TotalIncreasedDecreased\nComplete blood count\nHemoglobin (g/dL)13.0\u201017.513.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41\u201319 (28.4%)Mean Corpuscular volume (fL)80\u201010087.6 [85.5\u201089.75]\u20133 (4.5%)White blood cells (/\u03bcL)4500\u2010105006470 [4685\u20107710]6 (8.9%)15 (22.4%)Neutrophil count (/\u03bcL)1500\u201080004170 [3160\u20105583]4 (6.0%)5 (7.5%)Lymphocyte count (/\u03bcL)1000\u201048001290 [926\u20101745]\u201322 (32.8%)Platelet count (/\u03bcL)150\u2010450200.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063.00\u201315 (22.4%)Neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio\u20133.20 [2.43\u20104.91]N/AN/ADerived neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio\u20130.88 [0.83\u20100.92]N/AN/APlatelet\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio\u2013227 [161\u2010350.8]N/AN/A\nCoagulation function\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (s)28\u20104038.10 [35.10\u201042.35]26 (38.8%)\u2013International normalised ratio<1.11.04 [1.01\u20101.13]21 (31.3%)\u2013D\u2010dimer (\u00b5g/mL)<0.50.56 [0.41\u20101.19]39 (58.2%)\u2013Fibrinogen (mg/dL)200\u2010400553.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0162.2257 (85.1%)1 (1.5%)\nBlood biochemistry\nGlucose (mg/dL)75\u2010115105 [94\u2010116.5]18 (26.9%)\u2013Urea (mg/dL)10\u20104030 [24\u201040]16 (23.9%)\u2013Creatinine (mg/dL)0.6\u20101.20.90 [0.80\u20101.00]8 (11.9%)3 (4.5%)Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)10\u20104032 [24\u201045]25 (37.3%)\u2013Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)10\u20105031 [19.5\u201046]14 (20.9%)\u2013Total bilirubin (mg/dL)0.2\u20101.00.60 [0.45\u20100.80]8 (11.9%)\u2013Lactate dehydrogenase (mg/dL)<250268 [220\u2010364.5]43 (64.2%)\u2013Amylase (U/L)<9061 [40.5\u201077.5]7 (10.4%)\u2013Creatine phosphokinase (U/L)<17099 [76.5\u2010165]17 (25.4%)\u2013Uric acid (mg/dL)1.2\u20106.04.9 [4.1\u20105.9]12 (17.9%)\u2013Troponin (ng/L)<145 [2.7\u201010.15]13 (19.4%)\u2013Triglycerides (mg/dL)<150120.5 [92\u2010164.5]19 (28.4%)\u2013Total cholesterol (mg/dL)<200145.5 [130.8\u2010174]7 (10.4%)\u2013Sodium (mEq/L)135\u2010145138 [135.5\u2010140]\u201317 (25.4%)Potassium (mEq/L)3.5\u20105.54.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u20138 (11.9%)Lactate (mmol/L)<1.21.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3623 (34.3%)\u2013\nInflammation\u2010related markers\nC\u2010reactive protein (mg/dL)<0.36.55 [1.48\u201012.64]61 (91.0%)\u2013Procalcitonin (ng/mL)<0.250.07 [0.04\u20100.12]9 (13.4%)\u2013Ferritin (ng/mL)12\u2010300747 [309.3\u2010973.6]51 (76.1%)\u2013Open in a separate windowNoteData presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation in normally distributed variables or otherwise as median [interquartile range].Abbreviation: N/A, not applicable.This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

The risk score was significantly higher in patients that were subsequently admitted to ICU (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), as well as to those developing ARDS (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), SIRS (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and AKI (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001).TABLE 3Risk model for the prediction of ICU admissionCovariatesRegression coefficient (\u03b2)Gender (0: male, 1: female)\u22120.0086Hypertension (0: no, 1: yes)0.0402Diabetes mellitus (0: no, 1: yes)0.3269Fever at admission (0: no, 1: yes)0.0458Shortness of breath (0: no, 1: yes)0.2060Glucose (mg/dL)\na\n\n0.0006C\u2010reactive protein (mg/dL)\na\n\n0.0063Lactate dehydrogenase (mg/dL)\na\n\n0.0008Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)\na\n\n0.0019Fibrinogen (mg/dL)\na\n\n0.0005Open in a separate windowaper unit increase.This article is being made freely available through PubMed Central as part of the COVID-19 public health emergency response.

In addition, higher risk score was linked to ICU transfer both in patients with PaO2/FiO2\u00a0\u2264\u00a0200\u00a0mm Hg (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and PaO2/FiO2 of 200\u2010300\u00a0mm Hg (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.01) at presentation, although no significant difference was observed for patients with initial PaO2/FiO2\u00a0>\u00a0300, as only one patient was subsequently admitted to ICU in this subgroup (Figure\u00a02). The outcomes of the multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that the association of risk score with disease progression remained significant after adjustment for age, day of symptom and PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission (adjusted hazard ratio: 23.14, 95% confidence intervals: 2.43 to 220.37, P value: .006) (Table\u00a04).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Boxplots of risk score of critically and noncritically ill patients categorised by age (A), day of symptoms (B) and oxygenation status (C).

The diagnostic accuracy of the risk score was calculated to be higher than those of CURB\u201065 (AUC: 86.6%), CRB\u201065 (AUC: 86.3%) and PSI/PORT (AUC: 80.2%) (Figure\u00a03). The Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves stratified by the results of four clinical scores are depicted in Figure\u00a04. Specifically, time\u2010to\u2010event analysis indicated that progression to critical\u2010illness was significantly higher in patients with risk score\u00a0>\u00a01.6 (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), CURB\u201065\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 (P value\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), CRB\u201065\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 (P value: .00086) and PSI/PORT\u00a0\u2265\u00a090 (P value: .0018). Moreover, the risk score presented high diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of ARDS (AUC: 95.4%), SIRS (90.9%) and AKI (75.4%) (Figure S2), as well as significant correlation with worse SOFA (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.52, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001), APACHE II (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.50, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and MEWS score (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.58, P value\u00a0<\u00a0.001) (Figures S3\u2010S5).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of risk score, CURB\u201065, CRB\u201065 and PSI/PORT for the prediction of intensive care unit admission.

A risk score was developed aiming to optimise variable selection and minimise the risk of overfitting. Specifically, a model was constructed by taking into account the effects of gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fever and shortness of breath at admission, initial serum glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, C\u2010reactive protein and fibrinogen. The proposed risk model proved in our study population to be extremely accurate in the prediction of ICU admission, outperforming the conventional pneumonia severity scores, CURB\u201065, CRB\u201065 and PSI/PORT. Moreover, it was able to accurately predict disease complications, such as ARDS and SIRS and positively correlated with established scores of critical illness, especially SOFA, APACHE II and MEWS scores.The findings of the present study are in accordance with other prediction models concerning the negative prognostic value of male gender, hypertension, elevated glucose, C\u2010reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n Importantly, raised lactate dehydrogenase has been also recognised as a severity marker in patients with H1N1\n\n30\nand MERS\u2010CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection,\n31\n reflecting subclinical tissue damage and activation of the cytokine cascade. Increased fibrinogen levels in patients at risk of critical illness may be explained by the COVID\u201019\u2010induced coagulopathy, as well as by the hyperactivation of pro\u2010inflammatory pathways since recent studies have demonstrated a significant correlation of its values with interleukin\u20106 levels.\n32\n Moreover, no prognostic role was proposed for lymphopenia, as suggested by previous reports\n33\n; although neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte\u2010ratio of the sample was estimated to be high (median: 3.20, interquartile range: 2.43\u20104.91), no significant difference was observed amongst patients developing mild and severe disease.Inspection of the Kaplan\u2010Meier curves indicated that most events (ie, transfer to ICU) occurred within the first 5\u00a0days of hospital stay, implying that patients tended to present at a late stage of the disease. For this reason, subgroup analysis was performed based on the day form the onset of symptoms and the presenting PaO2/FiO2 ratio, obtaining stable results and thus strengthening the generalisability of outcomes. Therefore, the proposed risk score may be applicable at the time of admission for all COVID\u201019 patients requiring hospitalisation, allowing the early identification of those at high risk of disease progression and development of critical illness. Moreover, it should be noted that the internal validation of the model was performed by implementing cross\u2010validation techniques in order to account for potential optimism during variable selection and thus limit the overall risk of bias.\n34\n\nNevertheless, the study presents several shortcomings. Specifically, the interpretation of outcomes is mainly limited by the available sample size, as well as by the lack of external validation. The study was a single\u2010centre one and thus generalisability to populations of other countries cannot be ascertained. In addition, the number of deaths in the present cohort was small; hence, mortality could not be assessed as an outcome of interest. The potential effects of different treatment options could also not be assessed since the majority of patients initially received similar therapeutic regimens, consisting mainly of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Moreover, the present study adopted a prospective design with pre\u2010specified variables and end\u2010points, minimising thus the risk of selection bias. A variety of clinical and laboratory parameters was evaluated, allowing a comprehensive analysis of the potential prognostic factors amongst COVID\u201019 patients. In addition, the selection of variables for the construction of the risk model was optimised by applying regularisation techniques, since standard regression methods may not converge in the setting of small sample size and a high dimensional dataset.\n35\n\nSeveral research questions need to be addressed by future studies in the field. Additional validation cohorts should evaluate the proposed risk model in order to test its efficacy in different populations and compare it to other published COVID\u201019 prognostic scores. Clinical and laboratory findings may be combined with radiological features in order to construct models with improved discrimination. The potential value of viral load for the prediction of disease progression should be assessed by studies implementing droplet digital PCR allowing absolute quantification of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n36\n Finally, it is important to state that prediction models may serve as useful tools in the guidance of clinical practice regarding closer monitoring and treatment decisions, as well as during the selection of appropriate populations for inclusion in future clinical trials. In this context, their implementation may allow a precision medicine approach aiming to offer personalised therapeutic strategies depending on the accurate phenotypic recognition of COVID\u201019 patients.\n37\n\n 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONSThe present study developed a novel risk score based on clinical and laboratory characteristics in order to predict the occurrence of critical illness amongst patients hospitalised because of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. A10\u2010variable model was constructed, achieving optimal discrimination of patients that were subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit. Further large\u2010scale studies are needed to validate the efficacy of the proposed risk factors and test whether early risk stratification is able to guide therapeutic decisions and optimise the clinical management of COVID\u201019 patients.
