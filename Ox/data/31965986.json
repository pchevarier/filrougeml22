Understanding changes in the dynamics of chromatin and its causative molecular cues during the early evolution is essential to provide insights into the patterns of gene regulation responsible for configuring multicellular organisms (Koster et al. 2015). The phylogenetic position at the base of Eumetazoa makes Hydra a powerful model organism to understand the transitions that led to the evolution of gene regulation and functional genomic studies in complex multicellular organisms (Collins et al. 2005). Hydra also serves as an interesting system to study its regeneration capability (Bosch 2007), embryogenesis (Fr\u00f6bius et al. 2003; Genikhovich et al. 2006), evolution of eumetazoan specific cell types such as neurons and muscular epithelial cells (Hobmayer et al. 2012), aging mechanism (Tomczyk et al. 2015) and symbiosis (Bosch 2012). The availability of genome sequence (Chapman et al. 2010) and transcriptomes under different experimental conditions, along with molecular tools such as siRNA-mediated knockdown and generation of transgenic lines, makes Hydra amenable for molecular dissection of evolution of gene regulation. Therefore, we have chosen the basal eumetazoan Hydra as a model system for this study.Previously, we reported the early evolution of the complete histone repertoire along with taxon specific histone variant (Reddy et al. 2017). All canonical Hydra histones show the conservation of amino acids important for writers and readers of epigenetic modifications. Similarly, studies in a related Cnidarian, Hydractinia, has also shown the conservation of canonical histones and presence of non-canonical H2B variants, which are male germ cell specific (T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. 2016). Evolution of body axis occurred in Cnidaria and the role of Wnt signalling has been shown in the organizer activity in Hydra (Hobmayer et al. 2000; Broun et al. 2005; Reddy et al. 2019). We then analysed genes differentially regulated upon the activation of Wnt signalling in Hydra. In this analysis, a simple Hydra-like body axis formation involved a major set of genes involved in various processes like cell\u2013cell contact, cell\u2013ECM interaction and cytoskeletal dynamics affecting tissue morphogenesis. In addition to this, interconnections to other developmental signalling pathways like hedgehog, receptor tyrosine and hormone mediated signalling pathways were observed. This study shows the evolution and adaptation of master gene regulator transcription factors into Wnt signaling network regulating a primary body axis before Bilateria\u2013Radiata split. These players have later diverged further to give rise to A\u2013P, D\u2013Vand Left\u2013Right axes. Next, we studied the regulation of genes by monitoring the RNA Pol II occupancy profile and found a small set of genes involved in constitutive and stimuli responsive function. This is well correlated with the evolution of associated molecular players, such as NELF, in RNA Pol II pausing.Until recently, one of the major rate limiting and regulated steps during transcription was thought to be RNA Pol II recruitment at transcription start sites (Adelman and Lis 2012). However, recent technical advances allowed the analysis of changes at global level, showing that RNA Pol II pausing is a hitherto underexplored and overlooked, but potentially widespread strategy for controlling gene expression (Mayer et al. 2017). The pausing of RNA Pol II at the promoters might help in rapid release of stalled RNA Pol II during development or environmental stimuli, that in turn facilitate an efficient and integrated response to the dynamically changing environment (Muse et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2018). Here, we mapped the sites of RNA Pol II recruitment on the Hydra genome and correlated it with the global transcription. Furthermore, we identified a subset of developmentally regulated genes that exhibit poised RNA Pol II in a manner characteristic of bilaterians. Thus, our study provides the evidence of an important transition in gene regulation that occurred during the emergence of complex multicellular organisms with specialized tissue types and functions. 2.\u2003Materials and methods2.1. Hydra cultureA clonal culture of Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune was maintained at 18\u00b0C using standard protocols described previously (Reddy et al. 2011). Hydra polyps were fed daily with freshly hatched Artemia nauplii larvae and cleaned after 6\u20138 h of feeding.2.2. AntibodiesPan Histone H3 antibody (Abcam-ab1791) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) mouse monoclonal antibody (7G5) were used. Both antibodies recognized respective proteins in Hydra (supplementary figure 1).2.3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)Two thousand Hydra polyps were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, lysed and sonicated in sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 4% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF) to obtain an average chromatin size of 300 bp. Chromatin was pre-cleared using 50 \u03bcL of a 50% protein A sepharose (GE healthcare) slurry for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with gentle inverting. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 1 ml of ChIP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X 100). Input chromatin was obtained after preclearing, by de-crosslinking and purifying input DNA using a Qiaquick column (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with inverting at 4\u00b0C for 14\u201316 h. The samples were then incubated with 50 \u03bcL of a 50% Protein A Sepharose slurry for 3 h at 4\u00b0C with gentle inverting. ChIP samples were reverse-crosslinked and the DNA was purified using a Qiaquick column (Qiagen). Q-PCR using SYBR green was used to validate known target sites before and after sequencing.2.4. Library preparation and next generation sequencingSequencing libraries were prepared using SOLiD ChIP-Seq library preparation kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA samples were end repaired and adapter ligated before subjecting for amplification for 12 cycles to visualise sufficiently on 2% E-gel (Thermo). DNA purification at every step was performed using Agencourt XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Average library size were estimated using the bioanalyzer 2100 high-sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent) and concentrations were measured using the Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). Equimolar amount of libraries were pooled and 50 bp reads were sequenced in-house using SOLiD 4.0 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).2.5. Average profile calculationsWe extracted the tag density in a 5 Kb window surrounding the TSSs and gene body using the program seqMINER, which generates heatmap as well as the profiles (Ye et al. 2011). The sequenced ChIP-seq reads represent only the end of each immunoprecipitated fragments instead of the precise protein\u2013DNA binding sites. To illustrate the entire DNA fragment, basically before analysis, 3\u2032 end of each ChIP-seq read was extended to 200 bp in the direction of the reads. For average gene profiles, genes (+/\u22125000 bp from binding site) were divided in 100 bins of length relative to the gene length. Moreover, 10 equally sized (50 bp) bins were created on the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the gene and ChIP-seq densities were collected for each dataset in each bin. The average of enrichments over input in each bin was plotted for each dataset.2.6. Data source and analysisChIP-seq datasets for RNA Pol II were downloaded from the public data bank Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds) under the accession numbers {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM1160310\",\"term_id\":\"1160310\"}}GSM1160310 (Drosophila), {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM840279\",\"term_id\":\"840279\"}}GSM840279 (Human), {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM1018217\",\"term_id\":\"1018217\"}}GSM1018217 (Yeast) and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM307623\",\"term_id\":\"307623\"}}GSM307623 (Mouse). The scatter plots, k-means clustering and average gene profiles were created using seqMiner (Ye et al. 2011). Box plots and correlation analysis were produced using R software (http://r-project.org/). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) was used for data visualization. The sequencing data we have generated is deposited in the GEO database under the accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE63414\",\"term_id\":\"63414\"}}GSE63414. The number of mapped reads for each data set is provided in supplementary table 1. The primers used for ChIP-qPCR validation are provided in supplementary table 2.2.7. Phylogenetic analysisNELF (negative elongation factor) homologues were initially identified by BLAST-P similarity search performed using human counterparts as query from representative model organisms (supplementary table S3). A detailed phylogenetic analysis was carried out using these sequences. Here, initial alignment was carried out using MUSCLE (default parameters) and alignments were trimmed using trimAl (auto mode), which are implemented on an online server (https://ngphylogeny.fr) (Lemoine et al. 2019). An unrooted phylogentic tree was computed using randomized accelerated maximum likelihood (RAxML-HPC v.8 on XSEDE) implemented in CIPRES Science Gateway (Miller et al. 2012). Here, PROTCAT substitution model with DAHOFF substitution matrix was used with 1000 iterations of rapid bootstrap analysis. The phylogenetic tree was visualized and annotated in iTOL and branch support values above 30 were displayed on branches (Letunic and Bork 2016). 3.\u2003Results3.1. RNA Pol II pause immediately upstream of transcription start sites (TSSs) is not evident in HydraThe distribution and the correlation of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) occupancy with transcription are well established in bilaterians, however nothing is known about its distribution in basal eumetazoans such as Hydra. To gain insights into the RNA Pol II profile and transcription machinery in Hydra, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-coupled highthroughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for RNA Pol II using commercially available antibody (supplementary figure 1). Interestingly, we found that Hydra RNA Pol II is uniformly distributed across the entire gene body (figure 1A) as opposed to its counterparts in bilaterians such as human and mouse (Adelman and Lis 2012). Further, to contrast our observation with other metazoans, we calculated the density of RNA Pol II in the gene body of five eukaryotic model systems: human, mouse, drosophila, yeast and Hydra. Our analysis suggests highest RNA Pol II pausing at the TSSs in mouse and human followed by Drosophila and no RNA Pol II pausing in yeast. Interestingly, the RNA Pol II pause in Hydra was minimal, and the distribution of RNA Pol II in gene body was maximum (figure 1A). Representative examples of uniform distribution of Hydra RNA Pol II genome browser tracks are shown in figure 1B. The uniform distribution of RNA Pol II obtained in ChIP-sequencing was also validated by ChIP-qPCR on randomly selected genomic loci enriched with RNA Pol II (supplementary figure 2). Furthermore, uniform distribution of Hydra RNA Pol II was confirmed by correlating ChIP-seq enrichments in a second independent replicate (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.98, supplementary figure 3). The uniform distribution of Hydra RNA Pol II prompted us to explore the correlative relationship between the distribution of RNA Pol II over the gene body and the levels of transcription of the corresponding genes. The density of RNA Pol II was calculated over 500 genes with high, medium and very low expression levels, each, and plotted as an average gene profile. Interestingly, the levels of RNA Pol II correlate with the magnitude of gene expression. However, the characteristic peak of RNA Pol II pause at the TSSs found in bilaterians was not observed in Hydra RNA Pol II (figure 1C). Taken together, our data suggests that though Hydra RNA Pol II occupancy correlates with gene expression, it does not exhibit the characteristic RNA Pol II pause like other higher eukaryotic systems.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Global RNA Pol II pausing is not evident in Hydra.

RNA Pol II pause was observed in mouse, human and Drosophila. RNA Pol II pause in Hydra was minimal (small peak at TSS as compared to other organisms) and the distribution of RNA Pol II in gene body was maximum.3.2. Hydra exhibits slowest RNA Pol II traveling ratioIn bilaterian model organisms, differential gene expression depends on the regulation of transcription elongation via the release of RNA Pol II from the promoter (Levine 2011; Kwak and Lis 2013). Absence of promoter RNA Pol II in Hydra prompted us to calculate the RNA Pol II traveling ratio or \u2018pausing ratio\u2019, which quantifies the relative amount of RNA Pol II binding near the promoter versus at the gene body (Rahl et al. 2010). Decrease in RNA Pol II travelling ratio is an indication of clearance of promoter or transcription elongation inhibition (Wade and Struhl 2008). We then calculated the RNA Pol II traveling ratio for human, mouse, Drosophila and yeast, along with Hydra (figure 2). A higher traveling ratio value indicates a higher degree of pausing (Rahl et al. 2010). Interestingly, the RNA Pol II travelling ratio was found to be the lowest in Hydra, reinforcing the observation that it presumably lacks the RNA Pol II pause and indicating a different mode of RNA Pol II mediated transcriptional initiation and regulatory mechanism in Hydra. Interestingly, the global distribution of RNA Pol II in Hydra is intermediary to yeast and bilaterians (figure 1A), However, the traveling ratio is lower than that of yeast (figure 2). Thus, a multicellular organism such as Hydra, which exhibits differential gene expression in spatio-temporal manner according to external or internal signals, characteristically lacks an important developmental checkpoint present in higher metazoan; the RNA Pol II pause.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Hydra RNA Pol II travelling ratio. Comparative RNA Pol II traveling ratio. RNA Pol II travelling ratio was calculated for genes from Drosophila, human, mouse, S. cerevisiae and Hydra. RNA Pol II travelling ratio was lowest in Hydra in all the examined species.3.3. Evolution of NELF family membersPromoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol II is a post-initiation regulatory event and we wondered if Hydra, which lacks the promoter-proximal pause, uses novel mechanisms of transcriptional initiation/elongation. It has been shown that a multisubunit factor (Negative elongation factor \u2013 NELF) in association with DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) contributes to the transcriptional pausing of RNA Pol II (Narita et al. 2003). The genes regulated by promoter-proximal pause are shown to have binding of pause factor, the negative elongation factor (NELF) downstream of the TSS (Wada et al. 1998). The NELF complex consists of four distinct polypeptides namely NELF-A, NELF-B, NELF-C/D and NELF-E (Yamaguchi et al. 1999, 2001; Narita et al. 2003). Among these, NELF-E has the RNA binding domain and plays a critical role in NELF activity (Yamaguchi et al. 2002). Human homologues of these components were identified in mouse and Drosophila and are not present in Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We screened for homologues of these components in our in-house transcriptome assembly generated from Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune using protein blast similarity search (supplementary table 3) and performed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis after performing multiple sequence alignment (supplementary figure 4) to ascertain their homology to their bilaterian counterparts (figure 3A). Surprisingly, we found that the genes for all the NELF factors necessary for RNA Pol II pause were coded by Hydra. A comparative phylogenetic analysis suggest that NELF-A, B and C/D occurred before the divergence of sponges and the complete NELF repertoire evolved before the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria. Interestingly, putative homologues are not present in Schmidtea mediterranea (Platyhelminthes) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Nemathelminthes) suggesting intermittent loss of NELF members in these lineages (figure 3). This suggests that members of the complete NELF complex are present in Hydra and might be involved in the RNA Pol II pause, similar to the bilaterians.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Evolution of NELF family members. Reported and putative NELF protein sequences were extracted from representative phyla and their phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum likelihood method and their occurrence was summarized. (A) Phylogenetic tree of four classes of NELF members. All four classes of NELF members are shaded in distinct colours. NELF homologues identified in Hydra vulgaris Ind-Pune are highlighted in red colour font. Numbers on branch points denote bootstrap support values. (B) Summary table displaying the presence of NELF members in representative model organisms. Empty circle \u2013 absence; filled circle \u2013 presence and red filled circles represent homologues found in Hydra.3.4. A select subset of genes exhibit RNA Pol II pause in HydraThe absence of global RNA Pol II pause but presence of all the subunits of pause factor, NELF prompted us to re-examine the RNA Pol II pause in Hydra. We screened for individual genes, which exhibit RNA Pol II pause at the TSSs. Interestingly, such an exercise yielded a set of 235 genes, wherein significant RNA Pol II pause at TSSs was observed (figure 4A). To understand the role of RNA Pol II pause in Hydra, we compared the expression level of RNA Pol II passed genes as opposed to global transcription. Here, we found that RNA Pol II paused genes in Hydra are highly expressed as compared to the global transcription (figure 4B). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of RNA Pol II paused genes demonstrated that these genes are mostly associated with functions specific to multicellular organisms, localization and pattern formation, developmental processes and response to stimulus (figure 4C). Thus, the pausing of RNA Pol II is a plausible mechanism to fine-tune gene expression and to potentiate genes for further and/or future activation on a select subset of genes, which are important for stimuli-dependent or development-related functions.Open in a separate windowFigure 4A select subset of genes exhibit RNA Pol II pausing in Hydra. (A) Average ChIP-seq profile of RNA Pol II occupancy over a subset of 235 promoters identified having paused RNA Pol II in Hydra. (B) RNA Pol II paused genes in Hydra are highly expressed as compared to the total transcripts levels. (C) Gene ontology analysis of RNA Pol II paused genes suggests enrichment of the pathways associated with gene expression regulation and translation.3.5. Strongly positioned +1 nucleosome facilitates RNA Pol II pause in HydraNucleosomes form barriers against RNA Pol II elongation and paused genes maintain strong nucleosome signatures near transcription start sites (Jimeno-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2015). To further understand if the differential transcriptional regulation can be a function of distribution of nucleosomes in Hydra, we performed histone H3 ChIP-sequencing for determining nucleosome positioning in Hydra. Mapping of the ChIP-seq reads on the Hydra genome revealed that the nucleosomes are highly dynamic and unstable in Hydra as compared to yeast and the +1 nucleosome flanking the promoter is located at a preferred position along with nucleosome free region at TSSs (supplementary figure 5). Furthermore, the nucleosome occupancy is highest over the paused genes as compared to the total Hydra genes (figure 5), which is another indication of paused RNA Pol II at these genes. Taken together, our results indicate that the strongly positioned +1 nucleosome might be an important factor in facilitating promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Pol II to fine tune gene expression of important stimuli-dependent and developmentally regulated genes.Open in a separate windowFigure 5+1 Nucleosome is tightly positioned on transcription start sites (TSSs) of RNA Pol II paused genes in Hydra. +1 nucleosome position was analysed on all the genes and RNA Pol II paused genes from Hydra. RNA Pol II paused genes exhibit highest +1 nucleosome occupancy. 4.\u2003DiscussionTranscription is not merely the expression of the information encoded by the genome. Rather, it is a multilayered procedure that ultimately integrates cellular demands in terms of gene expression. Living organism are critically dependent on their fixed inherited genetic constitution and on the changing environment to which they are exposed to and typically respond to the internal or external cues through tightly controlled modulation of transcriptional responses. Thus, transcription programmes ultimately define the identity, function and fate of every cell of an organism. Multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for responding to various developmental, environmental and physical stimuli by regulating transcription. In a multicellular organism such as Hydra, the mechanism of RNA Pol II mediated transcriptional regulation appears to be in between that of yeast (unicellular eukaryote) and multicellular bilaterians. Our observations suggest that genes with high levels of paused RNA Pol II inherently favor the formation of nucleosomes over the promoter, establishing an active competition between RNA Pol II and nucleosomes for promoter occupancy (Gilchrist et al. 2010). The intrinsically repressive chromatin structure prevents aberrant expression of paused genes, which are often component of highly regulated pathways (Liu et al. 2015; Shao and Zeitlinger 2017). Our analysis suggests that the RNA Pol II pausing machinery was possibly first acquired in Hydra; however, it was restricted to a small subset of genes that were required for stimuli-dependent and developmentally regulated genes. Presence of all NELF complex members in Hydra indicates their role in observed RNA Pol II pausing. This in turn suggests that the pausing of RNA Pol II at the select TSSs in Hydra is a mechanism for tuning the expression of active genes and presumably maintaining them in poised state for future burst in gene expression.Previous studies in mammals and Drosophila have suggested the role of promoter sequence elements such as presence of GAGA motif, downstream promoter element (DPE), pause button (PB) and correlate with the higher GC content (Amir-Zilberstein et al. 2007; Hendrix et al. 2008; Gilchrist et al. 2010). These findings suggest that further analysis on the evolution of these elements might shed light on intrinsic properties of the promoters in regulation of RNA Pol II pause. This study suggests eumetazoan genes started \u2018learning\u2019 to pause and facilitate differential regulation required for development of multicellular organisms before the divergence of Bilateria and Radiata. Studies in Nematostella based on genome-wide histone marks have shown that existence of conserved eumetazoan enhancer mediated gene regulatory mechanism (Schwaiger et al. 2014). In light of the current study and other reports, cnidarian models serve as excellent model organisms to understand the evolutionary transition of gene regulation observed in complex multi-cellular organisms.
