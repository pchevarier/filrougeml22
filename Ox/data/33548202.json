Stress such as heat shock and arsenic exposure causes a rapid arrest of ongoing translation of mRNAs encoding metabolic, cell-cycle, and housekeeping proteins (Gibson, 2008; Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005). This is known to involve the formation of cytosolic stress granules\u2014biomolecular condensates that form by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Molliex et\u00a0al., 2015). Cytosolic stress granules store inactivated ribosomes and mRNA, facilitating the rapid translational arrest caused by stress. Early studies showed that stressed cells also downregulate the transcription of most genes (Spradling et\u00a0al., 1975). Recent genome-wide techniques confirmed that heat shock causes global transcriptional downregulation of housekeeping genes in fly, mouse, and human cells (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019; Gressel et\u00a0al., 2019; Mahat et\u00a0al., 2016; Vihervaara et\u00a0al., 2017). Transcriptional downregulation occurs at the level of promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase (Pol) II, implicating the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019; Gressel et\u00a0al., 2019), which is a hetero-tetramer composed of the subunits NELFA, B, C/D, and E.Under normal conditions, Pol II transcribes 20\u201360 bases downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and pauses for varying periods of time (Adelman and Lis, 2012; Core and Adelman, 2019; Core et\u00a0al., 2008). The fate of promoter-proximally paused Pol II is determined by the opposing actions of negative and positive transcription elongation factors (Jonkers and Lis, 2015; Kwak and Lis, 2013). Recent structural studies of a paused Pol II complex have shown that NELF and 5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB)-sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) bind to the polymerase in a manner that restricts Pol II mobility and impairs further RNA elongation (Vos et\u00a0al., 2018b).Release of Pol II from the paused state is facilitated by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1 (CCNT1) (Marshall and Price, 1995; Price, 2000; Wei et\u00a0al., 1998). CDK9 phosphorylates NELF and other factors to promote displacement of NELF from paused Pol II, concomitant with activation of Pol II and phosphorylation at Serine 2 on the pol II C-terminal domain (Kwak and Lis, 2013; Narita et\u00a0al., 2003; Vos et\u00a0al., 2018a; Wada et\u00a0al., 1998; Yamaguchi et\u00a0al., 1999). Under stress conditions, NELF binding to promoters of housekeeping genes is rapidly enhanced, coincident with a decrease of elongating Pol II (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). How stress leads to an increased residence time of NELF at downregulated gene promoters is not understood.Recent studies have highlighted the importance of biomolecular condensation for the formation of membraneless organelles and cellular organization (Banani et\u00a0al., 2017; Hyman et\u00a0al., 2014; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017). Such condensation also occurs in the nucleus and was proposed to underlie transcriptional regulation (Hnisz et\u00a0al., 2017). Indeed, recruitment of Pol II to promoters coincides with formation of \u201cpromoter condensates\u201d containing transcription factors, transcriptional coactivators such as the Mediator complex, and Pol II (Boehning et\u00a0al., 2018; Boija et\u00a0al., 2018; Cho et\u00a0al., 2018; Sabari et\u00a0al., 2018). Elongating Pol II has recently been proposed to form \u201cgene-body condensates\u201d composed of elongation and RNA-processing factors (Cramer, 2019), and evidence for these condensates is accumulating (Guo et\u00a0al., 2019; Lu et\u00a0al., 2018). Nuclear condensates are likely formed by LLPS of proteins that possess intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (Alberti et\u00a0al., 2019). Post-translational modification such as phosphorylation can influence the ability of IDR-containing proteins to facilitate condensation in\u00a0vivo (Boehning et\u00a0al., 2018; Guo et\u00a0al., 2019; Lu et\u00a0al., 2018).Whereas transcription initiation and elongation of Pol II appear to be organized with the help of dedicated nuclear condensates, the intermediate state of paused Pol II is transient under normal conditions and, so far, has not been associated with biomolecular condensation. In this study, we uncover that stress triggers the formation of NELF condensates in the nucleus that are causally linked with decreased Pol II elongation and transcriptional downregulation. We propose that stress-induced NELF-based condensates are nuclear counterparts of cytosolic stress granules involved in downregulating gene expression. ResultsHuman NELF forms nuclear condensates upon stressHeat shock stress causes global transcriptional downregulation, as seen by a decrease in the ChIP signal of RNA Pol II in gene bodies of many genes in human cells (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). We observed an increased binding of NELF at promoters of downregulated genes (Figure\u00a01A). Consistent with this, biochemical fractionation further showed that heat shock caused an increase in the abundance of chromatin-associated NELF complex (Figures 1B and S1A). Strikingly, microscopic visualization of fluorescently tagged NELFA subunit revealed that the homogeneous nuclear signal re-organizes into bright nuclear puncta within 30\u00a0min of heat shock (Figure\u00a01C). Stress-induced nuclear puncta were observed when the NELFA subunit was tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry in live or in fixed cells (Figures 1C and S1B\u2013S1E). In contrast, GFP alone remained homogenously distributed in heat-shocked cells (Figure\u00a0S1F). Puncta formation of NELFA was observed even when cells were exposed to mild heat shock (Figure\u00a0S1G) or arsenic stress (Figure\u00a0S1H). Subunits NELFC/D and NELFE also formed puncta upon heat shock that overlapped with NELFA puncta (Figures S2A\u2013S2C), suggesting that the entire NELF complex is reorganized into nuclear puncta upon various cellular stresses. Importantly, similar stress-induced puncta were observed for chromatin-associated endogenous NELFA using immunofluorescence imaging (Figures S2D and S2E). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses after pre-extracting non-chromatin-bound proteins further confirmed that stress enhanced chromatin retention of endogenous NELF (Figure\u00a0S2F). Stress-induced NELF puncta reverted to homogeneous signal within 30\u00a0min of recovery from stress (Figures 1D and S2G), arguing against an irreversible aggregation of NELF upon stressful conditions. The NELF puncta showed liquid-like properties such as spherical shape (Figures S2H and S2I) and rapidly coalesced to form bigger spherical puncta (Figure\u00a01E). To further test if NELF puncta were condensates formed by LLPS, we treated cells with 1,6-hexanediol\u2014an aliphatic alcohol that is thought to disrupt weak hydrophobic interactions that underlie many phase-separated condensates (Kroschwald et\u00a0al., 2017). NELF puncta were highly sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol treatment as quantified by the number of cells with NELF puncta (Figures 1F and S2J) and the number of condensates per nucleus (Figures 1F and 1G). Thus, human NELF complex rapidly formed liquid-like condensates upon stress, concomitant with increased recruitment of NELF to chromatin and global transcriptional downregulation.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Stress induces NELF condensates in nuclei(A) Genome browser tracks showing ChIP-seq occupancy of RNA Pol II, NELFA, and NELFE at RPL14 and RPS3A loci in HEK293 cells.

We expressed recombinant human NELF complex in insect cells, purified and dephosphorylated it, and labeled it with a fluorescent dye (Figure\u00a0S3A). Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that purified NELF readily self-associated to form numerous, micron-sized spherical droplets, which settled onto the coverslip surface by gravity (Figure\u00a02A). These observations indicated that NELF is capable of undergoing phase separation in\u00a0vitro in the absence of crowding agents.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02NELF complex undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in\u00a0vitro(A) Fluorescence microscopy images of purified recombinant NELF complex in buffer with variable NaCl concentration, as indicated.

At a concentration of sodium chloride of 50\u00a0mM, NELF formed droplets with a critical concentration of \u223c0.5\u00a0\u03bcM (Figure\u00a02B). Upon contact, these droplets coalesced into larger ones that readily relaxed to a spherical shape (Figure\u00a02C), emphasizing the liquid-like properties of NELF droplets. To study the dynamics of molecules within NELF phase-separated droplets, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Rapid recovery of fluorescence within the bleached region (Figures 2D and S3B) showed that NELF molecules can freely diffuse within the condensed phase, consistent with their liquid-like behavior. Together, these results demonstrate that the purified NELF complex can undergo LLPS in\u00a0vitro.NELF dephosphorylation is required for condensationWe next investigated why NELF condensation was observed only upon stress. We speculated that stress induces changes in post-translational modifications of NELF that may be critical for condensation. Mass spectrometric analysis of NELF isolated from control and heat-shocked human cells indeed revealed robust changes in phosphorylation of NELF subunits upon heat shock. A consistent decrease in phosphorylation levels of three NELFA residues was observed upon heat shock (Figure\u00a03A). It is known that these NELF residues are phosphorylated by the P-TEFb kinase subunit CDK9 in\u00a0vivo (Lu et\u00a0al., 2016).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03NELF dephosphorylation is required for phase separation(A) Mean fold changes in phosphorylation levels of indicated NELFA residues in HEK293 cells in heat-shocked cells (HS) compared to non-heat-shocked cells (NHS), as detected by mass spectrometry.

Asterisks denote p\u00a0value of <0.0001 as calculated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison tests. ns denotes non-significant.See also Figure\u00a0S3.To study the role of P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation in NELF condensation, we incubated preformed NELF droplets with active wild-type (WT) or catalytically inactive P-TEFb complex in\u00a0vitro. Time-resolved imaging revealed that NELF droplets shrunk considerably when treated with active P-TEFb, whereas no effect was observed with the inactive P-TEFb variant (Figure\u00a03B). We confirmed that P-TEFb phosphorylated the NELF complex under in\u00a0vitro conditions (Figures S3C and S3D). To further test the effect of phosphorylation on NELF phase separation, we performed FRAP analyses on partial or entire droplets formed by dephosphorylated or P-TEFb-treated NELF (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3E). After photobleaching entire droplets, about 80% of phosphorylated NELF molecules exchanged with the\u00a0surrounding solution within 20\u00a0min, while only 40% of dephosphorylated NELF molecules recovered in an equally sized droplet (Figures 3C and 3D). Consistently, P-TEFb-treated NELF showed faster fluorescence recovery after photobleaching a spot within individual droplets (Figure\u00a0S3E). The faster recovery of P-TEFb-treated NELF indicates that phosphorylation weakens the intermolecular interactions between NELF molecules, in line with the observed correlation between NELF dephosphorylation and condensation (Figure\u00a03B).To investigate how stress could regulate the phosphorylation of NELF in cells, we performed a quantitative interactome analysis on the kinase subunit of P-TEFb, namely CDK9. The interaction between CDK9 and the HSP90 chaperone complex did not change during heat shock (Figures 3E and S3F). However, heat shock caused a significant increase in the interaction of CDK9 with LARP7, HEXIM1, and MEPCE (Figure\u00a03E). These proteins are known components of the 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that sequesters CDK9 in a functionally inactive form (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2001; Yang et\u00a0al., 2001). To test the hypothesis that CDK9 sequestration upon heat shock leads to NELF condensation, we overexpressed CDK9 and its cyclin partner CCNT1 that together form the P-TEFb complex. A significant reduction in number of cells showing NELFA condensates was observed in cells overexpressing P-TEFb (Figure\u00a0S3G). Moreover, survival after heat shock was significantly compromised in cells overexpressing P-TEFb or just CCNT1 (Figure\u00a0S3H). Taken together, these results suggest that heat shock leads to CDK9 sequestration, likely promoting NELF dephosphorylation and condensation.Stress-induced SUMOylation is required for NELF condensationCDK9 inhibition with DRB on its own did not lead to NELF condensate formation (Figures 4A and S3I), implying that a decrease in NELF phosphorylation alone was not sufficient to drive cellular NELF condensation. In addition, we found that heat shock causes conjugation of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) 2/3 at more than 30 residues of the NELF complex (Hendriks et\u00a0al., 2018; Hendriks et\u00a0al., 2017) (Figure\u00a0S4A), suggesting a role of SUMOylation in NELF condensation. We observed that protein SUMOylation and NELF condensation is initiated within 5\u00a0min of acute heat shock (Figures S4B and S4C), whereas transcriptional downregulation is robustly observed after 15\u00a0min of exposure to heat shock (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). Treatment of cells with ML-792, an inhibitor of SUMO Activating Enzyme\u00a01/2 (SAE1/2), blocked the stress-induced increase of SUMOylation (Figure\u00a0S4D) and reduced the number of NELF condensates (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4E). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of SUMO-conjugating E2 enzyme UBC9 also decreased the fraction of cells with NELF condensates (Figures 4D, 4E, and S4F). Together, these data strongly support the idea that heat-shock-induced SUMOylation is critical for NELF condensation.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04NELF SUMOylation drives nuclear condensate formation(A) Fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa NELFA-GFP cells treated with vehicle or CDK9 inhibitor 5,6-Dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) under no heat shock conditions (NHS).

Indeed, ZNF451 isoform 1 immunoprecipitated from human cells (Eisenhardt et\u00a0al., 2015) as well as an N-terminal region of ZNF451 isoform 1 purified from E.\u00a0coli could SUMOylate recombinant NELF in\u00a0vitro (Figures 4F and S4G). Coincidently, ZNF451 was the only SUMO E3 ligase whose abundance at chromatin was drastically increased in response to heat shock, similar to the NELF complex (Figures 4G and S4H). Reminiscent of the auto-SUMOylated forms of ZNF451 seen in\u00a0vitro (Figure\u00a0S4G), we also observed high molecular weight forms in heat-shocked cells (Figure\u00a04G). Overexpression of ZNF451 led to an increased fraction of cells showing larger NELF condensates (Figures S5A and S5B), supporting the view that ZNF451-mediated SUMOylation facilitates NELF condensation. Intriguingly, ZNF451 itself formed puncta that were located at the periphery of NELF condensates (Figure\u00a0S5B). ZNF451 overexpression significantly reduced cell viability upon heat shock, similar to P-TEFb overexpression (Figure\u00a0S5C). Strikingly, however, the overexpression of both ZNF451 and P-TEFb neutralized the individual effects on cellular survival upon heat shock (Figure\u00a0S5C). These observations buttress the possibility that the two independent pathways, ZNF451-mediated SUMOylation and P-TEFb-mediated phosphorylation, have antagonizing functions in the process of NELF condensation.We then tested the significance of SUMOylation in stress-mediated transcriptional downregulation by pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Mahat et\u00a0al., 2016; Niskanen et\u00a0al., 2015) and nascent transcript counting with SLAM-seq (Herzog et\u00a0al., 2017). UBC9 depletion by siRNA blocked stress-induced downregulation of hundreds of genes as assessed by Pol II ChIP-seq (Figures 4H, S5D, and S5E). Similarly, ZNF451-depleted cells showed impaired downregulation of genes upon stress recovery as shown by Thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) (Figures\u00a04I and S5F). These results indicate that stress-induced SUMOylation mediated by UBC9/ZNF451 is necessary for global transcriptional downregulation seen upon stress. Besides ZNF451, pro-myelocytic leukemia (PML) is another protein which has been associated with nuclear SUMOylation (Sahin et\u00a0al., 2014) and a known target of ZNF451 (Eisenhardt et\u00a0al., 2015). We ruled out the functional involvement of PML in NELF\u00a0condensation, as PML-depleted cells formed NELF puncta similar to WT cells upon heat shock (Figure\u00a0S5G). Thus, heat shock activates the UBC9/ZNF451 pathway leading to NELF\u00a0SUMOylation, NELF condensation, and transcriptional downregulation.NELF condensates are distinct from HSF1-containing nuclear stress bodiesUpon stress, mammalian cells are known to form stress-induced nuclear bodies marked by the presence of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (Biamonti and Vourc\u2019h, 2010; Cotto et\u00a0al., 1997). While both NELF and HSF1 are homogenously distributed in the nucleus in non-stressed cells, we found that NELF and HSF1 formed spatially distinct puncta upon heat shock without any overlap (Figure\u00a0S6A). This observation suggests that NELF condensates are structurally and likely functionally distinct from nuclear stress bodies.HSF1 is critical for upregulation of chaperone-encoding genes during heat shock but dispensable for global downregulation (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019; Mahat et\u00a0al., 2016). As expected, heat shock caused an increase in the Pol II ChIP-seq occupancy at promoters of heat shock-induced genes (Figure\u00a0S6B). Concomitantly, NELF occupancy also increased at these promoters to a similar extent (Figure\u00a0S6B), in line with the known function of NELF as a Pol II co-factor. At promoters of downregulated genes, however, NELF ChIP-seq signal increased without any change of Pol II occupancy (Figure\u00a0S6B). Thus, heat shock causes significantly more NELF to accumulate in comparison with Pol II at downregulated genes (Figure\u00a0S6C), and this NELF accumulation correlates strongly with transcriptional downregulation (Figure\u00a0S6D).NELF tentacles drive phase separation and interact with Pol II CTD in\u00a0vitroNELFA and NELFE both contain IDRs termed \u201ctentacles\u201d (Figures 5A and S6E\u2013S6G) (Vos et\u00a0al., 2018b). GFP fused to either NELFA or NELFE tentacles did not undergo phase separation (Figure\u00a05B). However, when the GFP-NELFA tentacle fusion protein was mixed in an equimolar ratio with the GFP-NELFE tentacle fusion protein, droplets formed readily (Figure\u00a05C). GFP that fused to NELFE tentacle at its N terminus and NELFA tentacle at its C terminus Figure S5 exhibited phase separation even at much lower concentrations (Figure\u00a05D). The obtained droplets were sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol (Figure\u00a05E). Importantly, the NELF complex variants lacking either the NELFA or NELFE tentacle showed a highly reduced ability to form liquid\u00a0droplets (Figures 5F and S6E). Taken together, our in\u00a0vitro data identified the two disordered tentacles as critical determinants\u00a0that are necessary and sufficient for LLPS of the NELF complex.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05NELF tentacles drive phase separation in\u00a0vitro(A) Domain architecture of NELFA and NELFE subunits with corresponding disorder prediction using the software PONDR (Peng et\u00a0al., 2006). pNLS, putative nuclear localization sequence; IDR, intrinsically disordered region; RD, Arg/Asp-rich domain; RRM, RNA recognition motif.(B) Phase separation assays with recombinant GFP-NELFA or GFP-NELFE tentacle fusion protein at low ionic strength (50\u00a0mM NaCl).

Enrichment of human CTD (hCTD) within NELF droplets (Figures 5G and 5H) suggests that NELF condensates can indeed form heterotypic interactions with CTD. The proximal half of hCTD contains mostly repeats with the consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 and is almost identical to the CTD of the yeast S.\u00a0cerevisiae (yCTD) (Figure\u00a05G). The distal half of hCTD consists of repeats that frequently deviate from the consensus, most commonly at heptad position 7 (Figure\u00a05G) (Harlen and Churchman, 2017). Strikingly, the distal hCTD half showed enrichment within NELF droplets, but yCTD was excluded from NELF droplets (Figure\u00a05H). These observations suggest an importance of the distal non-consensus repeats in the hCTD-NELF condensate interaction. Experiments investigating the partitioning of synthetic CTD peptides with distinct phosphorylated residues revealed that S5-phosphorylated peptide was enriched within NELF droplets more than other tested CTD peptides (Figures 5I and 5J). The S5-phosphorylated form of Pol II is primarily observed around the promoter-proximal region where NELF occupancy increases upon heat shock (Figure\u00a01A) (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019; Eick and Geyer, 2013; Harlen and Churchman, 2017).A disordered NELFA region drives NELF condensation in cells, transcriptional downregulation, and survival upon stressBy deletion mutagenesis of the NELFA tentacle, we identified a continuous region of disorder from residue 321 to 460, which we refer to as the IDR. NELFA lacking the IDR (NELFA-\u0394IDR) showed normal targeting to the nucleus, as a putative nuclear localization sequence (pNLS) identified in the tentacle (Figure\u00a0S6H) was not inside the IDR (Figure\u00a05A). NELFA-\u0394IDR also got incorporated in the NELF complex (Figures S6I and S6J). However, NELFA-\u0394IDR failed to form condensates upon heat shock, unlike its WT counterpart (NELFA-WT) (Figures 6A, S6K, and S6L), in agreement with the in\u00a0vitro phase separation data (Figures 5F and S6E). Quantification by ChIP-qPCR showed that both NELFA-WT and NELFA-\u0394IDR were recruited to target promoters to the same extent in unstressed cells. Heat shock caused an increase of NELFA-WT ChIP signal at promoters of downregulated genes (Figures 1A and \u200band6B);6B); however, this increase was not seen for NELFA-\u0394IDR (Figure\u00a06B). We and others have shown previously (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019; Mahat et\u00a0al., 2016) that hundreds of genes encoding growth-related biosynthetic proteins become transcriptionally downregulated upon heat shock in NELFA-WT cells (Figures S7A\u2013S7E). However, cells expressing NELFA-\u0394IDR were unable to downregulate these genes (Figures 6C and S7C\u2013S7E). Instead, genes encoding growth-promoting cell cycle, translation, and DNA replication proteins were transcriptionally upregulated in NELFA-\u0394IDR cells (Figures S7I and S7J). Heat-shock-mediated transcriptional upregulation of chaperone-encoding genes was similar in NELFA-WT and NELFA-\u0394IDR cells (Figures S7A\u2013S7H). Thus, deletion of the NELFA IDR and loss of NELF condensation specifically compromised NELF function in stress-induced transcriptional downregulation. NELFA-\u0394IDR cells showed a marked decrease of cell survival upon heat shock compared to NELFA-WT cells (Figure\u00a07D), suggesting that IDR-driven NELF condensation is adaptive for stress resistance.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06NELFA disordered region drives stress-induced nuclear NELF condensation, transcriptional downregulation, and cell survival upon stress(A) Fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells expressing GFP fused to either wild-type NELFA (WT) or NELFA containing 140-residue IDR deletion (\u0394IDR).

The integration of two stress-dependent pathways\u2014sequestration of P-TEFb complex and activation of SUMO E3 ligase ZNF451\u2014results in NELF condensation in nuclei of stressed cells.To establish a causal relationship between NELF condensation and its stress-related function, we fused NELFA-\u0394IDR to IDRs of unrelated proteins. These replacement constructs contained the IDR from either FUS or EWSR1, two proteins known to be phase separated even under non-heat-shock conditions (Harrison and Shorter, 2017). Interestingly, NELF-IDR replacements formed condensates even in the absence of any stress (Figures 6E and 6F). Moreover, cells expressing NELFA with FUS- or EWSR1-IDRs showed decreased transcription of tested genes in comparison to NELFA-WT cells under non-stress conditions (Figure\u00a06G), linking NELF condensation to transcriptional reduction. Importantly, cells expressing NELFA-IDR replacements showed significantly better survival upon heat shock in comparison to NELFA-\u0394IDR cells (Figure\u00a06H). These observations suggest that the ability of NELF to form condensates is essential for its function in transcriptional downregulation promoting cell survival under stress. DiscussionHere we report that NELF can form nuclear condensates that are important for transcriptional downregulation and cellular survival under stressful conditions. By increasing local NELF concentration, such condensates may facilitate increased chromatin residence time of NELF. NELF stabilizes promoter-proximally paused Pol II that reduces further transcription initiation (Gressel et\u00a0al., 2017; Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017), decreasing transcriptional output of target genes during stress. NELF condensates may interact with RNA Pol II at the first pausing step, as reported recently (Aoi et\u00a0al., 2020). Alternatively, such condensates may sterically prevent the interaction of P-TEFb or other elongation factors with RNA Pol II, ultimately resulting in transcriptional downregulation of the target genes. Additionally, or alternatively, promoter-associated Pol II may dissociate from template DNA and terminate during stress.At the molecular level, the formation of NELF condensates requires the disordered tentacles in subunits NELFA and NELFE, whose differential sequence compositions likely allow them to engage in intermolecular multivalent interactions (Figure\u00a0S6G) (Wang et\u00a0al., 2018). The stress inducibility of NELF condensates may be explained by the fact that most of the P-TEFb phosphorylation sites and more than one-third of all SUMOylation sites lie within the disordered regions (Figures S3D and S4A). Moreover, NELF contains putative SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) that may further increase the valency of the NELF complex by binding to SUMOylated NELF in the vicinity (Banani et\u00a0al., 2016; Ditlev et\u00a0al., 2018; Min et\u00a0al., 2019). The various layers regulating NELF condensation likely makes it an integrative process that takes place only when multiple independent signaling pathways converge on the NELF complex (Figure\u00a07).On a more conceptual level, nuclear NELF condensates are similar to cytosolic stress granules. Both condensates are stress-induced and likely formed by phase separation that can be recapitulated in\u00a0vitro. Together, NELF condensates and stress granules are crucial for reversible downregulation of transcription and translation, respectively, thereby repressing gene expression upon stress. It is possible that upstream signaling co-regulates the formation of both these condensates (Samir et\u00a0al., 2019). In this regard, it is noteworthy that acute translation inhibition blocks stress-induced increase in NELF abundance at chromatin. Our earlier studies reported p38 kinase signaling to be crucial for communication between cytosolic translation events and nuclear transcriptional downregulation under stress conditions (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). How stress signaling initiates and/or maintains NELF condensates will be an exciting future avenue (Li et\u00a0al., 2012; Nott et\u00a0al., 2015). It is plausible that kinases, phosphatases, or the SUMOylation machinery partition in NELF condensates. The mechanism of CDK9 sequestration upon heat shock in the inactivating complex deserves further investigation, as CDK9 activity is essential for the upregulation of HSF1 target genes. In addition, it will be important to study how stress activates the SUMO E3 ligase ZNF451.In summary, we report a stress-induced nuclear condensate, which may contribute to cellular survival strategy under stressful conditions.

Timmers, University of Freiburg) and HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex cells (Obtained from R. Paro, ETH Zurich) were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich F0804), 2mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, G7513) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P4333). Cells were kept at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator. All cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination by PCR.Method DetailsCell stress treatments Heat shock experiments were performed by moving tissue culture plates with growing cells from a 37\u00b0C incubator to a 43\u00b0C incubator for 30\u00a0min, unless stated otherwise.Heat shock recovery experiments are performed by moving tissue culture plates to a 37\u00b0C incubator after heat shock treatment for mentioned time durations. To induce heavy metal stress, the cells were treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcM arsenic trioxide for 1 h.Generating clones For generation of clones for human proteins, hORFs in pDONOR vector were purchased from BIOSS, University of Freiburg and Cloned into GFP (kind gift from Marc Timmers, University of Freiburg) or mCherry (Addgene 31907) pDestination vector using Gateway LR clonase II enzyme kit (Life Technologies 11791020).Site directed mutagenesis The primers to introduce deletions were designed using NEBaseChanger. The NELFA mutants were generated using full plasmid amplification of WT plasmid with primers for deletions mutations. The Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase was used to perform PCR amplifications according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (New England BioLabs, M0494S). PCR products were subjected to DpnI digestion to remove co-purifed parental plasmid DNA. Colonies were selected with appropriate antibiotic selection marker and sequenced to confirm the deletions.IDR Replacement plasmids The NELFA-mCherry dIDR construct was used for genrating IDR replacement mutants.XhoI and HindIII restriction sites separated by Gly-Ser-Ser codons were inserted at the end of NELFA-dIDR mutant using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase. The insertion of restriction sites was confirmed with double restriction digestion and sequencing. The IDR regions from FUS (aa 61- 260) and EWSR1 (aa 121-340) were amplied from pDonor vectors with primers containing restriction sites and were ligated in the modified NELFA-dIDR plasmid using restriction enzymes based cloning. The cloning was confirmed with sequencing the plasmids.Plasmid transfections HEK293 and HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, L3000) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. mCherry tag containing vectors, CDK9-cGFP, CCNT1-cGFP and ZNF451-GFP vectors were transiently transfected in HeLa cells. NELFA-cGFP, NELFA-BG-nGFP, GFP-3FHBH (kind gift from Timmers lab, Freiburg and Akhtar Department, MPI Freiburg) were stably transfected in Flp-In T-Rex HeLa cells grown in 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"R25001\",\"term_id\":\"779889\",\"term_text\":\"R25001\"}}R25001) for at least three days before\u00a0transfection. Stable positive clones were selected for at least three weeks in 15\u00a0\u03bcg/mL blasticidin S (Carl Roth CP14.1) and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL hygromycin B (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10687010). Expression of proteins was induced with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich, T7660).Cellular fractionation and chromatin extraction Cells were harvested by scrapping and washing twice in ice-cold 1xPBS. Total cell extracts for western blot analysis were obtained by lysing cells in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS and 10% glycerol). Chromatin extraction was done as described previously (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and an aliquot was removed and saved as whole cell extract. Remaining cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25cM sucrose) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were passed through 18 G needles five times and centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was washed with buffer A, resuspended in 0.5 M buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 M KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) and incubated on a rotator for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The suspension was centrifuged and the chromatin pellet was resuspended in 2 M buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 M KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol), passed through a 200\u00a0\u03bcL cut tip ten times and incubated while rotating for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Chromatin fractions were sonicated for 15 cycles (30 s on, 30 s off, high power) in a Bioruptor sonication device. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000\u00a0g for 30 min to remove debris and unsonicated material.Western Blotting The whole cell lysates or chromatin fractions were prepared in buffers mentioned aboved. Samples were mixed in 3:1 ratio with 4x protein loading buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromophenol blue and 20% Beta-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C. Tris-glycine-based denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used before standard western blot procedures.Antibodies SUMO hybridoma SUMO2 8A2, were procured from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, created by the NICHD of the NIH and maintained at The University of Iowa, Department of Biology (http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu/) and supernatant was produced in Pichler lab. The SUMO2 antisera were used at 1:100. All other primary antibodies were purchased and validated by the manufacturers (data available on manufacturers\u2019 websites). They were used at the indicated dilutions; anti-NELFA (goat polyclonal, sc-23599 (A-20), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000, anti-NELFC/D (mouse monoclonal, sc-393972 (C-10), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:1,000, anti-NELFE (rabbit polyclonal, sc-32912 (H-140), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000, anti-SNRNP70 (rabbit polyclonal, ab83306, Abcam) at 1:1,000, anti-ZNF451 (rabbit polyclonal, A305-177A, Bethyl Laboratories inc), anti-RPB3 (rabbit polyclonal, ABE999, Millipore) at 1:1,000, and anti-Histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal, ab70550, Abcam) at 1:5,000. Secondary antibodies against goat, rabbit or mouse proteins were horseradish peroxidase conjugated and were typically used at 1:10,000 dilution. Anti-rabbit (NA934V) and anti-mouse (NA931V) antibodies were purchased from GE healthcare. Anti-goat (sc-2354) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Cell Imaging Cells were grown on Nunc Lab-Tek 8 well chambers (Thermo Fisher 155411) 24\u00a0h at 37 \u00b0C and then either transfected with mCherry constructs using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, L3000) or induced with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich, T7660) for Flp-In T-rex stable cell lines. Cells were either left at 37\u00b0C (No Heat Shock, NHS) or shifted to 43\u00b0C incubator for indicated time periods (Heat shock, HS).For live cell imaging, samples were taken immediately to microscope with temperature- and CO2- controlled stage top incubation unit (Tokai Hit).For fixed cell imaging, cells were treated with 4% fomaldehyde fixative solution (Invitrogen, FB002) for 10\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C post treatments and washed three times with 1xPBS (Sigma-Aldrich D8537). DAPI is added for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in 1xPBS and images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope using 63x oil immersion objective at a zoom range 0.6-2x. Z stacks were recorded and collapsed into a single maximum intensity projection using Zen black software. Images were processed using Zen blue or Imaris. For transient transfections, images were acquired with laser powers to avoid saturation. Images were presented as Min/Max intensity or Best fit function of Zen blue software.Colocalization images for NELFA-NELFE were acquired using Airyscan LSM880 microscope using 63x objective with oil immersion. The images were processed in Airyscan itself with default settings and using Zen blue subsequently.Hexanediol Treatment Cells were plated Nunc Lab-Tek Chamber Slides in 400\u00a0\u03bcl complete media in 4 different sets and induced with 1 ug/mL tetracycline in fresh media for 24 h. Cells were either left at 37\u00b0C with or without 10% 1,6-hexanediol treatment for 15\u00a0min (NHS and NHS\u00a0+ Hex) or shifted to a 43\u00b0C incubator with or without 10% 1,6-hexanediol treatment for 15\u00a0min (HS and HS\u00a0+ Hex). Cells were harvested, fixed and imaged as described above using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.Quantification of nuclear condensates For counting number of cells with heat shock induced puncta, minimum of two individual replicates were performed on different days and cells showing condensates were counted. Mean value with standard deviation from two replicates was reported. For counting number of condensates per cell a minimum of two individual replicates were done on different days. The number of condensates per nucleus was determined using Imaris software (version 9.3) in batch analysis mode with Cells module with custom parameters. One of the two representative replicates is presented for each condition with their mean and standard deviation. The number of condensates for NHS conditions were counted manually given the few number of condensates per cell. Sphericity of the condensates was measured using Imaris software (version 9.1) with Surface module with custom parameters.Visualization of chromatin associated endogenous NELFA using immunofluorescence Cells were plated Nunc Lab-Tek Chamber Slides in 400\u00a0\u03bcl complete media in 4 different sets and induced with 1 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline in fresh media for 24 h. Cells were either left at 37\u00b0C (NHS) or shifted to a 43\u00b0C incubator (HS) for 30\u00a0min. Cells were washed once with ice cold 1x PBS and then incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 6\u00a0min on ice. Cells were washed twice with ice cold 1x PBS and 200 ul of 4% fomaldehyde fixative solution (Invitrogen, FB002) was added for 10\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed twice with ice cold 1x PBS and 0.4% Triton X-100 was added for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Cells were washed and blocked with 5% BSA solution in 1x PBS for 2\u00a0h at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed and cells were incubated with primary antibody anti-NELFA (goat polyclonal, sc-23599 (A-20), Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100 dilution overnight at 4\u00b0C incubator. Cells were washed thrice with 1x PBS and labeled secondary antibody was added for 2\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were washed thrice with 1x PBS and DAPI is added for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in 1xPBS. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope keeping laser power same for NHS and HS. The mean intensity per nucleus (DAPI channel) is calculated using Imaris 9.3 in arbitiary units and a background value of 6 is subtracted from each measurement. Data is plotted in Prism 7.For FACS, similar protocol was followed and DAPI stained cells with NELFA- IF were subjected to analysis using FACS. Briefly, Trypsinized cells were resuspended in complete DMEM and washed with chilled 1X PBS. Then the cells were resuspended in chilled pre-extraction buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS) and incubated on ice for 4\u00a0min. The cells were washed with 1X PBS with 1% w/w BSA and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 1X PBS for 10\u00a0min at RT. For analysis of chromatin retained NELF, pre-extracted cells were measured on a BD LSRFortessa ii flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed or FlowJo software 9.9.6 (BD).Chemical treatments Treatment with the SUMO E1 inhibitor ML-792 (kind gift from UbiQ) was performed at a final concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM for 1\u00a0h immediately before induction of heat shock. Similarly CDK9 inhibitor DRB was used at final concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcM for 1 h.RNA interference SMARTpool siRNA reagent (Dharmacon) was used. This siRNA mix is a pool of four siRNA duplexes designed to target distinct sites within the specific gene of interest, while not to having significant off-target effects based on in silico predictions. Cherry-pick libraries from Dharmacon comprising several siRNA SMARTpool and nontargeting controls were ordered. NELFA-3\u2032UTR specific siRNA was ordered from Microsynth as set of three different siRNA duplexed and mixed together to a final stock concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM each. E3 ligase siRNAs (for knockdown of PIAS1, PIAS4 and ZNF451) were ordered from Origene. HeLa cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection. siRNAs were transfected using RNAiMax according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen, 13778075). siRNAs were transfected at 30 pmol per well of 6 well plate. Cells were further incubated for 48 h before being harvested for analysis. Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by western blotting.SILAC based Mass-spectrometric analysis of CDK9 interactome and NELFA phosphorylation Quantitative mass spectrometry was carried out using the SILAC approach (Ong et\u00a0al., 2002). For the analysis of the CDK9 interactome, Flp-In T-Rex HEK293 cells that stably express C-terminally GFP-tagged CDK9 or GFP, were cultured in normal medium (\u2018light\u2019), medium containing 2H4-lysine and 13C6-arginine (\u2018medium\u2019), or 15N213C6-lysine and 15N413C6-arginine (\u2018heavy\u2019) supplemented with dialyzed FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88440) for at least five cell divisions (starting density\u00a0< 1%). Light-, medium- and heavy-labeled cells were then either exposed to heat shock conditions (43\u00b0C, 1.5 h) or left at 37\u00b0C. Three replicate experiments were conducted following the label-swap strategy (Park et\u00a0al., 2012). After the treatment, cells were chemically crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min and quenched for 5\u00a0min using excess L-glycine. Cells were then lysed in 1xRIPA buffer (50\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and combined in equal amounts. The cell lysate was sonicated using a BioRuptor system and cleared by centrifugation. The cleared cell lysate was then applied to GFP-trap magnetic agarose beads (ChromoTek, gtma 20) for 1\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed with high salt buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1\u00a0M NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1\u00a0mM EDTA) and non-denaturing buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Proteins were digested sequentially on the beads with LysC and then with trypsin in solution. Peptides were desalted and analyzed using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an nLC 1000 Nano UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw files were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.7.4) and analyzed using Perseus (version 1.5.2.4). First, decoy and contaminant entries were removed. Next, specific CDK9 interactors were discriminated from background interactors under steady-state and heat shock conditions. For this, Student\u2019s t tests were performed based on the iBAQ intensities of proteins quantified in GFP and GFP-CDK9 pulldowns. Proteins exhibiting \u22652-fold enrichment and a t test p value \u22650.1 were defined as GFP-CDK9 specific interactors in both conditions. Subsequently, SILAC ratios of common CDK9 interactors under steady state and heat shock conditions were extracted and normalized so that the SILAC ratio of CDK9 equals one to account for slight variations in IP efficiency. Simultaneous western blots of the input material were performed to confirm that the intracellular CDK9 level did not change upon heat shock.CDK9 interactone score was calculated using double ratio normalization method as mentioned below.CDK9 interactone score (HS/NHS)\u00a0= SILAC ratio of protein HS/NHS in respective replicate divided by SILAC ratio of CDK9 HS/NHS in same replicateFor analysis of NELFA phosphorylation, Flp-In T-Rex HEK293 T-Rex cells that stably express C-terminally GFP-tagged NELFA were used. All procedures were conducted in triplicates as described above. Three different phosphorylation sites on NELFA were detected in each of the replicates with high confidence (PTM score > 0.99).Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR(qPCR) Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR experiments were performed as described previously (Arrigoni et\u00a0al., 2016). Briefly, cells were fixed using 1% methanol-free formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, 28906) in DMEM media at room temperature for 10 min, followed by 5 min quenching with 0.125 M glycine. Cells were then washed two times with ice-cold PBS and the cell pellet was resuspended in Farnham buffer (5 mM PIPES, pH 8; 85 mM KCl; 0.5% Igepal). Cell suspensions were sonicated in 1 ml Covaris tubes (Covaris, 520130) using Covaris S220 with the following settings: peak power\u00a0= 75; duty factor\u00a0= 2; cycles/burst\u00a0= 200. Sonication time varied from cell type to cell type; For HeLa, Sonication time of 4 minutes is used. Isolated nuclei were washed with Farnham buffer and suspended in shearing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 0.1% SDS; 1 mM EDTA). Chromatin was sheared by sonication in 1\u00a0mL Covaris tubes using the following settings: peak power\u00a0= 140; duty factor\u00a0= 5; cycles/burst\u00a0= 200, time\u00a0= 45 minutes. These settings led to a DNA fragment\u2013size distribution of 200\u2013600 bp. Debris was removed by centrifugation. Chromatin was then diluted 1:1 with IP buffer (GFP-trap dilution buffer; 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) to achieve a final SDS concentration of 0.05%. For immunoprecipitation, GFP beads were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 200\u00a0\u03bcg chromatin. An aliquot of chromatin was saved as input DNA. Beads were washed and DNA\u2013protein complexes were eluted from the beads by heating at 65\u00b0C in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS). Crosslinking was reversed for 6 h at 70\u00b0C and samples were treated with 200\u00a0\u03bcg ml\u20131 RNase A (Applichem, A3832) and 200\u00a0\u03bcg ml\u20131 proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, P2308). Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified with phenol\u2013chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and used either as input for subsequent qPCR or library preparation for next-generation sequencing. For ChIP-qPCR, enrichment of the immunoprecipitated DNA at the corresponding loci was expressed as a percentage relative to the input DNA.Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription and nascent-transcript quantification assay HeLa cells were plated and 24\u00a0h post plating, endogenous NELFA was knocked down using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX with concurrent transfection with either NELFA WT or NELFA \u0394IDR replacement mutants using Lipofectamine 3000 as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Media was changed 24\u00a0h after transfections. Cells were harvested in trizol 24\u00a0h after the change of media (48\u00a0h after transfections). RNA was extracted using Trizol as per manufactures protocol. RT reaction was done using Takara PrimeScript RT reaction kit (RR047A) and qPCRs were done using Takara TB Green Premix Ex-Taq (RR420L). Nascent transcripts were detected using intron-exon primer pairs as described (Palozola et\u00a0al., 2017). cDNA was amplified in a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). DNA amounts were quantified using the \u0394\u0394Ct method, and the nontreated condition was set to 1. hnRNP was used as normalized consistent with previous study (Aprile-Garcia et\u00a0al., 2019). The heatmap for qPCRs was generated in Prism 7 using mean values.In\u00a0vitro SUMO assays In\u00a0vitro SUMOylation assays were performed as reported before (Eisenhardt et\u00a0al., 2015; Knipscheer et\u00a0al., 2008; Pichler, 2008; Pichler et\u00a0al., 2004). Briefly, 20\u00a0mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 110\u00a0mM potassium acetate, 2\u00a0mM magnesium acetate, 0.05% (v/v) Tween20, 0.5\u00a0mM TCEP, 0.2\u00a0mg/mL ovalbumin and 5\u00a0mM ATP reactions buffer was used for 20\u00a0\u03bcL reaction volumes at 30\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. 50nM of E1 and E2, 50 and 150nM of E3, 200\u00a0nM Substrate and 2000\u00a0nM of SUMO2 enzymes were used for each reaction. Reactions were terminated by boiling with SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Detection was done using western blotting using protein specific antibodies.RNA Pol II ChIP seq library preparation and data analysis Libraries from Niskanen et\u00a0al. (2015). Genome Biology 2015 were used for RNA Pol II ChIP sequencing. Libraries were sequenced deeper to detect gene body Pol II signal.Cell viability assay Cell viability assay was perfromed using CellTiter-Glo 2 Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G7570) accoring to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96 well cell culture plates at density of 5000 cells per well. Cells were transfected 24\u00a0h after seeding with NELFA siRNA specific against 3\u2032UTR and WT, dIDR NELFA or IDR replacement plasmids using their respective transfection reagents as mentioned above. About 24\u00a0h after transfection, the medium was exchanged and cells were incubated for another 24 h. Following this, cells were subjected to heat shock at 43\u00b0C for different durations (60, 120 and 240\u00a0min). After heat shock treatment, cells were recovered at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and cell viability assay was performed.For CDK9, CCNT1 and ZNF451, Cells were transfected 24\u00a0h after seeding with NELFA mentioned plasmids using their respective transfection reagents as mentioned above. About 24\u00a0h after transfection, cells were subjected to heat shock at 43\u00b0C for different durations (180 and 240\u00a0min). After heat shock treatment, cells were recovered at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and cell viability assay was performed.Luminiscence readings were taken using microplate luminometer (Centro LB 960 \u2013 Berthold technologies) and Mikrowin 2000 software Version 4.41, English UI.Expression and purification of full-length NELF and tentacle deletion variants Full-length human NELF complex and variants lacking either the NELFA tentacle (\u0394189-528) or NELFE tentacle (\u0394139-380) were overexpressed in High Five insect cells (Expression Systems) as previously described (Vos et\u00a0al., 2018b; Vos et\u00a0al., 2016).NELF complex was purified essentially as described (Vos et\u00a0al., 2018b; Vos et\u00a0al., 2016). In brief, the cleared lysate was loaded onto a 5\u00a0mL HisTrap column (GE healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 30\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine) and then washed with high salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 800\u00a0mM NaCl, 30\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284\u00a0\u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine). After re-equilibration in lysis buffer, the column was washed with low salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 30\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine) and attached in-line to a 5\u00a0mL HiTrap Q column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in low salt buffer. The protein was eluted then using elution buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 500\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine). Appropriate elution fractions were mixed with 6xHis-tagged TEV protease and Lambda protein phosphatase and dialyzed overnight against lysis buffer containing 1\u00a0mM MnCl2. To remove the 6xHis tag and TEV protease, the dialysate was applied to a 5\u00a0mL HisTrap column equilibrated in lysis buffer. The flow through was concentrated using a 100\u00a0kDa MWCO Amicon spin filter (Merck) and subjected to gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE healthcare) in NELF size-exclusion buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT). To produce P-TEFb pretreated NELF, an aliquot was removed and incubated with 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM gluthathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged P-TEFb, 6\u00a0mM MgCl2, and 3\u00a0mM ATP for 2\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C. GST-tagged P-TEFb was bound to pre-equilibrated GSTrap 4B resin (GE healthcare) and the NELF-containing supernatant was subjected again to size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column. Appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated, and aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C.Expression and purification of GFP-NELF tentacle fusion proteins The sequence encoding either the tentacle regions of NELFA (residues 189-528) or NELFE (residues 139-380) was cloned C-terminal of a 6xHis-tagged monomeric (A206K) enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site into a modified, pET-derived vector (Addgene, 29654) using Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs). Both plasmids were used as template to generate a double tentacle GFP fusion protein construct with a TEV protease-cleavable 6xHis-tag followed by the NELFE tentacle sequence at its N terminus and the NELFA tentacle sequence at its C terminus. NELF tentacle-GFP fusion proteins were overexpressed in E.\u00a0coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Agilent). Overexpression was induced by the addition of 0.5\u00a0mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) after the culture reached an optical density at 600\u00a0nm of \u223c0.8. The cells were cultured for further 3-4\u00a0h at 22\u00b0C, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 30\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine), flash-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until purification.For purification of NELF tentacle GFP fusion proteins, lysate was loaded on a 5\u00a0mL HisTrap column pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with high salt buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1\u00a0M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37\u00a0\u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine) and eluted in a linear 20CV gradient with elution buffer (20\u00a0mM\u00a0Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 500\u00a0mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.284 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, 1.37 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A, 0.17 mg/mL PMSF, 0.33 mg/mL benzamidine). Appropriate pure fractions were pooled. Single NELF tentacle-GFP fusion proteins were concentrated with a 30\u00a0kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter and then loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column preequilibrated in NELF size-exclusion buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT). Appropriate fractions containing the NELF double tentacle-GFP fusion protein were mixed with 6xHis-tagged TEV protease to cleave the hexahistidine tag during overnight dialysis against lysis buffer. The protein was then loaded on a 5\u00a0mL HisTrap column pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. Flow through fractions were collected and concentrated with a 30\u00a0kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra spin filter. The concentrated protein solution was then applied onto a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column pre-equilibrated in NELF size exclusion buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.Expression and purification of P-TEFb Active P-TEFb (CDK9 1\u2013372, CYCT1 1\u2013272) and the catalytically inactive P-TEFb variant (containing the D149N substitution in CDK9) were expressed in High Five insect cells and purified as previously described (Vos et\u00a0al., 2018a; Vos et\u00a0al., 2018b).Fluorescent labeling of NELF complex NELF complex was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of fluorescent TFP-Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Molecular Probes) for 1\u00a0h on ice in the dark. The reaction was quenched by addition of L-lysine (in 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0) in a 10-fold molar excess to the dye. The reaction was then desalted using a Micro Bio-Spin P6 gel column (Biorad) pre-equilibrated in NELF size-exclusion buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, followed by multiple diafiltration steps using a 30\u00a0kDa MWCO Amicon spin filter (Merck). After concentration, small aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The protocol resulted in a low labeling density of \u223c1.0-1.2 fluorophores per NELF molecule.In\u00a0vitro phase separation assays and microscopy Phase separation assays were conducted in modified 50-well CultureWell chambered coverslides (Grace Bio-Labs). To minimize nonspecific adsorption, the coverslide was passivated with methoxy poly(ethylen glycol) (mPEG) silane, following a similar procedure as described (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2019). For this, the coverslides were washed with 2% Hellmanex III solution (Hellma Analytics) for 2\u00a0h and rinsed with ultrapure water. The glass surface was etched with 1\u00a0M NaOH for 1 h, washed with ultrapure water and incubated overnight with mPEG silane with an average molecular weight of 5\u00a0kDa (25\u00a0mg/mL in 95% EtOH; Nanosoft Polymers). The glass slide was subsequently rinsed with ultrapure water, dried and sealed with crystal clear tape.For phase separation assays with the NELF complex, unlabeled and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled protein were mixed at a molar ratio of 9:1. NELF complex or GFP fusion protein solutions were generally diluted to the indicated final concentrations in 20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT in a total volume of 5.1\u00a0\u03bcl to induce phase separation. To test sensitivity of LLPS toward aliphatic alcohols, 1,6-hexanediol (Sigma Aldrich) was included at a final concentration of 10%. The plate was sealed with crystal clear tape to minimize sample evaporation and incubated for 1-2\u00a0h in the dark to allow formed droplets to settle down on the coverslide surface. Images were acquired above the coverslide surface using an inverted Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope with a HC PL APO 63x/1.40 CS2 objective (oil immersion) at room temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1 1\u00b0C). Generally, at least 5 images per condition were taken in non-overlapping regions, which were considered representative for the droplet distribution on the slide. Images were further processed and analyzed using FIJI (version 1.52 h).In\u00a0vitro FRAP experiments Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to determine the effect of P-TEFb phosphorylation on the mobility of molecules in the condensed phase. Dephosphorylated as well as P-TEFb-treated NELF were diluted to 2\u00a0\u03bcM (partial droplet FRAP experiments) or 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM (full droplet FRAP experiments) in 20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT to induce LLPS. Afterward, the plate was incubated for around 1\u00a0h in the dark prior to imaging. FRAP movies were recorded at a resolution of 256\u00a0\u00d7 256 pixels with a pixel size of 96\u00a0\u00d7 96\u00a0nm. The 488\u00a0nm argon laser line was used at full laser intensity to photobleach a defined region of interest to \u223c10%\u201320% of its initial fluorescence. For partial droplet bleaching, a 1\u00a0\u03bcm circular region was bleached within the center of droplets with a diameter of around 6.0-7.5\u00a0\u03bcm. Fluorescence recovery was imaged every 0.5\u00a0s over a period of 250 s. For full droplet FRAP, the entire area of droplets with a diameter of around 5-6\u00a0\u03bcm was photobleached and 600 frames were recorded with a frame rate of 0.5 s-1. Fluorescence recovery of the bleached region was analyzed using FIJI (version 1.52 h). For this, the fluorescence intensity of the bleached spots was background subtracted, normalized to the fluorescence intensity of the first postbleach image, corrected for acquisition bleaching using a similarly-sized reference droplet in the frame, and normalized to the mean prebleach intensity. The obtained recovery curves were fit to a double-exponential recovery model using Prism (GraphPad software, version 5.03).Real-time P-TEFb droplet phosphorylation For droplet phosphorylation experiments with P-TEFb, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled and unlabeled NELF complex were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:9 and diluted to a final concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM in 20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 1.5\u00a0mM ATP and 4.5\u00a0mM MgCl2. The microscopy slide was then sealed and incubated on the microscope stage for 2\u00a0h in the dark to allow NELF droplets to settle down quantitatively on the coverslide surface. Subsequently, either active P-TEFb or a catalytically inactive P-TEFb variant (containing the D149N substitution in CDK9) were added gently to a final concentration of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM. Immediately after P-TEFb addition, a series of images was acquired in a representative area and imaged in regular intervals for 120\u00a0min.Mass spectrometric analysis of P-TEFb phosphorylation sites Dephosphorylated and P-TEFb-treated NELF samples were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel, respective bands were subjected to tryptic in-gel digestion, and the obtained peptide mixture was enriched for phosphopeptides as described previously (Oellerich et\u00a0al., 2009). After desalting, the peptide mixture was analyzed using a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 nano liquid-chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Oellerich et\u00a0al., 2009). The raw files were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) (Cox and Mann, 2008). The data were searched against the human Uniprot proteome database using default settings, except that serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation, methionine oxidation, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine were allowed as variable modifications. Identified phosphorylation sites were filtered for high confidence with a posttranslational modification (PTM) score > 0.75. All reported sites were detected exclusively in the P-TEFb-treated NELF sample.Analysis of NELF-CTD interaction To test whether NELF droplets interact with the RNA polymerase II CTD, we analyzed partitioning of different CTD fusion proteins. 6xHis-tagged maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins with the full-length human CTD (residues 1593-1970) (Boehning et\u00a0al., 2018), the full-length S.\u00a0cerevisiae CTD (residues 1542-1733) (Boehning et\u00a0al., 2018) as well as the distal half of the human CTD (1776-1970) were expressed in E.\u00a0coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (Boehning et\u00a0al., 2018). The proteins possess a single cysteine residue C-terminal of a TEV protease cleavage site that was used for site-specific labeling with an Alexa Fluor (AF) 647 C2 maleimide (Invitrogen, A20347). AF647-labeled CTD fusion proteins in NELF150 buffer (20\u00a0mM Na-HEPES pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT) were mixed with AF488-labeled NELF complex and 6xHis-tagged TEV protease, prior to induction of LLPS, resulting in final protein concentrations of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM NELF, 2\u00a0\u03bcM MBP-CTD fusion protein and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM TEV protease. The reaction was incubated for 1\u00a0h in the dark at room temperature to allow for TEV cleavage and droplets to settle, prior to imaging using a Leica SP8 microscope in sequential scanning mode.To investigate the effect of different CTD phosphorylation marks on the interaction with NELF condensates, we analyzed the partitioning of synthetic CTD peptides between the condensed and dilute NELF phase. For this, N-terminally carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled CTD peptides with the sequence SPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPS that possess phosphoryl groups at the indicated heptad positions (PSL GmbH) were mixed with unlabeled NELF complex, prior to induction of LLPS, leading to final concentrations of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM NELF and 1\u00a0\u03bcM of the respective peptide. The plate was incubated and imaged as described above. For the calculation of partition coefficients, the recorded images were segmented into condensed and dilute phase using brightfield images and peptide partitioning was analyzed based on the peptide fluorescence within dilute and condensed phase. For this, the fluorescence intensity was determined and averaged for three regions of interest within the condensed and dilute phase of each image. Determined fluorescence intensities for condensed and dilute phase were background-subtracted by the fluorescence intensity of a sample lacking CTD peptide. The corrected fluorescence intensities of the condensed phase were divided by the corrected intensity of the dilute phase to calculate the partition coefficients. For each peptide, partition coefficients were calculated as the ratio of the background-subtracted fluorescence intensities within and outside of the condensed phase for n\u00a0= 12 different recorded images.SLAM-Seq Experiments HeLa cells were plated, and after 24\u00a0h for experiment (1) NELFA Wildtype was knocked down using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX with concurrent transfection with either NELFA WT or NELFA \u0394IDR using Lipofectamine 3000, for experiment (2) scrambled siRNA and siZNF451 was used with Lipofectamine RNAi MAX all per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Media was changed 24\u00a0h after transfection and/or knockdown. Heat-shock and labeling was carried out 24\u00a0h after the change of media (48\u00a0h after transfection and/or knockdown) in the following manner:For NELFA WT and NELFA-\u0394IDR experiment - Cells were subject to heat shock at 43\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min, with labeling beginning at the start of heat-shock with 200\u00a0\u03bcM 4SU (Cayman Chemical 16373). The total labeling time was 60\u00a0min.For siZNF451 experiment - Cells were subject to heat shock at 43\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, with labeling beginning 15\u00a0min into heat-shock with 200\u00a0\u03bcM 4SU (Cayman Chemical 16373), after a total of thirty minutes of heat-shock, cells were returned to 37\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min of recovery. The total labeling time was 105\u00a0min.RNA was extracted using Trizol per manufactures protocol, with addition of DTT to a final concentration of 1mM, and protected from light during the procedure to prevent S-S cross-binding. 5\u03bcg of RNA was used for SLAM-seq modifications, as described in (Herzog et\u00a0al., 2017). Briefly, Iodoacetamide (Sigma I1149) was conjugated to 4SU in a 50mM pH 8.0 phosphate buffer in DMSO/Water\u00a0(1:1), the reaction was quenched with DTT and RNA was reprecipitated using Ethanol and NaOAc. Libraries were prepared using Quantseq 3\u2032 mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen).Bioinformatic analysis ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the human genome build hg38 using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Duplicate and discordant reads were removed. Peak calling was done with MACS2 (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2008) (model- based analysis of ChIP- Seq) using \u201c\u2013keep-dup all,\u201d \u201c\u2013nomodel,\u201d \u201c\u2013extsize\u201d and \u201c\u2013broad.\u201d Gene annotations and transcript start site (TSS) information for human genes were from taken from Gencode annotation release 26. Genes considered for differential gene body rpkm analysis were filtered similar to Chen et al. (2015): the rpm of the TSS region (from the TSS to 500\u00a0bp downstream of the TSS) had to be at least 1, genes had to be longer than 2kb and more than 1kb distant to any neighboring gene. In case a gene had several TSSs, the highest occupied (based on rpm) was taken. Gene body was defined for the remaining genes as TSS\u00a0+ 1500bp to transcription end site (TES) \u2013 500bp. Reads overlapping the gene body regions were counted using bedtools 10. Differential analysis of gene body density was done using DESeq2 (Love et\u00a0al., 2014). Size factors were calculated based on the ChIP-seq signal of very long genes as proposed by Mahat et\u00a0al. (2016). MAplots of differential gene body density were visualized using ggplots2 (Wickham, 2016) package in R with signifcant genes (padj\u00a0< 0.1) highlighted in red.For visualization, the paired-end reads were extended to fragment size and normalized to total reads aligned (reads per million, rpm) using deeptools2 (Ramirez et\u00a0al., 2016). All browser tracks were visualized using Integrative Genome Viewer (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/). Profile Plots for TSS regions (TSS+/\u2212 500bp) and gene body regions were generated using deeptools2. Violin plots were generated with the vioplot package in R using the log2 fold change of the gene body counts. Only top 250 expressed genes (based on Pol II density at TSS in NHS samples) were used for visualization.Boxplots depicting the ratio of NELFA/E ChIP-seq signal increase upon HS over the ratio of Pol II ChIP-seq signal increase were plotted using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). Significance was calculated using Wilcoxon rank sum test.Histograms showing the NelfA/E ChIP-seq signal increase upon HS of significantly downregulated genes and NELF target genes with their corresponding gene body density misregulation upon HS, respectively, were plotted using gplots (Warnes, 2012). NELF target genes were defined as genes with a ChIP-seq signal in the TSS region (TSS+/\u2212250bp) > 2\u00a0rpm.SLAM-seq analysis was done similar to Neumann et al. (2019). 3\u2032UTR annotations were taken from Gencode annotation release 31 and merged on a gene level. Adapters and polyA stretches were trimmed from raw reads using fastp (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018). Trimmed reads were further processed with SlamDunk v0.3.4 16. \u201cSlamdunk all\u201d command was executed with default parameters except \u2018-5 12 -n 100 -t 20 \u2013m -rl 100\u2013skip-sam\u2019.Differential gene expression was done with DESeq2 using raw read counts with at least 2 T>C conversions. MAplots of differential gene expression were visualized using ggplots2 (Wickham, 2016) package in R with signifcant genes (padj\u00a0< 0.1) highlighted in red. Size factors were calculated based on corresponding total read counts for global normalization.Violin plots were generated with the vioplot package in R using the log2 fold change based on reads with >\u00a0= 2 T>C conversions. Only genes with a padj\u00a0< 0.1 were used for visualization. The same gene lists were plotted as a heatmap using ComplexHeatmap package in R (Gu et\u00a0al., 2016).Scatterplots of log2FoldChanges upon different conditions were generated using gplots (Warnes, 2012).Pairwise correlation scatterplots by replicates were plotted using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) using spearman correlation method.Go analysis was done using Metascape (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2019) with Express analysis and pathways enriched with \u2013log10(P) vlaue of more than or equal to 10 are represented in manuscript.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisAll the statistical analysis is done using GraphPad \u2013 Prism Version 7.
