First, RNAP II and other general transcription factors are recruited to the promoter to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC). RNAP II then initiates the synthesis of RNA and escapes from the promoter. After moving away from the promoter, RNAP II is able to begin productive elongation with the assistance of a number of elongation factors or complexes. Finally, when a gene is transcribed completely, transcription termination occurs, and the newly synthesized RNA is released from the elongation complex. Among these steps, recruitment of the RNAP II transcriptional machinery to the promoters has been considered to be the principal regulatory step for most genes.1,2 However, increasing evidence suggests that post-recruitment steps are also important for regulating gene expression.3,4One of these post-recruitment steps is promoter-proximal pausing. A classic example is that of RNAP II paused at the promoter region of the Hsp70 gene in uninduced cells, and can be released to synthesize full-length Hsp70 transcripts upon heat induction.5,6 Promoter-proximal pausing has also been detected in human genes, including c-Myc and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).7,8 Recent genome-wide mapping of the distributions of RNAP II in the genomes of human and Drosophila cells has revealed that RNAP II is concentrated not only at the promoter region of active genes but also at many quiescent genes, suggesting that promoter-proximal pausing is a prevalent regulatory step in metazoans.9-11Although it is not fully understood how paused RNAP II is controlled, some of the key factors have been studied. DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF) associate with the elongation complex and cause RNAP II to pause closely downstream of the transcription start site (TSS).12,13 The release of paused RNAP II depends on positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which phosphorylates DSIF, NELF, and the CTD of RNAP II.14,15 Evidence suggests that several transcription factors are involved in the recruitment of P-TEFb, such as c-Myc,16 NF-kappaB,17 and Brd4.18-20 Moreover, recent studies suggest that the Mediator complex also contributes to the release of paused RNAP II.21,22The Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit complex that functions as a molecular bridge linking regulatory signals from transcription factors to the RNAP II transcription apparatus by direct interactions with RNAP II, GTFs and diverse transcription factors.23,24 Through these direct interactions, Mediator is believed to play important roles at multiple stages of transcription, from pre-initiation to termination.25-27The Mediator MED23 subunit controls the transcriptional activation of Egr1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.28,29\nEgr1 is an early response gene encoding a zinc finger transcription factor that is important for cell growth, cell differentiation, and apoptosis.30 The serum-responsive transcription of Egr1 is regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and ELK1, which cooperatively bind to the serum response elements (SREs) in its upstream promoter region.30 MAPK-signaling-activated phosphorylation of ELK1 stimulates Egr1 transcription by recruiting the Mediator complex to the Egr1 promoter through an interaction with the MED23 subunit.28,29 Previously, we found that upon serum induction, Med23 knockout resulted in an approximately 3-fold reduction in the recruitment of preinitiation complexes to the Egr1 promoter. If the relationship between RNAP II recruitment and mRNA synthesis were linear, there would be an approximately 3-fold reduction of Egr1 transcriptional activation. However, the level of Egr1 transcription was actually attenuated approximately 13-fold in Med23\u2212/\u2212 (KO) cells compared with wild-type (WT) cells after serum addition. The observation that the presence of Med23 dramatically enhanced transcription but only modestly increased the recruitment of RNAP II and GTFs led to our proposal of the post-recruitment model: i.e., the Mediator complex stimulates RNAP II activity in addition to its function in recruiting RNAP II machinery. An important criticism of this model is that even a modest enhancement in PIC formation by the Mediator complex may account for a drastic increase in transcription given the possibility that the relationship between RNAP II occupancy and transcription is nonlinear. Therefore, the post-recruitment model needs to be re-examined, and the molecular mechanisms by which the Mediator complex functions in post-recruitment steps remain to be further elucidated.In this study, we observed that under the unstimulated condition, Egr1 basal transcription was reduced 5-fold in KO cells compared with WT cells. However, pre-bound RNAP II, GTFs, ELK1, and Mediator complex occupy the Egr1 promoter equally in both WT and KO ES cells. This result unequivocally demonstrates that PIC formation can be uncoupled from the level of transcription, strongly supporting the post-recruitment function of the Mediator complex in stimulating RNAP II activity. Furthermore, close examination revealed that the binding of the elongating RNAP II at the Egr1 coding region is 50% lower in KO cells than in WT cells, suggesting that the defects resulting from Med23-deficiency likely occur at the elongation stage. CDK9 was the only elongation regulator found to be reduced by 50% at the Egr1 locus, and further investigations revealed that Mediator MED23 interacts with CDK9 in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our results provide in-depth mechanistic insight for the post-recruitment model; specifically, MED23 interacts with P-TEFb to regulate elongation. ResultsMed23 modulates Egr1 basal transcription in vivo without changing RNAP II recruitmentWe previously showed that an approximately 3-fold increase in RNAP II binding generated an approximately 13-fold increase in Egr1 mRNA under serum stimulation.29 However, this modest increase in RNAP II binding leading to a dramatic increase in transcription was not easily explained because Med23-dependent recruitment and post-recruitment mechanisms were combined together to impact on transcription. To determine the mechanism by which Med23 controls Egr1, we treated WT and KO ES cells with serum for different times after 12-h of depletion of serum from the medium. The Egr1 mRNA level was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR), and a constitutively expressed translation elongation factor 2 (EF2) gene was used as an internal control. Consistent with our earlier work,29\nEgr1 mRNA level in WT cells increased rapidly after adding serum to the medium, reached a maximum at approximately 30 min, and decreased after 60 min. In KO cells, Egr1 transcriptional level was largely reduced during the course of serum induction (Fig.\u00a01A). Interestingly, before or several hours after serum induction, the \u201cbasal\u201d level of Egr1 expression seemed to be reduced several-fold in KO cells to a lower, \u201csub-basal\u201d level. Here, the term \u201cbasal\u201d refers to the basic gene expression in cells under an unstimulated physiological condition, including the steady-state and the serum starvation. In vitro \u201cbasal transcription\u201d refers to transcription from a minimal promoter without transcription factor binding sites, which does not exist in the in vivo environment. We then carefully examined mRNA levels of Egr1 gene in both steady-state and serum starvation. Again, we found that Egr1 mRNA level was 5-fold higher in WT than in KO ES cells under both conditions (Fig.\u00a01B). WT and KO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells showed similar results (data not shown). Therefore, the presence or absence of Med23 seems to correlate with a higher or lower basal level of Egr1 expression, respectively, in vivo.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01.Med23 modulates Egr1 basal transcription in vivo without changing RNAP II recruitment. (A) Time-course analysis of Egr1 expression after serum addition to serum-starved WT and KO ES cells. The expression was normalized to EF2 mRNAs, and the normalized value in serum-starved WT cells at time 0 was defined as 1. (B) Real-time PCR analysis of the Egr1 expression at steady-state and under serum starvation. The expression was normalized to EF2 mRNA expression, and the normalized value in WT cells at steady-state was defined as 1. In this and subsequent figures, results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 s.d. of n = 3 independent experiments. (C) Time-course ChIP analysis of RNAP II binding to the Egr1 promoter after serum addition. Values from real-time PCR were normalized to the percentage of input chromatin. (D) ChIP analysis of RNAP II binding to the Egr1 gene using primers for the indicated fragments. The scale is in base pairs.To test whether the binding of RNAP II to the Egr1 promoter correlates with transcription, we performed ChIP experiments using an antibody against total RNAP II followed by Q-RT-PCR. Correlated with the Egr1 expression level, serum addition rapidly increased RNAP II recruitment at the Egr1 promoter in WT cells, whereas the increase in RNAP II binding at the Egr1 promoter in KO cells was greatly attenuated. Surprisingly, the RNAP II occupancy was equal between WT and KO cells before serum stimulation (Fig.\u00a01C) even though the transcription level between the two types of cells exhibited a 5-fold difference (Fig.\u00a01A, \u200b,1B).1B). To map the sites of RNAP II and other binding factors more accurately, we scanned the Egr1 promoter region with 5 sets of primers that amplified fragments centered at -836 (amplicon A), -598 (amplicon B), -62 (amplicon C), +366bp (amplicon D), and +674 (amplicon E) relative to the Egr1 transcription start site (TSS). As shown in Figure\u00a01D, RNAP II is primarily enriched at the TSS (amplicon C), and, as shown in Figure\u00a01C, RNAP II occupancy at the Egr1 promoter was not significantly different between WT and KO cells under the unstimulated condition. Thus, we observed that the equal RNAP II binding at the Egr1 promoter in WT and KO cells gave rise to 5-fold different levels of transcription.Med23 deficiency does not alter the occupancies of GTFs at the Egr1 promoterTo understand the discrepancy between RNAP II binding and mRNA levels, we investigated a series of events that occur at different stages of transcription. First, we examined whether PIC assembly at the Egr1 promoter differs between WT and KO cells. Using ChIP assays, we examined different GTFs binding at the Egr1 promoter under the unstimulated condition. Most of the ChIP signals from GTFs could be detected and peaked near the TSS (amplicon C; Figure\u00a02A-E). Similar to the RNAP II binding, the binding levels of TFIID (indicated by TBP), TFIIA, and TFIIB at the Egr1 promoter in WT cells were equal to those in KO cells (Fig.\u00a02A-C). However, there was no detectable peak for TFIIE and TFIIH binding at the Egr1 promoter in either WT or KO cells (Fig.\u00a02D-E), which may indicate that the binding is below the level of detection or that the binding does not occur under the unstimulated condition. It is unlikely that the antibodies against TFIIE and TFIIH are not appropriate for ChIP, because both factors could be detected after serum addition, and the binding signals peaked at region C after serum addition (Fig.\u00a02D-E). To explore whether TFIIE/TFIIH is required for basal transcription in mouse ES cells, we knocked down TFIIE or TFIIH in the WT and KO mES cells using retroviral RNAi (Fig.\u00a02F-H). We found that Egr1 mRNA level was largely reduced in both the siTFIIE and siTFIIH WT cells, which demonstrates that TFIIE and TFIIH are required for basal Egr1 transcription, though they are undetectable under the unstimulated condition (Fig.\u00a02F-H). This observation is also consistent with early findings that TFIIE and TFIIH play important roles in promoter clearance and elongation.31,32 However, in the KO cells, when TFIIH or TFIIE was knocked down, Egr1 mRNA level did not go down much further under the basal condition (data not shown), suggesting that Med23 may be also required for the minimal amount of TFIIE/TFIIH to be functional. Based on these results, we conclude that although there was an approximately 5-fold difference in the unstimulated transcription of the Egr1 gene between WT and KO cells, examination of the GTFs binding at the Egr1 promoter revealed no significant difference.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02.Med23 deficiency does not alter the occupancies of GTFs at the Egr1 promoter under an unstimulated condition. ChIP experiments were performed using antibodies against TBP (A), TFIIA (B), TFIIB (C), TFIIE (D), and TFIIH (E). The precipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR with primers described in Figure\u00a01D. WT+S/KO+S: 30 min after serum addition. (E) and (F), Egr1 mRNA levels in siCtrl and siTFIIEa/siCdk7 cells. The expression was normalized to EF2 mRNA expression, and the normalized value in siCtrl WT cells was defined as 1.ELK1 and Mediator occupancies at the Egr1 promoter are not affected by the presence or absence of Med23Comparable numbers of PICs at the Egr1 promoter between WT and KO cells were able to produce different levels of mRNA under an unstimulated condition. To better understand this paradox, we investigated whether Med23 depletion affected the binding and the activity of transcription factor ELK1 to the Egr1 promoter. To address this question, we performed ChIP experiments using antibodies against ELK1 or its phosphorylation. Unlike RNAP II and GTFs, which mainly bound to region C at the Egr1 promoter, ELK1 bound most often to region B, spanning the four clustered SREs in the Egr1 promoter (Fig.\u00a03A-B). Deletion of Med23 did not affect the level of ELK1 binding at region B of the Egr1 promoter between WT and KO cells (Fig.\u00a03A). Likewise, we did not observe any difference in phospho-ELK1 binding (Fig.\u00a03B). Mediator complex recruitment was Med23-dependent at the Egr1 promoter after serum induction.29 To determine whether the Mediator complex is also Med23-dependent under the unstimulated condition, we performed ChIP assays using two antibodies against Mediator subunits MED1 and MED17. Surprisingly, the Mediator complex also bound equally to the Egr1 promoter in WT cells as in KO cells (Fig.\u00a03C).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03. ELK1 and Mediator occupancies at the Egr1 promoter are not affected by the presence or absence of Med23. ChIP experiments were performed using antibodies against ELK1 (A), p-ELK1 (B), the Mediator Complex (Med1 and Med17) (C), and CDK8 (D). (E) KO MEF cells were infected with retroviruses encoding hMED23 and subsequently selected for hygromycin resistance. Western blotting was used to detect the protein levels of MED23 in WT, KO, and KO+Med23 cells. The anti-TBP blot was included as an internal control. (F) Real-time PCR analysis of the Egr1 expression in states of serum starvation and serum induction (30 min). The expression was normalized to EF2 mRNA expression, and the normalized value in serum-starved WT cells was defined as 1.Distinct forms of the Mediator complex can be characterized by the presence or absence of the CDK8 kinase module.33-35 CDK8 has been thought to be a transcriptional repressor.36 We previously observed that CDK8 associated with the activated Egr1 promoter,29 which was supported by a recent finding that CDK8 indeed acted as a positive regulator for gene activity.21 Because CDK8 can be either negative or positive for transcription, we investigated whether the binding of CDK8 at the Egr1 promoter may account for the different levels of Egr1 basal transcription between WT and KO cells. Again, we found that there was no difference in CDK8 occupancy between the two cell types (Fig.\u00a03D). These results indicate that under the unstimulated condition, activator ELK1, its phosphorylated form, and Mediator complex (including CDK8) at the Egr1 promoter, are Med23 independent. Thus, the recruitment of RNAP II, GTFs, ELK1, and the Mediator complex, including CDK8, may not be the reason for the reduced Egr1 expression in KO cells.Because all of these factors exhibited similar binding at the Egr1 promoter, we investigate whether Med23 was relevant to the difference in Egr1 basal transcription. To verify the effects of Med23 on Egr1 basal transcription, the human Med23 gene was reintroduced into KO MEF cells. A stable cell line was selected with hygromycin, and western blot confirmed the re-expression of Med23 in KO cells (Fig.\u00a03E). Indeed, ectopic expression of Med23 rescued Egr1 transcription under both unstimulated and stimulated conditions (Fig.\u00a03F), reinforcing the idea that the presence or absence of MED23 dictates the basal and sub-basal level of Egr1 expression in WT and KO cells, respectively.The interaction between ELK1 and MED23 is necessary for maintaining Egr1 basal transcriptionMAPK-phosphorylated ELK1 interacts with MED23 to recruit RNAP II and GTFs for Egr1 activation.28,29 To determine whether phosphorylation of ELK1 is necessary for the basal level of Egr1 transcription, we used an inhibitor of MEK1/2, U0126, to inhibit the phosphorylation of ELK1. After the addition of U0126 to WT cells, the basal level of Egr1 transcription was reduced to a level that was equivalent to the sub-basal level in KO cells (Fig.\u00a04A). Importantly, the sub-basal level of Egr1 transcription did not decrease further when U0126 was added to KO cells (Fig.\u00a04A) because Med23 deletion had already disrupted the transmission of MAPK signaling to the Egr1 gene transcription. This observation also suggests that MAPK signaling and Med23 are both required and in the same genetic pathway for maintaining the basal level of Egr1 transcription. Surprisingly, we found no obvious difference in RNAP II recruitment to the Egr1 promoter between WT and KO cells with or without U0126 addition (Fig.\u00a04B). These results suggest that the disruption of the MAPK-ELK1-MED23 axis does not affect RNAP II recruitment; instead, it may affect other events downstream of PIC formation to control the basal level of Egr1 transcription.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04. The interaction between ELK1 and Med23 is necessary for maintaining Egr1 basal transcription. (A) The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was added to the culture medium for 30 min, and total RNA samples were harvested and analyzed by real-time PCR. (B) WT and KO ES cells were treated or not treated by U0126 for 30 min. ChIP assays were performed using RNAP II antibody. (C) The structures of Gal4-Elk1 and Gal4-AA (S383,389A) are schematically depicted. The sequences are shown below. D: D-box domain; C: C-box domain. (D) 293T cells were transfected with a 5 \u00d7 Gal-E1B-TATA-luciferase reporter construct and a plasmid encoding the Gal4-Elk1 activation domain or Gal4-Elk1 mutant, with a MEKK expression plasmid. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.To further characterize the interface between MED23 and ELK1 that controls Egr1 basal transcription, two phosphorylated sites (S383,389) within the ELK1 activation domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain were mutated to alanine (Fig.\u00a04C). Phosphorylation of the serine 383/389 of the ELK1 activation domain was shown to be required for binding to MED23 and for transcription activation.29,37 We compared the transcriptional activities of wild-type GAL4-ELK1 and GAL4-ELK1(S383,389A) (GAL4-AA) in a transient transfection luciferase assay. Under unstimulated steady-state, the transcriptional activity of GAL4-AA was approximately 12-fold lower than that of GAL4-ELK1 in WT MEF cells (Fig.\u00a04D). However, in KO MEF cells, the transcriptional activities of GAL4-ELK1 and GAL4-AA were comparably low (Fig.\u00a04D), indicating that the activity of ELK1 is dependent on MED23 for sensing its signaling or phosphorylation. Collectively, these data suggest that ELK1 activation and its interaction with MED23 are prerequisites for maintaining basal Egr1 transcription.MED23 is required for RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and RNAP II elongation but not for RNAP II recruitmentAlthough RNAP II bound equally to the Egr1 promoter, its binding at the Egr1 coding region was lower in KO cells (Fig.\u00a05A), which correlated with the lower transcription level of Egr1. RNAP II CTD plays multiple critical roles in controlling transcription initiation and elongation via its different phosphorylation patterns. For example, Ser5 phosphorylation accompanies the transition from pre-initiation to elongation and helps recruit the 5\u2032 capping enzymes.38 Ser2 phosphorylation is implicated in facilitating the transition of initiating RNAP II into a productive elongating form in addition to 3\u2032 cleavage and polyadenylation.14,39,40 Ser5 phosphorylation peaks near the 5\u2032 end of genes, and Ser2 phosphorylation increases toward the 3\u2032 end of genes.41,42 To further analyze the events downstream of PIC formation that are affected by Med23 status, we monitored CTD phosphorylation throughout the Egr1 gene in WT and KO cells under the unstimulated condition. With ChIP assays, we found that depletion of Med23 clearly reduced the level of Ser5 phosphorylation (Ser5P) at the Egr1 gene, especially at the transcription initiation region (Fig.\u00a05B). Similarly, Med23 knockout strongly reduces the level of Ser2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) throughout the Egr1 coding region (Fig.\u00a05C), which explains the lower transcriptional level in KO cells.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05. MED23 is required for RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and RNAP II elongation but not RNAP II recruitment. ChIP experiments were performed using antibodies against total RNAP II (A), phosphor-Ser5 CTD (Ser5P) (B), and phospho-Ser2 (Ser2P) (C) at the Egr1 locus using primers as indicated below.MED23 is partially required for the recruitment of CDK9 to the Egr1 promoterGiven the effects of Med23 knockout on RNAP II CTD phosphorylation, we next analyzed the CTD kinases CDK7 and CDK9 under the unstimulated condition in addition to other factors regulating RNAP II pausing and elongation, such as DSIF and NELF. Although Ser5-P at the Egr1 promoter was reduced in KO cells compared with WT cells, we failed to detect any enriched signal of CDK7 binding at the Egr1 promoter under the unstimulated condition (Fig.\u00a02E). By examining the occupancies of DSIF and NELF with antibodies against Spt5 and NELF-E, we observed that the binding of DSIF and NELF to the Egr1 promoter was not affected by MED23 depletion under the unstimulated condition (Fig.\u00a06A, \u200b,6B).6B). In contrast, the binding of CDK9 to the Egr1 promoter decreased by roughly 50% in KO cells, which is consistent with reduced Ser2 phosphorylation of CTD at the Egr1 coding region, suggesting that Med23 may help recruit CDK9 to the Egr1 promoter (Fig.\u00a06C). These results suggest that MED23 may target CDK9 recruitment and CTD phosphorylation to impact Egr1 basal transcription.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06. MED23 is partially required for the recruitment of CDK9 to the Egr1 promoter. ChIP experiments were performed using antibodies against NELF-E (A), Spt5 (B), and CDK9 (C) at the Egr1 locus, as described in Figure\u00a01. (D) Egr1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR in WT and KO ES cells with or without 1 h of flavopiridol (250 nM) pre-treatment. The expression was normalized to the EF2 mRNA expression.

(G) ChIP analysis using an antibody against CDK9 at the Egr1 locus in control- and CDK9-overexpressed WT and KO ES cells. The mean of at least three separate experiments is shown, and the standard deviation is indicated. Student\u2019s t test, **p < 0.001.To further verify whether the effects of MED23 depletion on RNAP II activity at post-recruitment steps are the result of decreased P-TEFb binding, we treated cells with the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol. RNA samples were collected from 90% confluent WT and KO ES cells after 1 h treatment with flavopiridol (250 nM) and analyzed by Q-RT-PCR. The expression of Egr1 was inhibited in WT cells (Fig.\u00a06D). However, the sub-basal level of Egr1 expression in KO cells was reduced to an even lower level, which may have been a response to the inhibition of the 50% remaining CDK9 at the Egr1 promoter (Fig.\u00a06D).Having observed that CDK9 is an effector for Med23-controlled basal Egr1 expression, we overexpressed CDK9 to a similar level in both WT and KO cells using retroviral transduction, and stable cells were selected with puromycin (Fig.\u00a06E). The expression of Egr1 increased in both WT and KO cells when CDK9 was overexpressed. However, CDK9 overexpression could not overcome the effects of loss of MED23, as the fold difference in Egr1 expression remained the same between WT and KO cells (Fig.\u00a06F). ChIP experiments revealed that CDK9 overexpression also increased the occupancy of CDK9 at the Egr1 promoter of both WT and KO cells (Fig.\u00a06G), which correlated with the increase in Egr1 expression. Importantly, CDK9 occupancy at the Egr1 promoter in KO cells was still significantly lower than that in WT cells (Fig.\u00a06G), even when CDK9 was equally overexpressed in both WT and KO cells (Fig.\u00a06E). These results suggest that Med23 is, at least in part, critical for CDK9 recruitment, and the decreased P-TEFb activity at the Egr1 gene upon Med23 depletion may explain the post-recruitment defects in KO cells.Mediator associates with CDK9 via the MED23 subunit in vivo and in vitroSo far, our data suggest that Med23 is important for elongating RNAP II, CTD phosphorylation, and CDK9 recruitment at the Egr1 locus. These observations are consistent with a recent study indicating that the Mediator complex plays a role in RNAP II elongation via an interaction with P-TEFb by the CDK8 submodule in an in vitro co-IP experiment.21 However, it is not clear which subunit of this submodule or whether other submodule/subunits directly interact with P-TEFb. Because the presence or absence of Med23 impacts P-TEFb recruitment, we tested whether MED23 could associate with CDK9 directly. First, we expressed and purified a double-tag soluble His-FLAG-MED23 protein, which was historically difficult to purify as a solubilized form, from baculovirus-infected insect cells.25,37 Utilizing this soluble recombinant protein, we identified MED23-interacting proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts by sequential affinity purification (using Ni-NTA beads and then anti-FLAG M2 beads, respectively; Figure\u00a07A). The proteins eluted from the anti-FLAG M2 beads were visualized by silver staining (Fig.\u00a07B), followed by shotgun mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that CDK9 was among the MED23-associating proteins. Western blot confirmed that CDK9 and its partner Cyclin T1 were among the eluted proteins associated with MED23, but not with another subunit of Mediator MED29 (Fig.\u00a07C). Consistent with the previous study,21 we also found that CDK9 may also associate with the CDK8 subunit, though whether this association is direct or indirect was not determined.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07.

(B) Baculovirus-expressed His-Flag-MED23 (M23), His-Flag-CDK8 (CDK8) and His-Flag-MED29 (M29) were purified by Ni-NTA beads and then FLAG M2 beads sequentially, as described in (A). The proteins eluted from FLAG M2 beads were analyzed by SDS- PAGE followed by silver staining. (C) The proteins eluted from FLAG M2 beads were analyzed by SDS- PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against CDK9 and Cyclin T1. (D) Soluble His-Flag-MED23 was incubated at 4 degree overnight with immobilized GST or GST-CDK9. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (E) Flag-Med23 plasmid was co-transfected with HA-cdk9 or its mutant HA-cdk9 (T186A) into 293T cells. Whole-cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG M2 beads, followed by immunoblotting using antibodies against Tubulin, FLAG or HA. (F) Nuclear extracts prepared from wild type (WT) or Med23\u2212/\u2212 (KO) mouse embryonic stem cells were subjected to co-IP with MED1 and MED17 antibodies under various stringent wash conditions as indicated. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with indicated antibodies by immunoblotting. (G) ChIP-seq analysis of CDK9 enrichment on the set of genes whose expression level are regulated by MED23, in WT (black) and KO (gray) ES cells. All these genes were normalized to 3 kb for Mata-gene, with 1 kb extended upstream from TSS, and 1 kb downstream from TTS for analyzing average profile in 50 bp bins. (H) Quantitation of CDK9 binding intensity on promoter region (1 kb upstream from TSS) and gene body region (from TSS to TTS). Both are normalized to the values derived from the WT ES cells.To further verify the interaction between MED23 and CDK9, we went on to perform GST pull down, co-transfection and endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments. GST and GST-CDK9 were purified from baculovirus infected insect cells and immobilized on glutathione agarose to test their interaction with MED23. As shown in Figure\u00a07D, MED23 was capable of binding to GST-CDK9 (lane 2) but not to GST (lane 1). We further performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment by co-transfecting tagged Med23 and Cdk9 or its mutant T186A-Cdk9 into 293T cells. Immunoprecipitated of FLAG-MED23 from transfected 293T nuclear extracts revealed that CDK9-HA but little T186A-CDK9-HA could bind to MED23 (Fig.\u00a07E). This indicates that T186 of CDK9 may be important for the interaction between MED23 and CDK9. As T186 of CDK9 is important for its binding to 7SK snRNP and its enzymatic activity,43 we are not certain whether the enzymatic activity of CDK9 is required for its ability in binding to Mediator. Finally, we performed a co-IP experiment to detect the interaction between endogenous proteins. Extracts prepared from WT or KO ES cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-MED1 and anti-MED17 antibodies, followed by western blotting. The protein levels of several Mediator subunits, MED1, MED26, CDK8, and MED6, were not altered in input and IP samples from KO ES cells compared with WT ES cells, suggesting that Med23 depletion does not affect most of Mediator integrity. Importantly, endogenous CDK9 and Cyclin T1 were pulled down together with Mediator complex from WT cell extracts, but not from KO cell extracts under various stringent wash conditions (Fig.\u00a07F). Earlier studies found Brd4 associates with Mediator complex,18-21 we found that Brd4 was co-immunoprecipitated with the Mediator complex in WT cell extracts but not in KO cell extracts, suggesting that, similar to CDK9/Cyclin T1, the association of Brd4 with Mediator is also Med23-dependent. Taken together, these data suggest that the Mediator complex may directly interact with P-TEFb via its MED23 subunit to regulate transcriptional elongation, specifically for a basal level of Egr1 expression.To further address the question of whether MED23 affects the recruitment of CDK9 in a genomic scale, we performed a ChIP-seq experiment to compare the CDK9 binding profile in WT and KO ES cells. We first performed a microarray analysis between WT and KO cells under the unstimulated condition and identified 548 genes whose basal level of transcription is reduced at least 1.5-fold in KO cells. ChIP-seq revealed that CDK9 are enriched near the transcription start site (TSS) regions of these genes in WT cells, whereas Med23 depletion largely reduced CDK9 occupancy at the promoter region. CDK9 binding intensity in the gene body was also slightly reduced (Figs.\u00a07G and \u200band7H).7H). Therefore, MED23 affects the basal transcription of a subset of genes by regulating CDK9 occupancy at the promoter region. DiscussionOur previous work suggested that Mediator Med23 regulates RNAP II activity at both recruitment and post-recruitment steps upon serum stimulation,29 but the mechanism by which Med23 regulates transcription at a post-recruitment step remains elusive. In the present report, we took a more effective and clearer approach to characterize the function of the Mediator complex in post-recruitment steps. We found that, under the unstimulated condition, Egr1 mRNA level was largely reduced in KO ES cells. Nevertheless, the amount of basal transcription machinery was not dependent on the recruitment function of Mediator, because the occupancy of RNAP II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIE, and TFIIH at the Egr1 promoter showed no significant difference between WT and KO cells. Moreover, we did not detect any differences in the occupancy of Mediator complex, activator ELK1 or ELK1 phosphorylation. These data clearly indicate that the amount of pre-poised PIC could be uncoupled from the amount of transcribed mRNA, which highlights the post-recruitment function of Mediator complex. These results further suggest that Med23 depletion may affect transcription beyond PIC formation. In fact, we observed a significant decrease in RNAP II and Ser2P occupancy at the coding region and an approximately 50% reduction in CDK9 binding at the Egr1 promoter in KO cells, which may account for the defects in Egr1 transcription. Consistent with these observations, we have demonstrated that MED23 can directly interact with elongation factor CDK9 in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for how MED23 regulates transcription elongation.The Mediator complex is crucial for basal transcription in vitro23 but, in vivo, evidence has been absent. Here, we provide evidence that in vivo Egr1 basal transcription is dependent on Med23. When Med23 is absent, transcription of Egr1 is reduced to a sub-basal level. The human Mediator complex may enhance basal transcription by facilitating recruitment of TFIIB during PIC assembly.44 However, in the present study, we did not observe any defects in the recruitment of TFIIB, TFIIE or TFIIH in KO cells, which may reflect a discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, we found that depletion of Med23 affected the elongation stage of transcription.The Mediator complex has been suggested to play key roles at multiple stages of eukaryotic transcription,23,24,45 including the elongation stage. Using Med23\u2212/\u2212 cells, we discovered that the Mediator complex regulates Egr1 transcription at both recruitment and post-recruitment steps under serum induction.29 The Mediator CDK8 kinase module has also been implicated in recruiting P-TEFb to facilitate transcriptional activation of serum response genes21 and the thyroid hormone receptor target gene DioI.46 Consistent with the findings of the Espinosa\u2019s lab,21 we also found that CDK9 associates with His-FLAG-CDK8 (Fig.\u00a07A). Another subunit, MED26, has been shown to function as a docking site for super-elongation complexes containing ELL/EAF and P-TEFb and, therefore, to regulate a small set of MED26-controlled gene elongation.22 Now, we show that Mediator subunit MED23 recruits P-TEFb to promote the transition of RNAP II into the elongation stage by directly interacting with CDK9. These results are not necessarily conflicting with each other as Mediator may make multiple contacts with any given factor including RNAP II and P-TEFb, and multiple mechanisms could be utilized in regulating transcription elongation. Considering the multiple components and the huge size of the Mediator complex, it is conceivable that the Mediator complex could be involved in diverse protein interactions at the distinct stages of the transcriptional process.Promoter-proximal pausing is a general feature of transcription by RNAP II in metazoan cells.9-11,16 DSIF and NELF function together to cause pausing.47 Release of the paused RNAP II is mediated by P-TEFb, which overcomes the negative effects of NELF and DSIF.14 Multiple mechanisms are involved in regulation of P-TEFb. In mammals, P-TEFb is negatively regulated by 7SK RNA and HEXIM1, which form a complex to inhibit P-TEFb kinase activity.43,48,49 In contrast, 7SK/HEXIM1-bound P-TEFb is converted into an active form through its association with bromodomain protein Brd4.18,19 In addition to Brd4, other activators are responsible for recruiting P-TEFb to target genes, such as DNA-bound activator NF-kappaB,17 c-Myc,16,50,51 and RNA-bound activator HIV Tat.52 Recently, P-TEFb has been shown to associate with Mediator complex via CDK8 sub-module21 or MED26.22 However, these studies failed to demonstrate which subunit of the Mediator complex interacts with P-TEFb directly or via other co-factors indirectly. We performed both in vitro and in vivo experiments in this study to demonstrate the interaction between the Mediator complex and P-TEFb and revealed a physical interaction between MED23 and CDK9.Importantly, we also noticed that the MED23-CDK9 interaction may not be solely responsible for P-TEFb recruitment or its function in elongation, because deletion of Med23 resulted in only a 50% reduction in CDK9 binding at the Egr1 promoter and modestly decreased Egr1 transcription to the sub-basal level. Consistent with the idea that CDK9 could have a Med23-independent function, inhibition of CDK9 by flavopiridol in KO cells can further reduce Egr1 transcription to a much lower level than sub-basal transcription, presumably because flavopiridol directly inhibits the kinase activity of P-TEFb. Therefore, there may be other Med23-independent mechanisms by which the Mediator complex recruits P-TEFb via other subunits or factors, such as MED26, CDK8, and Brd4. Collectively, the Mediator complex may utilize multiple mechanisms to regulate P-TEFb for paused RNAP II release.

Peak calling was performed using MACS,53 with the following settings: bw = 300, tsize = 75, and p-value threshold of 10\u20135. To perform the average gene profile, BED and WIG files from MACS output were used in CEAS.54 ChIP-seq analysis was conducted based on the mouse genome built on July 2007 (NCBI37/mm9).For genome-wide gene expression analysis, microarray was performed using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array. Six arrays were probed with cDNA prepared from total RNAs isolated from WT and KO ES cells under the normal growth condition without stimulation.Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)WT and KO ES cells grew to 95\u2013100% confluence, were harvested and washed by cold PBS, and then lysed in 1 mL lysis buffer (1 \u00d7 PBS, 0.1% NP-40 (v/v), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, and freshly added proteinase inhibitor from Roche). After a brief sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was added with antibodies (2 \u03bcg each), and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. 40 \u03bcl Protein G beads were added, and after 2 h incubation, the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and then boiled in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by western blot with the indicated antibodies.Production of soluble recombinant H-F-MED23, H-F-MED29, and H-F-CDK8 and tandem affinity purificationDNA sequences encoding Med23, Med29 and Cdk8 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pFASTBac-HTc, and the Flag sequence was added to the N terminus to generate the N-terminal 6xHis-Flag-tagged fusion. The baculovirus expressing His-Flag-MED23, as well as His-Flag-MED29 and His-Flag-CDK8, was generated using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) as described.37For tandem affinity purification, 1 ml undialyzed HeLa nuclear extract (4 mg/ml) prepared using standard procedures33 was diluted with an equal volume of 300 mM KCl D buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 300 mM KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.1% NP-40 and incubated with the Ni-MED23, Ni-MED29 or Ni-CDK8 column (200 \u03bcl beads each) in low flow speed for five times at 4\u00b0C. The columns were washed twice with 1ml 300 mM KCl D buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 300 mM KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.1% NP-40 and twice with 1 ml 500 mM KCl D buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 500 mM KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.1% NP-40. Then the resins were washed in 1 ml of 20 mM imidazole washing buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and eluted with 3 ml of 250 mM imidazole elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300mM NaCl, 250mM imidazole) as E1 fraction. E1 fraction plus protease inhibitor (Roche) was then incubated with 100 \u03bcl Anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The resins were washed with TBS three times and eluted with with 3 \u00d7 Flag peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, 150 ng/\u03bcl final concentration) in 100 \u03bcl TBS with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The eluted proteins were boiled in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.Production of GST fusion proteins and GST pull downDNA sequence encoding cdk9 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T-1. E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with plasmids encoding the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein or GST alone, grown at 30\u00b0C until the optical density at 600 nm reached a value of 0.6 to 0.8, and induced with 100 \u03bcM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactosidase for 2 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, lysed by sonication, and mixed with TritonX-100 (1% final concentration). After the cell debris was removed by centrifugation, GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were collected and rinsed in PBS. The fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against PBS.GST and GST-CDK9 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads, blocked with PBS containing 0.1% NP-40 (v/v), 5 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitor plus 5% non-fat milk, and incubated with the same amount H-F-MED23 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C.
