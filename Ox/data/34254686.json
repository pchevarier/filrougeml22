These changes involve quantitative alterations of messenger RNA (mRNA) or non\u2010coding RNA (ncRNA) expression, but also qualitative changes through differential RNA processing, such as alternative splicing. The correct regulation of genome expression is essential at all steps of an organism\u2019s life. Among all the processes involved in genome expression control, transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) II is the first step and one of the most regulated. It has been extensively studied since it controls the production of all mRNAs in eukaryotic cells.Transcription begins at the so\u2010called \u201cTranscription Start Site\u201d (TSS) immediately downstream of the promoter that contains specific DNA sequences providing stable binding sites for the RNA polymerase and transcription factors. RNA Pol II reaches the polyadenylation (poly(A)) site after transcribing through the whole transcription unit, which can span hundreds of kilobases. When transcribing a protein\u2010coding gene, RNA Pol II produces a pre\u2010mRNA that needs to undergo a maturation process before giving rise to a functional mRNA. This process involves capping of the 5\u2032 end, removal of introns by splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end. All these steps stabilize mRNA and play important roles for its nuclear export and translation. In addition, these different pre\u2010mRNA processing steps are functionally coupled to transcription. Indeed, all these steps are initiated co\u2010transcriptionally, thereby allowing the connection of transcription with mRNA maturation in time and space (Bentley, 2014). Tight regulation of these various processing events allows cells to increase the diversity of the transcriptome, through alternative TSS selection, alternative splicing, back\u2010splicing, or alternative polyadenylation.The various steps of transcriptionRNA Pol II is a multiprotein complex composed of 12 subunits. RNA Pol II on its own cannot initiate transcription or transcribe long DNA sequences, but rather requires many additional protein complexes to perform these tasks. For example, topoisomerases which create transient DNA breaks to relieve DNA supercoiling play multiple roles during the transcription cycle (Pommier et\u00a0al, 2016; Chen et\u00a0al, 2018), including reduction of torsional stress to promote efficient transcription elongation (Baranello et\u00a0al, 2016). Overall, transcription can be divided into four main steps: initiation, promoter\u2010proximal pausing, elongation, and termination (Fig\u00a01) (for excellent reviews on these different steps, see (Porrua & Libri, 2015; Proudfoot, 2016; Core & Adelman, 2019; Schier & Taatjes, 2020)). The transitions between these steps often involve post\u2010translational modifications of RNA Pol II or associated factors.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Main regulated steps of the RNA Pol II transcription cycleThe RNA Pol II transcription cycle can be divided into four main regulated steps. First, transcription initiation starts with recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoter and assembly of the pre\u2010initiation complex (PIC) which is composed of many factors including, but not restricted to, the general transcription factors TFIIA (IIA), TFIIB (IIB), TFIID (IID), TFIIE (IIE), TFIIF (IIF), TFIIH (IIH), RNA Pol II, and Mediator. The PIC opens the DNA and RNA Pol II starts transcription. Shortly after transcription initiation, RNA Pol II enters a paused state known as promoter\u2010proximal pausing. Promoter\u2010proximal pausing involves a conformational change in the RNA:DNA hybrid in the polymerase active site that prevents the addition of incoming NTPs by canonical base pairing. In many metazoans, the negative elongation factors NELF (Negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB\u2010sensitivity inducing factor) stabilize and extend the lifetime of the paused complex. After its release from promoter\u2010proximal pausing, RNA Pol II enters into productive elongation. During productive transcription elongation, many factors travel with RNA Pol II and help coordinate pre\u2010mRNA processing with transcription. These factors include elongation factors (EF, represented by an orange oval) and splicing factors (SF, represented by a green oval). The term transcription elongation includes at least two regulated processes: RNA Pol II processivity, i.e., the ability of RNA Pol II to travel the entire length of the gene and transcription speed, defined as the number of nucleotides synthesized per unit of time. Finally, transcription termination involves poly(A) site recognition by the cleavage and polyadenylation complex which cleaves the nascent pre\u2010mRNA that is then polyadenylated (An). Transcription of the poly(A) site induces an elongation slow\u2010down which promotes transcription termination upon catch\u2010up of RNA Pol II by the exonuclease Xrn2, which degrades the RNA synthesized beyond the poly(A) site from its 3\u2032 end.The first step of RNA Pol II transcription consists of the assembly of the pre\u2010initiation complex (PIC) on the promoter. PIC assembly often involves the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and chromatin remodeling complexes that open chromatin to allow accessibility to promoters. The PIC is composed of many factors, including, but not restricted to, the general transcription factors TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, RNA Pol II, and Mediator (Schier & Taatjes, 2020). Once assembled on the promoter, the PIC opens the DNA double strand allowing transcription initiation (Dienemann et\u00a0al, 2019). RNA Pol II thus starts transcribing and a short nascent RNA is produced.Shortly after transcription initiation, RNA Pol II enters a paused state known as promoter\u2010proximal pausing. In mammals and many other metazoans, promoter\u2010proximal pausing occurs 25\u201350 base pairs downstream from the TSS and is a major rate\u2010limiting step of the transcription cycle (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Mayer et\u00a0al, 2015). It involves a conformational change in the RNA:DNA hybrid within the polymerase active site. This conformational change leads to the absence of a free DNA template base in the active site, which is required for the addition of incoming NTPs by canonical base pairing. As a consequence, the progression of RNA Pol II is prevented (Vos et\u00a0al, 2018b). The negative elongation factors NELF (Negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB\u2010sensitivity inducing factor) stabilize and extend the lifetime of the paused complex. RNA Pol II is released from this pausing and allowed to resume transcription by the Cdk9 kinase component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb) complex, which phosphorylates the Spt5 subunit of DSIF, NELF, and serines 2, 5, and 7 (Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7) of the RNA Pol II carboxy terminal domain (CTD) (Czudnochowski et\u00a0al, 2012; Eick & Geyer, 2013; Core & Adelman, 2019). P\u2010TEFb is recruited to promoters through interactions with transcription factors, Mediator, and coactivators (Li et\u00a0al, 2018). The P\u2010TEFb\u2010mediated phosphorylation events lead to both the dissociation of NELF from the RNA Pol II and the switch of Spt5 from a repressor to an activator of transcription (Ivanov et\u00a0al, 2000; Yamada et\u00a0al, 2006). Spt5 remains associated with RNA Pol II and serves as a recruitment platform for additional factors involved in RNA Pol II elongation and RNA processing.Although RNA Pol II promoter\u2010proximal pausing also occurs in nematodes, fission yeast, and plants, NELF is absent in these species, suggesting that alternative modes of RNA Pol II promoter\u2010proximal pausing exist. Indeed, pausing at the +1 nucleosome, which does not involve DSIF or NELF, has been identified fission yeast (Booth et\u00a0al, 2016) and plants (Kindgren et\u00a0al, 2020) but also in mammals (Chiu et\u00a0al, 2018). The mechanisms of this +1 nucleosome pausing are not yet fully understood, but regulation by the MYC transcription factor and sensitivity to flavopiridol (an inhibitor of Cdk9 and Cdk12) have been reported (Chiu et\u00a0al, 2018). In nematodes, although promoter\u2010proximal pausing has been identified at stress response genes during starvation, its mechanism remains largely unknown (Kruesi et\u00a0al, 2013; Maxwell et\u00a0al, 2014). In contrast to these alternative mechanisms to pause RNA Pol II in promoter\u2010proximal regions in nematode, fission yeast, and plants, RNA Pol II promoter\u2010proximal pausing has, to date, not been reported in budding yeast (Booth et\u00a0al, 2016).After its release from this pause, RNA Pol II enters productive transcription elongation. The term transcription elongation refers to at least two regulated aspects of the transcript elongation process: RNA Pol II processivity and speed. RNA Pol II processivity is the ability of RNA Pol II to travel the entire length of the gene and thus controls the production of full\u2010length transcripts. Premature transcription termination reduces RNA Pol II processivity and can lead to the production of transcripts that depending on the context are either rapidly degraded or stabilized. Stabilized prematurely terminated transcripts can give rise to non\u2010coding RNAs or to proteins with different properties compared to those synthesized from full\u2010length transcripts (Kamieniarz\u2010Gdula & Proudfoot, 2019). The other transcription elongation parameter, transcription speed (or velocity), also referred to as the elongation rate, is defined as the number of nucleotides synthesized per unit of time and is the topic of this review. Note, however, that the term elongation rate is also sometimes used to describe other steps of the transcription cycle, such as RNA Pol II release from promoter\u2010proximal pausing or RNA Pol II processivity.Finally, when RNA Pol II reaches the end of a gene, it terminates transcription. At the end of almost all protein\u2010coding genes (except replication\u2010dependent histone genes), the termination process involves poly(A) site recognition. The poly(A) site is recognized by the cleavage and polyadenylation complex composed of multi\u2010subunit factors including the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), the cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), and the cleavage factors (CF) I and II. Upon recognition of the poly(A) site by the CPSF30 and WDR33 components of CPSF, the nascent pre\u2010mRNA is cleaved by the CPSF73 endonuclease. The cleaved 3\u2032 end of the pre\u2010mRNA is then polyadenylated, while the unprotected 5\u2032 end of the nascent RNA provides an entry site for the Xrn2 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease, which co\u2010transcriptionally degrades the RNA synthesized beyond the poly(A) site (Eaton & West, 2020). In addition, transcription of the poly(A) site induces allosteric changes in the elongation complex (Logan et\u00a0al, 1987) mediated by dephosphorylation of Spt5 by the PP1 phosphatase, which slow down elongation by at least two\u2010 to threefold (Cortazar et\u00a0al, 2019). This reduction of elongation speed facilitates the catch\u2010up of RNA Pol II by the Xrn2 exonuclease, which dislodges RNA Pol II from the DNA template leading to transcription termination (Cortazar et\u00a0al, 2019; Eaton et\u00a0al, 2020).Regulation of RNA Pol II speedInitially, studies on transcriptional regulation focused on transcription initiation, demonstrating an essential role for this stage in the regulation of gene expression. However, over the years, it has become increasingly clear that other stages of transcription are critical to control gene expression. For example, RNA Pol II promoter\u2010proximal pausing, which has received increasing attention in the transcription field since the late 90s, was shown to be an early regulatory step that controls expression of most metazoan genes (for excellent reviews on this step, see (Jonkers & Lis, 2015; Chen et\u00a0al, 2018)). Meanwhile, it has become clear that virtually all steps of the transcription cycle can be regulated by RNA Pol II\u2010associated factors and the epigenetic context of the locus.Until recently however, transcription elongation by RNA Pol II was not considered as a major regulatory step in gene expression. However, studies published over the last 20\u00a0years have shown that transcription elongation speed is highly dynamic and extremely regulated within individual genes, as well as between genes, which is the topic of the first section of this review. The use of RNA Pol II mutants displaying accelerated or decelerated transcription rates has also allowed major advances in our understanding of the function of RNA Pol II speed, demonstrating an essential role in many co\u2010transcriptional processes and therefore in the repertoire of RNAs produced from a given locus as discussed in the second section of this review. We will also review the growing list of factors involved in the modulation of RNA Pol II speed highlighting that transcription velocity is a key regulatory step in the transcription cycle. Importantly, the introduction of a point mutation in RNA Pol II, which slows down transcription, was found to be embryonic lethal in mice (Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019) and non\u2010viable in plants (Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). These data demonstrate that correct RNA Pol II speed is essential for development (Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019; Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). Moreover, we and others have shown that transcription speed can be locally adapted in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli, affecting the identity of RNAs produced in the cell (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Schor et\u00a0al, 2013; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014; Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017).In this review, we will therefore discuss the different techniques used to measure RNA Pol II velocity and the evidences indicating that transcription speed is not static, but highly variable between genes, as well as within individual genes. We will then describe the influence of RNA Pol II velocity on co\u2010transcriptional processes and thus on the identity of RNAs produced from a given gene, as well as the factors that regulate transcription speed. Finally, we will cover the dynamics of RNA Pol II speed regulation and the roles it may play in the response to environmental changes.Measuring RNA Pol II speedAt which speed does RNA Pol II synthesize RNA? This a long\u2010standing question which has been investigated for over 40\u00a0years. Many different methods have been developed to estimate RNA Pol II speed on endogenous or integrated reporter genes in distinct species (see (Jonkers & Lis, 2015) for an excellent review describing some of these methods). These methods measure the distance traveled by RNA Pol II as a function of time. Importantly, we can only measure an average RNA Pol II speed on any given gene or part of gene, since it depends on both the instantaneous speed at which nucleotides are added by the polymerase to the nascent RNA, as well as polymerase pausing within the gene body. Indeed, transcription elongation is frequently interrupted by pauses induced by roadblocks such as nucleosomes, DNA\u2010binding proteins, or mis\u2010incorporated nucleotides (Mayer et\u00a0al, 2017), which can thus affect the average speed of transcription. Most of the described methods developed to estimate RNA Pol II speed rely on inducible gene expression or treatments with small drugs globally inhibiting transcription either at the initiation step (with triptolide, for example) or, more commonly, at the promoter\u2010proximal pause release step with reversible P\u2010TEFb inhibitors (e.g., flavopiridol or DRB). Inhibition of P\u2010TEFb and thus repression of the release of RNA Pol II from promoter\u2010proximal pausing has been shown to block transcription of almost all genes (Henriques et\u00a0al, 2013; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014). In this scenario, RNA Pol II elongation complexes which are already in the productive elongation phase of the transcription cycle continue transcribing, while no new RNA Pol II enters productive elongation. As such, methods relying on the reversible P\u2010TEFb inhibitors theoretically allow measurement of RNA Pol II speed at most active genes. To calculate transcription speed, the disappearance or appearance of the RNA produced by transcription or RNA Pol II itself is then followed at various locations downstream of gene promoters in kinetics experiments. The distance traveled by RNA Pol II after transcription inhibition (also called the RNA Pol II \u201cretreating wave\u201d) can be followed in response to transcriptional switch\u2010off of inducible genes or after treatment with general transcription inhibitors. Conversely, the distance traveled by RNA Pol II after transcription induction (also called the RNA Pol II \u201cemerging wave\u201d) can be followed in response to transcriptional activation by different stimuli or after globally switching on transcription by removing a reversible inhibitor (Jonkers & Lis, 2015).RNA Pol II speed measurements by biochemical approachesPioneering works have estimated average RNA Pol II speed only on a few genes. By monitoring the appearance of RNA by in\u00a0situ hybridization, nuclear run\u2010on, slot blot, or RT\u2013PCR after expression activation, RNA Pol II speed was estimated between 1.1\u00a0kb/min and 4.8\u00a0kb/min (Ucker & Yamamoto, 1984; Thummel et\u00a0al, 1990; Shermoen & O'Farrell, 1991; O'Brien & Lis, 1993; Tennyson et\u00a0al, 1995; Femino et\u00a0al, 1998; Femino et\u00a0al, 2003; Hanisch et\u00a0al, 2013). Other studies have estimated average RNA Pol II speed between 2 and 6\u00a0kb/min by analyzing the sedimentation profile of RNA after [3H] uridine incorporation (Sehgal et\u00a0al, 1976) or RNA Pol II levels by ChIP PCR at several locations in the gene (Mason & Struhl, 2005) after transcriptional repression.By using quantitative methods to detect RNAs, these measures of RNA Pol II speed were then refined. For instance, the RNA Pol II \u201cemerging wave\u201d has been followed by monitoring the appearance of nascent RNAs by qRT\u2013PCR on exon\u2013intron junctions spanning the genes. This has been performed on a few long genes at different time points after stimulation by tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) (Wada et\u00a0al, 2009), interferon \u03b2, or DRB release (Singh & Padgett, 2009). In these studies, the average transcription speed was estimated between 3.1\u00a0kb/min and 3.8\u00a0kb/min with little variation between individual genes (Singh & Padgett, 2009; Wada et\u00a0al, 2009).In the late 2000s, many teams began developing methodologies to measure transcription speed genome wide (Table\u00a01). A major improvement in the race for global measurement of RNA Pol II speed came from the demonstration that RNA Pol II \u201cemerging\u201d and \u201cretreating\u201d waves could be followed genome wide by global run\u2010on sequencing (GRO\u2010seq) (Hah et\u00a0al, 2011). This technique has been applied in various human cell lines to follow the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA Pol II after transcriptional activation by different cellular signaling pathways (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013) or by DRB release (Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014). Other methods have been developed to specifically enrich nascent RNAs and have been applied to follow the RNA Pol II \u201cemerging wave\u201d after DRB or flavopiridol release. These include sequencing of nascent RNAs labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine (Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014b; Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2015; Liang et\u00a0al, 2018; Baluapuri et\u00a0al, 2019; Gregersen et\u00a0al, 2020) or bromouridine (Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014). As for the RNA Pol II \u201cretreating wave\u201d, it has been followed genome wide by GRO\u2010seq after flavopiridol treatment (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014). All these techniques showed in various human cell lines that the average RNA Pol II speed ranges between 1.25\u00a0kb/min and 3.5\u00a0kb/min (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013; Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014b; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014; Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014; Liang et\u00a0al, 2018; Baluapuri et\u00a0al, 2019; Gregersen et\u00a0al, 2020). Contrary to what had been initially shown for a few genes (Singh & Padgett, 2009; Wada et\u00a0al, 2009), the measured transcription speed was found to be extremely variable between genes, with RNA Pol II velocity varying from 0.37\u00a0kb/min to 3.57\u00a0kb/min for individual genes (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013). RNA Pol II speed was furthermore also shown to be highly variable within individual genes, as RNA Pol II accelerates while traveling throughout the gene body, starting at 0.5\u00a0kb/min in the first 10\u201315\u00a0kb and accelerating up to 2\u20134\u00a0kb/min downstream (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013; Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014b; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014). In addition, comparison of transcription speed between different cell lines showed that transcription speed on individual genes is overall well conserved between cell lines (Singh & Padgett, 2009; Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014). However, Danko et\u00a0al (2013) found that RNA Pol II velocity can differ by as much as 25\u201340% on individual genes in different cell lines and in response to diverse signaling pathways. Moreover, we and others have shown that RNA Pol II speed can vary on individual genes or downstream of genes in response to different stimuli (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Schor et\u00a0al, 2013; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014; Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). Thus, RNA pol II speed is highly regulated between as well as within genes and can change in response to different stimuli.Table 1Average RNA pol II speed estimations on a genome\u2010wide basis.RNA pol II speedCell line, organismNumber of genesMeasurement methodStudy\n2.1\u00a0kb/min\n2.8\u00a0kb/min\n\nMCF\u20107, Human\nAC16, Human\n\n140 genes\n26 genes\nGRO\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA extended in the presence of BrUTP in run\u2010on experiments) following transcriptional activation by estrogen signaling or cytokine treatment\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIDanko et\u00a0al (2013)3.5\u00a0kb/minHeLa, Human1,577 genes4sUDRB\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIFuchs et\u00a0al (2014)\n1.25\u00a0kb/min\n1.75\u00a0kb/min\n1.25\u00a0kb/min\n1.25\u00a0kb/min\n1.75\u00a0kb/min\n\nHF1, Human\nTM, Human\nCS\u2010B, Human\nK562, Human\nMCF\u20107, Human\n\n2,702 genes\n2,469 genes\n1,932 genes\n2,270 genes\n2,399 genes\nBruDRB\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with bromouridine following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIVeloso et\u00a0al (2014)3.13\u00a0kb/minHEK293, Human237 genesDRB/GRO\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA extended in the presence of BrUTP in run\u2010on experiments following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IISaponaro et\u00a0al (2014)2\u00a0kb/minmESC, MouseMore than 1,000 genesGRO\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA extended in the presence of BrUTP in run\u2010on experiments) following flavopiridol treatment to block RNA pol II promoter\u2010proximal pause release\u2014follows the \u201cretreating wave\u201d of RNA pol IIJonkers et\u00a0al (2014)3.27\u00a0kb/minU2OS, Human2,163 genes4sUDRB\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIBaluapuri et\u00a0al (2019)Around 3.2\u00a0kb/minHEK293, Human982 genes4sUFP\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine following flavopiridol release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IILiang et\u00a0al (2018)Around 1\u00a0kb/minS2, Drosophila\nNot mentioned4sUDRB\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIAkhtar et\u00a0al (2019)2.3\u00a0kb/minHEK293, Human4,869 genesDRB/TTchem\u2010seq (sequencing of nascent RNA labeled with 4\u2010thiouridine following DRB release)\u2014follows the \u201cemerging wave\u201d of RNA pol IIGregersen et\u00a0al (2020)Open in a separate windowFinally, RNA Pol II speed has also been inferred from existing total RNA\u2010seq data (Ameur et\u00a0al, 2011; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Kawamura et\u00a0al, 2019). Indeed, intronic reads form a decreasing gradient from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032 end of the intron. This gradient depends on the kinetics of RNA Pol II and co\u2010transcriptional splicing and leads to formation of a \u201csaw\u2010tooth\u201d pattern of read coverage over the length of the gene (Ameur et\u00a0al, 2011). RNA Pol II speed can thus be inferred for long introns by calculating the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 slope of intron reads coverage. Faster RNA Pol II will take less time to reach the downstream exon where co\u2010transcriptional splicing can take place, thus limiting RNA accumulation at the 5\u2032 end of introns, thereby decreasing the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 slope of intronic reads coverage. This technique is however far less accurate than the methods designed to follow the emerging or retreating waves of RNA Pol II. It may, nonetheless, give an opportunity to compare RNA Pol II speed in thousands of published datasets from different cell types and in response to many different stimuli.RNA Pol II speed measurements by imaging technologiesInterestingly, studies performed in live cells came to very similar estimations of RNA Pol II speed. RNA Pol II speed in live cells was estimated to range from 0.6\u00a0kb/min to 4.3\u00a0kb/min by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments using MS2 fluorescent proteins to label nascent MS2 repeat\u2010containing RNAs (Boireau et\u00a0al, 2007; Darzacq et\u00a0al, 2007; Ben\u2010Ari et\u00a0al, 2010; Yunger et\u00a0al, 2010; Brody et\u00a0al, 2011; Maiuri et\u00a0al, 2011; Muramoto et\u00a0al, 2012; Corrigan et\u00a0al, 2016). By using constructs carrying arrays of MS2 and PP7 repeats in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions of the same gene, RNA Pol II speed was estimated to range from 0.84\u00a0kb/min to 3.66\u00a0kb/min (Hocine et\u00a0al, 2013; Fukaya et\u00a0al, 2017). Other imaging techniques such as fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled nascent RNA or high\u2010speed 3D fluorescence nanoimaging techniques reported speed in the same range, albeit slightly higher between 0.6 and 12\u00a0kb/min (Larson et\u00a0al, 2011; Martin et\u00a0al, 2013; Annibale & Gratton, 2015). Measurement of RNA Pol II velocity on endogenous genes in living cells was also attempted by FRAP experiments using EGFP tagged RNA Pol II. The authors calculated an RNA Pol II speed between 1.1 to 1.5\u00a0kb/min when measured on the Hsp70 genes following heat shock in Drosophila (Yao et\u00a0al, 2007; Ardehali et\u00a0al, 2009). These studies also found that RNA Pol II speed was highly variable between cells (Hocine et\u00a0al, 2013), as well as between identical copies of the same gene at different locations in a gene array, measured simultaneously in the same cell (Annibale & Gratton, 2015). Indeed, in this latter study, a fourfold variation in RNA Pol II velocity was measured between identical copies of the same gene and overall, the different RNA Pol II speeds measured in the gene array almost span the range of transcription speeds reported using the MS2 containing constructs, from below 0.6\u00a0kb/min to over 12\u00a0kb/min (Annibale & Gratton, 2015). Along the same line, Maiuri et\u00a0al (2011) even reported an extremely high RNA Pol II speed (about 80\u00a0kb/min) on an HIV\u2010based vector integrated in one copy, whereas when integrated in 35 copies, RNA Pol II velocity was estimated at 1.6\u00a0kb/min, similar to earlier estimates from multicopy HIV\u2010derived vector insertions (Boireau et\u00a0al, 2007). Nevertheless, single integration of the CCND1 gene under the control of an endogenous or viral promoter led to an RNA Pol II speed of 0.31\u20130.78\u00a0kb/min (Yunger et\u00a0al, 2010) and the number of gene units in the tandem array had no effect on RNA Pol II speed in another study (Brody et\u00a0al, 2011). In agreement with biochemical measurements of RNA Pol II speed, all these data show that RNA Pol II speed can be variable between genes but also within genes, highlighting the fact that RNA Pol II speed is highly regulated.RNA Pol II speed measurements in organismsAs mentioned above, over the last 20\u00a0years, RNA Pol II speed has been estimated by several different methods. All these studies show that transcription speed is highly dynamic and highly regulated within, as well as between genes, suggesting that it might play an important role in the transcription cycle. The most accurate and least biased methods to measure RNA Pol II speed are based on activation or inhibition of transcription and following RNA Pol II progression throughout genes over time. This allows estimating the distance traveled by RNA Pol II during a given amount of time. However, most of these studies, in particular those analyzing RNA Pol II speed genome wide, used drugs that inhibit either transcription initiation or promoter\u2010proximal pause release. It is important to consider that these drugs may have important secondary effects, since most of them target kinases involved in cell\u2010cycle control, which may affect the measurements. Another issue with most of these studies is that they were performed using cell lines. Whether the observed features can be generalized or whether they are a peculiarity of the respective analyzed cell lines thus remains an open question. The use of drugs can be overcome by activating different signaling pathways to induce transcription of specific genes, hence limiting secondary effects. Although the use of these induction systems restricts the analysis to only a handful of genes, the method can be scaled up to whole organisms, as shown in a recent study measuring RNA Pol II speed in budding yeast and A. thaliana seedlings (Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). Moreover, this study together with a recent study measuring RNA Pol II speed in mouse ESCs (Embryonic Stem Cells) and neurons showed that these methods are readily transferable to more complex systems and still give comparable results (Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019; Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). Clearly, further developing novel technologies allowing accurate measurement of RNA Pol II speed at genome\u2010wide level in physiological situations and in complex organisms will be a major advance in the field.RNA Pol II speed controls many co\u2010transcriptional processes and thus affects the composition of the\u00a0transcriptomeIn the early 80s, a screen was performed to discover mutations rendering Drosophila RNA Pol II resistant to the transcription inhibitor \u03b1\u2010amanitin (Greenleaf et\u00a0al, 1979). This screen led to the discovery of mutations affecting transcription speed. These mutations, mostly located in the largest RNA Pol II subunit RPB1 (Greenleaf, 1983), which either slow down or accelerate transcription, have allowed huge progress in the characterization of the role of RNA Pol II speed in the regulation of gene expression. At least two different mutations in human RNA Pol II are known to slow down transcription. The R749H substitution in the funnel domain is homologous to the C4 mutation in Drosophila (de la Mata et\u00a0al, 2003) and likely affects translocation of the polymerase such that the forward and backward movement of the mutant elongation complex is slowed\u2010down (Chen et\u00a0al, 1993; Chen et\u00a0al, 1996). The H1108Y substitution is homologous to the H1085Y substitution in the yeast Rpb1 (Kaplan et\u00a0al, 2008) and mutates a contact with the \u03b2\u2010phosphate of incoming NTPs (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014) which also slows down transcription. Conversely, the E1126G substitution in human RPB1 (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014) (homologous to the E1103G substitution in the yeast RPB1; Kaplan et\u00a0al, 2008; Kireeva et\u00a0al, 2008) accelerates transcription by stabilizing a triple alpha helix at the base of the trigger loop, concomitantly with a loss of fidelity that is reduced by \u03b1\u2010amanitin. Average speed for these RNA Pol II mutants is 0.5\u00a0Kb/min or even slower for the slow mutants (R749H and H1108Y, respectively) and 1.9\u00a0Kb/min for the fast mutant as compared to 1.7\u00a0Kb/min for the human \u03b1\u2010amanitin\u2010resistant WT pol II (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014). Nevertheless, prolonged \u03b1\u2010amanitin treatment has been shown to induce accelerated degradation of several proteins including the elongation factor DSIF (Tsao et\u00a0al, 2012). Measurements of RNA Pol II speed obtained using \u03b1\u2010amanitin\u2010resistant RNA Pol II mutants should thus be taken with care.By analyzing these different mutants in different systems, RNA Pol II velocity has been shown to control many co\u2010transcriptional processes. Indeed, transcription speed determines the rate at which binding sites for RNA\u2010binding proteins are synthesized within the nascent RNA and is thus in kinetic competition with co\u2010transcriptional processes. Co\u2010transcriptional processes shown to be regulated by RNA Pol II speed include constitutive splicing, alternative splicing, back\u2010splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and transcription termination (Fig\u00a02). All of these co\u2010transcriptional processes contribute to the generation of transcriptome diversity that is critical for proper cell functioning and will be discussed in further detail in the following sections.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Co\u2010transcriptional processes regulated by RNA Pol II speedRNA Pol II speed can influence the following:\nSplicing\u2010related processes such as constitutive splicing, alternative splicing, and back\u2010splicing;The RNA methylome by controlling the deposition of N6\u2010methyladenosine in RNAs;Normal 3\u2032 end processing of replication\u2010dependent core histone mRNAs by controlling the folding of nascent RNA at histone genes;Termination\u2010related processes such as alternative polyadenylation (represented by two poly(A) sites) and the distance traveled by RNA Pol II beyond the poly(A) site, i.e., read\u2010through transcription;Protein modifications on gene bodies: post\u2010translational modifications of RNA Pol II CTD such as serine 2 phosphorylation and chromatin modifications such as tri\u2010methylation of lysine 36 of histone H3.\nControl of splicing\u2010dependent processesConstitutive splicing is the joining of consecutive exons by removal of intervening introns. The majority of individual introns are constitutively spliced. However, splicing efficiency is not 100% and unspliced RNAs are predominantly retained in the nucleus and degraded through a quality\u2010control mechanism (Palazzo & Lee, 2018). Using microarrays designed to study splicing in budding yeast, slow RNA Pol II mutants were shown to enhance splicing, while fast mutants were shown to reduce constitutive splicing (Braberg et\u00a0al, 2013). This anti\u2010correlation between transcription speed and splicing efficiency has been confirmed in budding yeast by RNA sequencing\u2010based methods (Aslanzadeh et\u00a0al, 2018). Likewise, other studies using sequencing\u2010based methods showed that a slow mutant enhances constitutive splicing in Drosophila (Howe et\u00a0al, 2003; Khodor et\u00a0al, 2011; Braberg et\u00a0al, 2013; Aslanzadeh et\u00a0al, 2018), as does a fast mutant in plants (Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). This discrepancy between plants on one hand and Drosophila and budding yeast on the other hand might seem surprising; however, both slow and fast RNA Pol II mutants inhibit constitutive splicing in human cells (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014). These results show that while RNA Pol II speed differentially affects constitutive splicing in various species, proper control of intragenic RNA Pol II velocity is essential for proper regulation of constitutive splicing efficiency.In contrast to constitutive splicing, alternative splicing contributes to the proteome diversity through the biogenesis of several mRNA splice variants from the same pre\u2010mRNA. Indeed, transcripts can undergo one or more alternative splicing events such as inclusion or skipping of an exon, use of alternative 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice sites, intron retention, or splicing of adjacent mutually exclusive exons, thus generating several different transcript isoforms from the same gene. More than 95% of human genes undergo alternative splicing in a developmental, tissue\u2010specific or signal transduction\u2010dependent manner (Nilsen & Graveley, 2010). Alternative splicing regulation is extremely complex, with dynamic alternative splicing networks identified in many different cell types and organs, as well as in different physiological conditions. Many types of RNA\u2010binding proteins can control alternative splicing through binding to cis elements (splicing enhancers or silencers), although the full set of factors involved is not known. Like constitutive splicing, alternative splicing is also sensitive to RNA Pol II speed. Indeed, the use of gel\u2010based methods in yeast, human, and mouse cells (de la Mata et\u00a0al, 2003; Howe et\u00a0al, 2003; Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Ip et\u00a0al, 2011; Dujardin et\u00a0al, 2014) or of RNA sequencing\u2010based methods in human cells (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014) showed that slow and fast transcription either increased or decreased inclusion of alternative exons depending on the genes analyzed. Moreover, RNA sequencing analyses showed that slow transcription obtained using an RNA Pol II knock\u2010in mutant in mouse ESCs or fast transcription induced by an RNA Pol II point mutant in plants leads to changes in both exon inclusion and skipping (Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019; Leng et\u00a0al, 2020).The effects of RNA Pol II velocity on splicing events can be explained by the fact that splicing is in kinetic competition with transcription elongation. According to the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d model, altering transcription speed may regulate splicing by modulating the presence of cis\u2010acting sequence elements on the nascent RNA and thus the recruitment of both positive and negative splicing factors. However, slow and fast RNA Pol II mutants often have the same effect on alternative exon inclusion or skipping (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014; Aslanzadeh et\u00a0al, 2018), which is not predicted by the \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d model. These observations have thus led to the emergence of another model termed \u201cGoldilocks\u201d model in which an optimal RNA Pol II speed is required to allow proper nascent RNA folding and factors binding to splice sites, splicing enhancers and silencers (Fong et\u00a0al, 2014). This model predicts that RNA Pol II speed has evolved under positive selection pressure to allow optimal co\u2010transcriptional splicing. However, it remains to be determined how RNA Pol II speed affects nascent RNA folding and/or binding of factors to influence co\u2010transcriptional splicing.RNA Pol II speed, through controlling splicing efficiency, has also been implicated in the regulation of circular RNA (circRNA) production. CircRNAs belong to a newly described class of RNAs that also contribute to transcriptome diversity. CircRNAs are produced by back\u2010splicing of pre\u2010mRNAs, which corresponds to the joining of a downstream 5\u2032 splice site to an upstream 3\u2032 splice site in the reversed orientation, thus producing a circular RNA molecule (for excellent reviews on circRNA biogenesis and function, see (Chen, 2020; Xiao et\u00a0al, 2020)). Tens of thousands of circRNAs have been identified in metazoans, some of which are evolutionarily conserved. While a majority of these circRNAs are expressed at low levels, some of them accumulate to levels exceeding those of their linear counterparts (Jeck et\u00a0al, 2013; Salzman et\u00a0al, 2013). Indeed, although back\u2010splicing is generally much less efficient than canonical splicing, owing to their circular structure, circRNAs are resistant to degradation by exonucleases, which allows them to accumulate to high levels. CircRNAs exhibit tissue and cell type\u2010specific expression patterns with a tendency to accumulate in the brain (Rybak\u2010Wolf et\u00a0al, 2015). To date, only a small subset of all the identified circRNAs has been functionally studied, leaving a full repertoire of circRNAs of unknown function. Moreover, because of their low expression level, the biological significance of some circRNAs has been questioned; however, recent findings suggest that circRNAs can work as a group to achieve measurable effects. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that circRNAs are tightly regulated transcripts that in some cases play essential biological functions. Indeed, a growing number of circRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of innate immunity, cell proliferation, transformation, and neuronal function (Chen et\u00a0al, 2019; Liu et\u00a0al, 2019; Hollensen et\u00a0al, 2020). Misregulation of some circRNAs has also been implicated in multiple diseases among which cancer, some circRNAs playing important roles in cancer progression (Chen et\u00a0al, 2019). CircRNAs can regulate transcription, splicing, and chromatin interactions. They can also act as microRNA decoys, function as protein scaffolds, sequester proteins, or be themselves translated (Kristensen et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, because circRNAs are very stable and can be detected in body fluids (blood and urine, for example), they are now considered as promising disease biomarkers (Vo et\u00a0al, 2019; Wang et\u00a0al, 2021). Importantly, circRNA biogenesis is tightly regulated, although the mechanisms regulating their levels are not completely understood. Among key elements regulating their production, intronic complementary repeats in introns flanking the circularized exons have been shown to be important for the biogenesis of circRNAs (Liang & Wilusz, 2014). Base pairing between these repeats is required for the biogenesis of these circRNAs, most probably by bringing the splice sites into close proximity. Many proteins are also involved in the production of circRNAs, such as spliceosome components, RNA\u2010binding proteins, and RNA helicases (Patop et\u00a0al, 2019). In addition, some recent studies point to RNA Pol II speed as another determinant of circRNA production. Indeed, the average RNA Pol II velocity is higher on genes producing circRNAs than on genes not producing circRNAs (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2016) and especially on introns of these genes (Ragan et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, the use of slow and fast RNA Pol II mutants has shown that transcription speed directly correlates with the circularization efficiency of circRNAs (Ashwal\u2010Fluss et\u00a0al, 2014; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2016).Control of transcription termination\u2010related processesRNA Pol II speed is also in competition with the rate of processes linked to transcription termination such as poly(A) site usage and transcription termination itself.A gene can possess multiple poly(A) sites, and differential usage of these sites leads to the formation of distinct mRNA isoforms, a phenomenon termed alternative polyadenylation. Alternative polyadenylation is very common in eukaryotes, and around 70% of mammalian protein\u2010coding genes are subjected to alternative polyadenylation (Derti et\u00a0al, 2012; Hoque et\u00a0al, 2013). When an alternative poly(A) site is present in the coding region, the use of this alternative polyadenylation site can produce mRNA isoforms that differ in their coding capacity, resulting in different final protein products with specific cellular functions. In contrast, and most frequently, the alternative poly(A) sites are located downstream of the coding region and their differential usage generates mRNAs that share the same coding sequence, but have different 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) lengths. The alternative 3\u2032 UTR sequence may contain regulatory elements that interact with RNA\u2010binding proteins or miRNAs, modulating mRNA stability, translation, transport, and/or localization (Tian & Manley, 2017). On several genes possessing alternative poly(A) sites, a slow RNA Pol II mutant shows a switch to the use of upstream poly(A) sites (Pinto et\u00a0al, 2011; Liu et\u00a0al, 2017; Geisberg et\u00a0al, 2020; Yague\u2010Sanz et\u00a0al, 2020), while a fast RNA Pol II mutant shows a slight downstream switch in poly(A) site usage (Geisberg et\u00a0al, 2020). In addition, a slow RNA Pol II mutant shows a tissue\u2010specific effect on alternative polyadenylation as it affects poly(A) site usage differentially in the Drosophila head or body (Liu et\u00a0al, 2017).Transcription termination is an essential step of the transcription cycle. It requires disassembly of the stable complex formed between the nascent RNA, RNA Pol II, and the DNA template. Transcription termination is important to recycle RNA Pol II and to prevent interference between adjacent transcription units. For most genes, transcription termination is triggered by recognition of the poly(A) site, but it does not occur at a conserved site or distance from the 3\u2032 end of genes (Hofer & Darnell, 1981; Weintraub et\u00a0al, 1981; Hagenb\u00fcchle et\u00a0al, 1984). It rather occurs at diffuse sites, at variable distances, up to several kilobases, downstream of the poly(A) site (Fong et\u00a0al, 2015). Transcription termination has been shown to be shifted closer to the poly(A) site by a slow RNA Pol II mutant (Fong et\u00a0al, 2015), whereas a fast RNA Pol II mutant shifted transcription termination further downstream from the poly(A) site (Fong et\u00a0al, 2015; Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). Consistent with the results obtained with slow RNA Pol II mutants, slowing\u2010down transcription using mutants of the elongation factor TFIIS also shifts termination upstream (Sheridan et\u00a0al, 2019; Zatreanu et\u00a0al, 2019). RNA Pol II velocity can thus control the distance traveled by RNA Pol II downstream of genes, in other words, the extent of transcriptional read\u2010through. These results suggest that a kinetic competition between the elongating RNA Pol II and the degradation of the nascent RNA by Xrn2 is controlling termination (Fong et\u00a0al, 2015). Interestingly, we recently showed that transcription speed increases downstream of two genes in response to activation of an oncogene and that this increase correlates with an increase in transcriptional read\u2010though downstream of these genes (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). This implies that transcriptional read\u2010through might be regulated by RNA Pol II speed in response to intra\u2010cellular stimuli.Control of mRNA modificationsN6\u2010methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in mRNA, detected in thousands of human transcripts (about 25% of mRNAs contain at least one m6A) (Dominissini et\u00a0al, 2012; Meyer et\u00a0al, 2012). More than 99% of total m6A in polyadenylated mRNA is deposited by a heterodimeric complex composed of METTL3\u2010METTL14 in a highly specific manner (Shi et\u00a0al, 2019; Zaccara et\u00a0al, 2019). m6A influences splicing, degradation, and translation of mRNA (Knuckles & B\u00fchler, 2018; He & He, 2021). A slow RNA Pol II mutant induces an increase in the level of m6A deposition on mRNAs, and this has been linked to a reduced efficiency of mRNA translation (Slobodin et\u00a0al, 2017). Thus, transcription speed, by affecting m6A deposition on mRNAs, may influence mRNA stability as well as translation efficiency and therefore proteome composition.Control of histone pre\u2010mRNA processing through alteration of nascent RNA structuremRNAs encoding replication\u2010dependent core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) produced during S\u2010phase lack the normal poly(A) tail and instead present a 3\u2032 stem\u2010loop (Marzluff & Koreski, 2017). They undergo endonucleolytic cleavage at the 3\u02b9 side of this stem\u2010loop, and correct folding of this structure is absolutely essential for normal 3\u2032 processing of histone mRNAs (Williams et\u00a0al, 1994; Battle & Doudna, 2001; Dominski et\u00a0al, 2003). Slow RNA Pol II mutants reduce histone pre\u2010mRNA processing (Saldi et\u00a0al, 2018), the stem\u2010loop failing to properly fold in transcripts synthesized by these mutants. This is likely due to a competition mechanism between the rate of RNA synthesis and the rate of nascent RNA folding, thus explaining the failure to process 3\u2032 ends. These results show that regulation of transcription speed can also control pre\u2010mRNA processing by changing nascent RNA structure.Control of protein modifications on gene bodiesThe CTD of RNA Pol II, which consists of tandem repeats of the heptapeptide YSPTSPS, plays a central role in the coordination of co\u2010transcriptional processing through its association with a large number of enzymes and protein/RNA\u2010binding factors. The CTD is the target of many post\u2010translational modifications, yielding specific patterns (referred to as \u201cthe CTD code\u201d), which are recognized by factors playing essential roles throughout the transcription cycle (Harlen & Churchman, 2017). Importantly, these RNA Pol II CTD modifications are dynamic, allowing spatial and temporal regulation of processing factors binding. Eukaryotic transcription units are, for instance, characterized by conserved 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 profiles of specific pol II CTD phosphorylation events deposited co\u2010transcriptionally. Phosphorylation on Ser5 is normally high at the 5\u2032 ends of genes where it facilitates mRNA capping, whereas Ser2 phosphorylation is high at 3\u2032 ends where it is important for mRNA 3\u2032 end formation (Buratowski, 2009; Heidemann et\u00a0al, 2013; Bentley, 2014). Interestingly, in\u00a0vitro transcription analyses have shown that the RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation patterns and the factors recognizing them change as a function of post\u2010initiation time rather than distance elongated (Joo et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, slow RNA Pol II mutants shift RNA Pol II Ser2 hyperphosphorylation to the 5\u2032 end of genes (Fong et\u00a0al, 2017). These results suggest that the dwell time spent by RNA Pol II within the \u201ctarget zone\u201d where it associates with a modifier can modulate the deposition or removal of post\u2010translational modifications (Fong et\u00a0al, 2017). Altogether, these studies indicate that CTD phosphorylation is controlled by RNA Pol II speed.Eukaryotic transcription units are also characterized by conserved 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 profiles of specific histone modifications deposited co\u2010transcriptionally. These histone modifications profiles are sensitive to RNA Pol II speed. Indeed, fast transcription correlates with distal localization of H3K36me3 (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014). Moreover, a fast RNA Pol II mutant shifts H3K4me2/me3 in the 3\u2032 direction (Soares et\u00a0al, 2017), while a slow RNA Pol II mutant shifts these marks toward the 5\u2032 end of genes (Fong et\u00a0al, 2017; Soares et\u00a0al, 2017). In addition, H2Bub1 levels are highly correlated with RNA Pol II velocity and inhibition of transcription elongation strongly affects global H2Bub1 levels (Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014a). These results suggest that transcription speed can modulate co\u2010transcriptional chromatin modification patterns.Control of TSS selectionMost eukaryotic promoters are known to utilize several different TSSs; nevertheless, how the TSSs are chosen remains an open question. Transcripts with different start sites can differ in their stability or translational efficiency (Rojas\u2010Duran & Gilbert, 2012) and give rise to transcriptome variations during development and cell differentiation (Hu et\u00a0al, 2020). In budding yeast, RNA Pol II speed controls the use of differential TSSs, with fast RNA Pol II mutants shifting to upstream TSSs, while slow RNA Pol II mutants shift to downstream TSSs (Kaplan et\u00a0al, 2012; Braberg et\u00a0al, 2013; Qiu et\u00a0al, 2020).Control of pausingFollowing transcription initiation and promoter clearance, RNA Pol II stalls and accumulates at high levels in the promoter\u2010proximal region. Promoter\u2010proximal pausing is a key rate\u2010limiting step of the transcription cycle that RNA Pol II experiences at almost all genes in metazoans (Henriques et\u00a0al, 2013; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014), at around 20% of genes in plants (Kindgren et\u00a0al, 2020) and at about 30% of genes in fission yeast (Booth et\u00a0al, 2016). In Drosophila, a slow RNA Pol II mutant has been shown to shift pausing, which is stabilized by NELF in this species, closer to the TSS (Li et\u00a0al, 2013), while in plants, a fast RNA Pol II mutant decreases the extent of +1 nucleosome promoter\u2010proximal pausing (Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). As such, RNA Pol II velocity can control both the location relative to the TSS and the extent of promoter\u2010proximal pausing.Control of gene expressionFinally, RNA Pol II speed has been linked to regulation of gene expression levels in several studies. Indeed, genes with the highest measured RNA Pol II velocity have been shown to generate more mRNAs (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Cohen et\u00a0al, 2018). Moreover, transcription by a fast RNA Pol II mutant in A.\u00a0thaliana increased production of nascent RNAs (Leng et\u00a0al, 2020), suggesting that transcription speed can, to some extent, affect gene expression levels. However, other studies have found no relationship between RNA Pol II speed and expression levels (Singh & Padgett, 2009; Fukaya et\u00a0al, 2017). Nevertheless, RNA Pol II velocity has also been suggested to affect the timing of mRNA accumulation and could thus play a role in the timing of some developmental regulatory processes (Thummel et\u00a0al, 1990; Fukaya et\u00a0al, 2017; Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019). Indeed, early stages of embryonic development display great variations in cell\u2010cycle duration with some extremely fast cell divisions (Ciemerych & Sicinski, 2005; Ferree et\u00a0al, 2016). It is thus possible that during these short cell divisions, RNA Pol II speed plays a crucial role in maintaining the required level of some essential mRNAs that need to be expressed at given developmental stages.Factors controlling RNA Pol II speedAs described above, dynamic regulation of transcription speed within gene bodies is essential for controlling co\u2010transcriptional processes, which determine the composition of the transcriptome. Factors regulating RNA Pol II velocity therefore play an essential role in cells and are the topic of several recent studies using genome\u2010wide RNA Pol II speed measurement methods (Table\u00a02) (Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014; Liang et\u00a0al, 2018; Baluapuri et\u00a0al, 2019; Cortazar et\u00a0al, 2019; Gregersen et\u00a0al, 2019; Hou et\u00a0al, 2019; Sheridan et\u00a0al, 2019; Fan et\u00a0al, 2020). RNA Pol II speed can be controlled by different factors including, but not restricted to, DNA sequence, gene structure, histone modifications, chromatin remodelers, and RNA Pol II\u2010associated factors and modifications.Table 2List of factors controlling transcription speedFactorStudyEffect on RNA pol II speedOrganismNumber of genes analyzed and measurement methodRNA pol II\u2010associated

a paused state and backtrack, sliding backwards on the DNA template. Backtracking thus causes a misalignment of the nascent RNA 3\u2032 end with its active site, which needs to be resolved before transcription can restart. RNA poll II pausing and backtracking lead to an overall decrease in RNA Pol II average speed. The DNA sequence in the transcription bubble and the secondary structure adopted by the nascent RNA can influence RNA Pol II speed through controlling pausing and backtracking. Indeed, in\u00a0vitro transcription assays showed that RNA Pol II pauses are shorter and less frequent on GC\u2010rich templates. This is probably due to co\u2010transcriptional folding of nascent RNA which, at GC\u2010rich sequences, may impose an energy barrier to pausing by impeding backtracking along the DNA (Zamft et\u00a0al, 2012). Along the same line, in\u00a0vivo experiments in budding yeast showed that fast transcription elongation by RNA Pol II is associated with strong nascent RNA structures which would prevent RNA Pol II from backtracking thus pushing it forward (Turowski et\u00a0al, 2020). Short DNA sub\u2010sequences have also been shown to influence the frequency and duration of pauses in budding yeast. However, here, no correlation has been found between the GC content of these short sequences and RNA Pol II speed (Cohen et\u00a0al, 2018). Moreover, the GC content within gene bodies has been shown to correlate negatively with RNA Pol II speed (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014). As GC rich templates have been shown to increase RNA pol II speed in\u00a0vitro (Zamft et\u00a0al, 2012), the role played by the GC content in RNA pol II speed in cellulo might be more complex than anticipated. For example, while high GC content in the transcription bubble slows down RNA polymerase I transcription, strong nascent RNA structures formed close to the polymerase promote forward movement (Turowski et\u00a0al, 2020). Finally, in budding yeast, RNA Pol II pauses were found to correlate with the stability of the RNA:DNA hybrid, rather than the stability of the DNA:DNA duplex (Luka\u010di\u0161in et\u00a0al, 2017).Gene structureInterestingly, the gene structure itself, and in particular its intron and exon composition, can also play a role in regulating RNA Pol II velocity. Indeed, a positive correlation has been identified between intron 1 size and RNA Pol II speed (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014) and the presence of introns increases transcription speed (Fukaya et\u00a0al, 2017). Conversely, exon density correlates negatively with RNA Pol II velocity (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014), which may be the result of several contributing factors.First, increased nucleosome occupancy occurs on exons with respect to introns (Andersson et\u00a0al, 2009; Nahkuri et\u00a0al, 2009; Schwartz et\u00a0al, 2009; Spies et\u00a0al, 2009; Tilgner et\u00a0al, 2009; Chodavarapu et\u00a0al, 2010). Nucleosomes can induce RNA Pol II pausing in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and may even be the major source of pausing (Churchman & Weissman, 2011; Bintu et\u00a0al, 2012). Consistent with the idea that nucleosomes represent a transcriptional barrier, histone depletion from human cells increases transcription speed (Jimeno\u2010Gonz\u00e1lez et\u00a0al, 2015). Although no general correlation has been found between nucleosome occupancy and RNA Pol II speed (Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014), nucleosomes bound within exons could nonetheless slow down RNA Pol II transcription.Second, pre\u2010mRNA splicing may be involved in the reduction of RNA Pol II velocity over exons, which could, in turn, affect co\u2010transcriptional splicing. Indeed, RNA Pol II ChIP on chip and ChIP\u2010seq data showed that RNA Pol II accumulates on exons in yeast and human, suggesting that RNA Pol II pauses over exons (Brodsky et\u00a0al, 2005; Schwartz et\u00a0al, 2009; Alexander et\u00a0al, 2010; Carrillo Oesterreich et\u00a0al, 2010; Kwak et\u00a0al, 2013; Mayer et\u00a0al, 2015; Nojima et\u00a0al, 2015; Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016). Furthermore, in budding yeast, RNA Pol II ChIP qPCR allowed observation of RNA Pol II pausing at the 3\u2032 splice site (Alexander et\u00a0al, 2010). This transcriptional pausing over the 3\u2032 splice site is splicing\u2010dependent, since it was lost upon introduction of a mutation in the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 splice sites (Alexander et\u00a0al, 2010; Chathoth et\u00a0al, 2014). A mutation in the branch site of the intron also inhibited this RNA Pol II pausing, which was restored by introducing a complementary mutation in the U2 snRNA (Alexander et\u00a0al, 2010). Finally, this pausing is enforced by ubiquitylation of the catalytic subunit of RNA Pol II (Milligan et\u00a0al, 2017).More recently, PRO\u2010seq (precision run\u2010on sequencing) and NET\u2010seq (native elongating transcript sequencing), methods offering global and strand\u2010specific mapping of RNA Pol II density at nucleotide resolution, were used to investigate RNA Pol II pausing throughout genes. These methods confirmed the existence of a pause at different positions over exons and intron\u2010exon boundaries in several different species. These methods also confirmed the existence of a pause at the 3\u2032 splice site in budding yeast (Harlen et\u00a0al, 2016) and Drosophila (Kwak et\u00a0al, 2013), at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 splice sites in human cells (Mayer et\u00a0al, 2015; Nojima et\u00a0al, 2015) and at the 5\u2032 splice site in plants (Kindgren et\u00a0al, 2020). Moreover, higher RNA Pol II accumulation has been reported at spliced exons, as compared to skipped exons (Kwak et\u00a0al, 2013; Mayer et\u00a0al, 2015; Nojima et\u00a0al, 2015). All these studies show that exons and intron\u2013exon boundaries are regions of RNA Pol II transcription slow\u2010down and this slow\u2010down seems to be induced by the splicing process itself and could, in turn, affect co\u2010transcriptional splicing.RNA Pol II\u2010associated factors and modificationsMany transcription factors play a role in transcription elongation; however, few of them have been shown to directly influence the speed of transcription by RNA Pol II (Table\u00a02). Backtracked RNA Pol II can be rescued by the elongation factor TFIIS which stimulates RNA Pol II intrinsic cleavage activity (Cheung & Cramer, 2011). RNA Pol II cleaves the nascent RNA 3\u2032 end, releasing an RNA fragment of 2\u201314 bases long (Izban & Luse, 1993) and producing a new 3\u2032 end perfectly aligned with its active site. RNA Pol II can then resume transcription. TFIIS thus reduces the duration of pausing and has been shown to accelerate RNA Pol II transcription in\u00a0vitro (Ishibashi et\u00a0al, 2014; Schweikhard et\u00a0al, 2014). Accordingly, TFIIS increases RNA Pol II speed in human cells (Sheridan et\u00a0al, 2019; Zatreanu et\u00a0al, 2019), while its deletion had no effect on RNA Pol II velocity in budding yeast (Mason & Struhl, 2005). Another factor which can accelerate transcription through reactivation of backtracked RNA Pol II is the Ccr4\u2010Not complex (Kruk et\u00a0al, 2011), which is considered a master regulator of eukaryotic gene expression. Reactivation of backtracked RNA Pol II by the Ccr4\u2010Not complex is different from reactivation by TFIIS. In vitro transcription assays showed that in contrast to TFIIS, this complex is unable to reactivate RNA Pol II which has backtracked after incorporation of the chain terminator O\u2010me\u2010GTP, indicating that its activity does not involve stimulation of the intrinsic RNA Pol II cleavage activity (Kruk et\u00a0al, 2011). The Ccr4\u2010Not complex is instead thought to push RNA Pol II forward through binding to the nascent RNA until realignment of the 3\u2032 end of the nascent transcript in the active site (Kruk et\u00a0al, 2011). Finally, interplays between these two complexes have been described: While Ccr4\u2010Not can rescue backtracked RNA Pol II in the absence of TFIIS, further in\u00a0vitro characterization showed that Ccr4\u2010Not also interacts with TFIIS and recruits it to the arrested elongation complex resulting in enhanced transcript cleavage (Dutta et\u00a0al, 2015).Besides factors stimulating the progression of backtracked RNA Pol II, other general transcription factors are involved in controlling transcription speed by mechanisms that are for the most unclear. These factors, which we introduce in the following section, are mostly proteins or complexes associated with RNA Pol II which are also involved in other transcription steps. Sub1, which is a functional component of the pre\u2010initiation complex playing a role in TSS selection is also involved in transcription elongation and has been shown to increase RNA Pol II velocity in budding yeast (Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al, 2012). Another factor reported to increase RNA Pol II speed is the transcription elongation factor Spt6, which physically interacts with histone H3 (Bortvin & Winston, 1996; Winkler et\u00a0al, 2000) and can facilitate nucleosome reassembly (Adkins & Tyler, 2006). Spt6 binds to the phosphorylated RNA Pol II CTD and facilitates RNA Pol II promoter\u2010proximal pause release (Vos et\u00a0al, 2018a). In Drosophila, Spt6 has also been shown to increase RNA Pol II speed (Ardehali et\u00a0al, 2009).The super elongation complex (SEC) is a large protein complex with compositional and functional diversity and is one of the most active P\u2010TEFb containing complexes (Luo et\u00a0al, 2012). In addition to its role in promoter\u2010proximal pause release and elongation processivity, the SEC facilitates RNA Pol II transcription, as disruption of this complex slows down RNA Pol II (Liang et\u00a0al, 2018). RNA Pol II CTD heptapeptide residues Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5, and Ser7 are dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by different CTD kinases and phosphatases throughout the transcription cycle (Harlen & Churchman, 2017). CDK12 and CDK13 are multitask RNA Pol II CTD kinases playing important roles for proper gene expression and genome stability (Greenleaf, 2019). Dual inhibition of both kinases significantly decreases RNA Pol II CTD Ser2 and Thr4 phosphorylation, as well as RNA Pol II processivity and speed (Fan et\u00a0al, 2020).Spt5 (suppressor of Ty 5) is a highly conserved RNA Pol II\u2010associated factor, which, in eukaryotes, is part of the DSIF complex together with Spt4. In budding yeast, Spt5 increases transcription speed (Quan & Hartzog, 2010). However, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts it controls RNA Pol II processivity, but not RNA Pol II velocity (Fitz et\u00a0al, 2018). Nevertheless, consistent with a role of Spt5 in the regulation of RNA Pol II speed, the PP1 phosphatase together with its nuclear targeting subunit (PNUTS) can dephosphorylate Spt5, which slows down RNA Pol II transcription in human cells (Cortazar et\u00a0al, 2019). Moreover, the transcription factor MYC, which directly binds to Spt5 and recruits it to promoters, allowing Spt5 transfer onto RNA Pol II (Baluapuri et\u00a0al, 2019), has been shown to be required for fast transcription elongation (Liang et\u00a0al, 2018; Baluapuri et\u00a0al, 2019; Caggiano et\u00a0al, 2019).Furthermore, involved in regulating RNA Pol II speed is the conserved polymerase\u2010associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C), which plays multiple roles in chromatin transcription and genomic regulation (Van Oss et\u00a0al, 2017). Paf1C specifically increases RNA Pol II velocity within the first part of gene bodies in mice (Hou et\u00a0al, 2019), although no effect of the loss of this factor could be measured in budding yeast (Mason & Struhl, 2005). On the other hand, consistent with a role of the Paf1C complex in RNA Pol II speed regulation, recent data show that the dissociable Paf1C subunit Rtf1 increases RNA Pol II speed in in\u00a0vitro transcription assays (Vos et\u00a0al, 2020).Two more components affecting RNA Pol II speed are SCAF8 and the DBIRD complex. SCAF8, an RNA Pol II CTD\u2010interacting protein, which plays a role in suppressing the use of proximal poly(A) sites, is a positive RNA Pol II elongation factor that increases RNA Pol II speed (Gregersen et\u00a0al, 2019). Depletion of DBIRD, a protein complex formed by DBC1 and ZNF326, induces an accumulation of RNA Pol II on A/T\u2010rich alternatively spliced internal exons in human cells, suggesting a role for DBIRD in the control of RNA Pol II speed over exons (Close et\u00a0al, 2012).Finally, RECQL5, a member of the conserved family of RECQ DNA helicases, decreases RNA Pol II speed and suppresses genome instability (Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014). The hypothesis behind these two observations is that decreasing RNA Pol II speed smoothens transcription elongation and thus renders RNA Pol II less prone to pausing and arrest which can induce transcription stress (Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014).As exemplified above, some factors such as Paf1C, TFIIS, or Spt5 have been reported to be important for transcription speed in certain species, but not in others. This may represent a real biological difference between species or could be due to the fact that these factors are involved only for some genes or under particular conditions. However, this difference could also be caused by technical issues: In yeast, genes are quite short (around 1.5\u20132\u00a0kb long on average, although the gene YLR454W, used for most of the experiments measuring RNA Pol II speed in budding yeast, is exceptionally large with a size of around 8\u00a0kb (Table\u00a02) (Mason & Struhl, 2005; Quan & Hartzog, 2010; Kruk et\u00a0al, 2011; Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al, 2012)). It might thus be difficult to assess the effect of a factor on transcription speed because the methods used to measure RNA Pol II speed offer poor resolution on short genes. Indeed, in mammalian cells most studies only consider very long genes to accurately decipher an elongation speed (Saponaro et\u00a0al, 2014; Cortazar et\u00a0al, 2019; Gregersen et\u00a0al, 2019; Hou et\u00a0al, 2019; Sheridan et\u00a0al, 2019; Fan et\u00a0al, 2020).Chromatin landscapeChromatin modifications can also regulate RNA Pol II velocity by facilitating or hindering RNA Pol II progression through nucleosomes (Table\u00a02). Genome\u2010wide studies have shown that H3K79me2, H2B mono\u2010ubiquitylation, and H4K20me1 positively correlate with RNA Pol II speed in the gene body (Fuchs et\u00a0al, 2014a; Jonkers et\u00a0al, 2014; Veloso et\u00a0al, 2014). Besides these global correlations, other histone modifications locally influence RNA Pol II velocity: modifications triggering chromatin relaxation increase RNA Pol II speed, while modifications triggering chromatin compaction slow down RNA Pol II. For instance, a reduction in the level of class II HDACs on specific genes and increased H3 and H4 acetylation correlate with faster RNA Pol II transcription on these genes (Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014). Similarly, H3K9 hyperacetylation correlates with a change in the ratio of distal versus proximal pre\u2010mRNA levels suggesting a local increase in RNA Pol II speed (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009), whereas an increase in H3K9 di\u2010methylation and H3K27 tri\u2010methylation correlates with a slow\u2010down of RNA Pol II transcription (Schor et\u00a0al, 2013).The evolutionary conserved family of non\u2010histone chromosomal proteins HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) consists of three isoforms in human. HP1 proteins bind to di\u2010 and trimethylated H3K9, as well as to other proteins involved in various epigenetic functions, such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (Zeng et\u00a0al, 2010). HP1\u03b1 and HP1\u03b2 isoforms are mainly heterochromatic, while HP1\u03b3 is present in both heterochromatin and euchromatin (Zeng et\u00a0al, 2010). Through RNA Pol II ChIP measurements, HP1\u03b3 has been suggested to locally increase RNA Pol II pausing on alternatively spliced exons enriched in H3K9me3 marks (Saint\u2010Andr\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2011). The mechanism is thought to involve the RNAi machinery (Saint\u2010Andr\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2011; Ameyar\u2010Zazoua et\u00a0al, 2012). Similarly, HP1\u03b1 recruitment to local H3K9me2 enrichment induced by siRNA targeting correlates with a change in the ratio of distal versus proximal pre\u2010mRNA levels suggesting a decreased local RNA Pol II speed (All\u00f3 et\u00a0al, 2009).ATP\u2010dependent chromatin remodeling complexes regulate the access of different factors to genomic DNA during transcription, replication, and repair by altering the contacts between histones and DNA within nucleosomes. The SWI/SNF family of ATP\u2010dependent chromatin remodeling complexes controls the expression of many genes by sliding or evicting nucleosomes positioned on binding sites for transcription activators or repressors (Clapier et\u00a0al, 2017). SWI/SNF complexes contain more than 10 protein subunits, including a single ATPase, either SMARCA4 (BRG1) or SMARCA2 (BRM), that utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter nucleosome positioning (Euskirchen et\u00a0al, 2012). The SWI/SNF complex subunit BRM has been suggested to locally decrease RNA Pol II speed in response to activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Indeed, BRM knockdown has been shown to decrease RNA Pol II accumulation on alternatively spliced exons as measured by RNA Pol II ChIP (Batsch\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2006).Adapting RNA Pol II speed to the cellular environmentOver the last 20\u00a0years, the use of kinetic RNA Pol II mutants has shown that RNA Pol II speed regulation plays an essential role in many co\u2010transcriptional processes thus controlling the composition of the transcriptome. The use of such mutants has also shown that RNA Pol II speed regulation is essential for development (Maslon et\u00a0al, 2019; Leng et\u00a0al, 2020). However, RNA Pol II mutants globally affect RNA Pol II velocity and thus may have side effects on the expression of transcription factors involved in these co\u2010transcriptional events or\u00a0in physiological processes such as development. These studies thus\u00a0left the question of the physiological relevance of transcription speed regulation open. Recent studies have however given a hint of\u00a0an answer to this question by revealing that RNA Pol II velocity can\u00a0be adapted to respond to intra\u2010 and extra\u2010cellular stimuli (Fig\u00a03). First, RNA Pol II velocity differs by as much as 25\u201340% on individual genes stimulated by diverse signaling pathways in different cell lines (Danko et\u00a0al, 2013). Second, RNA Pol II velocity changes around alternatively spliced exons in specific genes, in response to cell depolarization and cellular differentiation (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Schor et\u00a0al, 2013; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014). Along the same lines, RNA Pol II accumulates on alternatively spliced exons of specific genes in response to activation of the protein kinase C or MAP kinase pathways, suggesting a decrease in RNA Pol II speed (Batsch\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2006; Saint\u2010Andr\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2011; Ameyar\u2010Zazoua et\u00a0al, 2012). Third, transcription speed increases downstream of some protein\u2010coding genes in response to an oncogenic signal (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). Finally, UV\u2010induced DNA damage has been proposed to induce a reduction in RNA Pol II speed (Mu\u00f1oz et\u00a0al, 2009; Lavigne et\u00a0al, 2017; Williamson et\u00a0al, 2017). Although this last result can be explained by transcription\u2010blocking DNA lesions accumulating along gene bodies, it remains plausible that DNA damage signaling also directly triggers RNA Pol II transcription slow\u2010down.Open in a separate windowFigure 3RNA Pol II speed is regulated in order to adapt the transcriptome composition in response to intra\u2010 or extra\u2010cellular stimuliIn response to intra\u2010 or extra\u2010cellular stimuli such as oncogenic stress, cell depolarization, or cell differentiation, RNA Pol II can either accelerate or slow down locally, inducing a change in alternative splicing or the extent of read\u2010through which could play a role in the response to stimuli.These variations in transcription speed in response to changes in the cellular environment may have important consequences on transcriptome composition. Indeed, changes in RNA Pol II velocity measured in response to cell depolarization and cell differentiation regulate alternative splicing and thus RNA identity (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Schor et\u00a0al, 2013; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014). Moreover, we have shown that the increase in RNA Pol II velocity downstream of genes is accompanied by an increase in transcriptional read\u2010through which interferes with and thus decreases the expression of downstream convergent protein\u2010coding genes (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). Increased transcriptional read\u2010through is known to interfere with the expression of downstream genes also in other contexts such as cancer or HSV\u20101 infection in human cells (Grosso et\u00a0al, 2015; Rutkowski et\u00a0al, 2015; Hennig et\u00a0al, 2018), as well as cold acclimation in plants (Kindgren et\u00a0al, 2018). Transcriptional read\u2010through can also give rise to a chimeric transcript which can be spliced and translated into an aberrant fusion protein, if it invades the downstream gene in a pair of tandem genes (Grosso et\u00a0al, 2015; Hennig et\u00a0al, 2018). Therefore, by controlling the extent of transcriptional read\u2010through, RNA Pol II speed can have dramatic consequences on the expression of surrounding genes.Importantly, transcriptome modifications induced by RNA Pol II speed changes can be extremely fast, since they do not require new transcription initiation events. Furthermore, these transcriptome modifications could participate in the response to intra\u2010 or extra\u2010cellular stimuli. Indeed, we have shown that those convergent genes, antisense to the transcriptional read\u2010through induced in response to oncogene\u2010induced senescence, are enriched in pro\u2010proliferative genes (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). Thus, by repressing those genes, the transcriptional read\u2010through may participate in the control of the genetic program of senescence. Moreover, transcriptional read\u2010through is induced downstream of thousands of genes in response to different kinds of stresses (Rutkowski et\u00a0al, 2015; Vilborg et\u00a0al, 2015; Vilborg et\u00a0al, 2017; Cardiello et\u00a0al, 2018; Hennig et\u00a0al, 2018) and has been proposed to play an important role in the stress response by reinforcing the nuclear scaffold integrity after nuclear stress (Vilborg et\u00a0al, 2015). Finally, read\u2010through transcription can also affect the genome 3D structure: In read\u2010through regions, elongating RNA Pol II displaces cohesin from CTCF sites thus eliminating chromatin loops and locally decompacting chromatin (Heinz et\u00a0al, 2018). Therefore, by controlling the extent of transcriptional read\u2010through, RNA Pol II speed could affect both gene expression and genome 3D organization. More generally speaking, regulation of RNA Pol II speed might thus be important for the cell response to intra\u2010 and extra\u2010cellular stimuli by affecting the whole transcriptome, from splicing\u2010dependent processes to gene expression and chromatin organization.Conclusion and perspectivesMore and more studies point to the importance of RNA Pol II speed in determining the identity of RNAs produced from a specific locus. Indeed, changes in transcription speed induce changes in the splicing repertoire, with modifications of alternative splicing and of the production of circular RNAs by back\u2010splicing (see section on co\u2010transcriptional processes regulated by RNA Pol II speed). These changes also affect transcription termination\u2010related processes such as poly(A) site usage and the extent of transcriptional read\u2010through. In summary, changes in RNA Pol II speed modify the whole spectrum of coding and non\u2010coding RNAs produced from the genome. By changing the spectrum of RNAs produced by transcribed genes, RNA Pol II speed can thus provide another layer of complexity in genome expression control.An important issue is to which extent this speed can be regulated upon changes in the cellular environment. As exemplified above, a number of factors are known to participate in controlling transcription speed. Some of them are general transcription factors probably affecting all transcribing RNA polymerases. Thus, any modification of the function of these factors presumably affects RNA Pol II velocity genome wide, leading to major changes in the repertoire of coding and non\u2010coding RNAs. However, some features of the chromatin landscape, such as histone modifications or chromatin bound factors, can locally control RNA Pol II speed. Chromatin is a highly dynamic structure, which is known to harbor local changes depending on the cellular environment. Such local changes within a transcribed region are thus susceptible to lead to local changes in RNA Pol II velocity and thus to modifications in the identity of the RNAs produced by this locus. We recently exemplified such a local modification of chromatin and RNA Pol II speed in cells undergoing oncogene\u2010induced senescence downstream of two genes, leading to extended transcriptional read\u2010through (Muniz et\u00a0al, 2017). Along the same lines, local changes of histone modifications such as acetylation or methylation and RNA Pol II speed occur on alternative spliced exons during cell response to depolarization and differentiation (Schor et\u00a0al, 2009; Schor et\u00a0al, 2013; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2014). Whether such observations can be generalized to various environmental changes is clearly an open issue which merits further investigation. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying such changes, as well as the signaling pathways involved, will also clearly be a major step toward our understanding of the genome response to environmental changes. Similarly, the local regulation of RNA Pol II velocity upon activation of specific signaling pathways may be essential during the development of multicellular organisms and therefore represents a challenging line of research in the field of developmental biology.It would also be important to investigate whether deficient regulations of RNA Pol II speed participate in disease progression, again through the resulting consequences on local or global genome expression. Cancer cells have probably exploited such mechanisms given the variety of circular and read\u2010through RNAs whose expression is affected during cancer progression (Grosso et\u00a0al, 2015; Smid et\u00a0al, 2019). Most importantly, recent results point to a causative role of circular RNAs on cancer progression (Chen et\u00a0al, 2019). Investigating the developmental\u2010programmed and cancer\u2010induced modifications in RNA Pol II velocity and the complexity of the RNAs affected thus clearly opens a new avenue of research in the fields of physiology and physiopathology.
