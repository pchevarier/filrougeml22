Closed-loop mechanical\nventilation could help clinicians in the systematic implementation of\nlung-protective ventilation in CARDS patients, while significantly reducing their\nworkload.Closed-loop mechanical ventilation modes enable a fully automatized and optimized\nfunction of the mechanical ventilator, thus reducing the necessity for manual adjustment.11 INTELLiVENT\u00ae-ASV is such a closed-loop ventilation mode. Based on peripheral\noxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration measurements, it\nautomatically adjusts minute ventilation, the fraction of inspired oxygen\n(FiO2) and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) breath-by-breath.11 INTELLiVENT\u00ae-ASV has been shown to safely ventilate patients in a variety of\npathologies and to maintain ventilation settings and lung mechanics within the\nlimits of protective mechanical ventilation, while reducing the necessity for\nmedical and nursing adjustment.12\u201314\n\nThe objective of the present study was to assess the performance, in terms of\nlung-protective ventilation, of a closed-loop ventilation mode as compared to\nconventional mechanical ventilation in the resource-constrained setting of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. MethodsThis prospective study was performed between March and May 2020 at the Institute of\nIntensive Care Medicine of the University Hospital Zurich, an academic tertiary care\nreferral center. The study was approved by the cantonal ethics committee of Zurich\n(BASEC: 2020-01681) and informed consent was obtained from the patients or from\ntheir next of kin. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, the\nGuidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP-Directive) issued by the European\nMedicines Agency as well as with Swiss law and regulatory authority\nrequirements.PopulationPatients were prospectively included in this study if they presented with (I) a\nSARS-CoV-2 infection that was laboratory confirmed by nucleic acid amplification\naccording to the WHO-issued testing guidelines,15 and (II) a critical manifestation of COVID-19 requiring admission to an\nintensive care unit and treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation due to\nprofound hypoxemia, complying with the Berlin definition for ARDS.16\nStudy Design, Blinding and Ventilator AllocationIn the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, resources at the Institute of Intensive\nCare Medicine had to be expanded to allow for care of a higher number of\ninvasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in addition to the standard\nHamilton-S1\u00ae (Hamilton Medical AG, Switzerland) mechanical ventilator, Draeger\nEvita\u00ae Infinity\u00ae V500 machines (Draegerwerk AG, Germany) had to be employed to\nmechanically ventilate COVID-19 patients. The standard mode of ventilation\nemployed on the Hamilton-S1\u00ae ventilator was INTELLiVENT\u00ae-ASV 1.1 (closed-loop\nventilation), and Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation on the Draeger\nEvita\u00ae Infinity\u00ae V500 (conventional ventilation). Weaning from the Hamilton\nventilator was approached via the INTELLiVENT\u00ae-ASV mode. For the Draeger\nventilator, Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure and Spontaneous Continuous\nPositive Airway Pressure ventilation could be used. Ventilation times on other\nventilation modes, during patient transport and during interventions, were\ndisregarded in the final analysis to prevent potential biases. Physician and\nnursing staff in charge of treatment and care in the ICU were the same for both\ntypes of mechanical ventilator; no differentiation or splitting of teams\ndependent on ventilator expertise was undertaken. Medical and nursing staff were\nfamiliar with the use of both devices and ventilation modes as part of their\ndaily routine, and had received an intensified refresher course on mechanical\nventilation focusing on lung-protective ARDS ventilation in both closed-loop\nventilation and conventional ventilation modes at the beginning of the pandemic.\nInstitutional standard procedures were the same for both closed-loop and\nconventional mechanical ventilation, including but not limited to the proning of\npatients with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (paO2) over\nFiO2 ratio (P/F ratio) <200 mmHg, the use of neuromuscular\nblocking agents in patients with a P/F ratio <150 mmHg or presenting an\nuncontrollable respiratory drive and vigorous breathing efforts under deep\nsedation, as well as the use of an esophageal pressure probe in patients at the\nlimit of lung-protective ventilation or with a clinically assessed abnormal\nchest-wall compliance.Patients were allocated, at the time-point of ICU admission, to either type of\nmechanical ventilator based on the availability of the latter by coordinating\nstaff unaware of this study, without any further judgment or knowledge of the\npatients\u2019 condition influencing this decision. Medical and nursing staff,\nincluding consulting physicians, were fully blinded to the existence of the\npresent study. Further, the study team was blinded to the initial respirator\nallocation and had no influence on the decision.Data Collection and Lung-Protective Mechanical Ventilation DefinitionAll mechanical ventilators were attached to the patient data management system\n(MetaVision, iMDsoft, Israel) enabling a prospective, minute-by-minute\ncollection of all mechanical ventilator settings and measurements. Changes in\nventilator settings (respiratory rate, FiO2, PEEP, inspiratory\npressure, support pressure, target shifts, PASV limit and INTELLiVENT\u00ae-ASV\ncontrollers) were algorithmically assessed on a minute-by-minute basis; thus,\nnon-equal, temporally concomitant settings were noted as a change. To assure\noptimal ventilation and oxygenation of all patients, at least 1 blood gas\nanalysis per 6 hours ICU was performed. Static driving pressure was measured at\nthe time-point of endotracheal intubation as the difference of an\ninspiratory-and an expiratory-hold maneuver, subsequently \u00f7 static compliance\nwas calculated as tidal volume static driving pressure. However, in order to\nenable a continuous, minute-by-minute assessment of driving pressure and\nmechanical power, we chose to employ their dynamic approximations in analogy to\nthe previously published study by Urner et al.17 Peak inspiratory pressure was thus employed as a surrogate for plateau\npressure. Consequently dynamic driving pressure was calculated as peak\ninspiratory pressure \u2212 positive end expiratory pressure, dynamic compliance as\ntidal volume \u00f7 dynamic driving pressure and dynamic mechanical power as 0.098 \u00d7\nrespiratory rate \u00d7 tidal volume \u00d7 (peak inspiratory pressure \u2212 (0.5 \u00d7 dynamic\ndriving pressure)).Lung-protective mechanical ventilation was defined and institutionally targeted\nas: a maximal tidal volume of 6-8 ml per kg of ideal body weight.18,19 a driving pressure <15 cmH2O,20 a plateau pressure <30 cmH2O,21 a paO2 \u22657.33 kPa or a peripheral oxygen saturation\n(SpO2) \u226588%22,23 under permissive hypercapnic ventilation with a lower pH limit of 7.25.24 Further, a mechanical power <17 J/min was defined as lung-protective\nfor the setting of this study.17,25\nStatistical AnalysisDue to the breakthrough nature of this cohort study during the ongoing health\ncrisis, no power calculations were undertaken. Comparisons of population\ncharacteristics were performed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank and chi-squared\ntest, as appropriate. A 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant. For longitudinal analysis of mechanical ventilator\nparameters, lung mechanics and blood gas analyses, differences between time\npoints and ventilation modes were tested using linear mixed effects model\nanalysis. As independent variable fixed effects, time point and ventilation mode\nwere entered into the model, respectively, with and without interaction terms,\nwhich were retained only if they were found to contribute to the model. As\nrandom effects, intercepts for subjects as well as per-subject random slopes for\nthe effect on dependent variables were employed. P values were\ncalculated using a likelihood ratio test of the full model, with the effect in\nquestion, against a \u201cnull model,\u201d without the effect in question.\nP values for individual fixed effects were obtained by\nSatterthwaite approximation in a multi-dimensional model comprising time point\nand outcome status. Statistical analysis was performed via a fully scripted data\nmanagement pathway using the R environment for statistical computing version 3.6.1.26 Values are given as medians with interquartile ranges or counts and\npercentages as appropriate. ResultsDemographicsForty-seven patients with CARDS were admitted to the intensive care unit during\nthe study period. Of these, 40 patients required invasive mechanical\nventilation, were included in the study and allocated by study-blinded\ncoordinating staff to either conventional ventilation (ConV) in 17 cases or\nclosed-loop ventilation (CLoop) in 23 cases, as illustrated in Figure 1. At admission,\npatients were characterized by a P/F ratio of 92 [72-147] mmHg and a static\ncompliance of 18 [11-25] cmH2O/ L, as presented in Table 1. Baseline\ncharacteristics were comparable for the 2 groups (Table 1). Overall time on mechanical\nventilation was 11 [4-25] days and 28-day mortality amounted to 20% (Table 1). Only 1\npatient died due to refractory respiratory failure, the leading causes of death\nwere coagulopathy associated, with 4 patients deceasing due to intestinal\nischemia and 1 due to central pulmonary embolism with right heart failure\n(Supplemental Table e1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Study flow diagram.Table 1.Demographics, Baseline Characteristics at Intensive Care Unit Admission\nand Outcomes.a\nOverall population, N = 40Conventional ventilation, N = 17Closed loop ventilation, N = 23\nP\nDemographics\u2003Age [years]61 [54-70]59 [56-66]66 [54-72]0.331\u2003Sex [male]33 (83)15 (88)17 (78)0.689\u2003BMI [kg m-2]28 [26-31]29 [27-31]27 [25-29]0.151\u2003SAPS II36 [27-47]36 [30-45]36 [27-47]0.837\u2003SOFA9 [6-10]8 [6-10]9 [6-10]0.901\u2003PaO2/ FiO2 [mmHg]92 [72-147]86 [66-137]99 [77-147]0.639\u2003Time from first Symptoms to ICU Admission [days]9 [5-14]9 [6-15]8 [5-10]0.702\u2003Time to ICU Admission from Hospital Admission [days]0 [0-3]1 [0-3]0 [0-1]0.126\u2003Need for Vasopressors19 (48)8 (47)11 (48)0.899Comorbidities\u2003Ischemic Heart Disease8 (20)1 (6)7 (30)0.347\u2003Arterial Hypertension23 (58)9 (53)14 (61)0.859\u2003Diabetes Mellitus17 (43)6 (35)11 (48)0.639\u2003Chronic Pulmonary Disease7 (18)4 (24)3 (13)0.659\u2003Chronic Renal Insufficiency11 (28)4 (24)7 (30)0.9\u2003Solid Tumor4 (10)3 (18)1 (4)0.394\u2003Immunosuppressionb\n7 (18)4 (24)3 (13)0.659Laboratory Parameters\u2003White Blood Cell Count [G/l]8.2 [6.3-12.0]7.3 [5.2-10.0]10.0 [6.4-13.4]0.123\u2003Interleukin-6 [ng/l]136 [90-507]135 [73-796]144.5 [91-238]0.629\u2003CRP [mg/l]192 [102-283]124 [62-245]232 [165-287]0.089\u2003Creatinine [\u03bcmol/l]91 [72-144]91 [80-180]91 [70-128]0.941\u2003D-Dimer [mg/l]2725 [1020-4178]1190 [720-3048]3195 [1758-5668]0.088Arterial Blood Gas Analysis\u2003pH7.28 [7.24-7.33]7.30 [7.25-7.36]7.28 [7.22-7.31]0.172\u2003paO2 [kPa]8.3 [7.8-9.1]8.3 [7.9-8.9]8.3 [7.8-9.2]0.825\u2003paCO2 [kPa]6.8 [6.0-7.5]6.8 [6.0-7.7]6.8 [6.2-7.4]0.847\u2003HCO3 [mmol/l]23 [22-24]23 [23-24]24 [22-25]0.988\u2003Lactate [mmol/l]0.9 [0.7-1.2]0.9 [0.7-1.1]0.9 [0.7-1.2]1Mechanical Ventilation Parameters\u2003FiO2 [%]98 [95-100]100 [96-100]97 [95-100]0.193\u2003PEEP [cmH2O]15 [14-17]15 [11-16]16 [14-17]0.245\u2003Tidal Volume/ IBW [ml/kg]7.5 [6.5-8.8]6.6 [6.5-8.1]8.0 [6.8-9.0]0.065\u2003Static Driving Pressure [cmH2O]17 [15-20]21 [17-24]16 [14-18]0.001\u2003Respiratory Rate [1/min]28 [23-32]30 [27-34]27 [22-32]0.079\u2003Minute Volume Ventilation [l/min]9.6 [8.4-11.0]11.2 [8.6-13.8]9.5 [8.3-10.4]0.095\u2003Peak Inspiratory Pressure [cmH2O]29 [26-33]33 [30-36]27 [25-31]0.005\u2003Static Mechanical Power [J/min]21 [19-24]24 [21-31]19 [16-22]0.004\u2003Static Compliance [ml/cmH2O]18 [11-25]16 [11-20]21 [12-26]0.203Outcome\u2003Duration of Mechanical Ventilation [days]11 [4-25]12 [6-24]10 [4-23]0.837\u2003Length of ICU stay [days]18 [8-32]19 [7-32]18 [9-33]0.547\u200328-Day Mortality8 (20)2 (12)6 (26)0.472Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: BMI, Body Mass index; SAPS, Simplified Acute\nPhysiology Score; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment; CRP,\nC-reactive protein; PCT, Procalcitonin; LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase;\nHCO3, Bicarbonate; paO2, partial pressure\nof arterial oxygen; paCO2, partial pressure of arterial\ncarbon dioxide; FiO2, Fraction of inspired oxygen; PEEP,\nPositive End-Expiratory Pressure; IBW, Ideal Body Weight; ICU,\nIntensive Care Unit.a\u200aQuantitative data are expressed as median\n[interquartile range] or counts (and percentages) as\nappropriate.b\u200aImmunosuppression was defined as any of the following:\nHematological Malignancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B\nor C, Prescribed Immunosuppressive Medication.Overall Mechanical VentilationOverall, 1,048,630 minutes or 728 days of cumulative mechanical ventilator time\nwere analyzed (Table\n2).

For ease of visualization, individual\npatient data were averaged into 6-hour intervals. Lines represent median\nvalues, shaded areas the interquartile ranges.Lung-Protective VentilationThe dynamic driving pressure in the CLoop group was maintained at <15\ncmH2O for 84% of the time during the initial week, and 66% for\nthe overall ventilation time, as opposed to 51% (P < 0.001)\nand 49% (P < 0.001), respectively, for dynamic driving\npressures in the ConV group (Figure 3, Supplemental Tables e5, e6). Further, dynamic mechanical\npower could be held to <17 J/min for 79% of the ventilation time during the\ninitial week in the CLoop group, compared to 50% achieved in the ConV group\n(P < 0.001); this difference was also patent when the\noverall ventilation time between groups was compared (P <\n0.001). Additionally, the percentage of time with a peak inspiratory pressure\n<30 cmH2O (P < 0.001) was also higher in the\nCLoop group. Simultaneously, paO2 levels remained \u22657.33 kPa for 99%\nand the SpO2 \u226588% for 99% of the ventilation time in the CLoop group\nversus 99% (P < 0.001) and 97% (P <\n0.001) in the ConV group, respectively. Finally, patients in the CLoop group\nwere successfully ventilated in a fully protective fashion, with conjoint tidal\nvolumes <8 ml/kg IBW, dynamic driving pressures <15 cmH2O, peak\ninspiratory pressures <30 cmH20, SpO2 \u226588% and dynamic\nmechanical power <17 J/min, over 45% of the time, 63% during the first week,\nas opposed to 33% (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.76-1.82; P < 0.001) and\n38% (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.21-1.23; P < 0.001), respectively, in\nthe ConV group.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Bar plots and spider diagrams assessing the percentage of time of\nlung-protective mechanical ventilation (A) in reference to the overall\nmechanical ventilation time (B) in COVID-19 ARDS patients ventilated\nwith conventional and closed loop ventilation. \u2020Full lung\nprotective ventilation was defined as the conjoined target of tidal\nvolumes <8 ml/ kg, peak inspiratory pressure <30 cmH2O,\ndynamic driving pressure <15 cmH2O, peripheral oxygen\nsaturation >88% and a dynamic mechanical power <17 J/min.Changes in SettingsIn patients ventilated in the ConV group 7 [3-12] changes per day had to be\nmanually implemented to adapt mechanical ventilator settings as opposed to 4\n[2-7] in the CLoop group (P = 0.02). In comparison, the\nautomated algorithm in the CLoop group adapted the ventilator settings every 2.8\n[2.3-3.6] minutes. DiscussionIn this prospective study, closed-loop mechanical ventilation (CLoop) was compared\nwith conventional mechanical ventilation (ConV) in COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS) on a\nminute-by-minute basis. The CLoop group was fully protectively ventilated concerning\ntidal volume, driving pressure, peak inspiratory pressure, peripheral oxygen\nsaturation and mechanical power, for 65% of the first week and 45% of their overall\nventilation time, as opposed to 38% and 33%, respectively, for those in the ConV\ngroup. This was achieved with a concomitant decrease in the need for manual\nadjustment of the ventilator settings in the CLoop compared to the ConV group.Protective invasive mechanical ventilation has become a clear goal in ARDS therapy in\norder to limit strain to the \u201cbaby lung\u201d and prevent VILI.3 In this setting, reduced tidal volume ventilation patterns with 4 to 8 ml/kg\nIBW tidal volumes have become standard of care.18,19 Nonetheless, the implementation of these standards is still not universal; in\nthe recent LUNG SAFE study only two-thirds of the ARDS patients received tidal\nvolumes below 8 ml/kg IBW27 and recent data show only 23% of patients with CARDS being ventilated with\ntidal volumes below 6 ml/kg IBW.28 The present study reports a limitation of tidal volumes below 8 kg/ml IBW for\n90% and below 6 ml/kg for 57% of the mechanical ventilation time in the ConV group,\nreflecting the excellent training and understanding of protective ventilation among\nICU staff. Nonetheless, and regardless of the evident proficiency of the medical and\nnursing staff, CLoop was superior to ConV concerning settings for inspiratory\npressure and dynamic driving pressure. These 2 variables act as surrogate parameters\nfor transpulmonary pressure and pulmonary distension, and their limitation at 30\ncmH2O21 and 15 cmH2O,17,20 respectively, has been correlated with systematic mortality reductions in\nARDS. Further, recent research has emphasized the importance of elevated cycling\nfrequencies as amplifiers of the static strain induced by tidal volumes and driving\npressures leading to the stress failure of stress-bearing alveolar micro-elements.3,29 The observed reduced respiratory rate in the CLoop group during the acute\nphase of CARDS ventilation, as opposed to the higher respiratory frequencies in the\nConV group, could thus be a further protective factor. Interestingly, and in\ncontrast to ConV, CLoop enabled normoxic ventilation at higher P/F ratios while\nreducing FiO2 levels. Elevated FiO2 settings have been\npreviously postulated as an exacerbating variable to alveolar barrier dysfunction,\naggravating the degree of VILI, while their limitation has shown protective effects.30\u201333\n\nThe concept of mechanical power is a relatively new and holistic approach to\nquantifying the energetic strain delivered to the lung during ventilation.34,35 Mechanical power combines the effects of all main ventilatory variables, and\npowers above 17 J/min have been associated with worse outcomes in ARDS.17,25 Even though mechanical power calculation is not included in the CLoop\nalgorithm, this type of ventilation mode managed to limit mechanical power to under\n17 J/min for 79% of ventilation time while ConV did so for only 50% of the time, a\nvalue similar to the mechanical power reported in large ARDS cohorts.17 Interestingly, the percentage of time under lung-protective mechanical\nventilation in the CLoop group, especially regarding mechanical power, was reduced\nduring the first week in comparison to the overall time, probably indicating the\ndifficulty of the closed-loop algorithm to counterbalance spontaneous\nventilation.Integrating lung-protective ventilation approaches into routine mechanical\nventilation is a complex and resource-intensive endeavor, even for experienced\nclinicians and nurses.27,36 The pandemic triggered by SARS-CoV-2 has overwhelmed hospitals, leading to a\nlack of personnel and resources in ICUs.5\u20137\n Mortalities in mechanically ventilated CARDS patients have been reported to\noscillate between 20%-80% in this setting,1,8,28,37,38 with most lying substantially above the 30% reported in classic ARDS.10 Reasons for the variability of mortality are manifold, probably reflecting\nthe heterogeneity of treatment strategies, especially regarding off-label therapies,\npatient triage before ICU, variable degrees of resources and staffing limitation as\nwell as ventilation strategies, including ventilator sharing, among others.1,8,28,37\u201339\n Nonetheless, the elevated incidence of barotraumas in CARDS as compared to\nclassical ARDS may mainly be rooted in the exhaustion of personal resources, coupled\nwith the recruitment of staff who are inexperienced in ARDS treatment.8,9,40 The thorough implementation of lung-protective protocols could explain the\nexceptionally low 28-day mortality of only 20% in this cohort. Most notably no\nventilator associated barotraumas were observed in this cohort and only 1 patient\ndied of refractory respiratory failure.In analogy to previous studies on CLoop, the number of manual changes in mechanical\nventilator settings by caregivers was lower with CLoop than with ConV.12 This added efficiency could reduce strain on nursing and medical staff,\nespecially within the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it allows\ninexperienced ICU staff to implement lung-protective ventilation strategies without\nthe need for exhaustive training and considerations of the high heterogeneity of CARDS.2,41 Experienced caregivers are rare and the implementation of their know-how is resource-intensive.36\nThe present study has to acknowledge certain limitations. First, this study was not a\nclassic and truly randomized controlled trial; nevertheless, the study design chosen\nwas devised to maximally reduce biases. Second, the primary end-point of the study,\nalbeit of pathophysiological relevance, does not prove a clinical benefit of CLoop\nover ConV. Nonetheless, this study describes continuous, minute-by-minute sampled\nventilatory data, something unaccomplished before over such a long period of\nmechanical ventilation in ARDS. This, in turn, allows a faithful representation of\nboth ventilation strategies over time, as opposed to the reporting of daily sampled\nventilation data, and counterbalances the relatively low number of recruited\npatients. Third, the relevance of the reduction in ventilator interactions described\nwas not directly correlated to the bedside experience of the ICU staff; as such, the\ndegree of reduction in effective strain on medical and nursing personnel is not\nquantifiable. Fourth, it can be argued, that the present study only regarded CLoop\ncomparing it with pressure-controlled ventilation, and disregarding the still widely\nused volume-controlled ventilation. However, there is no clear evidence favoring any\nmode over pressure control in ARDS.42,43 Fifth, the use of peak pressure as a surrogate parameter for plateau pressure\nmay be a relevant confounder for the interpretability of the data. Nevertheless, and\nas previously shown, dynamic driving pressure and mechanical power have a clinical\nrepercussion on outcome similar to static driving pressure and mechanical power.17 Further, there is no current method for faithfully assessing static plateau\npressure in a continuous approach. Sixth, it could be argued that ICU staff were not\naccustomed to pressure-controlled ventilation and lung-protective strategies,\nleading to the observed inferiority of ConV. However, the implementation of\nmechanical ventilation refreshers for the ICU staff previous to this study\u2019s\ninitiation as well as the high degree of implementation of lung-protective\nstrategies in the ConV group compared to what is mentioned in the literature, argue\nagainst this point. Finally, while the implementation and acceptance of closed-loop\nventilation is widespread in the ICU setting in which this study was performed, the\nde-novo implementation of this tool in other ICUs may face\nresistance due to its novelty and an intrinsic reluctance to use automatic tools in\nICU settings. As shown here, the safety and efficacy of closed-loop ventilation as\nwell as the reduction of workload should be strong enough arguments to support a\nsupervised implementation of this technology, especially in the setting of a\npandemic. ConclusionIn conclusion, closed-loop ventilation, when compared to conventional mechanical\nventilation, is associated with a higher degree of lung-protective ventilation,\ncoupled with less hypoxemic time, while reducing the number of mechanical ventilator\nsetting adjustments necessary in CARDS during an early highpoint of the COVID-19\npandemic.
