The patients admitted to the respiratory departments from eight hospitals in Hunan and Guangxi Province with nucleic acid-positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited. Epidemiological information, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiological characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcomes data were recorded and analyzed. The median age of the recruited 541 subjects was 43 years (IQR, 33-55).

Respiratory COVID-19 subjects had more secondary bacterial infections (8.7% vs 0.0%, P < 0.001), needed the intensive care unit more (9.7% vs 2.2%, P = 0.005), non-invasive ventilation more (7.2% vs 1.5%, P = 0.004), developed ARDS more (11.4% vs 2.2%, P = 0.001) and needed longer time to recover (18.5 vs 16.7 days, P = 0.003) compared to predominately non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects. The multivariate model showed that age (OR = 1.04, P = 0.01), dyspnea (OR = 4.91, P < 0.001) and secondary bacterial infection (OR = 19.8, P < 0.001) were independently associated with development of ARDS among COVID-19 patients.

The causative agent, a novel coronavirus, was subsequently identified (January 7th, 2020) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has been named Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).So far, COVID-19 has claimed more cases and fatalities than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2,3]. This fact could be related to potentially more sources of viral transmission, including aerosolized droplets, direct contact and potentially fecal-oral transmission [4,5]. The lack of medical staff and personal protective equipment may also have contributed to the high number of deaths. These various transmission sources are mirrored in the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, which includes some subjects with predominant respiratory symptoms at disease onset and others with more non-respiratory symptoms. In this study, we sought to explore baseline characteristics and outcomes in subjects with COVID-19 with particular attention to differences in symptoms at disease onset (respiratory versus non-respiratory). We also identify risk factors for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2.\u2003Materials and methods2.1. Study design and subjectsWe performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from eight COVID-19 designated hospitals in Hunan and Guangxi Province, including the first Attached Hospital of Shaoyang University, the Affiliated Shaoyang Central Hospital of the University of South China, Zhuzhou Central Hospital, Yueyang Second People\u2019s Hospital, the First People\u2019s Hospital of Huaihua affiliated to the University of South China, the Second People\u2019s Hospital of Guilin, Xiangtan Central Hospital, and Loudi Central Hospital. This research was approved by the local Ethics Committee (2020002). All hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction between 1 January and 31 March 2020 were included. Asymptomatic subjects were excluded from the analysis. The asymptomatic subjects were those being tested positive due to intimate contact with confirmed cases.We obtained baseline demographic, and clinical manifestations from a questionnaire designed by the CDC [6]. The treatment regimens and outcome data were collected from the electronic medical record. Respiratory symptoms at disease onset (termed \u2018respiratory COVID-19\u2019) were adjudicated to include patients who reported their first COVID-19 symptoms as respiratory (i.e. dry cough, sputum production, sneeze, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, dyspnea, chest tightness, and hemoptysis). Similarly, predominantly non-respiratory symptoms at disease onset (termed \u2018non-respiratory COVID-19\u2019) were adjudicated to include patients who reported their first symptoms outside the respiratory system (i.e. fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhea, palpitation, nausea, vomit, and loss of appetite). The initial symptoms or signs were defined as the first symptoms noticed by the patients. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom was reported. For those asymptomatic patients, the date onset was specified as the day the positive nuclear acid was reported. The disease of severity was identified according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 [6].ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition. Briefly, the ARDS was diagnosed based on hypoxemia, which is a ratio of PaO2 to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2)\u00a0\u2264\u00a0300\u00a0mmHg [7]. Secondary bacterial infection was diagnosed if the patients had clinical symptoms and signs. Briefly, if two or more of the following clinical features are present: temperature greater than 38\u00b0C or less than 36\u00b0C, leukopenia or leukocytosis, purulent tracheal secretions and decreased PaO2, and the absence of an alternative infective focus mandates that a chest radiograph be performed. Then if the radiograph shows alveolar infiltrates or an air bronchogram sign, or if the findings have worsened, it is recommended that the CPIS be calculated which is more than 6 scores. Or laboratory findings of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteremia not present on admission [8].2.2. Statistical analysisMeans for continuous variables were compared by independent group t-tests or Mann-Whitney test. Proportions of categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Adjusted multiple logistic regression models were performed to determine risk factors for ARDS development. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 software. A value of P <\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant. 3.\u2003Results3.1. Demographics, clinical variables, and outcomes among COVID-19 subjectsWe recruited 541 cases in the final analysis. The median age of the recruited subjects was 43\u00a0years (IQR, 33\u201355). Of the 541 subjects, 173 (32.0%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions. Hypertension (14.2%) and diabetes (8.7%) were the most common comorbidities. Respiratory COVID-19 subjects were more likely to be classified into the severe and very severe groups and had longer hospital days (17 vs 14, P =\u00a00.03) relative to non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects. All the patients received antiviral therapy. Respiratory COVID-19 subjects received more corticosteroids (26.5 vs 14.6, P =\u00a00.005) and antibiotics (48 vs 36.5, P =\u00a00.02) compared to non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects. Respiratory COVID-19 subjects also had more secondary bacterial infections (P <\u00a00.001), needed the intensive care unit more (P =\u00a00.005), non-invasive ventilation more (P =\u00a00.004), developed ARDS more (P =\u00a00.001) and needed longer to recover (P =\u00a00.003) compared to predominately non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects. No non-respiratory COVID-19 subject required advanced support, including invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and continuous renal replacement therapies. There were no significant differences in laboratory findings between the two groups (Table 1).\nTable 1.Demographics, clinical variables and outcomes among COVID-19 subjectsVariablesAll(N\u00a0=\u00a0541)Respiratorya(N\u00a0=\u00a0404)Non-respiratoryb(N\u00a0=\u00a0137)PcAge (IQR)43.0 (33.0\u201355.0)45.0 (34.0\u201357.0)38.0 (29.0\u201350.0)<0.001Gender: Female (%)270 (49.9)204 (50.5)67 (48.9)0.64Body mass index (IQR)23.3 (21.3\u201326.2)23.4 (21.3\u201326.2)23.1 (21.3\u201325.8)0.55Contact with confirmed cases (%)417 (77.1)301 (404)116 (84.7)0.05Comorbidities, any (%)173 (32.0)144 (35.7)29 (21.0)0.002Diabetes (%)47 (8.7)38 (9.4)9 (6.5)0.31Hypertension (%)77 (14.2)67 (16.6)10 (7.2)0.007Cardiovascular disease (%)23 (4.3)21 (5.2)2 (1.5)0.06COPD (%)10 (1.8)10 (2.5)0 (0.0)0.06Asthma (%)13 (2.4)11 (2.7)2 (1.5)0.40Malignancy (%)6 (1.1)4 (1.0)2 (1.5)0.65Disease severity at admissiond35/436/47/2320/319/44/2115/117/3/2<0.001Illness onset until hospitalization4.0 (2.0\u20137.0)5.0 (3.0\u20138.0)4.0 (2.0\u20136.0)0.16Hospital days (IQR)17 (14\u201321)17 (12\u201324)14 (11\u201320)0.03Day to recovery (IQR)21 (16\u201328)23 (17\u201328)18 (14\u201325)0.003Clinical variablesTherapy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antiviral therapy (%)e541 (100)403 (100)138 (100)1Corticosteroids (%)127 (23.5)107 (26.5)20 (14.6)0.005Antibiotics244 (45.1)194 (48.0)50 (36.5)0.02Secondary bacterial infection (%)36 (6.7)35 (8.7)1 (0.7)<0.001Support\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NIV (%)31 (5.7)30 (7.4)1 (0.7)0.004IMV (%)15 (2.8)15 (3.7)0 (0.0)0.02ECMO (%)8 (1.5)8 (2.0)0 (0.0)0.10CRRT(%)8 (1.5)8 (2.0)0 (0.0)0.14Outcomes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ICU admission (%)42 (7.8)39 (9.7)3 (2.2)0.005ARDS (%)49 (9.1)46 (11.4)3 (2.2)0.001In-hospital mortality (%)4 (0.4)4 (0.5)0 (0.0)0.24Laboratory findings\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White blood cell count (\u00d7 109/L)4.6 (3.6\u20136.1)4.7 (3.6\u20136.2)4.6 (3.7\u20135.8)0.53Neutrophil count (\u00d7 109/L)2.9 (2.2\u20134.1)3.0 (2.1\u20134.2)2.9 (2.3\u20133.8)0.78Lymphocyte count (\u00d7 109/L)1.1 (0.8\u20131.6)1.1 (0.8\u20131.6)1.2 (0.9\u20131.6)0.96Hemoglobin (g/L)133 (121\u2013145)132 (121\u2013145)134 (123\u2013144)0.68Platelet count (\u00d7 109/L)190 (146\u2013247)188 (146\u2013246)194 (147\u2013248)0.77D-dimer (mg/L)0.3 (0.2\u20130.6)0.4 (0.2\u20130.6)0.3 (0.15\u20130.53)0.11Albumin (g/L)40.2 (36.2\u201343.7)39.8 (35.6\u201343.4)40.7 (37.7\u201344.4)0.74Globulin (g/L)25.9 (23.2\u201328.6)26.2 (22.9\u201329.0)25.7 (23.3\u201328.1)0.27Creatine kinase (U/L)68.7 (46.4\u2013109.1)69.5 (46.8\u2013109.3)65.8 (45.0\u2013109.1)0.34Prothrombin time (s)12.2 (11.1\u201312.9)12.2 (11.1\u201312.9)12.1 (11.1\u201312.8)0.77Alanine aminotransferase (IU/L)21.0 (14.9\u201330.6)21.0 (14.9\u201331.4)21.0 (14.7\u201329.6)0.32Aspartate aminotransferase (IU/L)24.0 (19.2\u201331.4)24.5 (19.6\u201331.3)23.4 (19.0\u201332.2)0.41Total bilirubin (umol/L)12.0 (7.7\u201318.5)12.0 (7.6\u201317.4)12.0 (8.8\u201321.1)0.13Creatinine (umol/L)62.7 (50.6\u201376.1)63.0 (50.6\u201377.0)59.5 (49.4\u201373.0)0.16Blood urea nitrogen (mmol/L)4.1 (3.2\u20135.1)4.1 (3.2\u20135.4)4.1 (3.3\u20134.6)0.29Open in a separate windowCOVID-19\u00a0=\u00a0coronavirus disease 2019, COPD\u00a0=\u00a0chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, N =\u00a0number of subjects, IQR\u00a0=\u00a0interquartile range, NIV\u00a0=\u00a0non-invasive ventilation, IMV\u00a0=\u00a0invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO\u00a0=\u00a0extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, CRRT\u00a0=\u00a0Continuous Renal Replacement Therapies, ICU\u00a0=\u00a0intensive care unit, ARDS\u00a0=\u00a0acute respiratory distress syndrome. a Includes COVID-19 subjects with initial symptoms respiratory, b includes COVID-19 subjects with initial symptoms non-respiratory, c p value for statistical difference between respiratory COVID-19 subject and non-respiratory COVID-19 subjects, d severity of disease on admission (mild/moderate/severe/very severe). e includes abidol, lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon, g includes gamma globulin or thymosin.

Univariate analysis showed several risk factors for developing ARDS, including age (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20131.07, P <\u00a00.001), comorbidities (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.13, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.74\u20139.61, P <\u00a00.001), secondary bacterial infection (OR\u00a0=\u00a050.2, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a021.7\u2013116.0, P <\u00a00.001), dry cough (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.7, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u20133.40, P =\u00a00.01), dyspnea (OR\u00a0=\u00a012.9, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a06.78\u201324.5, P =\u00a00.01), fever (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.86, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.79\u201319.2, P =\u00a00.003) and fatigue (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.27, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26\u20134.11, P =\u00a00.007).

While COVID-19 disease is known to range from asymptomatic disease to ARDS/death, there is limited data to identify where patients will fall on this disease continuum. Here, we demonstrate a COVID-19 population (non-respiratory COVID-19) that utilized fewer hospital resources, required no advanced respiratory support, and had quicker recovery. As the previous studies showed, the most common symptoms were dry cough and fever [9,10].Similarly, identifying patients (older patients), symptoms (dyspnea) at disease onset, and clinical developments (secondary bacterial infections) associated with ARDS development may help healthcare providers identify patients at the highest risk of clinical worsening. Here, our data demonstrate that subjects who reported dyspnea at disease onset were more likely to have worse outcomes. Interestingly, comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension, were not associated with ARDS development but instead likely reflect the increased comorbidity burden associated with aging and were not a contributor to ARDS development itself. Rather, alterations in airway epithelium and dysregulated immune responses associated with aging are more likely causative [11].Our study has strengths and limitations. The large, laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19 population (N\u00a0=\u00a0541) from eight COVID-19 designed hospitals improves the generalizability of our observations to regions and hospital systems that designate hospitals to care for COVID-19 patients, but the mortality is not as high as reported for the COVID-19 patients, in China; the mortality is less than 1% except for Wuhan [12], which may due to the lack of medical staff and personal protective equipment in Wuhan at the early stage of the disease outbreak, and as such, the finding in this study may not apply to regions with severe outbreaks, such as New York and Lombardy. This is a retrospective study, and some rare symptoms might not have been noted, but the common symptoms of COVID-19 were all recorded in the questionnaire designed by CDC. Finally, we did not obtain microbiological information and for secondary bacterial infection definition, we referred to the standards as Rotstein et al. [8] reported. Because the management of patient specimens was very strict according to the official documents in China during the COVID-19 outbreak, ordinary laboratories were not allowed to conduct microbiological study for COVID-19 patients.In conclusion, we identify COVID-19 subjects with dyspnea at disease onset who have a worse prognosis. We also demonstrate age and secondary bacterial infections to be independently associated with ARDS development in subjects with COVID-19.
