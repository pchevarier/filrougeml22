Therefore, it is recommended to adopt a parsimonious approach in the use of TTE, which should be carefully considered on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis and performed only if retained essential for patients care.6, 7\nThe role of TTE in risk stratification of patients admitted with COVID\u201019 has been poorly investigated. The aim of this multicentre study was to evaluate clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID\u201019 and to investigate the association between clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters with in\u2010hospital mortality. 2.\u2003METHODSThis is a multicentre retrospective observational study including consecutive patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID\u201019 admitted at seven Italian centres from 1 March to 22 April 2020.COVID\u201019 diagnosis was based on the World Health Organization criteria, and all cases were confirmed by real\u2010time reverse transcriptase\u2010polymerase chain reaction analysis of pharyngeal swab specimens.All patients included in this study were evaluated by the hospital cardiology service and underwent TTE within 48\u00a0hours from admission. To minimize the exposure to COVID\u201019, each referral for TTE was confirmed as clinically appropriate by one consultant cardiologist.8\nThis study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective design. Reporting of the study conforms to broad EQUATOR guidelines.9\n2.1. Measures and outcomeThe baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and TTE data were collected and recorded on an electronic datasheet. In all patients, demographic (age, gender, height, and weight), clinical (comorbidities, pharmacological therapy before and during hospitalization), laboratory (D\u2010dimer, N\u2010terminal pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide, and high\u2010sensitivity troponin) and echocardiographic data were collected. TTE was performed in accordance with the current guidelines.10 Echocardiographic analysis included the evaluation of left ventricular end\u2010diastolic (LVEDV) and end\u2010systolic volumes (LVESV). Left ventricular systolic function was assessed by determining left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) through biplane analysis using the modified Simpson's rule. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was derived from the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity using systolic trans\u2010tricuspid pressure gradient calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation and the addition of estimated right atrial pressure according to inferior vena cava dimension and inspiratory distensibility. Heart valve regurgitations were assessed using by the Color Doppler method.11 As a parameter of global right ventricular (RV) function, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), which reflects the base to apex shortening of the right ventricle in systole, was assessed. After adjusting the echo transducer at the level of the RV chamber to achieve optimal visualization of the RV, TAPSE was obtained by aligning the M\u2010mode linear cursor to the lateral tricuspid annulus and calculated as previously described.10\nInformation on clinical course (admission in intensive care unit and respiratory support measures) and in\u2010hospital complications were systematically recorded. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis was defined according to the Berlin definition.12 Acute myocardial injury was diagnosed in patients with elevated cardiac troponin levels with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.13\nThe number of patients who had died or recovered was recorded. No patient was still hospitalized at the time of the analysis (June 25, 2020). The occurrence of death during hospitalization was identified as the outcome measure of this study.2.2. Statistical analysisDistribution of continuous data was tested with the Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov and the Shapiro\u2010Wilk test. Normally distributed variables were expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation, whereas non\u2010normal ones as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were reported as numbers and percentages. Continuous normally distributed variables were compared by using the Student t test. Categorical variables were compared with chi\u2010squared test, or Fisher exact test when appropriate. Differences between non\u2010normally distributed variables were tested with Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Variables from different settings (ie clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic) were tested through univariable logistic regression to evaluate the association with mortality during hospitalization. To limit the risk of overfitting, only variables significantly associated (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) with mortality at univariable analysis were tested in the multivariable model, accounting for potential confounders and multicollinearity bias related to the interplay between them. The final regression model was built in a step\u2010down manner, by removing at each step the least significant predictors based on P values (backward elimination), reiterating this process until no nonsignificant variables remain. Variables were excluded from the regression model if showed significant collinearity, defined as a variance inflation factor >5 or a correlation coefficient >0.5. Variables describing in\u2010hospital treatments (eg drugs), interventions (eg respiratory support) and clinical setting (ICU, ward) were not tested in the model to avoid the introduction of unaccounted confounders related to the local protocol and patient's management in different centres. Results were presented as relative risk (RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). To test the statistical interaction between ARDS and TAPSE, an interaction term \u2018ARDS\u2019 * \u2018TAPSE\u2019 was entered into a separate regression model.A competing risk analysis for discharge free from death and in\u2010hospital mortality was performed and displayed using stacked cumulative incidence function area curves. The risk of in\u2010hospital mortality in the subgroups of interest was expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. LVEF >50% and TAPSE >17 normal cut\u2010off values were considered for subgroup definitions.10, 14\nFor all test, a P value\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed by using R version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 3.\u2003RESULTSA total of 1401 patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID\u201019 were admitted at the participating centres; in\u2010hospital mortality was reported in 181 cases (12.9%; CI: 11.1%\u201014.8%).Out of the entire population, 226 (16.1%) subjects underwent TTE within 48\u00a0hours from admission and were included in this analysis. In\u2010hospital death occurred in 68 cases (30.1%; CI: 24.2%\u201036.5%); 158 patients recovered and were discharged. The baseline demographic and clinical features of the study population at admission are summarized in Table\u00a01. The mean age was 68.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.9\u00a0years; male sex was reported in 141 patients (62.4%) and was significantly prevalent among patients who died during hospitalization as compared with those who recovered (75.0% vs 57.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016). At admission, the most common symptoms were dyspnoea (157, 69.5%), fever (153, 67.7%), and cough (87, 38.5%). Fatigue was reported in 77 patients (34.1%) and was prevalent in patients who underwent fatal outcome (47.1% vs 28.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.011).TABLE 1Demographic and clinical features at admissionOverall (N\u00a0=\u00a0226)Death (N\u00a0=\u00a068)Survival (N\u00a0=\u00a0158)\nP\nAge, years68.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.972.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.167.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3.012Males, N (%)141 (62.4)51 (75.0)90 (57.0).016Height, cm165.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3165.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0164.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4.508Weight, kg74.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.174.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.174.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.6.946Clinical presentationSymptoms onset to hospitalization, d (median [IQR])5.50 [2.25, 10.00]5.00 [2.00, 10.00]6.00 [3.00, 10.00].244Dyspnoea, N (%)157 (69.5)53 (77.9)104 (65.8).098Chest tightness, N (%)69 (30.5)27 (39.7)42 (26.6).071Fever, N (%)153 (67.7)52 (76.5)101 (63.9).090Cough, N (%)87 (38.5)26 (38.2)61 (38.6)1.000GI symptoms, N (%)30 (13.3)9 (13.2)21 (13.3)1.000Syncope, N (%)21 (9.3)5 (7.4)16 (10.1).683Medical historyHypertension, N (%)138 (61.1)48 (70.6)90 (57.0).075Diabetes, N (%)64 (28.3)23 (33.8)41 (25.9).296Dyslipidaemia, N (%)62 (30.8)18 (29.5)44 (31.4).916Smoking, N (%)42 (18.6)14 (20.6)28 (17.7).748CAD, N (%)37 (16.4)15 (22.1)22 (13.9).187Prior MI, N (%)35 (15.5)14 (20.6)21 (13.3).234Prior PCI, N (%)36 (15.9)14 (20.6)22 (13.9).290Prior CABG, N (%)13 (5.8)8 (11.8)5 (3.2).025HF, N (%)22 (9.7)11 (16.2)11 (7.0).058History of AF, N (%)46 (20.4)14 (20.6)32 (20.4)1.000History of VT, N (%)3 (1.3)2 (2.9)1 (0.6).449History of SVT, N (%)7 (3.1)1 (1.5)6 (3.8).612Prior stroke/TIA, N (%)18 (8.0)5 (7.4)13 (8.2)1.000COPD, N (%)46 (20.4)17 (25.0)29 (18.4).338CKD, N (%)45 (19.9)19 (27.9)26 (16.5).072Malignancy, N (%)27 (11.9)10 (14.7)17 (10.8).538Home pharmacotherapyACE inhibitors, N (%)61 (27.0)24 (35.3)37 (23.4).093ARBs, N (%)38 (16.8)10 (14.7)28 (17.7).717ASA, N (%)67 (29.6)27 (39.7)40 (25.3).044P2Y12 inhibitors, N (%)21 (9.3)8 (11.8)13 (8.2).555VKA, N (%)9 (4.0)4 (5.9)5 (3.2).557NOACs, N (%)33 (14.6)9 (13.2)24 (15.2).860Diuretics, N (%)47 (20.8)20 (29.4)27 (17.1).056Statins, N (%)71 (31.4)25 (36.8)46 (29.1).327Insulin, N (%)32 (14.2)12 (17.6)20 (12.7).436Open in a separate windowNoteContinuous normally distributed variables are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD.

History of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction and heart failure (HF) had higher prevalence in patients deceased during hospitalization, albeit not reaching statistical significance. Thirty\u2010six patients underwent prior percutaneous coronary intervention and 13 coronary artery bypass graft, which was significantly prevalent in the deceased cohort (11.8% vs 3.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.025).At admission, 99 patients (43.8%) were being treated with renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors with no difference between deceased vs survived patients; oral anticoagulation therapy was reported in 42 cases (18.6%).Main clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table\u00a02. Admission in intensive care unit was required for 72 patients (31.9%) and was higher in deceased patients as compared with those who recovered (67.6% vs 16.5%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The incidence of ARDS (83.8% vs 31.0%, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) as well as the need of oxygen therapy, noninvasive and invasive ventilatory support was higher in patients who underwent fatal outcome during the hospitalization.

This proportion of use of ultrasound may be considered consistent with the recommendations proposed by the leading societies of cardiovascular imaging intended to optimize sources and reduce the risk of contagion in this clinical setting.6, 7 The strict indication for TTE may contribute to explain the high proportion of comorbidities and in\u2010hospital complications observed in this study population. In fact, our patients showed a worse clinical profile, more need of intensive care, and a higher incidence of in\u2010hospital death, compared to previous study cohorts.17, 18\nMany authors reported a high risk of multiple and life\u2010threatening cardiovascular complications during the in\u2010hospital course of patients infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, acute myocardial injury, acute HF and ventricular arrhythmias.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 These cases need to be prioritized for focused cardiac ultrasound studies, which have been proposed as the most appropriate approach for minimizing the time of exposure with the patients and improve the safety of operators.6 Therefore, we collected conventional meaningful parameters of LV and RV function, valves and pericardium. Data on advanced TTE, such as speckle\u2010tracking echocardiography, were not systematically collected, probably because they are not easy to acquire routinely in patients infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (need for multiple views, ECG gating, adequate frame rate, multiple cardiac cycles cine loops).At multivariable analysis, LVEF, TAPSE and ARDS emerged as independent predictors of in\u2010hospital mortality. Our results were consistent with previous findings from Rath and colleagues, who reported that impaired LVEF and RV systolic function were associated with higher mortality in 123 patients with COVID\u201019.24\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction is a well\u2010established parameter for risk stratification both in the ward and in the intensive care unit, and still represent the most widely used parameter for the assessment of LV systolic function.10, 25, 26 In patient with reduced LVEF, COVID\u201019 could act like a precipitating factor and rapidly deteriorate the patients' clinical status. In fact, previous studies demonstrated the association of concomitant cardiac disease with outcome in patients infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.27\nAlthough SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 primarily affects the respiratory tract, it has also been associated with LV dysfunction in more serious cases.28 The pathophysiology of myocardial impairment has not yet definitely clarified, but either ischaemic or nonischaemic mechanisms have been hypothesized, including systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia\u2010induced cardiac injury, direct viral damage and adrenergic stimulation.29, 30 Indeed, the occurrence of myocardial damage demonstrated by increased cardiac troponin levels have been associated with in\u2010hospital mortality in patients with COVID\u201019.19 Moreover, in a Chinese cohort from Wuhan, acute HF and myocardial injury were significantly associated with death regardless of past medical history of cardiovascular diseases.31\nIndependently from the time of onset of LV dysfunction, this analysis suggests that LVEF at admission may be very useful to identify patients with higher probability of fatal outcome, and the reference normal value of 50% might be effectively employed also in this patient population.An extensive pulmonary interstitial involvement, thrombotic complications such as pulmonary embolism, and the use of high positive end\u2010expiratory pressures, are some of the mechanisms potentially involved in a RV impairment in patients with COVID\u201019.32, 33 In a cohort of 74 patients infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 assessed by TTE, the most common abnormalities were RV dilation and dysfunction.34 Moreover, Pagnesi et al35 showed that patients with RV dysfunction had a higher burden of cardiac pre\u2010existing comorbidities. In the present study, we found that the RV longitudinal shortening estimated by TAPSE was an independent predictor of mortality, and abnormal TAPSE values identified individuals with about five times greater risk of death during the hospitalization. According to the pathophysiology of the disease, RV function is essential to maintain a clinical balance and its evaluation during the progression of the infection may be crucial for the patient risk assessment.24, 36 This information could drastically influence their clinical management, especially in terms of diuretic therapy, ventilation strategies and specific anticoagulation regimens. A quick and easy parameter such as TAPSE is suitable for assessing RV function in these patients, especially for its rapid and real\u2010time feasibility in urgent and intensive care settings. Our results are also consistent with a recent multicentre study including 870 COVID\u201019 patients undergoing TTE during the acute phase, which identified LV longitudinal strain and RV free wall strain, two indices of left and right ventricular systolic function, respectively, as independently associated with 1\u2010year mortality.37\nIn this study population, we found a very high prevalence of ARDS. Consistently with previous data from Chinese cohorts, the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, was significantly increased in critically ill patients with ARDS compared to those with milder forms.38 The high proportion of ARDS might have contributed to the mortality rate observed, as the association between ARDS and fatal outcome in patients hospitalized for COVID\u201019 has been extensively described.39, 40\nAlthough limited by the retrospective nature of the study, our results point out the usefulness of TTE for risk stratification in COVID\u201019 patients. An accurate evaluation of both LV and RV function by echocardiography should be strongly considered in this setting, particularly in more critical and severe cases.41\nSome limitations of this observational retrospective study should be acknowledged. Although we reviewed all consecutive patients infected by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 hospitalized at different Italian institutions, TTE was performed in only one sixth of the entire patient population. The need of echocardiographic data restricted the analysis to 226 cases, who could not be representative of the entire COVID\u201019 population and may have affected the generalizability of our findings. The use of TTE in only a limited percentage of cases, which resulted to be particularly serious and at high risk of adverse events, may reflect the adherence to the current recommendation on the use of imaging modalities in patients with COVID\u201019, which circumscribe the adoption of TTE to more challenging cases.6, 8 Indeed, the high mortality rate observed in our study was consistent with previous echocardiography\u2010focused studies, which reported similarly high rates of mortality during the in\u2010hospital stay.34, 37\nIn this study, we did not include indexes of diastolic dysfunction as well as novel parameters from speckle tracking or other advanced echocardiographic techniques. The context of pandemic and the risk of infection for the operators make difficult to perform a lot of measures and may justify an approach based on few parameters quick to assess at bedside.Owing to the absence of TTE data before hospitalization, we cannot exclude the presence of patients with pre\u2010existent LV and/or RV impairment in this data set. However, our aim was not to investigate the prognostic role of new\u2010onset TTE abnormalities, but to explore the association between the presence of echocardiographic abnormalities at admission and in\u2010hospital course in patients with COVID\u201019. Therefore, the analysis was restricted to patients who underwent TTE within 48\u00a0hours from admission. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONSCardiovascular complications can negatively impact on outcomes of patients with COVID\u201019. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters such as LVEF \u226450%, TAPSE \u226417\u00a0mm, and ARDS might help to identify patients at higher risk for in\u2010hospital mortality. Our preliminary findings need to be confirmed in larger, prospective studies. CONFLICT OF INTERESTNo conflict of interest. Notes\nSilverio A, Di Maio M, Scudiero F, et al.
