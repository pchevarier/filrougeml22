A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop severe respiratory disease and may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation.2\u20134\nPatients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation typically fulfill the diagnostic criteria for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).5 Some authors pointed out that a substantial fraction of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia exhibit features quite atypical for ARDS. For example, gas exchange may be impaired out of proportion to mechanical abnormalities (\u201chappy hypoxia\u201d)6 and respiratory system compliance is relatively preserved.7 Gattinoni and colleagues have hypothesized 2 distinct phenotypes of lung failure in COVID-19: L-type with low elastance and H-type with high elastance.8 These peculiar features may affect treatment choices, such as levels of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or strategies for delivering lung-protective ventilation. More fundamentally, these characteristics offer clues to pathophysiology of lung failure in COVID-19 pneumonia and could point to new therapies.In our experience managing patients with COVID-19, we noticed another unusual feature: airflow obstruction was typically evident. Ventilator graphics display pressure and flow waveforms as a function of time, allowing for prompt recognition of this phenomenon. The typical findings of airflow obstruction, including elevated peak airway pressure, abnormal resistive pressure (peak minus plateau airway pressure, Presist), and an abnormal expiratory flow profile (low expiratory flow rate with flow persisting late in the expiratory phase, sometimes with evident end-expiratory flow) were present so often that we hypothesize that airflow obstruction is an integral part of COVID-19-related lung failure. Materials and MethodsEthicsThe project was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Waiver of informed consent was granted.Patient Selection, Setting, and Data AcquisitionAdult subjects with ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia ventilated in the medical ICU between April 19 and May 1, 2020 were prospectively identified during usual ICU care. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin criteria. All subjects were passively breathing on volume-control mode at the time of contact. A heat moisture exchange (HME) filter was used in all ventilator circuits. Ventilator settings and patient-ventilator interaction measurements were obtained and documented in the electronic health record (EHR), as were screenshots of ventilator waveforms. The following additional data were collected:Patient information including age, sex, virologic testing results including SARS-CoV2 and respiratory viral panel, duration of mechanical ventilation, body mass index (BMI), history of prior lung disease, smoking history and prior pulmonary function test results.Prone vs supine position.Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB).Ventilator information including settings (tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)), peak pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), total PEEP (PEEPtot), and ventilator graphics.\nInstitutional recommendations were consistent with evidence-based care for ARDS, including low tidal volume ventilation, maintenance of plateau pressures less than 30 cm H2O, driving pressure of 15 cm H2O or less, and conservative fluid therapy. Prone positioning was utilized for severe hypoxemia (e.g. ratio of partial pressure of oxygen on arterial blood gas to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) less than 150, or ratio of oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry to FiO2 (SaO2/FiO2) less than 180). NMB was initiated for significant patient-ventilator dyssynchrony. PEEP titration and other aspects of patient management were at the discretion of the ICU attending physician.Measurements and DefinitionsThe Pplat and PEEPtot were measured by performing manual inspiratory and expiratory hold maneuvers respectively for at least 0.4 seconds. Airway resistive pressure (Presist) was calculated as the difference between Ppeak and Pplat. Airway resistance was calculated as Ppeak minus Pplat divided by inspiratory flow rate. Driving pressure was calculated as Pplat minus PEEPtot. AutoPEEP was calculated as the difference between PEEPtot and set PEEP. Static respiratory system compliance (Cstat) was calculated as Vt divided by driving pressure.Statistical AnalysisQuantitative continuous variables were reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize clinical data. ResultsPatients, Clinical Characteristics, and Ventilator SettingsBetween April 19, 2020 and May 1, 2020, 21 patients were admitted to the medical ICU with ARDS due to COVID-19, 12 of whom were passively ventilated. Patient characteristics are reported in Table 1. The mean age was 58 and 50% (6/12) were men. Most of the subjects were non-smokers (8/12) and had no known history of pulmonary disease (10/12). The average duration between intubation and time of data collection was 1.7 days. Half (6/12) of the patients were receiving NMB at the time of data collection. All were ventilated in the supine position. None were receiving inhaled pulmonary vasodilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). One patient received inhaled bronchodilators in the 24 hours preceding data collection. No patients had significant secretions. No prior PFTs were available for any of the subjects.

All patients had increased airway resistance, illustrated by Ppeak and Presist that were significantly elevated at 42.3 [\u00b15.26] cm H2O and 18.8 [\u00b13.60] cm H2O respectively. Calculated airway resistance was markedly increased at 20.4 [\u00b14.13] cm H2O/L/sec. AutoPEEP was minimally elevated at 1 [\u00b11] cm H2O. Driving pressure was 9.92 [\u00b12.75] cm H2O. Static compliance of the respiratory system was 39.0 [\u00b115.6] ml/cm H2O. Examination of the ventilator waveforms, specifically expiratory flow curve, indicated the presence of airflow obstruction (Figures 1\n\u200b-\u200b-33).Table 3.Ventilator-Derived Indices of Airway Resistance and Respiratory System Compliance.Patient no.Ppeak (cm H2O)Pplat (cm H2O)AutoPEEP (cm H2O)*Presist (cm H2O)*Airway resistance (cmH2O/L/sec)*Driving pressure (cm H2O)*Cstat (ml/cmH2O)*Patient 1452512026.41030Patient 2442312122.21038Patient 3372401314.41230.83Patient 4341941516.8758.57Patient 5382141718576Patient 6432711616.21229.16Patient 75129\u201312223.41518.67Patient 8482402425.71946.67Patient 9402012022.86938.89Patient 104925124241229.17Patient 11382101717742.86Patient 12412501617.491129\nMean (\u00b1SD)\n\n42 (\u00b15)\n\n24 (\u00b13)\n\n1 (\u00b11)\n\n19 (\u00b14)\n\n20 (\u00b14)\n\n10 (\u00b13)\n\n39 (\u00b116)\nOpen in a separate windowAbbreviations: Cstat, static compliance; Ppeak, peak pressure; Pplat, plateau pressure; Presist, resistive pressure.*\u200aCalculation of indices: AutoPEEP = intrinsic PEEP \u2013 extrinsic PEEP; Presist = Ppeak\u2003\u2013 Pplat; airway resistance = (Ppeak \u2013 Presist)/flow rate; driving pressure = Pplat \u2013 intrinsic PEEP; Cstat = Vt/driving pressure.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Representative image of ventilator waveforms.

DiscussionIn mechanically ventilated patients, breath-by-breath measurement of pressure and flow allows characterization of the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, such as compliance and resistance. Such measurements revealed an unusual finding in our patients with COVID-19 ARDS: airways resistance was elevated in all subjects. This novel finding has not been previously reported to our knowledge. Airways resistance is modestly elevated in ARDS,9 but generally not to the degree seen in our patients.Our findings show that peak pressures were significantly elevated in all subjects. Further, this was from a combination of both decreased compliance leading to elevated plateau pressures, and increased resistance to airflow. The latter is indicated by the elevated Presist and airway resistance. While decreased compliance would be an expected finding in ARDS secondary to COVID-19, the elevated airway resistance to this degree is unusual and unexpected. Although there was individual variation in the magnitude of resistive indices, they were elevated in all subjects.There are several challenges which make interpretation of the results difficult\u2014most importantly, lack of a control group. Additionally, we considered the possibility that our findings were due to the effects of the ventilator circuit. We assessed whether the HME filter, used to filter viral particles, was responsible for the abnormal resistance. Older literature reported increased airway resistance with the use of filters in ventilator circuits, especially with high minute ventilation.10,11 The manufacturer of the filter we use (Intersurgical ltd, Inter-ThermTM range, model number: 1341031 S)12 claims that it adds a resistance of 2.7 cmH2O at a flow rate of 60 L/min. The mean flow rate for our subjects was 56 L/min, therefore only a small fraction of the resistive pressure we measured can be accounted for by the filter. Moreover, in one non-study subject, we briefly removed the HME filter to determine its impact, finding little change in Ppeak, Presist, or expiratory flow shape. We also conducted an experiment using the HME filter on a simulator (Michigan Instruments 5600i Dual Adult TTL Training/Test Lung) at 2 different flow rates and found that the filter added a resistance of 2 cmH2O/L/sec at any given flow. The endotracheal tube itself presents a resistive load, but this would be insufficient to explain resistance of sufficient magnitude.13 In our cohort of patients, the smallest size of endotracheal tube used was 7 millimeters (internal diameter). We assume that increased Presist reflects an increase in the Ohmic component of resistance rather than the viscoelastic fraction. We believe it unlikely that substantially increased viscoelastic resistance accounts for our findings since we used a rather brief (0.4 s) end-inspiratory pause. Given the complexity of patient-ventilator interactions, further confirmatory studies are needed to address the issue of airway resistance in patients ventilated with heated humidification systems.An alternative explanation to account for our finding of slowed expiratory flow is expiratory braking. The post-inspiratory complex, which controls the transition from inspiration to expiration, could act to limit expiratory flow, mimicking expiratory airflow obstruction.14,15 SARS-CoV-2 is a neurotropic virus and could impact the respiratory centers directly. We think this explanation is unlikely since it would not also explain the elevation in inspiratory Presist.Finally, the mean BMI of patients in our study is 35. Airways resistance is modestly elevated in obesity,16 but this cannot explain the degree of elevation in our patients, nor account for the presence of obstruction in all of them.We believe it is more likely that increased airways resistance is an intrinsic feature of severe COVID-19 lung disease. There is precedent for viral pneumonias to produce a resistive lesion, most notably with infection due to respiratory syncytial virus.17 The anatomic site of obstruction is uncertain, although some patients have increased bronchomotor tone. Others exhibit airflow obstruction due to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), webs of extracellular chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes in small airways, as has been seen in RSV and other pneumonias.18,19 Evidence for the presence of NETs in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with more severe disease, has been published. Further, serum from patients with COVID-19 triggers NET release from control neutrophils in vitro.20\nRadiographic surveys of patients with COVID-19 have identified airway abnormalities, including bronchial wall thickening.21 These findings are more evident in the most severely afflicted patients.22 Few autopsy studies have been published, but peribronchial lymphocytic accumulation, connective tissue within bronchioles, and granulocytic infiltration of bronchi have been described (in addition to other findings).23,24 Each of these provides a potential structural basis for the physiological findings we describe.Recognition of airflow obstruction in COVID-19 pneumonia has potential implications for therapy. Heliox lowers the resistive pressure where flow is turbulent,25\u201327 and can ameliorate respiratory distress in infants with RSV bronchiolitis.28 One case report describes successful treatment of airflow obstruction associated with coronavirus OC43 in a child with high-flow heliox administration.29 Heliox is most effective when the fraction of helium is high, but the modest degree of hypoxemia seen in many COVID-19 patients may allow its use. If NETs play a causal role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory failure, aerosolized dornase might bear consideration,30 as has been reported in other subtypes of ARDS.31 Bronchodilator use, preferably via in-line metered dose inhalers, could also be considered, especially when significant airflow obstruction interferes with ventilation (for example, when there is evidence of developing auto-PEEP). Recently, a case series showed excellent tolerability of nebulized in-line dornase and albuterol in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.32\nNot long after the initial description of ARDS, John Murray warned against lumping multiple diseases into one syndrome,33 thereby \u201cdetracting from important and distinctive differences in pathogenesis, therapy, and prognosis.\u201d Forty-five years later, and only months following Dr. Murray\u2019s death from COVID-19, his words ring true. ConclusionSevere respiratory failure due to COVID-19 is regularly associated with airflow obstruction. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of respiratory failure and suggests potential therapies.
