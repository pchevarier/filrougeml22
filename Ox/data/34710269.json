Objectives:                       To characterize platelet activation and determine if SARS-CoV-2 induces platelet activation.                  Patients/methods:                       We investigated platelet activation in 119 COVID-19 patients at admission in a university hospital in Milan, Italy, between March 18 and May 5, 2020. Sixty-nine subjects (36 healthy donors, 26 patients with coronary artery disease, coronary artery disease, and seven patients with sepsis) served as controls.                  Results:                       COVID-19 patients had activated platelets, as assessed by the expression and distribution of HMGB1 and von Willebrand factor, and by the accumulation of platelet-derived (plt) extracellular vesicles (EVs) and HMGB1+ plt-EVs in the plasma. P-selectin upregulation was not detectable on the platelet surface in a fraction of patients (55%) and the concentration of soluble P-selectin in the plasma was conversely increased. The plasma concentration of HMGB1+ plt-EVs of patients at hospital admission remained in a multivariate analysis an independent predictor of the clinical outcome, as assessed using a 6-point ordinal scale (from 1 = discharged to 6 = death). Platelets interacting in vitro with SARS-CoV-2 underwent activation, which was replicated using SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-viral particles and purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunits. Human platelets express CD147, a putative coreceptor for SARS-CoV-2, and Spike-dependent platelet activation, aggregation and granule release, release of soluble P-selectin and HMGB1+ plt-EVs abated in the presence of anti-CD147 antibodies.

These events contribute to organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n and thrombocytopenia. The main function of platelets is indeed hemostatic. They patrol the vasculature and guard its integrity, undergoing activation in response to damaged endothelia. Moreover, platelets express surface receptors that directly interact with microbes\n4\n and contribute to the host response at various levels, via the release of microbicidal agents from granules and via the recruitment of cellular and humoral innate immunity. Megakaryocytes and platelets are a preferential target of selected microbes, flaviviruses in particular,\n5\n and thrombocytopenia is common in acute viral infections.A decrease in platelet counts, more frequent in patients with worse clinical outcomes, has been described in COVID\u201019.\n6\n, \n7\n However, platelet counts per se may not be sufficiently informative in an ongoing infection, as thrombocytopenia may reflect a decrease in platelet production in the bone marrow, an increase in peripheral destruction and clearance of platelets or a combination of the two events. Conversely, platelet activation could result in the generation of bioactive extracellular vesicles (EVs) that reach distant sites through the circulatory system and perpetuate damage and inflammation in various organs, including the lung.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n Recently, platelet activation in patients with COVID\u201019\u00a0has been independently described in various cohorts.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n Differential gene expression profile of platelets of COVID\u201019 patients was associated with enhanced ability to aggregate and to form aggregates with leukocytes\n11\n and platelet activation was prominent in patients with severe disease.\n12\n, \n14\n Additionally, a major platelet response to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0has recently been described, which included massive release of granule content, generation of microparticles, and eventual death by apoptosis or necroptosis.\n16\n ACE2, the only primary receptor identified so far, appears to be dispensable for the interaction between platelets and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n Here, we have identified platelet\u2010derived extracellular vesicles expressing the DAMP, HMGB1 as surrogate markers of platelet activation that predict the outcome of COVID\u201019, and the CD147 receptor as a critical player in the activation of host platelets following interaction with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. 2.\u2003PATIENTS AND METHODS2.1. PatientsPatients \u226518\u00a0years old diagnosed with COVID\u201019 at the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, a 1350\u2010bed tertiary care University Hospital in Milan, Italy, between March 18 and May 5, 2020, were enrolled. All patients belonged to the COVID\u201019 San Raffaele clinical\u2010biological cohort (Covid\u2010BioB, ClinicalTrials.gov {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04318366\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04318366\"}}NCT04318366). The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and obtained ethical approval from the institutional review board (protocol number 34/int/2020). Written informed consent was obtained by all patients.

Data collected from chart review and patient interview were entered in a dedicated electronic case record form. Twenty\u2010six patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), seven patients with severe sepsis, and 36\u00a0healthy donors served as controls (Table\u00a01).TABLE 1Demographic characteristics and main clinical and laboratory findings of patients at time of blood samplingCOVID\u201019 patientsSepsisHDCADN11973626Age (years), median (IQR)60 (50\u201372)79 (67\u201382) *58 (51\u201369)62 (57\u201369)Female, n (%)50 (42)5 (71.4)19 (52.8)3 (11.5)BMI (kg/cm2), median (IQR)27 (25\u201330)\u201024 (23\u201325) *26 (24\u201329)ComorbiditiesHTN, n (%)41 (34.5)2 (28.6)0***18 (69.2)**CAD, n (%)10 (8.4)3 (42.9)*026 (100)***DM, n (%)18 (15.1)3 (42.9)0*2 (7.7)COPD, n (%)6 (5.0)2 (28.6)00CKD, n (%)8 (6.7)000Neoplasia, n (%)7 (5.9)000Autoimmune disease, n (%)9 (7.6)1 (14.3)00Treatment at time of samplingLMWH, n (%)20 (16.8)\u2010\u2010\u2010Hydroxychloroquine, n (%)42 (35.3)\u2010\u2010\u2010Aspirin, n (%)26 (21.8)3 (42.9)0**23 (88.5)***At admission\u2010\u2010PaO2/FiO2, median (IQR)305 (231\u2013357)\u2010\u2010\u2010ARDS, n (%)47 (39.5)2 (28.6)\u2010\u2010Platelet count (\u00d7103/\u00b5l), median (IQR)215 (171\u2013283)96 (35\u2013165)***180 (163\u2013230)217 (178\u2013234)CRP (mg/dl), median (IQR)57 (17\u2013138)220 (141\u2013277)**\u2010\u2010LDH (U/L), median (IQR)331 (247\u2013437)723 (348\u2013854)**\u2010\u2010D\u2010dimer (\u00b5g/ml), median (IQR)0.9 (0.5\u20131.9)12 (9.0\u201325.0)***\u2010\u2010HospitalizationHospitalized, n (%)97 (81.5)7 (100)\u2010\u2010Length of stay (days)\u2021, median (IQR)10 (5\u201322)15 (5\u201320)\u2010\u2010Transfer to ICU, n (%)13 (10.9)5 (71.4)***\u2010\u2010Death, n (%)23 (19.3)3 (42.9)\u2010\u2010Open in a separate windowNote*p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.

PGE1, thrombin receptor agonist peptide\u20106 (TRAP\u20106), and thrombin were obtained from Sigma (Italy). mAbs against CD147\u00a0clone HIM6 (Santa Cruz) was used for flow cytometry and clone 8D6 (GeneTex) in blocking experiments. Polyclonal blocking Abs against ACE2 was from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal Abs against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0Nucleoprotein Antibody (40143\u2010R019) and against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike antibody (40150\u2010R007) were obtained from Sino Biological (Italy). Recombinant SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike protein full\u2010length S1\u00a0subunit (aa Val16\u2010Gln690) (230\u201301101), the Arg319\u2010Phe541 S1\u00a0subunit fragment (230\u201320405), and the appropriate negative control (i.e., the culture supernatant of cells transfected with the empty expression vector) (230\u201320001) were from RayBiotech. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles (#MBS434275), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pseudoviral particles, 614G (#MBS434278), and negative control pseudoviral particles (#MBS434280) were from MyBiosource. Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008; clone E6\u2010CRL\u20101586) were from American Type Culture Collection (Italy). QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit was obtained from Qiagen. SuperScript First\u2010Strand Synthesis System, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and goat anti\u2010rabbit antibody Alexa Fluor 488 (A\u201011008) were from Thermo Fisher (Italy). ELISA kit for soluble P\u2010selectin was obtained from Invitrogen (Italy).2.3. Blood sampling and platelet analysisVenous blood were immediately fixed, stored at 4\u00b0C and platelet activation markers (P\u2010selectin, HMGB1, and von Willebrand factor [VWF] expression) were analyzed on a daily aligned Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Milan, Italy).\n9\n, \n10\n, \n19\n Quantification of platelet\u2010derived EVs (plt\u2010EVs) and assessment of HMGB1 expression were performed in platelet\u2010free plasma, as previously described.\n9\n, \n10\n The gating strategy is depicted in Figure\u00a01A, H.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Platelet activation in patients with COVID\u201019. Whole blood (A\u2010G) and platelet\u2010free plasma (H\u2010M) of COVID\u201019 patients, patients with severe sepsis, sex\u2010 and age\u2010 matched healthy donors, and sex\u2010 and age\u2010matched patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were analyzed. Platelets and platelet\u2010derived extracellular vesicles (plt\u2010EVs) were identified in the blood within the CD61+ population (threshold of acquisition) by their side scatter (y axis) and forward scatter (x axis) characteristics (A, gating strategy). Plt\u2010EVs were identified within the CD61+ population in platelet\u2010free plasma (H, gating strategy). Representative dot plots of a healthy donor and a patient with COVID\u201019 are shown A and H). Panels B\u2010D depict the fraction of platelets expressing P\u2010selectin, expressing HMGB1 and the fraction of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs respectively. P\u2010sellow and P\u2010selhigh platelets were identified as those with a percentage of activated platelets within or higher than the confidential range observed in healthy donors. High or low P\u2010selectin expression is independent of the fraction of HMGB1+ platelets (F) or HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs (G). In contrast, the plasma concentration of soluble P\u2010selectin was significantly higher in patients with P\u2010sellow platelets (I) and correlated with platelet P\u2010selectin surface expression (J). The concentration of plt\u2010EVs and of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs were both significantly higher in patients with COVID\u201019 than in healthy volunteers or patients with CAD (K, L) and was independent of P\u2010selectin expression (M). Symbols depict individual observations in each subject and whiskies median, minimum, and maximum values. Statistical differences were determined by Kruskal\u2010Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test.2.4. Cells and virusVero E6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, Hepes buffer, and 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS). A clinical isolate of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (hCoV\u201019/Italy/UniSR1/2020; GISAID accession n. EPI_ISL_413489) was obtained and propagated in Vero E6 cells.2.5. PlateletsVenous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers who had not received any pharmacological treatment in the previous 10\u00a0days. Venous blood was drawn through a 19\u2010gauge butterfly needle. After discarding the first 3\u20135\u00a0ml, blood was carefully collected in tubes containing Na2EDTA. Samples were centrifuged at 150g, 10\u00a0min at 20\u00b0C, to obtain platelet\u2010rich plasma (PRP) to be used to isolate platelets as described.\n9\n, \n10\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n Briefly, the upper 2/3 of PRP was recovered and PGE1 (2.5\u00a0\u00b5M) was added before centrifugation at 800g for 15\u00a0min at 18\u00b0 C (without break). Platelet pellets were washed twice with Hepes Tyrode buffer (129\u00a0mmol/L NaCl, 9.9\u00a0mmol/L NaHCO3, 2.8 mmol/L KCl, 0.8\u00a0mmol/L KH2PO4, 5.6\u00a0mmol/L dextrose, 10\u00a0mmol/L HEPES, MgCl2 1 mM, pH 7.4) containing Na EDTA (5\u00a0mM) and in the first wash PGE1 (2.5\u00a0\u00b5M) and resuspended with Hepes Tyrode buffer containing CaCl2 (1\u00a0mM). Platelets were counted with an automated blood cell counter (Sysmex). Contaminating leukocytes were consistently absent. The purity of the platelet preparations was routinely confirmed by flow cytometry using anti\u2010CD45 and anti\u2010CD61\u00a0mAbs (<1 CD45+ event out of 107 CD61+ events).2.6. \nIn\nvitro platelet response to SARS\u2010COV\u20102Platelets were stimulated with TRAP\u20106 (25\u00a0\u00b5M) or thrombin (0.5\u00a0U/ml) as positive controls. Purified platelets (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/\u00b5l) from three healthy donors were incubated (1:1) for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in static conditions with clarified supernatants of Vero E6 cells (Vero C1008; clone E6\u2013CRL\u20101586; American Type Culture Collection) infected with a SARS\u2010COV\u20102\u00a0clinical isolate (hCoV\u201019/Italy/UniSR1/2020; GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_413489) (3 \u00d7 106 50% tissue culture infective dose). The supernatant of uninfected Vero E6 cells was used as negative control. To determine platelet activation, samples were immediately fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. To assess the virus platelet interaction, after centrifugation to remove unbound virus, platelets were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline\u2010EDTA and resuspended in complete medium supplemented with 2% FBS. At 24 and 48\u00a0h after infection, the platelets were centrifuged. The pellet was fixed using PFA, whereas the supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Platelets were incubated with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 614D pseudoviral particles (PP), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 614G PP or negative control PP (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/\u00b5l, 1:1 platelet: PP ratio) for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in static conditions. Recombinant SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike protein S1\u00a0subunit (Val16\u2010Gln690) or the Spike S1\u00a0subunit fragment (Arg319\u2010Phe541) were used at a final concentration of 30\u00a0ng/\u00b5l. When indicated. platelets were challenged with the previous stimuli in the presence of an irrelevant antibody, of mAbs against CD147, or against ACE2, fixed with Thrombofix and analyzed by flow cytometry. The concentration of soluble P\u2010selectin was assessed by ELISA in supernatants that had been cleared by centrifugation at 10,000g for 3\u00a0min. Experiments were performed 3\u20136 times with different donors.2.7. Electron microscopyPlatelets were isolated and stimulated as described previously and fixed in two\u00a0steps: first with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 125\u00a0mM cacodylate buffer at 4\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min and then with 2% OsO4 in 125\u00a0mM cacodylate buffer for 1\u00a0h. Samples were then washed, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon. Conventional thin sections were collected on uncoated grids, stained with uranil and lead citrate, and examined on a Leo912 electron microscope.2.8. Platelet aggregation and dense granules releasePlatelet aggregation and dense granule release assays were performed by Lumi\u2010aggregometry (Chrono\u2010Log, Mascia Brunelli, Milan).\n22\n PRP samples were challenged with recombinant SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike protein S1\u00a0subunit (Val16\u2010Gln690) or with the Spike S1\u00a0subunit Arg319\u2010Phe541 fragment at a final concentration of 30\u00a0ng/\u00b5l each. When indicated, challenge with the previous stimuli or with the platelet agonist, TRAP\u20106 was carried out in the presence of an irrelevant antibody, of mAbs against CD147 or of mAbs against ACE2 (Table\u00a0S1).2.9. Infectivity assay and virus back titrationVero E6 cells (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105/well) were seeded into 96\u201396 good plates and infected with base 10 dilutions of the supernatants. After 1\u00a0h of adsorption at 37\u00b0C, the cell\u2010free virus was removed by centrifugation, and complete medium supplemented with 2% FBS was added to cells. After 72\u00a0h, cytopathic effect (CPE) was assessed using a scoring system (0\u00a0=\u00a0uninfected; 0.5\u20132.5\u00a0=\u00a0increasing number/area of plaques; 3\u00a0=\u00a0all cells infected). Infection control (score 3) was set as 100% infection, uninfected cells (score 0) as 0% infection. The whole surface of the wells was considered for the analysis (5\u00d7 magnification). All conditions were tested in triplicate. To verify the infectivity of the viral stock and the binding of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to platelets, end\u2010point dilution (median tissue culture infective dose per milliliter) assays was performed using the unbound virus.2.10. Viral RNA extraction and quantitative RT\u2010PCRThe viral RNA was purified from 50\u00a0\u00b5l of cell\u2010free culture supernatant (previously inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min), using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The purified RNA was subsequently used to perform the synthesis of first\u2010strand complementary DNA, using the SuperScript First\u2010Strand Synthesis System for RT\u2010PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer's instructions. RT\u2010PCR was performed to detect the complementary DNA. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix with the forward primer N2F (TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA), the reverse primer N2R (GCG CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA) were used, at the following PCR conditions: 95\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 20\u00a0s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, followed by a final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. RT\u2010PCR was performed using the ABI\u2010PRISM 7900HT Fast Real Time instrument (Applied Biosystems) and optical\u2010grade 96\u2010well plates. Samples were run in duplicate, with a total volume of 20\u00a0\u00b5l.2.11. Nucleic acid extraction, cDNA synthesis, and detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0subgenomic mRNAThe nucleic acid extraction, cDNA synthesis, and detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0subgenomic mRNA were performed by adapting described protocols.\n23\n Briefly, 24\u00a0h after virus inoculation, platelets were collected and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. Nucleic acids were extracted using Trizol following the manufacturer's instructions and purified RNA was reverse\u2010transcribed by using SuperScript IV and a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0specific primer (WHSA\u201029950R: 5\u2032 \u2010TCTCCTAAGAAGCTATTAAAAT\u20103\u2032 ). The amplification was performed using Platinum Taq Polymerase with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0specific primer (WHSA\u20100025F: 5\u2032\u2010CCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTA\u20103\u2032 and WHSA\u201029925R: 5\u2032\u2010ATGGGGATAGCACTACTAAAATTA\u20103\u2032). The PCR products were then analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Experiments were performed using platelets derived from three to five independent donors in duplicate. Platelets derived from the same donors not exposed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0served as a negative control.2.12. ImmunofluorescenceFixed platelets were introduced to Shandon Cytospin II (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), permeabilized with Triton X\u2010100 (0.5%) and stained with anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0Nucleoprotein Antibody (40143\u2010R019, Sino Biological) or anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike Antibody (40150\u2010R007, Sino Biological). A goat anti\u2010rabbit antibody Alexa Fluor 488 (A\u201011008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as second step reagent.2.13. StatisticsDichotomous variables were expressed as absolute frequencies (percentages), and continuous variables as medians (interquartile range). When indicated, continuous variables were expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Comparisons for categorical variables between groups were performed using the chi\u2010squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Kruskal\u2010Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test or Mann\u2010Whitney U was used to compare continuous variables between groups. Length of stay was calculated as the time from hospital admission to death, discharge, or time of statistical analysis for still hospitalized patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to Berlin definition.\n24\n The previously described\n25\n 6\u2010point ordinal scale for clinical status was used as a marker of COVID\u201019\u00a0severity. The worst category reached from hospital admission to discharge or death of the 6\u2010point scale was used as the primary outcome.\n26\n Univariate and multivariate log\u2010linear Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of individual variables on the primary outcome. Variables that emerged as significant (with a p value <\u00a00.01) predictors of the primary outcome at univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Missing data were not imputed. For the virus/platelet interactions, CPE observed were normalized to corresponding virus infection control. Quantitative RT\u2010PCR results were analyzed using cycle threshold values obtained for experimental settings. Then, two\u2010way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test or Sidak's multiple comparisons test were performed for the evaluation of CPE scoring and cycle threshold differences, respectively (GraphPad Prism 8). R statistical package (version 4.0.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used, with a two\u2010sided significance level set at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Widespread activation of platelets in the blood of COVID\u201019 patientsBlood was retrieved from 119 patients with COVID\u201019 admitted at the emergency department of a university hospital in Milan, Italy, between March 18 and May 5, 2020. To assess markers of platelet activation, samples were immediately fixed and analyzed. Table\u00a01\u00a0summarizes the main clinical and laboratory features of patients and controls. Compared with control populations, such as healthy subjects and patients with CAD, platelets of COVID\u201019 patients expressed significantly higher levels of P\u2010selectin (Figure\u00a01B) and of the prototype endogenous inflammatory signal, HMGB1 (Figure\u00a01C), markers that reflect platelet activation regardless of the original stimulus (Table\u00a0S2). After activation, platelets generate and release EVs (Table\u00a0S2).Plt\u2010EVs accumulated in the plasma of patients with COVID\u201019. Plt\u2010EVs and the fraction of plt\u2010EVs expressing HMGB1, which play a direct role in pulmonary microvascular activation and inflammation,\n9\n, \n10\n were significantly more concentrated in the blood of COVID\u201019 patients than in the blood of control subjects (Figure\u00a01D, M). Therefore, three independent markers, which are associated with platelet activation in patients with sepsis (Figure\u00a01B\u2010D), revealed platelet activation in the blood of COVID\u201019 patients.Of interest, P\u2010selectin expression was bimodal and 53 (45%) patients had a level of P\u2010selectin on activated platelets similar to that of controls (Figure\u00a01, E) regardless of the fact that they quantitatively expressed high levels of HMGB1 and had high levels of plt\u2010EVs expressing HMGB1 (Figure\u00a01E,G,M). This feature could be specific for COVID\u201019 because activated platelets expressing low levels of P\u2010selectin were not detectable in patients with severe sepsis (Figure\u00a01E), a condition in which different pathways are involved in platelet activation.Defective release of the content of \u03b1 granules, where P\u2010selectin is stored in platelets at rest, or accelerated shedding of P\u2010selectin could contribute. The first event is unlikely, as other \u03b1 granule components such as VWF were depleted in platelets of COVID\u201019 patients regardless of the extent of P\u2010selectin membrane expression (Table\u00a02). In support of the second mechanism, various proteases cleave P\u2010selectin, which is for example released as a soluble molecule from activated platelets.\n27\n, \n28\n In agreement, the concentration of soluble P\u2010selectin was significantly higher in the plasma of patients with activated platelets expressing low levels of P\u2010selectin (Figure\u00a01I,J).TABLE 2Characteristics on sampling of patients with different expression of platelet P\u2010selectinCOVID\u201019 patientsSepsisHDCADP\u2010selectinlow\nP\u2010selectinhigh\nN536673626Platelet VWF content, mean \u00b1 SD326.0 \u00b1 15.9330.0 \u00b1 5.9396.4 \u00b1 130.9585.0 \u00b1 50.0543.1 \u00b1 51.6Age (years), median (IQR)62 (53\u201376)58 (49\u201368)79 (67\u201382)54 (47\u201359)62 (57\u201369)Female, n (%)22 (41.5)28 (42.4)5 (71.4)19 (52.8)3 (11.5)BMI (kg/cm2), median (IQR)26 (25\u201330)28 (25\u201331)\u201024 (23\u201325)26 (24\u201329)ComorbiditiesHTN, n (%)22 (41.5)19 (28.8)2 (28.6)018 (69.2)CAD, n (%)6 (11.3)4 (6.1)3 (42.9)026 (100)DM, n (%)11 (20.8)7 (10.6)3 (42.9)02 (7.7)COPD, n (%)4 (7.5)2 (3.0)2 (28.6)00CKD, n (%)5 (9.4)3 (4.5)000Active neoplasia, n (%)4 (7.5)3 (4.5)000Autoimmune disease, n (%)6 (11.3)3 (4.5)1 (14.3)00Treatment at time of samplingLMWH, n (%)8 (15.1)12 (18.2)0\u2010\u2010Hydroxychloroquine, n (%)16 (30.2)26 (39.4)0\u2010\u2010Aspirin, n (%)14 (26.4)12 (18.2)3 (43)023 (88.5)At admissionPaO2/FiO2, median (IQR)302 (168\u2013394)308 (234\u2013346)\u2010\u2010\u2010ARDS at admission, n (%)20 (30.7)27 (40.9)1 (14.3)\u2010\u2010Platelet count (\u00d7103/\u00b5l),median (IQR)198 (162\u2013241)230 (181\u2013316) *\u202096 (35\u2013165)180 (163\u2013230)217 (178\u2013234)CRP (mg/dL), median (IQR)49 (17\u2013155)58 (18\u2013132)220 (141\u2013277)\u2010\u2010LDH (U/L), median (IQR)344 (241\u2013479)317 (256\u2013415)723 (348\u2013854)\u2010\u2010D\u2010dimer (\u00b5g/ml), median (IQR)1.1 (0.5\u20133.2)0.7 (0.4\u20131.6)12 (9.0\u201325.0)\u2010\u2010HospitalizationHospitalized, n (%)41 (77.4)56 (84.8)7 (100)Length of stay (days)\n\na\n\n, \n*\n\nmedian (IQR)10 (5\u201330)11 (5\u201321)15 (5\u201320)\u2010\u2010Transfer to ICU, n (%)7 (13.2)6 (9.1)5 (71.4)\u2010\u2010Death, n (%)12 (22.6)11 (16.7)3 (42.9)\u2010\u2010Open in a separate windowARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BMI, body mass index; CAD, coronary artery disease; CKD, chronic kidney disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRP, C\u2010reactive protein; DM, diabetes mellitus; HD, healthy donors; HTN, arterial hypertension; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LMWH, low\u2010molecular weight heparin; PaO2/FiO2, arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen; VWF, von Willebrand factor.\na\nCalculated as the time from hospital admission to death: discharge or time of statistical analysis for still hospitalized patients.\nb\nCompared with P\u2010selectin low COVID\u201019 patients. von Willebrand factor (VWF) was expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of arbitrary units of mean fluorescence intensity.*\np\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, ***p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs concentration was significantly correlated with that of CRP (Figure\u00a02A), D\u2010dimer (Figure\u00a02B), with the extent of hypoxia (Figure\u00a02C), and with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Figure\u00a02D). Moreover, they were at admission more abundant in the plasma of patients that eventually developed ARDS (Figure\u00a02E). To verify whether HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs level at hospital admission could inform on the eventual clinical course, we relied on an ordinal scale that measures the severity of COVID\u201019 over time, considering the worst category reached by each patient. The concentration of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs, but not the concentration of plt\u2010EVs per se, emerged as a strong predictor of clinical outcome on univariate analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Table\u00a03, Figure\u00a02F) along with age, comorbidities, extent of hypoxia and concentrations of CRP, LDH, and D\u2010dimer at hospital admission (Table\u00a03). When adjusted for the previously mentioned predictors, the concentration of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs survived as independent predictor of the clinical outcome on multivariate analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Table\u00a03 and Figure\u00a02F).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs concentration is associated with COVID\u201019\u00a0severity and predicts clinical outcomes.

SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 activates human plateletsWe combined SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and human platelets (106/\u00b5l) for an hour at 37\u00b0C. Platelets challenged with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 underwent activation, as demonstrated by HMGB1 expression, generation of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs, depletion of platelet VWF (Figure\u00a03A). Electron microscopy confirmed the activation of platelets, which acquired an approximately spherical shape and lost \u03b1 and dense granules. This was associated with the fusion of the open canalicular and dense tubular systems, the centralization of the organelles and the peripheral arrangement of the mitochondria (Figure\u00a03B). Platelet activation was replicated using pseudoviral particles (PP) expressing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Spike protein (Figure\u00a03B). Platelets were activated to a similar extent by Spike expressing pseudovirions, by the full\u2010length Spike S1\u00a0subunit protein (Val16\u2010Gln690) or by the S1 fragment containing the receptor\u2010binding domain (Arg319\u2010Phe541). Recombinant S1 proteins also effectively induced platelet aggregation and release reaction, with a lag\u2010time of approximatively 5\u00a0min (5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0min for Spike S1\u00a0Val16\u2010Glu690 and 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0min for Spike S1 Arg319\u2010Phe541) (Figure\u00a03C and Figure\u00a04B).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 activates platelets.

Representative traces and quantification of maximal aggregation and ATP release are reported (B). Activation of platelets, as reflected by platelet HMGB1 expression, the concentration of released HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs, the VWF platelet content, the P\u2010selectin expression and by the concentration of released soluble P\u2010selectin were assessed after challenge with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 614D pseudoviral particles (PP), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 614G PP, Spike S1\u00a0Val16\u2010Glu690, or Spike S1 Arg319\u2010Phe541 recombinant proteins for 1\u00a0hr in the presence of irrelevant Abs (irr ab), of anti\u2010CD147 or anti\u2010ACE2 Abs. #\np\u00a0<\u00a00.001, significantly different from platelets stimulated in the presence of irrelevant Abs or of anti\u2010ACE2 Abs, determined by Kruskal\u2010Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test.The time course of HMGB1 expression and of HMGB1+ Plt\u2010EVs release indicates that full platelet response occurs after 60\u00a0min (Figure\u00a03D). The kinetics of P\u2010selectin expression is different because it increases in the first phase of the incubation to subsequently abate (Figure\u00a03D), a pattern that might be compatible with eventual shedding of the molecule. In support, platelets challenged with purified SARS\u2010COV\u20102 expressed relatively low amounts of P\u2010selectin on the plasma membrane after 60\u00a0min, but soluble P\u2010selectin accumulated at that time in the extracellular environment (Figure\u00a03A).ACE2, the best characterized receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, is expressed in a fraction of human platelets only (2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5% in platelets at rest, 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6% in activated platelets, Figure\u00a04A). CD147, a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 putative coreceptor,\n26\n is constitutively expressed on a large fraction of platelets from healthy donors (60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.5% in platelets at rest, 71.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.1% in activated platelets, Figure\u00a04A). Platelet activation induced by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 PPs or Spike S1 recombinant proteins, assessed by measuring platelet expression of HMGB1, release of EVs and depletion of VWF, aggregation and release reaction abated in the presence of antibodies blocking the CD147 receptor, while antibodies that block ACE2 were ineffective (Figure\u00a04,B, C). The effect was specific, since CD147 blockade did not influence TRAP\u20106\u2010elicited platelet activation (Table\u00a0S1). The fraction of platelets expressing P\u2010selectin in this system did not reflect the extent of activation in response to viral stimuli, despite the effective depletion of the alpha granules reflected by the VWF content. This discrepancy was probably due to the release of the soluble molecule into the environment. In agreement, the concentration of soluble P selectin in the supernatant of Spike\u2010stimulated platelets was increased (Figure\u00a04C). This event was significantly inhibited by blocking the CD147 receptor (Figure\u00a04C).3.3. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 does not replicate in human plateletsThe interaction between the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 protein Spike and platelets suggests the possibility that the virus infects them, even if we did not detect virus\u2010like particles within platelets exposed to virus at analysis by electron microscopy (Figure\u00a03B). Back\u2010titration assays of unbound virus, performed by infecting Vero E6 cells with supernatants retrieved after 1h of coincubation of platelets with a definite amount of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, revealed that unbound virus titers were significantly lower compared to virus control, supporting the physical interaction of the virus with the platelets (Figure\u00a05A). To assess the possible replication of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, platelets were washed after virus adsorption and incubated up to 48\u00a0h. Supernatants were collected and assessed for their ability to infect Vero E6 cells. Low levels of infectious virions were detected at 24\u00a0h and no infection of Vero E6 cells was revealed at 48\u00a0h (Figure\u00a05B). Virus\u2010specific RT\u2010PCR analysis revealed increased cycle threshold values at 48\u00a0h compared with 24\u00a0h, thus underlining that no increase of viral RNA occurs during virus/platelets coincubation (Figure\u00a05C). The subgenomic mRNA of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was evaluated 24\u00a0h after challenge. The PCR products of agarose gel electrophoresis of the platelets exposed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 revealed a single band of approximately 1200\u00a0bp, corresponding to the length of the nucleoprotein transcript (Figure\u00a05D). Sanger sequencing analysis confirmed that the PCR products correspond to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u00a0N. The results confirm that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 enters platelets. However, no viral progeny was detected, as reflected by the lack of other subgenomic mRNAs, thus confirming the absence of productive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection on platelets in these experimental conditions (Figure\u00a05E).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 interacts with but does not productively infect platelets.

They vastly outnumber leukocytes in the blood and constantly patrol the vasculature for the integrity of the endothelial layer and the presence of infectious agents. Platelets express receptors specialized in microbe recognition.\n29\n Some of these receptors have been implicated in the recognition and interaction of platelets with viruses they encounter in the circulation, including DC\u2010SIGN, platelet glycoprotein VI, and C\u2010type lectin\u2010like receptor 2 CLEC\u20102, GPVI.\n5\n\nThe cause of the activation of platelets in vivo in patients with COVID\u201019\u00a0remains to be determined. The generation of thrombin associated to the coagulopathy, the production of cytokines and the activation of endothelial linings, in particular at the level of the lung microvasculature\n30\n could all play a role. The results of this study suggest that platelets interact and undergo activation when challenged with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, even if they are not productively infected by the virus. Such an interaction could contribute to the vast activation of platelets found by us and others in patients with COVID\u201019.\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n31\n\nThe best characterized receptor for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is the ACE2, which is required for the infection of most nucleated cells. However, the extent of the expression and the physiological relevance of ACE2 in human platelets are controversial.\n11\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n32\n CD147, a receptor constitutively expressed on a large fraction of human platelets, has been described as a coreceptor involved in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection of epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.\n26\n However, other groups failed to identify a direct role of CD147 in Spike\u2010mediated infection of epithelial cells,\n33\n, \n34\n suggesting that it may act more as an attachment cofactor than as a bona fide receptor needed for virus entry.\n35\n Our results indicate that platelet preparations that have been exposed to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 contain only traces of the virus, which has not actively replicated, suggesting that the receptor is not sufficient for platelet infection. In support, a limited presence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in platelets of patients with COVID\u201019\u00a0has been reported by others\n11\n, \n13\n, \n16\n, \n36\n and microvesicles generated by virus\u2010activated platelets might per se represent the Trojan horse the virus relies on to enter bystander platelets.\n16\n\nCD147 is a multifunctional membrane glycoprotein with various binding partners.\n37\n In addition to being expressed by human platelets, it is up\u2010regulated in activated platelets and in turn contributes, after involvement, to platelet degranulation,\n38\n, \n39\n at least in part via phosphoinositid\u20103\u2010kinase/Akt\u2010signaling events. Interestingly, ERK1/2, p38, and eIF4E phosphorylation is significantly upregulated in platelets from patients with severe COVID\u201019.\n11\n Further studies are necessary to dissect the intracellular signaling events associated with the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 elicited, CD147\u2010mediated platelet activation. Overall, CD147 represents a strong candidate as a moiety necessary for the platelet activation caused by the interaction of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n18\n\nThe role of platelets in intravascular immunity includes, on meeting a microbe in the circulation, the deployment of mechanisms to prevent its dissemination, including its containment within thrombi. The process, referred to as immunothrombosis, depends on the ability of platelets to trigger the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),\n29\n\nvia presentation of their own HMGB1.\n19\n, \n40\n Strongly supporting the role of immunothrombosis in COVID\u201019, the presence of thrombi containing NETs associated with platelets and fibrin in the pulmonary, renal, and cardiac microcirculation of patients with COVID\u201019\u00a0has been reported.\n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n Microthrombosis was related to the extent of neutrophil and platelet activation and interaction pattern in the blood, and to both ARDS and systemic hypercoagulability.\n41\n, \n42\n, \n43\n, \n44\n\nRespiratory tract epithelial cells are a primary target of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and the main clinical syndrome of COVID\u201019 is one of the upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Although viremia in the early stages of COVID\u201019's natural history is limited,\n45\n systemic spread of the virus through the bloodstream to extrapulmonary sites occurs and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA has been detected in the blood of hospitalized patients, most frequently in patients in intensive care units.\n46\n, \n47\n SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA levels consistently correlated with COVID\u201019\u00a0severity\n46\n, \n47\n and with the presence of intact SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virions.\n48\n Therefore, the blood and possibly the pulmonary microcirculation could represent a privileged meeting point for the virus and platelets.Platelets undergo early activation in the context of other infections in which the viral load in the blood is limited, such as human influenza. In these patients, platelet activation has been associated with lung involvement.\n49\n In the case of human influenza, Koupenova et al. have shown influenza virus engulfment by platelets, which results in the activation of neutrophils via a pathway that involves the complement cascade.\n50\n We did not find phagocytosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, possibly highlighting the different systems used by platelets to recognize the two viruses. In both cases, platelets undergo substantial activation and a role for complement in COVID\u201019\u00a0has been convincingly proposed.\n41\n, \n51\n Further studies are warranted to verify whether platelet and neutrophil activation and complement involvement are causally related in COVID\u201019.In this study, we observe widespread activation of platelets in patients with COVID\u201019, which correlates with activation of the coagulation cascade, with exposure of HMGB1 on the platelet membrane and with generation of HMGB1+ plt\u2010EVs, which are bioactive elements that activate endothelial cells, favor the generation of NETs and cause lung inflammation.\n9\n, \n10\n Our data support the rising COVID\u201019\u00a0model depicting platelet activation and coagulopathy as interconnected events via the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes. Of importance, there is a significant association between the extent of platelet activation at admission and disease outcomes (this report and previous work\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n31\n), suggesting that platelet activation might be a target for molecular intervention in COVID\u201019.
