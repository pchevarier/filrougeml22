Of note, our data is conflicting with results from the RECOVERY trial, and therefore gathering more evidence on the subject would be desirable.\n In the past months, the spotlight has been on the effects of corticosteroid therapy on hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), with many randomized clinical trials being conducted on the subject.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n\nMany of the ongoing trials were stopped early, due to the results of the preliminary report from the RECOVERY Collaborative Group, which showed that the use of dexamethasone was associated with a lower 28\u2010day mortality in patients who were receiving either invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, compared with standard care.\n5\n\nWhile the evidence in favor of corticosteroid therapy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from any cause\n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n seems to be confirmed also in ARDS secondary to COVID\u201019, the RECOVERY Collaborative Group Preliminary Report results were consistent with dexamethasone being possibly harmful in patients not receiving oxygen therapy.\n5\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality in noncritically ill COVID\u201019 patients, who had been admitted to the ward for more than 24\u00a0hours and who did not need invasive mechanical ventilation (with a score of 3, 4, and 5 on the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID\u201019 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI)). MATERIAL AND METHODSIn this observational cohort study, data were prospectively collected from the electronic medical records of patients admitted between February 20 and May 10, 2020 to Poliambulanza Foundation Hospital, a 600\u2010bed tertiary care hospital in Northern Italy. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Brescia.Patients were included in the study if they had a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102)\u2013positive reverse transcriptase real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction test on biological material obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab, if they had been admitted to a nonintensive ward, and if they did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of enrollment. Patients with a score of 3, 4, and 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI were included:\n10\n Patients with a score of 3 were hospitalized patients not receiving oxygen therapy, patients with a score of 4 were hospitalized patients receiving oxygen by mask or nasal prongs, and patients with a score of 5 were patients receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high\u2010flow oxygen.Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18\u00a0years, had been admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU), or had a length of stay on the ward of <\u00a024\u00a0hours. Oxygen therapy was started if oxygen saturation was <\u00a090%; noninvasive mechanical ventilation was indicated in the presence of dyspnea or with oxygen saturation <\u00a090% despite oxygen therapy. ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation were indicated if, despite noninvasive ventilation, any of the following were present: ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2)\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0mmHg, dyspnea, respiratory rate >\u00a040 breaths per minute, or tidal volume >\u00a010\u00a0ml/kg.Patients were divided into two cohorts: (i) patients who received corticosteroid therapy on the ward and (ii) patients who did not receive corticosteroid therapy on the ward.Corticosteroid therapy with drugs different from dexamethasone was converted to the equivalent dose.\n11\n The choice of patients\u2019 treatment plan and the decision to start or withhold corticosteroid therapy was made by the attending physician, since there was no clear evidence in favor or against the use of corticosteroids in COVID\u201019 patients at the time of the study.Primary outcome was association between corticosteroid use and in\u2010hospital mortality. The association between corticosteroid therapy and ICU admission was the secondary outcome.For secondary analyses, patients were divided according to the need of positive pressure support: The noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) group included all patients with a score of 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI, that is to say patients that received noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure or pressure support ventilation), while the group of patients not on NIMV included all patients with a score of 3 or 4 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI, i.e., patients that did not receive positive pressure ventilation (spontaneously breathing patients, with or without oxygen therapy).Statistical analysisOne thousand fifty four patients were needed to obtain a power of 80% to detect an odds ratio of\u00a00.7, assuming mortality was 25% in those receiving corticosteroids, with one patient treated with corticosteroids for every three patients admitted to the hospital and alpha error\u00a0=\u00a00.05.Continuous variables are expressed with mean (standard deviation, SD) or median (1\u00b0 quartile\u20133\u00b0 quartile) as appropriate, discrete variable as count (percentage). Bivariate analysis of the outcome was performed with Fisher's exact test for factorial variables and Student\u2019s t\u2010test for continuous ones. Association with corticosteroid treatment was assessed, and a propensity score was estimated using variables that were associated with treatment allocation and survival. The overlap weight method was used for balancing variables between the corticosteroids cohort and control cohort.\n12\n Association with hospital survival was assessed with logistic regression; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. A second analysis was conducted with proportional hazard ratios. Patients were considered alive after hospital discharge and the results were reported in explicative figures.Collinearity was assessed with variation inflation factor, and variables were excluded from the multivariate model if variation inflation factor was >\u00a03 and if there was correlation with other explanatory variables (for example, PaO2/FiO2 and PaO2). Missing values, in covariates, were assessed and replaced with mean substitution. A sensitivity analysis including only complete cases was conducted to evaluate the effect of missing values.Planned secondary analyses were conducted according to the daily dosage of corticosteroids used: more than 8\u00a0mg of dexamethasone/die (the median daily dose) and less than or equal to 8\u00a0mg/die, and assessing the effect of corticosteroids in patients with or without noninvasive ventilation.Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio software version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2014) and packages \"psw\" and \"survival\" for overlap weight propensity score and Cox\u2019s model estimation, respectively. RESULTSAs shown in Figure\u00a0\n\n1\n, 11,671 patients visited Fondazione Poliambulanza\u2019s emergency room during the study period, 2,053 of them tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, and 1,403 of those were admitted to the hospital. Forty\u2010one of them were admitted directly to the ICU, while 1,362 were admitted to a nonintensive ward. In the first 24\u00a0hours of hospital stay, 37 patients went to intensive care, and 14 died or were discharged: They were therefore excluded from analyses. Of the 1,311 remaining patients, 480 were exposed to steroids, and 831 were not (Figure\u00a0\n\n1\n). Three hundred ninety patients underwent noninvasive mechanical ventilation on the nonintensive care wards; 203 of them received corticosteroid therapy and 187 did not.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Flow diagram of study patients.

This finding was confirmed by the survival analysis (Figure\u00a0\n\n2\n).

DISCUSSIONOur findings show that corticosteroid therapy is not associated with any difference in hospital mortality for patients with COVID\u201019 who score 3, 4, or 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI, i.e., not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.At the beginning of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, caution was advised when prescribing corticosteroids, due to the possibility of a more prolonged viral shedding and delayed viral clearance,\n13\n which was also shown for other similar viral infections, like Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.\n14\n Many guidelines did not recommend the use of corticosteroids in COVID\u201019 patients,\n15\n and the World Health Organization initially discouraged corticosteroid use in COVID\u201019 due to the absence of any survival benefit and the possibility of harmful effects (avascular necrosis, psychosis, or diabetes) found in patients with SARS.\n16\n\nIn the following months, evidence specific to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 emerged from randomized clinical trials, showing the benefit of corticosteroid treatment on critically ill COVID\u201019 patients with severe forms of the disease.\n1\n, \n4\n, \n5\n These patients underwent invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation for severe hypoxemia in a disease characterized by diffuse viral pneumonia, suggesting that most of them could be classified as patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Therefore the results of clinical trials on the use of steroids in severe COVID\u201019 appear to be in agreement with current treatment guidelines for ARDS patients, like the ones produced by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) in 2017, which recommend the use corticosteroids in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n17\n Moreover, a recent study by Villar et al. found that early administration of dexamethasone could reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with established moderate to severe ARDS.\n7\n The benefit of corticosteroid treatment in patients with ARDS could be due to their effect on the inflammatory state that is a hallmark of the disease,\n18\n since corticosteroids affect numerous steps in the inflammatory pathway.\n19\n\nIn patients who are not critically ill, the evidence is less compelling. In community acquired pneumonia, dexamethasone could reduce length of hospital stay when added to antibiotic treatment in nonimmunocompromised patients,\n20\n and it could reduce mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation.\n21\n But evidence in influenza, another viral disease that can cause severe respiratory symptoms, shows that corticosteroid treatment is associated with increased mortality and hospital\u2010acquired superinfection.\n22\n In COVID\u201019, data from the RECOVERY Collaborative Group Preliminary Report showed no benefit (and the possibility of harm) among patients who did not receive oxygen therapy.\n5\n Our data suggest that corticosteroids are not beneficial in patients without invasive mechanical ventilation (with a score of 3,4, or 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI\n10\n). In particular, this appears to be evident in all patients with a score of 3 or 4, i.e., patients with or without oxygen therapy who are not on positive pressure noninvasive ventilation. Since ARDS diagnostic criteria include the use of at least 5 centimeters of water of end\u2010expiratory pressure, patients receiving oxygen therapy but not on NIMV / continuous positive airway pressure and patients not receiving oxygen cannot have an ARDS diagnosis.\n23\n\nDifferently from previous trials on corticosteroids in COVID\u201019 patients,\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n5\n we assessed patients who received noninvasive ventilatory support (with a score of 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI) as a separate group from patients who score 3 or 4 on the same scale. With this stratification of study sample, corticosteroids showed a protective effect against the need for ICU admission for patients with a score of 5 on the WHO scale (i.e., noninvasively mechanical ventilated patients). Differently from the RECOVERY trial,\n5\n we did not find any mortality reduction in patients receiving steroid therapy. This could depend on the exclusion of patients with a score of 6 on the WHO COVID\u201019 scale of clinical improvement (invasive mechanical ventilation patients), which were the stratum with the most benefit in survival with steroids. The secondary analysis on patients with score of 3, 4, and 5 is not comparable with the one in the RECOVERY trial, because we aimed to assess the effect of steroids in ventilated (score of 5) versus nonventilated (with a score of 3 and 4) patients, whereas RECOVERY separately analyzed patients without oxygen therapy (with a score of 3) separately from patients with oxygen therapy (with a score of 4 and 5). The subgroup analysis in patients without mechanical ventilation (score of 3 and 4) clearly confirms the absence of effect of steroids on mortality, confirming the primary analysis. The effect of steroids on survival is more complex to interpret in patients on NIMV (with a score of 5), because a trend toward the improvement could be detected and the sample size of the NIMV patients (390 patients) gives a low statistical power (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.553). In absence of further evidence on COVID\u201019 patients with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, we think that steroid use should be suggested in these patients because it reduces ICU admission and it can possibly have an effect on mortality reduction. It should be noted that COVID\u201019 requiring noninvasive mechanical ventilation probably met all moderate to severe ARDS diagnostic criteria (acute onset, PaO2/FIO2 lower than 200, bilateral lung infiltrates, and absence of cardiogenic origin of respiratory failure).\n23\n Therefore our data show once more how corticosteroid efficacy seems to be linked to the more severe disease stages of COVID\u201019. Since corticosteroid treatment is not exempt from side effects, and has been associated with complications such as increased infection rate,\n24\n hyperglycemia,\n20\n, \n25\n hypernatremia,\n26\n and ICU\u2010acquired weakness,\n27\n we think that caution should be exercised when prescribing corticosteroids to COVID\u201019 patients who are not receiving ventilatory support.Recent data showed that a high dose of corticosteroids, defined as higher than 1\u00a0mg/kg/day of prednisone (equivalent to 10\u00a0mg of dexamethasone a day in a 70\u2010kg patient),\n11\n was independently associated with an increased risk of death in patients with severe COVID\u201019.\n28\n When conducting the planned secondary analysis dividing patients receiving higher or lower equivalent dexamethasone doses, no difference in mortality was found in our cohorts. A post hoc analysis was conducted, with a cutoff of 6\u00a0mg of daily dexamethasone or less (the RECOVERY trial cutoff), which did not show any difference between strata (see \nSupplemental Material\n). Nevertheless there appears to be a trend towards a better outcome (as compared with the higher doses) in patients treated with 6\u00a0mg of dexamethasone daily dexamethasone or less, but the study was underpowered to detect this difference. Simulating from the data that were collected during the present study to obtain a power of 0.8 with type I error rate set at 0.05, and assuming that 1 of every 2 patients will be exposed to corticosteroids in low dose, i.e., 6\u00a0mg of daily dexamethasone or less, a total of 2,339 patients would need to be enrolled to detect an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.75.The effect of corticosteroids on outcome was adjusted for the possible associated treatment with enoxaparin, which has been shown to be associated with a reduction in mortality risk in COVID\u201019 patients.\n29\n\nWe believe that our findings could be generalized to other patients with severe COVID\u201019, because our patients\u2019 characteristics and outcomes are comparable to what was found in other studies.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n5\n Nevertheless, our study suffers from four main limitations: First, it is an observational prospective analysis of prospectively collected data; therefore the absence of randomization makes it impossible to exclude the presence of bias or unmeasured confounders. Second, it is a single\u2010center study, so our results might not be valid for centers with different settings. Patients we have enrolled are patients with a score of 3, 4, and 5 on the WHO COVID\u201019 OSCI; therefore caution is advised when applying these findings to patients with a different disease severity. Nonetheless, even if multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard in assessing a treatment\u2019s efficacy and safety, observational studies, which usually have a greater external validity than RCTs, can add information on the use of certain drugs in the clinical field and should be integrated with RCTs. Third, corticosteroid therapy was administered as per treating physicians\u2019 decision and without prespecified criteria. Fourth, in this cohort of patients, the mean duration of steroid therapy, which is of 5 (3\u20139) days, is shorter than the one proposed in the RECOVERY trial protocol, in which dexamethasone was prescribed for 10\u00a0days or until hospital discharge. This difference could hypothetically explain a discrepancy in hospital mortality, nevertheless the effective duration of steroid therapy in the RECOVERY trial was 7\u00a0days (interquartile range 3 to 10) and the possibility that just 2 more days of steroid therapy could explain these different findings is remote. A subgroup analysis for corticosteroid therapy duration was not feasible because it would inevitably lead to immortal patient bias,\n30\n by selecting patients who survived for more than 7\u00a0days in the steroids group, thus leading to a biased association with reduced mortality. CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, data from our observational, prospective, single\u2010center study show that treatment with corticosteroids is not associated with in\u2010hospital mortality reduction in patients admitted for COVID\u201019 who did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation. In the subgroup of COVID\u201019 patients treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid therapy is associated with a lower OR for ICU admission, whereas the effect on mortality has to be addressed in further studies.
