However, unlike other novel therapeutic interventions in COVID-19-like remdesovir and tocilizumab, corticosteroids are also often considered part of standard clinical care for a variety of non-ARDS indications. The aim of the work reported in this paper was to ascertain the use of corticosteroids for non-ARDS indications in patients with ARDS. MethodsA retrospective observational single-centre case series review was conducted using data from electronic healthcare records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at University College London Hospital between January 2018 and March 2020 (pre-COVID-19). Our main ICU is an adult, general unit with 35 beds, in a central London teaching hospital that gets tertiary referrals for patients with haemato-oncological malignancy. As data on corticosteroid use are collected as part of the routine service at our institution, our Research and Development link confirmed that ethical permission was not necessary.Our electronic health record was searched for mechanically ventilated patients with the phrase \u2018ARDS\u2019 in the notes. Their P/F ratios and hospital numbers were extracted into Microsoft Excel. The details of patients identified with moderate-to-severe ARDS, based on the Berlin definition,[5] were manually extracted on Excel for analysis by C.M. and I.P. The radiological scans were reviewed by S.P., C.M. and A.L. Details of any corticosteroid therapy were recorded, including indication, dosing and duration. Anonymised data were used for analysis. Continuous and categorical variables are reported as median (interquartile range) and n (%), respectively.The corticosteroid regimens were coded as per a classification previously described.[6] Here \u2018physiological\u2019 dose is classified as \u2018low\u2019 dose at the equivalent of prednisolone 7.5 mg daily, \u2018medium\u2019 dose 7.5\u201330 mg, \u2018high\u2019 dose 30\u2013100 mg and \u2018very high\u2019 >100 mg. ResultsThere were 4817 admissions to our Unit (some of whom were readmissions) during the data collection period. We identified 91 patients who fulfilled the criteria for moderate-to-severe ARDS (Table 1). The median age was 53 (34\u201366) years, and 55% were male. Haemato-oncology patients accounted for the majority of this cohort (n = 46, 51%), while pulmonary infection accounted for the majority of ARDS aetiology (n = 64, 70%). All patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventy percent of the 91 patients died in the ICU.Table 1Demographics of patients with ARDSDemographic baselineResults (number of patients and % or median and interquartile range)Gender\n\u2003Female41 (45.1%)\u2003Male50 (54.9%)Age53 [34\u201366]Weight (kg)70 [58\u201383]ARDS severity\n\u2003Moderate22 (24.2%)\u2003Severe69 (75.8%)ARDS aetiology\n\u2003Pulmonary infection64 (70.3%)\u2003Non-pulmonary infection with sepsis11 (12.1%)\u2003Aspiration pneumonia8 (8.8%)\u2003Pancreatitis3 (3.3%)\u2003Other5 (5.5%)APACHE II score23 [17\u201327]Primary speciality\n\u2003Haematology/oncology46 (51%)\u2003Gastroenterology9 (9.9%)\u2003Infectious diseases9 (9.9%)\u2003Thoracic surgery9 (9.9%)\u2003General surgery4 (4.4%)\u2003General medicine4 (4.4%)\u2002Respiratory2 (2.2%)\u2002Other8 (8.8%)Diabetes15 (16.5%)Renal replacement therapy42 (46.2%)Length of stay (days)17 [9\u201325]ICU mortality64 (70.3%)Patients on steroid treatment73 (80.2%)\u2003Haematology/oncology32 (94%)\u2003Non-haematology/oncology27 (68%)Steroids length of treatment (days)7 [3\u201317]Total91Open in a separate windowSeventy-three (80%) of ARDS patients received corticosteroid treatment during their ICU stay. The time from ICU admission to first dosing was 1 (0\u20135) day and duration was 7 (3\u201317) days. Corticosteroid treatment included hydrocortisone for septic shock (n = 40, 54.8%), methylprednisolone/prednisolone for ARDS (n = 13, 17.7%) and methylprednisolone/prednisolone for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PjP) (n = 8, 11%) as well as a range of corticosteroids for miscellaneous indications (n = 12, 16.4%). A total of 131 courses were administered, including one-off doses (Table 2), with 20 patients receiving two courses, and 15 more than 2 courses. Many of the miscellaneous indications were for one-off doses of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone for haematological conditions. The regimens are described in Table 2. The doses used were mostly \u2018very high\u2019 (including pulse) or \u2018high\u2019.Table 2Description of courses of corticosteroid treatmentSteroid course/one-off dosesARDS (N = 13)SS (N = 40)PCP (N = 8)MISC (N = 70)Total (N = 131)First7 (9.6%)22 (30.1%)5 (6.8%)39 (53.4%)73 (100%)Second4 (5.5%)12 (16.4%)3 (4.1%)16 (21.9%)35 (47.9%)Third2 (2.7%)3 (4.1%)010 (13.7%)15 (20.5%)Fourth03 (4.1%)03 (4.1%)6 (8.2%)Fifth0001 (1.4%)1 (1.4%)Sixth0001 (1.4%)1 (1.4%)Open in a separate windowARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome; MISC, miscellaneous; N = number of courses; PjP, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia; SS, septic shock.ARDS and PCP regimen both comprise methylprednisolone and prednisolone; SS comprises hydrocortisone; MISC represents other regimens. DiscussionIn ARDS there is an important disconnect between clinical trial patient selection and clinical practice. A majority of our patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS received corticosteroids, mostly for reasons other than ARDS, and multiple courses were common. Our study results need to be interpreted in the light of two important limitations. Firstly, our haemato-oncological subgroup is not representative or generalisable of the general ICU population. Secondly, there will be between-centre differences in prescribing practices, but the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with ARDS outside the context of a clinical trial is likely to be commonplace.The high number of miscellaneous steroid doses observed in our study highlights the importance of documenting the indication as part of the daily dynamic of medicine reconciliation. The high doses of corticosteroid used here for non-ARDS indications may have implications if corticosteroids are studied in ARDS or COVID-19. For example, a previous analysis reported that increased corticosteroid doses were linked to worsened mortality in sepsis.[7]Up to 25% of patients are excluded from clinical trials of ARDS because of underlying disease requiring long- or short-term concomitant corticosteroid use.[8] ARDS trials may also exclude patients with active cancer. Subsequent corticosteroid courses for other indications are often not reported.[9, 10] Similarly, some studies exploring the use of corticosteroids excluded patients who had received corticosteroids before admission[11\u201313] or who required corticosteroids acutely for any indication other than COVID-19[11] or were expected to need corticosteroid[12] \u2013 though in this study 15% in the no corticosteroid group received a corticosteroid, which was allowed for new other indications. Indeed in the RECOVERY study,[14] 8% received corticosteroids in the usual care group. ConclusionsIn our centre, most of the moderate-to-severe ARDS patients are treated with corticosteroids for reasons other than ARDS. Clinical trials investigating the utility of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS exclude patients who are treated with other corticosteroids before [4, 8, 9, 12, 13] or during ICU admission.[4, 8, 11, 12] It is therefore difficult to extrapolate the findings of these studies to routine clinical practice, which should have implications for the design of future clinical trials.
