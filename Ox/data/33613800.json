Plateau pressures below 27 cm H2O and 30 cm H2O were not associated with an absolute risk reduction of short-term mortality. According to univariable meta-regression analysis, mortality was significantly associated with plateau pressure on day 1 (\u03b2 = 0.01 (95% CI, 0.002 - 0.024), P = 0.02). On days 3 and 7, however, no significant difference was detected. When the cutoffs were set at 27, 30 and 32 cm H2O on day 1, which showed a significant difference, plateau pressure tended to be associated with increased mortality at pressures above the cut-off values, and there were no significant differences at pressures below the cut-off values, regardless of the cutoff used.

The mortality rate of the patients with ARDS is approximately 19.7-55.3% [1, 2]. A substantial number of ventilator strategies to reduce the plateau pressure have been proposed to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in patients with ARDS [1-8]. Considering the effect of these pressures on outcomes such as mortality, the effects from several perspectives must be evaluated, including at what cut-off values outcomes are affected, and how long these effects last.In a recent observational study, Villar et al [7] reported that a plateau pressure above 26 cm H2O is harmful, which suggests that the appropriate plateau pressure still remains to be conclusively determined. A Cochrane review [9] compared two lung ventilation strategies, protective and non-protective, not between different cut-off limits of plateau pressure. In contrast, although all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in a meta-analysis [10] involved a comparison of higher and lower levels for the upper limit of plateau pressures, no study compared various levels of plateau pressures. Since the relationship between the plateau pressure and mortality in ARDS may not be linear [11], it may be inappropriate to investigate the optimal upper limit of plateau pressure by a simple comparison of two different plateau pressures.The interactions between the time course and changes in plateau pressure were not considered in a previous meta-analysis [10]. The degree of the effects of these pressures on outcomes such as mortality may be different on day 1, day 3, and day 7, and it is not clear how long these pressures need to be strictly controlled. However, most studies have evaluated the pressures on day 1 or the average of day 1 and day 3, so the effect of the pressure after several days, such as on day 3 and day 7, on outcomes has not been evaluated. Therefore, to investigate the optimal upper limits of plateau pressure over the course of ARDS, a simple meta-analysis of RCTs may be insufficient. Stratification based on the upper limits of plateau pressures, and by the period of ventilation along with a meta-regression analysis, may be more meaningful.The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the optimal limits of plateau pressure with respect to mortality on days 1, 3, and 7, by univariable meta-regression analysis, with or without determining the cut-off values for these pressures. In this analysis, the mean and standard deviation of the pressures for each arm of the RCTs were independent variables and mortality was the dependent variable. Materials and MethodsThis systematic review was designed on the basis of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements [12]. This protocol is registered with the PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviewers (CRD42016041924) and has been published [13]. Since this study is a systematic review and meta-analysis, the Institutional Review Board approval was not required. This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical standards of the responsible institution on human subjects as well as with the Helsinki Declaration.Study eligibilityType of studies This analysis included only published RCTs that were either full-scale or pilot studies.Type of participants This study included adults (age 18 years or older) with ARDS or acute lung injury from any cause, as defined by the Berlin definition [14] or the North-American-European Consensus Conference on ARDS, undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) [15].Types of interventions and comparators We included RCTs that compared two different MV strategies with lower and higher plateau pressures in patients with ARDS and acute lung injury. The values of the plateau pressures were directly extracted from each paper. High-frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) was excluded due to the lack of information on the plateau pressure.Type of outcomes The following outcome measures were evaluated: the primary outcome was short-term mortality (1: at the end of the follow-up period for each trial, 2: at day 28, and 3: at discharge from the hospital).Information sourcesWe searched MEDLINE via the NCBI Entrez system, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, and Ichushi, a database of papers in the Japanese language.Search strategyWe used the search terms \u201cmechanical ventilation\u201d AND \u201cARDS,\u201d \u201cadult respiratory distress syndrome,\u201d \u201cALI\u201d or \u201cacute lung injury\u201d AND \u201ctidal volume,\u201d \u201cpressure limited\u201d or \u201cvolume limited.\u201d Searches were performed in May 2019. The detailed search strategy and the dates on which the searches were performed are shown here (Supplementary Material 1, www.jocmr.org).Study records and data managementThe literature search results from each database were extracted into Microsoft (Redmond WA USA) Excel files, and duplicates were removed by sorting the results alphabetically based on author. All full text files were managed with EndNote (X7) bibliographic software (Thompson Reuters, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). A meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager (RevMan) software V.5.3.5.Selection processTwo of the three physicians involved in the study (HY, TN, TK) screened each title and abstract of relevant studies during the first screening and the full text during the second screening. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with the physician who did not screen the study in question.Data collection processAfter extracting meta-analyses during the second screening, data were extracted from each study by three reviewers (HY, TN, TK) using two tools: 1) the Cochrane Data Collection Form (RCTs only) [16] and 2) Review Manager (RevMan) software V.5.3.5 [10].Risk of bias in individual studiesThe risk of bias in each included study was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool [17, 18] with respect to the eight domains. Each bias was graded as \u201clow-risk,\u201d \u201cunclear-risk,\u201d or \u201chigh-risk.\u201d Two of the three reviewers (HY, TN, TK) separately graded the bias of each study, and any disagreement was resolved by the decision of the remaining reviewer.Data synthesisForest plots were used for the meta-analysis, and the effect size expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and as weighted mean differences with 95% CI for continuous data. Outcome measures were pooled using a random effect model to account for study-specific effects in measures. For all analyses, a two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered significant. If a study was missing data, we attempted to contact the authors of the study for additional data. If a reply from the authors was not obtained, we classified it as missing data.On days 1, 3, and 7 of mechanical ventilation, univariable meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of plateau pressure with mortality, with or without determining the cut-off values for the pressures (27 cm H2O, 30 cm H2O and 32 cm H2O). These cut-off values were determined by the authors of this review according to the data distribution included in this review. Since the range of plateau pressures included in this review was approximately from 25 cm H2O to 35 cm H2O, the cut-off values were set to these three plateau pressures. The mean and standard deviation of plateau pressure of each arm of the RCTs included in the analysis were the independent variables and mortality was the dependent variable. Data expressed as the median and interquartile range were converted to the mean and standard deviation values. Meta-regression analysis was performed with R version 3.3.2.Assessment of heterogeneityThe heterogeneity between trials for each outcome was assessed with an I2 statistic for quantifying inconsistency (RevMan). I2 values of < 25%, 25-50% and > 50% represented small, medium, and large amounts of heterogeneity, respectively [19].Assessment of reporting biasA funnel plot was planned to be used to investigate the possibility of publication bias if \u2265 10 studies were available (RevMan) [20].Subgroup and sensitivity analysesSubgroup analysis was conducted based on factors that may cause heterogeneity, i.e., the cut-off values of plateau pressure. Subgroup analysis was also performed for the different time points (day 1, day 3, and day 7) that plateau pressure was measured while the patient was undergoing MV.For sensitivity analysis, we first excluded all studies assessed as having a high risk of bias, i.e., when the quality of evidence was assessed as \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low.\u201d The remaining studies were used for sensitivity analysis. ResultsStudy selectionA comprehensive search across electronic databases yielded a total of 2,975 citations (Fig. 1). After evaluation of the 2,975 citations, 99 references were evaluated in detail, and 28 were included in the qualitative synthesis. After excluding studies without detailed descriptions of plateau pressure, 14 studies [1-4, 8, 21-29] were included in the final qualitative analysis (Fig. 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Flow diagram (search, inclusion, and exclusion).Study characteristicsTrial protocols for each study eventually included in this meta-analysis are summarized in Table 1 [1-4, 8, 21-29]. The total number of patients included in the quantitative analysis was 4,984. The types of interventions and comparisons varied among studies. Studies used different ventilator modes, such as volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-controlled ventilation, or airway pressure-release ventilation. The number of trials designed to compare these strategies was five for tidal volume, one for adaptive support ventilation, two for recruitment maneuver, one for airway pressure-release ventilation, five for pressure-controlled ventilation, and four for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy. The risk of bias in the included studies is shown here (Supplementary Material 2, www.jocmr.org).Table 1Previous Study Populations and Protocols [1-4, 8, 21-29]Author, yearSample size (n)CountryInclusion criteriaInterventionControlVentilator modesTidal volumeAirway pressurePEEPVentilator modesTidal volumeAirway pressurePEEPBrower et al, 1999 [21]52USA1.

Based on these results, we decided to use parameters on days 1, 3, and 7 for the meta-analysis and meta-regression in this study to include as many studies as possible.Table 2Study ImplementationAuthor, yearIntervention comparisonPopulationTidal volume, mL/kg/PBWPlateau pressure, cm H2OPEEP, cm H2OAgeSeverity scorePaO2/FiO2Day1Day3Day7Day1Day3Day7Day1Day3Day7Brower et al, 1999 [21]Intervention46.9 (17.1)LIS: 2.8 (0.5)129 (51)7.8 (0.4)7.3 (0.9)7.5 (1)28.4 (7.7)23.9 (5.3)22.2 (6.1)9.7 (3)7.9 (4.5)5.6 (4.2)APACHE 3: 90.6 (26.4)Control49.8 (14.4)LIS: 2.7 (0.5)150 (69)10.2 (0.7)10 (1)10 (0.7)32.3 (7.3)29 (8.2)31.9 (10.8)8.7 (3.5)7.8 (4.2)6 (4.2)APACHE 3: 84.6 (27.1)Villar et al, 2006 [22]Intervention45.3 (26 - 62)aLIS: 2.9 (0.4)-7.3 (0.9)7.1 (0.9)-30.6 (6)28.4 (5.4)-14.1 (2.8)11.2 (3.1)-APACHE 2: 18 (7)Control53.7 (40 - 69)aLIS: 2.8 (0.5)-10.2 (1.2)10 (1)-32.6 (6.2)32.5 (7.5)-9 (2.7)8.7 (2.8)-APACHE 2: 18 (6)Hodgson et al, 2011 [23]Intervention60 (15.8)APACHE 2: 20.1 (3)b----27.6 (1.5)b24.2 (2.4)b21 (2.1)b15 (1)b12.1 (1.5)b8.5 (1.8)bSOFA: 8.6 (0.9)bControl58 (12.6)APACHE 2: 20.1 (3)b----26.9 (1.4)b24 (2.1)b20 (3.4)b10 (0.5)b9.3 (1.4)b7.8 (2)bSOFA: 8.4 (0.5)bAgarwal et al, 2013 [24]Intervention31.4 (14.9)APACHE 2: 17 (8.9)107.3 (41.9)---26.6 (8.7)22.4 (13.2)25.9 (11.9)12.6 (4.9)9.3 (4.9)10.1 (5.5)SOFA: 7.4 (4)Control29.7 (11.6)APACHE 2: 17 (9.7)96.6 (34.5)---26.5 (4.1)23.3 (11.1)24.0 (8.6)12.1 (3.8)9.3 (4.4)8.1 (3.9)SOFA: 8.2 (4.4)Amato et al, 1998 [25]Intervention33 (13)LIS: 3.4 (0.4)112 (10)348 (6)c--30.1 (0.7)c--16.4 (0.4)c--APACHE 2: 28 (7)Control36 (14)LIS: 3.2 (0.4)134 (14)768 (13)c--36.8 (0.9)c--8.7 (0.4)c--APACHE 2: 27 (6)Cavalcanti et al, 2017 [1]Intervention51.3 (17.4)SAPS 3: 63.5 (18.1)119 (43.5)5.6 (1.1)5.8 (1.6)6.1 (1.3)27.9 (4.5)26.3 (5.7)24.1 (6.1)16.2 (3.9)14.2 (4.2)11.6 (4.0)Control50.6 (17.4)SAPS 3: 62.7 (18.1)117.2 (41.9)5.7 (0.6)5.8 (0.5)6.2 (1.4)25.4 (4.5)24.0 (5.8)23.2 (6.0)12.0 (3.4)10.5 (3.7)9.6 (3.2)Brower et al, 2004 [26]Intervention54 (17)APACHE 3: 96 33)151 (67)6 (0.9)5.8 (1)5.8 (1.2)27 (6)26 (7)26 (6)14.7 (3.5)12.9 (4.5)12.9 (4)Control49 (17)APACHE 3: 91 (30)165 (77)6.1 (0.8)6.1 (1.1)6.2 (1.3)24 (7)24 (6)26 (8)8.9 (3.5)8.5 (3.7)8.4 (4.3)Kacmarek et al, 2016 [4]Intervention52.2 (15.1)APACHE 2: 18 (10)133.4 (43.5)5.6 (1.1)5.8 (1.2)6.8 (1.5)27.9 (3.8)26.2 (3.9)23.7 (6)15.8 (3.8)14.3 (3.9)11.2 (4.4)Control53.4 (14.5)APACHE 2: 17 (6)128.3 (30.5)6.2 (0.7)6.4 (1.1)6.7 (1.6)25.2 (4.6)24.5 (5.1)24.8 (5.9)11.6 (2.5)10.7 (3.3)10.5 (3.9)Mercat et al, 2008 [27]Intervention60 (16)SAPS2: 50 (16)144 (58)6.1 (0.3)6.2 (0.5)6.8 (1.3)27.5 (2.4)26.5 (4.2)24.3 (5.8)14.6 (3.2)13.4 (4.7)8.9 (5.1)Control60 (15)SAPS2: 49 (16)143 (57)6.1 (0.4)6.2 (0.6)6.4 (0.9)21.1 (4.7)20.7 (5)21.1 (5.6)7.1 (1.8)6.7 (1.8)6.2 (2.1)Esteban et al, 2000 [28]Intervention56 (17)LIS: 2.8 (0.6)126 (47)8 (1.9)8.1 (2.4)33 (6)34 (8)11 (4)10 (4)SAPS2: 39 (14)Control54 (16)LIS: 2.9 (0.5)131 (48)8 (2.5)8.3 (2.6)32 (5)34 (7)12 (4)12 (5)SAPS2: 42 (17)Brochard et al, 1998 [29]Intervention57 (15.3)LIS: 3 (0.3)144 (61)7.1 (1.3)7.4 (1.3)25.7 (5)24.5 (5.7)10.7 (2.9)9.6 (3)APACHE 2: 18 (7)SAPS2: 35 (12)Control56.5 (15.3)LIS: 3 (0.3)155 (68)10.3 (1.7)10.7 (1.8)31.7 (6.6)30.5 (9.4)10.7 (2.3)8.5 (2.8)APACHE 2: 17 (8)SAPS2: 36 (13)Meade et al, 2008 [3]Intervention54.5 (16.5)APACHE 2: 24.8 (7.8)144.8 (47.9)6.8 (1.4)6.9 (1.5)6.9 (1.3)30.2 (6.3)28.6 (6)28.8 (6.3)15.6 (3.9)11.8 (4.1)10.3 (4.3)Control56.9 (16.5)APACHE 2: 25.9 (7.7)144.6 (49.2)6.8 (1.3)6.7 (1.5)7 (1.6)24.9 (5.1)24.7 (5.7)25.1 (6.8)10.1 (3)8.8 (3)8 (3.1)ARDSnet, 2000 [8]Intervention51 (17)APACHE 3: 81 (28)138 (64)6.2 (0.9)6.2 (1.1)6.5 (1.4)25 (7)26 (7)26 (7)9.4 (3.6)9.2 (3.6)8.1 (3.4)Control52 (18)APACHE 3: 84 (28)134 (58)11.8 (0.8)11.8 (0.8)11.4 (1.4)33 (9)34 (9)37 (9)8.6 (3.6)8.6 (4.2)9.1 (4.2)Zhou et al, 2017 [2]Intervention51.5 (15)APACHE 2: 22.0 (7.9)121.7 (46.8)7.3 (1.2)7.8 (1.9)7.4 (1.2)22.7 (4.3)19.3 (3.9)18.6 (4.5)7.0 (1.6)6.9 (1.8)6.5 (1.3)Control52.0 (15.1)APACHE 2: 20.2 (7.6)138.3 (56.1)7.2 (1.1)7.7 (1.1)7.5 (1.0)24.3 (4.3)23.3 (4.6)23.0 (4.6)12.0 (2.1)10.4 (2.8)10.3 (2.1)Open in a separate windowData are presented as mean (SD) if there is no asterisk. aData are presented as median (IQR). bData are presented as mean (SE). cData are measured at 36 h after study enrollment.

Two studies [21, 24] for which the authors submitted their study data were included in this meta-analysis, but the other studies for which no response was obtained from the authors were excluded. For the assessment of reporting bias, we did not test for funnel plot asymmetry as the number of studies included in each outcome was less than 10.Short-term mortality (main outcome and sensitivity analysis)Overall short-term mortality was significantly higher for patients with plateau pressures over 32 cm H2O during the first 3 days after ICU admission (day 1: RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 - 0.89; I2 = 0%; day 3: RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64 - 0.90; I2 = 0%; day 7: RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.65 - 1.04; I2 = 16%), but plateau pressures below 27 cm H2O and 30 cm H2O were not associated with an absolute risk reduction of short-term mortality (Table 3, Supplementary Materials 3-5, www.jocmr.org).Table 3Effect Size of Short-Term Mortality According to Plateau Pressure on Day 1, 3, and Day7 at Selected Cut-Off ValuesTotal events (below cutoff)Total (below cutoff)Total events (over cutoff)Total (over cutoff)RR95% CIP valueI2Day 1\u2003\u200327 cm H2O8052,0038131,9570.990.86 to 1.130.8859%\u2003\u200330 cm H2O3791,0243789881.000.78 to 1.280.9969%\u2003\u200332 cm H2O1775402255290.770.66 to 0.890.00070%Day 3\u2003\u200327 cm H2O3529663569300.960.72 to 1.270.7576%\u2003\u200330 cm H2O1514851964790.760.64 to 0.900.0020%\u2003\u200332 cm H2O1514851964790.760.64 to 0.900.0020%Day 7\u2003\u200327 cm H2O3791,0243789881.000.78 to 1.280.9969%\u2003\u200330 cm H2O1745162055130.950.69 to 1.310.7655%\u2003\u200332 cm H2O1474581834550.820.65 to 1.040.1016%Open in a separate windowCI: confidential interval; RR: risk ratio.Meta-regression analysis of short-term mortalitySince the results appeared to differ depending on the cut-off values for the plateau pressure, the mortality at the plateau pressure value was evaluated by meta-regression analysis. On day 1, mortality tended to increase with an increase in pressure, with significant differences observed for the plateau pressure. However, on days 3 and 7, the trends showed no significant difference (Fig. 2). Since significant differences were observed for the plateau pressure on day 1 (\u03b2 = 0.01 (95% CI, 0.002 - 0.024), P = 0.02), plateau pressure cut-off values of 27, 30, and 32 cm H2O were assessed to determine the optimal cut-off values, and regression analysis was performed. Plateau pressure tended to be associated with increased mortality at pressures above the cut-off values, especially above 27 cm H2O, and there were no significant differences at pressures below the cut-off values, regardless of the cutoff that was set (Fig. 3). This indicates that when the plateau pressure was below any of the three cut-off values, the mortality rate did not increase as the plateau pressure increased, but plateau pressures above 27 cm H2O might affect the mortality rate. As a result, the cut-off values above 27 cm H2O may affect the mortality rate. Multivariable meta-regression analysis was not performed because there was no association between age and: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) 2 scores and mortality rate using meta-regression analysis (Fig. 4).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Univariable meta-regression analysis of the effect of plateau pressure on short-term mortality on days 1, 3 and 7.

Sensitivity analysis was not conducted because the quality of evidence of none of the included studies was assessed as \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low.\u201d DiscussionSummary of results of this review (or principal findings)This systematic review, using a meta-regression analysis of 14 RCTs, suggests that the plateau pressure is associated with short-term mortality, and that this association may continue up to the first 3 days, not 1 week, after ICU admission. Optimal cut-off values that can be suggested from the results of this meta-analysis are 27 cm H2O of plateau pressure from days 1 through 3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to compare the effects of plateau pressure, not only on the day of ICU admission, but also several days after admission.Summary of the evidence (possible mechanisms and differences from previous studies)Many recent meta-analyses [30-33], as well as the paper by Amato et al [34], evaluated pressures (plateau and driving pressures) on day 1 or the average pressures for a few days after starting MV. In these studies, the cut-off values for plateau pressures that influenced an improvement in the prognosis were approximately 30 cm H2O and 15 cm H2O. On day 1, the plateau pressure identified in the present meta-analysis was similar to the results of previous studies [9, 34, 35]. However, no previous study compared the pressures up to days 3 and 7 with prognosis, and the influence of the pressures after initiation of MV on the prognosis was unclear. The results of this review show that the influence of the pressure on mortality remains until day 3, and the effect tended to diminish by day 7. It is an important clinical question whether a lung protective strategy should be continued for a certain number of days. The results of this meta-analysis and meta-regression have made it possible to make a new suggestion regarding the duration of lung protective strategies.When considering the effect of MV pressure on patient prognosis, it is important to recognize that MV pressure may correlate with the prognosis. In meta-analyses and clinical research reported so far [8, 9, 36, 37], the MV pressure, which is a continuous variable, was converted into a binary variable using a cut-off value to allow intergroup comparisons of its influence on outcomes. Within each group, the effects of different pressures on the outcomes were not uniform and may have had various degrees of correlation. Therefore, the effects of ventilator pressure on the prognosis could not be evaluated strictly from the results of previous clinical studies [8, 9]. To compensate for this weakness, we used a meta-regression method that considered the ventilator pressure as a continuous variable. The results on day 3 using the meta-regression analysis in Figure 2 show a slightly different tendency compared with the results obtained with the usual meta-analysis method, in which pressure is converted into a binary variable and analyzed. By analyzing these pressures as a binary variable, the result seemed to be either overestimated or underestimated.Implications for each stakeholderAccurate determination of the duration for which strict management of MV pressure contributes to improvement in outcomes may facilitate MV management for physicians. If the tidal volume and the plateau pressure are to be limited below prespecified goals in the late phase of mechanical ventilation, a substantial number of patients may be difficult to reach the target tidal volume without sedation. For critical care physicians, the duration of the lung protection strategy is an essential, but unresolved question. Since the present study suggests that a lung protection strategy may not need to be followed in the later phase, clinicians may consider earlier discontinuation of sedatives, which may allow for earlier rehabilitation and, therefore, earlier liberation from mechanical ventilation.LimitationsThere are several limitations of this meta-analysis. First, the method used in this review is a meta-regression analysis, but it is only one type of meta-analysis, and a multivariate analysis was not performed by integrating individual data. This may have led to over- or under-estimation of the original results by summarizing the data for each individual participating in the study and then reintegrating it using the meta-analysis method. Second, the present meta-analysis included RCTs that compared plateau pressures but did not include RCTs that compared driving pressure or transpulmonary pressure. Recently, it was shown that driving pressure may have a greater influence on patient prognosis than plateau pressure [34]. However, a meta-analysis with a limited number of RCTs that compared the driving pressure has limited value. Although a meta-analysis of RCTs [38, 39] that evaluate transpulmonary pressure is worthy of consideration, a comparison of plateau pressure was not performed in these studies, but the superiority of a personalized ventilation strategy using transpulmonary pressure was assessed. Also, the frequency of esophageal pressure measurements reported in the Lung Safe Study [35] was 1.2%, suggesting that ventilation strategy using transpulmonary pressure is not yet standard management. Third, the meta-regression analysis used in this review is different from standard meta-regression that investigates whether the difference in study characteristics (e.g., age, time, and other such factors) may account for the heterogeneity of effect size of each included study. The method of meta-regression analysis used in this review considered each of the two study arms in RCTs as an individual group, and the mortality ratio in each group, not effect size, was used as the dependent variable. The mortality ratio in each group was then evaluated by regression analysis. Although a similar technique may be used for meta-regression analysis of certain studies [40], the study results should be interpreted with caution. Finally, in this meta-analysis, univariable meta-regression analysis was conducted, not multivariable meta-regression analysis because the possible confounding factors, such as etiology of ARDS, could not be collected from the data in each study. There may be several confounding factors affecting mortality and plateau pressure, such as etiology of ARDS and transpulmonary pressure, which were not considered in this meta-analysis, so the interpretation of the results should not be exaggerated.ConclusionsThis review suggests that MV management, restricting plateau pressure, for at least several days after hospitalization may be critical for improving prognosis. According to this meta-analysis, the optimal cut-off values for plateau pressure are around 27 cm H2O. However, since this is a meta-analysis with recognized limitations, it is necessary to conduct further studies, including individual meta-analyses and large-scale interventions.
