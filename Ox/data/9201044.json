Setting:                       Surgical and medical intensive care units in a tertiary care, military teaching hospital.                  Design:                       A prospective, clinical study.                  Patients:                       Seventeen patients, 17 yrs to 83 yrs of age, with severe ARDS (Lung Injury Score of 3.81 +/- 0.23) failing inverse ratio mechanical conventional ventilation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 68.6 +/- 21.6, peak inspiratory pressure of 54.3 +/- 12.7 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 18.2 +/- 6.9 cm H2O).                  Interventions:                       High-frequency oscillatory ventilation was instituted after varying periods of conventional ventilation (5.12 +/- 4.3 days). We employed lung volume recruitment strategy that consisted of incremental increases in mean airway pressure to achieve a PaO2 of > or = 60 torr (> or = 8.0 kPa), with an FiO2 of < or = 0.6.                  Measurements and main results:                       High-frequency oscillator ventilator settings (FiO2, mean airway pressure, pressure amplitude of oscillation [delta P] frequency) and hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, oxygen delivery [DO2]), mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, and the oxygenation index (oxygenation index = [FiO2 x mean airway pressure x 100]/PaO2) were monitored during the transition to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and throughout the course of the high-frequency protocol. Thirteen patients demonstrated improved gas exchange and an overall improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < .02). Reductions in the oxygenation index (p < .01) and FiO2 (p < .02) at 12, 24, and 48 hrs after starting high-frequency oscillatory ventilation were observed. No significant compromise in cardiac output or DO2 was observed, despite a significant increase in mean airway pressure (31.2 +/- 10.3 to 34.0 +/- 6.7 cm H2O, p < .05) on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The overall survival rate at 30 days was 47%. A greater number of pretreatment days on conventional ventilation (p < .009) and an entry oxygenation index of > 47 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) were associated with mortality.                  Conclusions:                       High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is both safe and effective in adult patients with severe ARDS failing conventional ventilation. A lung volume recruitment strategy during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation produced improved gas exchange without a compromise in DO2. These results are encouraging and support the need for a prospective, randomized trial of algorithm-controlled conventional ventilation vs. high-frequency oscillatory ventilation for adults with severe ARDS.", "author": [{"author": "P Fort", "affiliation": ["Department of Pulmonary/Critical Care Medieine, Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX 78236-5300, USA."], "href": "/?term=Fort+P&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "C Farmer", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Farmer+C&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "J Westerman", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Westerman+J&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "J Johannigman", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Johannigman+J&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "W Beninati", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Beninati+W&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "S Dolan", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Dolan+S&cauthor_id=9201044"}, {"author": "S Derdak", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Derdak+S&cauthor_id=9201044"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["9201044", "34765495", "32974029", "31197492", "30202530", "30053961", "29743121", "29675732", "27043185", "25593740", "24887179", "24886674", "24760513", "23497577", "23419093", "23132266", "22096349", "21742216", "21647845", "21560002", "20949287", "19475349", "19014575", "18691048", "17680186", "17565024", "17184554", "16507163", "16464246", "16137379", "16137357", "15753721", "15480780", "12974971", "12923619", "12897997", "12793874", "12149536", "12133172", "9803331"], "body": ""}
