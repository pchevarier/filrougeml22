Approximately 66,381,204 confirmed cases and 1,527,390 deaths (2.3%) from COVID-19 as of December 5, 2020.1 Different factors have been associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 as age, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular diseases, kidney dysfunction, cardiac injury, liver dysfunction, coagulation alterations or the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nSince COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic disease, a large number of investigations have been carried out to better understand its epidemiology, mechanisms, clinical evolution, and management. Recently, several researchers have suggested the potential role of oxidative stress on COVID-19 and it has been proposed that oxidative stress in patients with COVID-19 could contribute in the cytokine storm and coagulopathy; in addition, the use of antioxidants agents has been suggested to reduce oxidative stress.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) could damage lipids, proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) during oxidative stress. Adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine and uracil are the five types of nucleobases that constitute DNA and RNA. Four types of those nucleobases are present in DNA and RNA. In both, DNA and RNA, adenine, cytosine and guanine are present. Furthermore, thymine is present in the DNA and uracil in RNA. As guanine is the nucleobase with the lowest redox potential, it is the most prone to oxidation.15, 16, 17, 18 There are three oxidizied guanine species (OGS): 8\u2011hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) also named 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) from DNA, 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG) also named 8-oxo-guanosine (8-oxo-G) from RNA, and 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHGua) also named 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-Gua) from DNA or RNA.Previously, we found that the oxidative damage of DNA and RNA (assessed by blood concentration of the three oxidizied guanine species) was associated with mortality of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage,19 brain infarction,20 traumatic brain injury21 and sepsis.22 However, there are no data on DNA and RNA oxidative damage of COVID-19 patients. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore DNA and RNA oxidative damage in surviving and non-surviving patients with COVID-19. MethodsDesign and subjectsEigth Intensive Care Units from 6 hospitals in the Canary Islands (Spain) participated in the inclusion of patients in this observational and prospective study. The study protocol (code CHUC-2020\u201326) was approved by the Ethics Committee of each hospital. In the context of the pandemic and that the Spain Government forbid patient visits due to the health outbreak policy, the requirement of written informed consent for patient or family to participate in the study was waived.Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by an assay of real time fluorescence reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab sample or a bronchial aspirate admitted to the ICU were included.Determination of serum concentrations of OGSSerum samples were collected on admission at ICU and were stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until to the moment of blood determinations. DNA/RNA Oxidative Damage ELISA Kit\u00ae (Cayman Chemical Corporation, Ann Arbor, USA) with a detection limit of 0.45\u00a0ng/mL was used for the determination of serum OGS concentrations. All determinations were performed blindly to clinical data in the same Laboratory Department.Variables recordedThe following demographic and clinical data were recorded on admission to the ICU: body max index (BMI), age, sex, chronic renal failure, COPD, smoking, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, arterial hypertension, steroid agents, solid tumor, hematological tumor, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chest radiograpy findings, ARDS,23 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score24 and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score.25 Additionally, the following laboratory data were recorded on admission to the ICU: creatinine, lactic acid, sodium, protein, glucose, albumin, creatine kinase, bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, eosinophils, d-dimer, fibrinogen, platelets, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fraction inspired of oxygen (FIO2). In addition, the following data regarding ICU treatment were recorded: respiratory support, tocilizumab, hydroxicloroquine, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and steroid agents. Finally, survival at 30 days was our end-point study.Statistical methodsFrequencies (percentages), medians (percentile 25\u201375), chi-square test and Mann\u2013Whitney U test were used to describe and compare categorical and continuous variables between non-surviving and surviving patient groups. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the ability of serum OGS levels to predict mortality. Kaplan-Meier at 30-day survival curves were conducted using serum OGS concentrations >2\u00a0ng/mL and \u22642\u00a0ng/mL (cut-off selected by Youden J index). Logistic regression was carried out to determine the association between serum OGS levels and 30-day mortality controlling by SOFA or APACHE-II. As the number of deceased patients was only 11, two models were constructed with only two predictor variables in each model. We used the SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 as the cut-off of significant differences for the statistical analysis. ResultsNon-surviving patients (n\u00a0=\u00a011) compared to surviving patients (n\u00a0=\u00a042) had higher APACHE-II (p<0.001) and SOFA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) (Table 1\n). Additionally, non-surviving patients compared to surviving patients had lower platelet count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and higher serum OGS levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) (Table 2\n).TABLE 1Demographic data, clinical data and treatment of non-surviving and surviving patients.Non-survivors(n\u00a0=\u00a011)Survivors(n\u00a0=\u00a042)P valueGender female - n (%)7 (63.6)27 (64.3)0.99COPD - n (%)3 (27.3)5 (11.9)0.34Smoking - n (%)2 (18.2)2 (4.8)0.19Chronic renal failure - n (%)01 (2.4)0.99Arterial hypertension - n (%)6 (54.5)16 (38.1)0.49Ischemic heart disease - n (%)1 (9.1)1 (2.4)0.38Diabetes mellitus - n (%)3 (27.3)12 (28.6)0.99Solid tumor - n (%)01 (2.4)0.99Hematological tumor - n (%)02 (4.8)0.99Steroid agents prior to admission - n (%)2 (18.2)1 (2.4)0.11Human Immunodeficiency Virus - n (%)01 (2.4)0.99Chest radiograpy findings - n (%)0.95\u00a0- Consolidation only1 (9.1)5 (11.9)\u00a0- Ground glass opacity plus consolidation6 (54.5)21 (50.0)\u00a0- Ground glass opacity only4 (36.4)16 (38.1)ARDS - n (%)9 (81.8)36 (85.7)0.67Age (years) - median (p 25\u201375)70 (59\u201375)65 (51\u201370)0.10Body max index (kg/m2) - median (p 25\u201375)27.1 (23.0\u201330.2)28.1 (24.8\u201332.4)0.29APACHE-II score - median (p 25\u201375)18 (16\u201320)12 (7\u201315)<0.001SOFA score - median (p 25\u201375)8 (5\u20139)5 (3\u20137)0.004Respiratory support - n (%)0.30\u00a0- Conventional oxygen therapy04 (9.5)\u00a0- High-flow nasal cannula04 (9.5)\u00a0- Non-invasive mechanical ventilation03 (7.1)\u00a0- Invasive mechanical ventilation11 (100)31 (73.8)Tocilizumab - n (%)6 (54.5)15 (35.7)0.31Lopinavir/Ritonavir - n (%)10 (90.9)39 (92.9)0.99Interferon Beta 1-B - n (%)7 (63.6)26 (61.9)0.99Hydroxychloroquine - n (%)11 (100)39 (92.9)0.99Steroid agents in ICU- n (%)9 (81.8)31 (73.8)0.71Open in a separate windowCOPD\u00a0=\u00a0Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease;

DiscussionTo our knowledge, this is the first study reporting DNA and RNA oxidative damage in COVID-19 patients. The main new finding was that serum OGS concentration was associated with mortality. Another interesting finding of our study was that serum OGS concentration showed a similar predictive ability for mortality as SOFA and APACHE-II and could help physicians to estimate the prognosis of these patients.Recently, different researchers have suggested that oxidative stress in patients with COVID-19 could contribute to cytokine storm and coagulopathy.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 In vitro studies have found that SARS-CoV-1 infection increases the production of ROS in human promonocyte cells26 and in various mammalian cells.27 To our knowledge, such observations have not yet been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, we believe that SARS-CoV-2 infection may similarly lead to increased production of ROS. Regarding cytokine storm and oxidative stress, ROS has been found to activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) producing an increase in inflammatory cytokines.28 In addition, hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) has been found in patients with COVID-19 and has been associated with the development of ARDS and multiple organ dysfunction.2\n,\n3 With regard to hematological findings and oxidative stress, hydroxyl radicals (a type of ROS) transform soluble plasma fibrinogen into abnormal fibrin clots (in the form of dense tangled deposits resistant to enzymatic degradation) that cause microthrombosis.29 In addition, a hypercoagulable state has been found in patients with COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of multiple organ dysfunction.30\nBesides, our novel findings about higher serum GOS levels in non-surviving than in surviving COVID-19 patients are in line with those found in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage,19 brain infarction,20 traumatic brain injury21 and sepsis.22 We believe that this association between higher serum GOS levels and mortality of COVID-19 patients could be related to higher oxidant state, which could contribute in multiple organ dysfunction and finally the death of patients.We would like to acknowledge that the main limitation of our study was that the low number of deceased patients prevented the inclusion of more variables in a single regression analysis. However, the strengths of the study were that the association between serum OGS levels and mortality is present in both regression models (controlling for SOFA or APACHE-II), and that is in line with the poor prognosis found in patients with other diseases.19, 20, 21, 22 Therefore, we believe that the new findings of our study could motivate the research to clarify the potential role of oxidative damage on COVID-19 patients, its potential contribution in prognosis, and the possible use of antioxidants agents to reduce oxidative stress. ConclusionsAs far as we know, this is the first study to report on oxidative DNA and RNA damage in COVID-19 patients, and the main new finding was that serum OGS concentration was associated with mortality.
