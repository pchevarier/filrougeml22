This severe respiratory illness, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pneumonia, typically develops 8\u00a0days after symptom onset (Hu et\u00a0al., 2021) and, when it does not respond to non\u2010invasive respiratory support, it requires advanced respiratory support, including high concentrations of inspired oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Such therapies are also required for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Ranieri et\u00a0al., 2012), which has been widely studied over several decades. This review highlights the pathophysiology of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and subsequent COVID\u201019 pneumonia, its similarities with and differences from classical ARDS, and the implications for mechanical ventilation strategies to support COVID\u201019 patients in the intensive care unit.During inspiration, the lung expands owing to a positive transpulmonary pressure. In spontaneous ventilation, this gradient is produced by a negative pleural pressure created by the inspiratory muscles, mainly the diaphragm. In contrast, controlled mechanical ventilation relies upon a positive airway pressure driving gas into the lungs, with the positive transpulmonary gradient dependent upon an increased alveolar pressure, and passive movement of the chest wall. The fundamental ventilator parameters that can be set are airway pressure and flow and their timing, which need to match the patient's respiratory system resistance and elastance (inverse of compliance). At each time point during inspiration, airway pressure is determined by the equation of motion and equals the sum of end\u2010expiratory alveolar pressure, the product of flow and resistance to flow, and the product of tidal volume and elastance of the respiratory system. Mechanical ventilation can be delivered in mandatory mode or in assisted mode to support spontaneous breathing. In the latter modality, the patient's inspiratory effort triggers the delivery of breaths (Pham et\u00a0al., 2017), the work of breathing is shared in various proportions between the respiratory muscles and the mechanical ventilator, and the transpulmonary pressure is generated by a combination of a negative pleural pressure and a positive alveolar pressure.This ventilatory support can be necessary to sustain life in the acute phase of the disease while the immune system fights the viral infection, yet can cause harm to the patient if the levels of positive pressure are not tailored to the associated lung mechanics (ventilator\u2010induced lung injury). Ventilator\u2010induced lung injury is well studied in classical ARDS, a syndrome associated with a distinct histopathological entity termed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Diffuse alveolar damage is a widespread, heterogeneous inflammatory reaction comprising alveolar infiltrates with leucocytes and proteinaceous deposits, damage to alveolar pneumocytes, the basement membrane and endothelium, and patchy areas of haemorrhage (Nash et\u00a0al., 1967; Ware & Matthay, 2000). Understanding the microstructural changes in disease processes is a requisite for effective ventilatory management, with large\u2010scale clinical trials supporting the use of low tidal volumes (ARDSnet, 2000) and driving pressures (Amato et\u00a0al., 2015) to reduce the risk of stretch or overpressure damage to the already injured, fragile lung parenchyma (Slutsky & Ranieri, 2013). It is not clear whether and how these guidelines for ventilation of patients with ARDS are applicable for the management of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia, which appears to demonstrate a distinct pattern of injury. 2.\u2003PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HYPOXAEMIA IN COVID\u201019 PNEUMONIAEarly COVID\u201019 pneumonia is a process predominantly affecting the peripheries of both lungs (Fox et\u00a0al., 2020; Shi et\u00a0al., 2020). The lack of a significant burden of atelectatic, consolidated lung in early COVID\u201019 pneumonia explains the lack of response to increases in positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) in this cohort (Ball et\u00a0al., 2021; Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020), who nevertheless demonstrate a significant reduction in oxygenation (Gattinoni, Chiumello, Caironi et\u00a0al., 2020; Figure\u00a01). The disease progresses with development of patchy bilateral ground\u2010glass opacification and, finally, dense consolidation in keeping with ARDS (Shi et\u00a0al., 2020), and post\u2010mortem studies of patients who died with COVID\u201019 pneumonia have identified alveolar injury similar or identical to DAD, even in those patients who did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation (Fox et\u00a0al., 2020; Konopka et\u00a0al., 2020; Menter et\u00a0al., 2020).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Computed tomography (CT) scans showing different degrees of lung consolidation associated with similar levels of arterial oxygenation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). (a) The CT scan was acquired during spontaneous breathing and associated with low Hounsfield unit values, indicating well\u2010aerated compartments. (b) The CT scan was acquired during controlled mechanical ventilation, with positive end\u2010expiratory pressure at 5 cmH2O, and associated with a marked proportion of high Hounsfield unit values, indicating non\u2010aerated compartments.

(2020)All post\u2010mortem studies by their definition include patients who did not survive their disease, probably determining a disproportion of evidence available with greater weight to the late\u2010/end\u2010stage disease and associated bias. Biopsies from living patients earlier in the disease process, however, demonstrate a number of important differences from classical ARDS histology, including a marked absence of DAD features, hyperplasia of type\u00a02 pneumocytes and an increased number and size of both interstitial capillaries and postcapillary venules (Doglioni et\u00a0al., 2021).A small autopsy series, looking at patients who died earlier in the disease process, also demonstrated some differences from classical DAD, with a lymphocytic alveolar infiltrate in the early stages followed by a progression to intra\u2010alveolar fibrin deposition and microvascular injury (Copin et\u00a0al., 2020). This latter finding of severe microvascular injury associated with pulmonary capillary microthrombi was also present in other series (Fox et\u00a0al., 2020; Menter et\u00a0al., 2020).The pathogenesis of these microthrombi is likely to be related to direct pulmonary endothelial cell damage attributable to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, in addition to widespread immunothrombosis triggered by a widespread dysregulated immune response (\u2018cytokine storm\u2019) (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2020). SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike proteins, similar to those on the original SARS\u2010CoV\u20101, interact with the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u00a02 (ACE2) receptor (Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2003). The ACE2 receptor is abundantly expressed on type\u00a02 pneumocytes and on endothelial cells (Hamming et\u00a0al., 2004), and it is postulated that viral particles interacting with this receptor lead to endocytosis of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102/ACE2 complex and the subsequent pneumonia and local pro\u2010inflammatory, pro\u2010thrombotic response. This endothelial injury is similar to the endotheliitis associated with T\u2010cell\u2010mediated rejection of solid organ transplants (Ackermann, Mentzer, et\u00a0al., 2020; Varga et\u00a0al., 2020) and is associated with alveolar capillary and postcapillary venule thrombosis to an extent up to nine times greater than is seen in other viral pneumonias, such as H1N1 pneumonia (Ackermann, Verleden, et\u00a0al., 2020; Figure\u00a02). Brisk neovascularization, particularly intussusceptive, is also seen early in the disease process in COVID\u201019 pneumonia (Ackermann, Verleden, et\u00a0al., 2020).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2The interalveolar septa of a 78\u2010year\u2010old male patient who died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019), showing slightly expanded alveolar walls and multiple fibrinous microthrombi (arrowheads) in the alveolar capillaries.

(2020), Copyright Massachusetts Medical SocietyUsing a variety of imaging methodologies including iodine maps from dual\u2010energy computed tomography (CT) imaging and positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (PET/SPECT) imaging, different groups have confirmed the co\u2010existence of widespread pulmonary perfusion deficits both with and without radiologically visible thrombi (Grillet et\u00a0al., 2020; Patel et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramos et\u00a0al., 2021; Ridge et\u00a0al., 2020; Santamarina, Boisier, et\u00a0al., 2020; Santamarina, Boisier Riscal, et\u00a0al., 2020), the latter hypothesized to reflect vascular inflammation or alteration of the vascular tone (Busana et\u00a0al., 2021). Regions of reduced perfusion demonstrated otherwise near\u2010normal lung parenchyma and air spaces. There is additionally evidence that pulmonary blood volume is redistributed towards regions of ground glass opacification, with the potential to exacerbate shunt (Si\u2010Mohamed et\u00a0al., 2020). These findings fit with clinical evidence of increased dead space, as measured by ventilatory ratio (Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020; Patel et\u00a0al., 2020), in addition to venous admixture (Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020) in COVID\u201019 pneumonia.Based upon these imaging studies and the known endothelial dysfunction induced by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, one of the causes of ventilation\u2013perfusion (V\u02d9/V\u02d9Q\u02d9Q\u02d9) mismatching and therefore hypoxaemia in COVID\u201019 pneumonia is hypothesized to be loss of the normal hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response (Gattinoni, Chiumello, Caironi et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramos et\u00a0al., 2021), in addition to the physical redistribution of blood owing to occlusive thrombi.Macrovascular complications, including pulmonary emboli, are also common in severe SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (Helms et\u00a0al., 2020) and can arise either from lower limb sources consistent with widespread immunothrombosis or from in situ pulmonary thrombosis (Loo et\u00a0al., 2021). 3.\u2003COMPARISONS WITH CLASSICAL ARDSIn ARDS with other aetiology, the severity of disease, evaluated using the arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/PaO2FI,O2FI,O2) ratio according to the Berlin definition (Ranieri et\u00a0al., 2012), is directly proportional to the quantity of lung oedema and to the amount of non\u2010aerated lung tissue (Caironi et\u00a0al., 2015). This inverse relationship between the PaO2/PaO2FI,O2FI,O2 ratio and the quantity of non\u2010aerated lung tissue is a hallmark of ARDS, and because of the strong relationship, it is possible to estimate the shunt fraction and therefore the PaO2/PaO2FI,O2FI,O2 ratio from the amount of collapsed tissue obtained from the lung CT (Reske et\u00a0al., 2013).The implication of this relationship is that a progressively more severe disease is associated with progressively smaller lung volumes available for ventilation (\u2018baby lung\u2019) and a progressively larger amount of collapsed but potentially recruitable lung (Gattinoni et\u00a0al., 2006). These two characteristics underpin the widely accepted recommendations on the use of ventilation with a lower tidal volume (to protect the baby lung) and a progressively higher amount of PEEP (according to PEEP/FI,O2 tables), to keep open the atelectatic but potentially recruitable lung.Although some uncertainty remains with regard to the underlying mechanisms, the hypoxaemia observed early in COVID\u201019 results from a more complex interaction between a dysregulation in pulmonary perfusion through alteration of angiotensin\u00a0II metabolism, vascular inflammation, loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, neo\u2010angiogenesis and immunothrombosis (Ackermann, Verleden, et\u00a0al., 2020; Busana et\u00a0al., 2021; Habashi et\u00a0al., 2021; Sherren et\u00a0al., 2020). As the disease progresses, as evidenced by serial CT and post\u2010mortem examinations, changes consistent with classical ARDS are seen. As such, two differing phenotypes of COVID\u201019 pneumonia have been proposed: \u2018type\u00a0L\u2019, associated with low elastance, V\u02d9/V\u02d9Q\u02d9Q\u02d9 ratio, lung weight and recruitability, and \u2018type\u00a0H\u2019, associated with high elastance, right\u2010to\u2010left shunt, lung weight and recruitability (Gattinoni, Chiumello, Caironi et\u00a0al., 2020). In terms of the underlying pathophysiology, type\u00a0L relates to the early peripheral disease process, where the hypoxia is mediated by perfusion deficits and an increased dead space, whereas type\u00a0H refers to a pathophysiology consistent with classical ARDS. Such a distinction must be made with caution, because it is clear that some patients will exhibit features of both types, some will transition between types, and some will remain in one or the other for the entirety of their disease process. Understanding the particular underlying pathophysiology in any particular patient is crucial for the appropriate choice of mechanical ventilation settings, both in order to optimize gas exchange and to prevent further damage to the already injured lung.Owing to the primarily vascular phenomena in type\u00a0L disease, the alteration in gas exchange (venous admixture and dead space ventilation resulting in hypoxaemia and hypercapnia) can occur in the presence of near\u2010normal lung volumes (Gattinoni, Chiumello, Rossi, et\u00a0al., 2020; Gattinoni, Coppola, et\u00a0al., 2020; Gattinoni, Meissner, et\u00a0al., 2020; Gattinoni et\u00a0al., 2021). In this case, there is a complete dissociation between the severity of alterations in gas exchange (mainly hypoxaemia) and the relatively preserved lung volumes and therefore compliance of the respiratory system (Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020).Ultimately, some patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia develop irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (George et\u00a0al., 2020; Mo et\u00a0al., 2020), which is also seen late in ARDS (Masclans et\u00a0al., 2011). This phenotype manifests as a restrictive lung pathology with minimal potential for lung recruitment (PLR) and is associated with difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation and a poor prognosis, in some cases warranting lung transplantation (Bharat et\u00a0al., 2020).The above considerations are essential for the appropriate management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID\u201019 (Habashi et\u00a0al., 2021; Robba et\u00a0al., 2020). This management requires a shift between the concepts of selecting low tidal volumes based on the severity of hypoxaemia and the selection of PEEP based on the PaO2/PaO2FI,O2FI,O2 ratio (Marini & Gattinoni, 2020) and will require a more global assessment of the patient, which starts with an understanding of the duration of the symptoms, the radiological characteristics (particularly CT) and an assessment of lung mechanics, preferably at PEEP 5\u00a0cmH2O (Caironi et\u00a0al., 2015; Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020). 4.\u2003SELECTION OF TIDAL VOLUMETypically, a tidal volume of 6\u00a0ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) is used in patients with the ARDS because, compared with the delivery of larger tidal volumes, it increases both survival and the number of days spent without ventilation (ARDSnet, 2000). Given the above\u2010mentioned dissociation between the severity of oxygenation and lung volumes, a tidal volume of 6\u00a0ml/kg PBW may not be appropriate for every patient at every stage of the disease process. Recent studies make it clear that selecting total volumes based on a value of driving pressure (DP; measured as plateau pressure minus PEEP or as tidal volume divided by compliance) is a better way of personalizing the total volume to the lung compliance, and therefore the lung volume, hence adapting tidal volumes to the different phenotypes of the disease, with the aim of maintaining lung strain within a narrow range (Amato et\u00a0al., 2015; Costa et\u00a0al., 2021; Goligher et\u00a0al., 2021).Practically, the first approach in a patient receiving controlled mechanical ventilation should be to select a tidal volume that reflects a threshold of driving pressure rather than being based on PBW, or to set the lowest driving pressure (in pressure control) to achieve any initial tidal volume of 8\u00a0ml/kg PBW. If the driving pressure is <\u00a014\u00a0cmH2O (Tsolaki et\u00a0al., 2021), the associated tidal volume can be maintained. However, the driving pressure might be well above 14\u00a0cmH2O in patients with reduced compliance, and in this case the tidal volume needs to be lowered until the target driving pressure has been achieved (Marini & Gattinoni, 2020). This approach of selecting total volume based on obtaining a driving pressure <\u00a014\u00a0cmH2O ensures the avoidance of both hypoventilation in patients with preserved compliance and the excessive strain in patients with smaller lung volumes and lower lung compliance.The total energy delivered by the mechanical ventilator to the respiratory system every minute can be calculated by combining tidal volume, PEEP, plateau and peak inspiratory pressures and respiratory rate, all used to determine mechanical power. The trade\u2010off between a decrease in tidal volume and an increase in respiratory rate to achieve a given minute ventilation necessary to remove a sufficient quantity of carbon dioxide can be calculated using either the formula of mechanical power (Giosa et\u00a0al., 2019) or an abbreviated practical formula of 4DPRR (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0driving pressure\u00a0+\u00a0respiratory rate) (Costa et\u00a0al., 2021). Using this formula, it is possible to select the most appropriate total volume (based on driving pressure) and respiratory rate that will give the lowest possible total value of 4DPRR (Costa et\u00a0al., 2021). 5.\u2003SELECTION OF POSITIVE END\u2010EXPIRATORY PRESSUREThe selection of PEEP in COVID\u201019 is complex, given the dissociation between hypoxaemia and anatomical shunt fraction, which normally reflects the amount of non\u2010aerated lung tissue (Chiumello et\u00a0al., 2020). Choosing high PEEP based solely on the severity of hypoxaemia in patients with preserved lung compliance will add static stress and strain, alter lung perfusion and haemodynamics, and ultimately, increase the static component of mechanical power and contribute to volutrauma (G\u00fcldner et\u00a0al., 2016).The best approach to evaluate the effects of different levels of PEEP is by measuring the PLR either through the CT scan or, more simply, at the bedside using a single\u2010breath recruitment\u2010to\u2010inflation ratio (R/I ratio). This ratio is calculated as the compliance of the lung volume recruited with an abrupt release of PEEP from 15 to 5\u00a0cmH2O (or to airway opening pressure) divided by the compliance at a PEEP of 5\u00a0cmH2O (or airway opening pressure). An R/I ratio\u00a0>\u00a00.5 indicates higher lung recruitability, and these patients may benefit from higher levels of PEEP (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). In COVID\u201019, recruitability is highly variable (Beloncle et\u00a0al., 2020) and seems to be dependent crucially on the delay from symptoms to intensive care unit admission or to intubation, in addition to the treatment received in hospital before the institution of mechanical ventilation.It is important to stress that an improvement in oxygenation after an increase in PEEP does not necessarily indicate recruitability. Positive intrathoracic pressure has a complex relationship with oxygenation. By decreasing alveolar capillary transmural pressure, it can impair pulmonary perfusion (Versprille, 1987) and even redistribute it to non\u2010ventilated areas (Cronin et\u00a0al., 2020), but by increasing lung volume it can also increase the flow through extra\u2010alveolar vessels and, additionally, reduce the shunt fraction by a depressive effect upon cardiac output (Dantzker et\u00a0al., 1980). Therefore, many patients can respond to an increase in PEEP with an improvement in oxygenation but a deterioration in dead space ventilation, a reduction in respiratory system compliance and an increase in driving pressure (Grieco et\u00a0al., 2020). Only when all these changes are taken into consideration is it possible to determine whether a higher or lower PEEP setting is required for individual patients. 6.\u2003RESCUE INTERVENTIONSWhen deciding on the use of recruitment manoeuvres (RMs), determining PLR is again crucial. Recruitment manoeuvres and high PEEP in patients with low PLR can cause overdistension of areas of the lung already opened, increasing dynamic strain, volutrauma and barotrauma owing to the effects of stress risers (areas of the lung where amplification of mechanical forces takes place), which can represent 14\u201323% of the lung parenchyma (Cressoni et\u00a0al., 2014). In these patients, the most effective strategy is to use PEEP of 5\u22128\u00a0cmH2O, avoid RMs and adopt the prone position early, ideally within the first 24\u00a0h of intubation (Guerin et\u00a0al., 2013; Langer et\u00a0al., 2021; Mathews et\u00a0al., 2021; Shelhamer et\u00a0al., 2021; Weiss et\u00a0al., 2021; Zarantonello et\u00a0al., 2020).On the contrary, in patients with high PLR, PEEP\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0cmH2O (but possibly \u2264\u00a015\u201318\u00a0cmH2O) can lead to opening of new alveolar units, reducing dynamic strain and increasing the recruited volume. In these patients, higher PEEP may improve lung homogeneity.In both circumstances, the most effective way to achieve lung homogeneity and protective ventilation and to optimize V\u02d9/V\u02d9Q\u02d9Q\u02d9 matching is the use of prone positioning (Beitler et\u00a0al., 2014; Gattinoni et\u00a0al., 2003; Munshi et\u00a0al., 2017; Weiss et\u00a0al., 2021). Prone positioning has been effective at improving gas exchange in patients with ARDS and in those with COVID\u201019 (Gu\u00e9rin et\u00a0al., 2020; Scaramuzzo et\u00a0al., 2021), and other studies are in progress to determine its capacity to reduce mortality. During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, the use of prone positioning has been extended to patients who were not intubated but were receiving non\u2010invasive mechanical support or simply high\u2010flow nasal oxygenation. Awake proning has improved gas exchange, but the ultimate effects on preventing intubation, improving outcome or altering the course of the trajectory of the disease are unclear (Coppo et\u00a0al., 2020; Ferrando et\u00a0al., 2020). 7.\u2003SPONTANEOUS BREATHING AND RISK OF PATIENT SELF\u2010INFLICTED LUNG INJURYSevere hypoxaemia is associated with an increase in ventilation (Weil et\u00a0al., 1970), but its correlation with the symptom of dyspnoea is moderate at best, with other factors, such as hypercapnia and mechanical limitation of ventilation, exhibiting stronger relationships based on accepted physiological principles (Manning & Schwartzstein, 1995). In severe SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, a subgroup of patients tolerate life\u2010threatening degrees of hypoxaemia without obvious distress or air hunger (Tobin et\u00a0al., 2020). Several mechanisms are proposed to account for this phenomenon. The relative lack of changes in lung parenchyma and respiratory system compliance seen with early infection might override the dyspnoeic response that would be expected owing to hypoxaemia from severe V\u02d9/V\u02d9Q\u02d9Q\u02d9 mismatch (Couzin\u2010Frankel, 2020). Neurological manifestations of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection are common, particularly anosmia, and direct impairment of the respiratory control centre might represent a further effect of the brainstem inflammation caused by the virus (Matschke et\u00a0al., 2020).During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, it has become clear that other groups of patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure presented with barotrauma, mediastinal emphysema and subcutaneous emphysema generated during spontaneous breathing, often in the absence of any additional positive airway pressure. This barotrauma caused during spontaneous breathing has been named patient self\u2010inflicted lung injury (P\u2010SILI) (Cruces et\u00a0al., 2020; Yoshida et\u00a0al., 2017), to reflect the fact that often excessive inspiratory effort (e.g.,\u00a0>\u00a015\u00a0cmH2O) (Esnault et\u00a0al., 2020; Roesthuis et\u00a0al., 2021), even in the absence of high\u2010pressure ventilation, can contribute to severe lung injury and progression of lung disease. Given the high risk of P\u2010SILI in these COVID\u201019 patients, it is important to monitor the inspiratory efforts during both non\u2010invasive and invasive ventilation.Monitoring of inspiratory effort during non\u2010invasive ventilation is more challenging and relies on recording of total volumes, the diaphragmatic excursions measured with ultrasound, or signs of activation of inspiratory muscles. However, the most accurate measurement of inspiratory effort is obtained by the insertion of an oesophageal balloon catheter that, although carrying some practical difficulties, can record the swings in oesophageal pressure (Tonelli et\u00a0al., 2020). The swings in (or delta) oesophageal pressure reflect the changes in plural pressure and can therefore give an indication of whether a given inspiratory effort is excessive and can lead to P\u2010SILI. This strategy was effective in monitoring respiratory effort and predicting failure of non\u2010invasive mechanical ventilation (Tonelli et\u00a0al., 2020).In patients who are ventilated invasively, it is possible to measure the P0.1 (the airway pressure developed during the first 100\u00a0ms of inspiration), which reflects the inspiratory drive, and to calculate the occlusion pressure (DPocc, which is the difference between the most negative airway pressure obtained during an expiratory occlusion manoeuvre and the value of PEEP). The importance of these measurements has been shown recently in a study where 62.5% patients with high P0.1 (>\u00a04\u00a0cmH2O) and DPocc (<\u00a0\u221215\u00a0cmH2O) had a relapse in respiratory failure compared with none of the patients with low P0.1 and DPocc (Esnault et\u00a0al., 2020).Multiplying the DPocc by 0.75 enables estimation of the respiratory muscle pressure (Pmusc=\u22120.75\u00d7DPocc) and the dynamic transpulmonary pressure (DPL\u00a0=\u00a0DP\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u2154DPocc). As a general guide, it has been suggested that if the estimated P\nmusc is\u00a0>\u00a013\u201315\u00a0cmH2O or DPL\u00a0\u2265\u00a016\u00a0cmH2O, more careful monitoring of transpulmonary pressure with oesophageal pressure should be used, or alterations in the sedation and ventilatory strategy should take place to reduce lung stress and strain (Bertoni et\u00a0al., 2020). 8.\u2003CONCLUSIONSCOVID\u201019 pneumonia is a pathophysiological entity distinct from classical ARDS and requires different ventilatory management (Figure\u00a03). In early, type\u00a0L disease, the hypoxaemia is predominantly underpinned by an increased dead space and V\u02d9/V\u02d9Q\u02d9Q\u02d9 mismatch and is not correlated with the healthy lung volume. As such, tidal volumes should not be limited stringently, but should be more liberal as long as the driving pressure is limited. Likewise, PEEP levels should not be titrated in relationship to hypoxaemia but on the potential for recruitability of the lung, which is not necessarily high if there is minimal air\u2010space disease. Prone positioning in both spontaneously breathing and ventilated patients is often beneficial and should be considered early.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Diagram summarizing pathophysiological features associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) infection and the proposed management of mechanical ventilation for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) in the intensive care unit. The figure shows the main known pathophysiological mechanisms that can lead to hypoxaemia, with paired CT images (top row) and iodine perfusion maps (bottom row) indicative of the main phases. Initially, hypoxaemia is related to increased shunt (arrows) and dead space ventilation (asterisks), with minimal lung parenchymal pathology at risk of ventilator\u2010induced lung injury. Lung gas volume can decrease over time because of oedema and atelectasis, which may be reversible with prone positioning or higher PEEP. Eventually, dense consolidation and/or fibrosis can make the condition less responsive to both proning and PEEP (low PLR). Macrothrombosis is also present, with pulmonary emboli causing large areas of reduced or absent perfusion.
