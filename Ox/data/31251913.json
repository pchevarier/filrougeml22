IntroductionBRCA1 mutations carry a 40-80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (BC). Inadequate maintenance of mammary epithelial cell (MEC) genome integrity is a suspected driver of this outcome (Chen et al., 2018; Huen et al., 2010; Silver and Livingston, 2012). While p220, the primary disease-suppressing BRCA1 product, exhibits multiple functions, like DNA damage repair, the detailed events that lead to BRCA1 BC are largely unknown.Mammary gland (MG) development is a unidirectional, hierarchical process wherein mammary stem cells (MaSCs) differentiate into progenitors that further differentiate into mature MECs (Visvader and Stingl, 2014). Dedifferentiation of mature cells into a more primitive state rarely occurs in normal tissues. However, when it does, it can trigger a neoplastic process (Friedmann-Morvinski and Verma, 2014; Van Keymeulen et al., 2015; Visvader, 2011). Although BRCA1 can prevent transdifferentiation of cultured, human MECs, whether this translates into BC suppression is unclear (Wang et al., 2016).BRCA1 p220 is necessary for maintaining a normal MEC differentiation state, a function that likely contributes to its BC suppression activity (Liu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016; Xu et al., 1999). In humans, p220 depletion in basal-like MECs led to disorderly differentiation (Wang et al., 2016), and aberrant luminal progenitors (LPs) were detected in germline BRCA1-mutated mammary tissue (Lim et al., 2009; Nakshatri et al., 2015; Park et al., 2010; Proia et al., 2011).Defective p220 function promotes aberrant differentiation of otherwise normal, cultured, basal-like human MECs to a more primitive, mesenchymal state that arises, at least in part, from inadequate repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) (Wang et al., 2016). Specifically, p220, and its bound partners, BRG1 and FANCD2, and \u0394Np63, with which it also communicates, suppress ICL accumulation and MEC transdifferentiation. This study explores these events both in cultured MECs and during BRCA1 mouse mammary tumor development. ResultsNUMB is a BRCA1-interacting proteinThe BRCA1 C-Terminal (BRCT) region is vital for the p220 DNA repair function. It contains two, adjacent BRCT repeat motifs that operate as DNA damage signal receptors (Gerloff et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015). Currently, three BRCA1-associated proteins, CtIP, BACH1/BRIP1, and Abraxas, are known to bind to them. All contain pSXXF/pSPTF sequences, where the serine is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR following DNA damage, thereby sustaining their BRCT binding function (Kim et al., 2007; Manke et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007; Yu and Chen, 2004; Yu et al., 2003). Conceivably, these motifs participate in signaling events that sustain MEC differentiation following effective DNA repair.Lacking evidence that any known BRCT-binding protein participates in MEC differentiation control, we initiated a search for additional p220 BRCT binding proteins. Specifically, we screened database for heretofore undetected BRCA1-binding polypeptides that contain SPTF sequences (Manke et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003) and encountered a stem cell biology-associated protein, NUMB. Interestingly, NUMB is required for MEC differentiation maintenance (Tosoni et al., 2015).NUMB also contains an SPTF and SPTXXF motif (Figure S1A). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of HA- or myc-tagged BRCA1 in 293T cells showed that it co-immunoprecipitated (IP\u2019d) with at least two, endogenous human NUMB isoforms [aka (L)ong and (S)hort (Figure 1A\u2013B)]. Moreover, endogenous BRCA1 p220 and NUMB co-IP\u2019d (Figure 1C\u2013D), an event that was stimulated by cell exposure to mitomycin C (MMC) (Figure 1E-\u200b-F).F). These results implied that BRCA1 and NUMB co-participate in DNA damage control.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.NUMB is a BRCA1 partner(A-B) Reciprocal interaction between BRCA1 and NUMB. 293T cell extracts transiently expressing HA-BRCA1 or myc-BRCA1 (A) or Flag-NUMB (Long or Short isoform, B) were IP\u2019d with anti-epitope antibody (Ab) and then immunoblotted (IB\u2019d) with the indicated Abs.(C-D) Endogenous BRCA1-NUMB Interaction. MCF7 extracts were respectively IP\u2019d with BRCA1 (C) or NUMB Ab (D), and the IPs were analyzed by IB.(E-F) Effect of cisplatin or KU55933 on BRCA1-NUMB binding. Myc-tagged BRCA1-expressing (E) or naive 293T cells were or were not (UT) exposed to MMC (100ng/ml, overnight) or KU55933 (10\u03bcM, overnight); extracts were IP\u2019d with myc (E) or BRCA1 Ab (F) and analyzed by IB.(G)\nIn vitro BRCA1-BRCT/NUMB binding.(H) NUMB mutations compromise NUMB/BRCA1 binding. Extracts of 293T cells transiently expressing Flag-NUMB (long and short, WT or 2A) were IP\u2019d with Flag Ab and the IPs analyzed by IB.See also\nFigure S1.To test whether the BRCA1 BRCT motifs contribute to NUMB binding, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged BRCA1 fragments, collectively representing the entire BRCA1 sequence, were assayed as candidate NUMB binding targets (Chen et al., 1998). GST-BRCT fragment F6 (aa 1314-1863) exhibited the strongest NUMB binding. Less impressive NUMB binding was detected with GST-F5 (aa 1005-1313) (Figure 1G). A clinically relevant BRCA1 point mutation (M1775R) introduced into the BRCT domain of HA-tagged full length BRCA1 abolished BRCA1/NUMB binding as it had done for Abraxas-, CtIP-, and BACH1-BRCA1 binding (Kim et al., 2007; Manke et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007; Yu and Chen, 2004; Yu et al., 2003). By contrast, HA-BRCA1 bearing a RING domain mutation (C61G) bound NUMB normally (Figure S1B). Therefore, one or both F6 BRCT motifs bind(s) NUMB.In response to DNA damage, the SPTF sequence(s) that bind the BRCA1 BRCT motifs are phosphorylated by a suitable PIKK kinase. Since this modification is essential for SPTF/BRCT interactions (Manke et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003), we asked if BRCA1-NUMB binding is NUMB phosphorylation-dependent. Specifically, we IP\u2019d HA-tagged NUMB, exposed the IP to an exogenous phosphatase, and NUMB binding to BRCA1 decreased significantly (Figure S1C). ATM inhibitor addition also disrupted BRCA1-NUMB binding (Figure 1E), and mutagenizing NUMB serines 361 and 634 to alanines led the resulting double mutant (NUMB 2A) to exhibit reduced BRCA1 binding (Figure 1H). Thus, endogenous NUMB appears to interact directly and in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with one or both BRCA1-BRCT motifs and is, therefore, an authentic BRCA1 partner.Nuclear NUMB is a BRCA1 partner proteinNUMB was first identified in Drosophila as a membrane protein that regulates asymmetric vs symmetric cell division and NOTCH signaling (Guo et al., 1996; Uemura et al., 1989). At least four NUMB isoforms exist in mammalian cells; the longest controls cell proliferation, and the shortest affects differentiation (Dho et al., 1999; Verdi et al., 1999). A mammary-specific Numb knockout led to an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), development of stem cell-like properties, and tumorigenesis (Tosoni et al., 2015), much like the effects of BRCA1 depletion. Since endogenous NUMB binds BRCA1, we asked whether NUMB function is, at least in part, nuclear and, if so, whether it and BRCA1 co-participate in DNA damage control.Specifically, human MECs were fractionated into different subcellular fractions that were then assayed for NUMB (Xia et al., 2006) (Figure S1D). Both long and short NUMB isoforms were detected in the cytoplasmic (S100) and soluble nuclear (S400) fractions (Figure S1E\u2013H). Furthermore, the relative abundance of NUMB in the latter was comparable to that in the former. These findings were consistently observed in multiple cell lines (Figure S1E\u2013H), in keeping with others\u2019 results (Dhami et al., 2013). Moreover, the long isoform was enriched in CD44low MECs, while the short form was overexpressed in mesenchymal (U2OS) cells (Figure S1E). When exposed to cisplatin, the cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of NUMB in U2OS and MCF7 cells did not change (Figure S1G\u2013H). These data suggest that NUMB is both nuclear and cytoplasmic.While participating in certain types of DNA repair, BRCA1 concentrates in multiple, small, nuclear foci in S/G2 cells (Scully et al., 1997) or single, larger BRCA1-containing foci in G1/G0 cells (Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013; Lukas et al., 2011). In CD44low HME cells NUMB often colocalized with BRCA1 and 53BP1 in these single, large G0/G1 foci (Figure 2A\u2013D), which are also known as \u201c53BP1 bodies\u201d. They carry DNA damaged during a prior S/G2 period (Lukas et al., 2011). BRCA1/NUMB colocalization was confirmed by confocal image analysis (Figure 2B and Supplemental Video 1). By contrast, frequent co-localization of BRCA1 and NUMB in single, large foci was rare in S/G2 cells (Figure 2A\u2013F). Analogous results were obtained in MCF7 cells (Figure S2A\u2013B).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.NUMB-BRCA1 co-localization(A) Co-staining of NUMB and BRCA1 in WT CD44low MECs.

To determine if NUMB and/or BRCA1 loss results in an accumulation of G1 DNA damage, we searched for 53BP1 foci in cyclin A-negative cells. When NUMB- or BRCA1- depleted, these G1 cells overly accumulated large 53BP1 foci (3 or more foci/cell), suggesting the development of additional G1 DNA damage (Figures 2E\u2013F\nand\nS2C\u2013D).ATM/ATR signaling is essential for the formation of BRCA1 or 53BP1 foci after DNA damage. Hence, we asked if reduced ATM/ATR signaling abolishes the NUMB focus formation. Cell exposure to the ATM inhibitor, KU55933, suppressed single 53BP1 and NUMB focus formation (Figure 2G\u2013I). 53BP1 depletion also abolished BRCA1/NUMB focal co-localization (Figure 2J\u2013K). BRCA1 depletion also abolished NUMB focus formation, implying its BRCA1/53BP1 co-dependence (Figure S2E\u2013F).These observations fit with previous reports implying that BRCA1 loss promotes 53BP1-dependent NHEJ repair (Bunting et al., 2010). In addition, following the prior development of DNA damage, significantly more cells arrested in G1/G0 after BRCA1 or NUMB depletion, consistent with G1 checkpoint activation (Figure S2D). Thus, BRCA1/NUMB complexes respond to spontaneously arising DNA damage, at least in part, during G1/G0.NUMB sustains a DNA damage-associated differentiation program in MECsFailed ICL repair can promote aberrant basal-mesenchymal transdifferentiation of cultured, basal-like human MECs (Wang et al., 2016). In addition, at least three proteins-BRCA1, and its partners, FANCD2 and BRG1, participate in ICL repair-driven MEC differentiation control (Wang et al., 2016). Thus, we asked if NUMB is also required for ICL repair and found that depletion of NUMB in either CD44low or naive MCF10A MECs led to hypersensitivity to the ICL-inducing agents, cisplatin, and MMC (Figure 3A\u2013D), much as has been detected in CD44low MECs after BRCA1, BRG1, or FANCD2 depletion (Wang et al., 2016). To determine if ICL agent sensitivity was NUMB depletion-dependent, we expressed siNUMB-resistant WT NUMB or NUMB-2A mutant cDNAs in MCF10A cells and found that WT-NUMB, but not the mutant, rescued cisplatin sensitivity (Figure 3C\u2013D). This implied that NUMB phosphorylation participates in sustaining ICL repair. Therefore, NUMB, which was not formerly known to engage in DNA repair, much less ICL repair, is necessary for ICL repair in these cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.NUMB and MEC differentiation(A) Effects of overnight cisplatin exposure and NUMB depletion on CD44low MEC clonogenic survival.(B) Western Blot of NUMB in CD44low MECs before and after its shRNA-driven depletion.(C) Cisplatin effect on clonogenic survival of MCF10A cells with NUMB siRNA depletion vs control, upon expression of empty vector (EV), SiRNA-resistant NUMB-WT, or NUMB-2A.(D) Western Blot of NUMB in MCF10A cells after NUMB depletion or depletion and repletion with NUMB-WT or 2A.(E) Western Blot of NUMB and BRCA1 after transfecting CD44low MECs with the respective siRNAs.(F-G) Clonogenic survival after depleting NUMB or BRCA1 or both in CD44low MECs exposed overnight to increasing concentrations of cisplatin or MMC.(H-I) Effect of NUMB or HES1 depletion on monoubiquitination of FANCD2 after ICL damage in CD44low MECs or in U2OS cells.

Two-way ANOVA analysis was used for statistical significance. N.S.=Not Significant; *P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001.See also\nFigure S3.We also asked if BRCA1 and NUMB cooperate in ICL repair. When CD44low MECs were depleted of both NUMB and BRCA1, they became more sensitive to cisplatin or MMC than after depleting NUMB or BRCA1 alone. This suggests that BRCA1 and NUMB cooperate in ICL repair (Figure 3E\u2013G). In addition, NUMB depletion impaired nuclear focus formation by the key ICL repair protein, FANCD2 (Figure S3A\u2013B). Moreover, NUMB depletion in MECs led to failed FANCD2 monoubiquitination following MMC exposure (Figures 3H\u2013I\nand\nS3C). Thus, NUMB, like BRCA1 (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001), promotes FANCD2 recruitment to ICL damaged sites by supporting its monoubiquitination, a key event during ICL repair.Since inadequate ICL repair threatened the normal differentiation state of CD44low MECs, we asked if NUMB is required to maintain a normal human MEC differentiation state, much like its bound partner, BRCA1. We analyzed CD44low HME cells (epithelial) and their BRCA1-depleted, aberrantly transdifferentiated CD44high derivatives (Wang et al., 2016). The former expressed relatively high levels of E-Cadherin and \u0394Np63 and a low level of ZEB1, while CD44high cells revealed the opposite phenotype, reflecting their respective epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes (Figure 3J).NUMB also underwent a dramatic isoform switch as CD44low cells experienced BRCA1 depletion-driven EMT (Figure 3J). CD44low HME cells expressed a relatively high level of the NUMB long and a low level of the short isoform, while BRCA1-depleted, aberrantly transdifferentiated CD44high cells revealed the opposite pattern (Figure 3J). qPCR also revealed a significant decrease of the long and an increase of short isoform-encoding mRNA (Figure S3D). Using specific siRNAs, we selectively depleted each isoform and validated that the two bands represent the two, above-noted isoform species (Figure S3E).To test further whether a suitable NUMB isoform switch and MEC differentiation maintenance are linked, we stably introduced NUMB-short cDNA (siRNA-resistant) or an empty vector into CD44low MECs. Using a NUMB siRNA targeting its native 3\u2019UTR, the endogenous NUMB long isoform was efficiently depleted while NUMB-short cDNA expression was unaffected (Figure 3K).Depleting endogenous NUMB-long or overexpressing NUMB-short in otherwise unmanipulated cells led to only a subtle MEC morphology effect with most cells retaining their epithelial state (Figure S3F). By contrast, the combination of both triggered a clear change to mesenchymal morphology (Figure S3F), a marked shift from CD44low to CD44high cells (Figure S3G\u2013H), and reduced expression of E-Cadherin, and overexpression of Vimentin (Figure 3K), similar to the results of a loss of BRCA1, BRG1, or FANCD2 expression. NUMB-long depletion followed by NUMB-short overexpression also led to a decrease in \u0394Np63 expression (Figure 3K), which is a driver of DNA damage-associated MEC dedifferentiation (Wang et al, 2016). Interestingly, two, human, basal-like BC cell lines also overexpressed the short isoform unlike untransformed MECs (Figure S3I), suggesting that a general isoform switch might accompany MEC tumorigenesis. Thus, like BRCA1 depletion, purposely altering the ambient ratio of NUMB long/short isoform expression in human MECs perturbed their differentiation state. Moreover, NUMB, like BRCA1 and its partners, BRG1 and FANCD2, is necessary for ICL repair, failure of which elicits an EMT.HES1 links BRCA1 and NUMB in ICL repairThe finding of a NUMB contribution to ICL repair and MEC differentiation maintenance prompted the question of whether NOTCH signaling, a NUMB-influenced function (Flores et al., 2014), underlies the latter. Of note, the NOTCH pathway transcription factor (TF), HES1, normally interacts with certain Fanconi pathway core proteins and is required for proper ICL repair (Tremblay et al., 2008). Moreover, HES1 depletion rendered CD44low MECs hypersensitive to cisplatin and MMC exposure (Figure 4A\u2013C).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.HES1 facilitates BRCA1/NUMB-dependent ICL-repair(A-B) Effects of overnight cisplatin (A) or MMC (B) exposure and HES1 depletion on CD44low MEC clonogenic survival.

The corresponding cell extracts were IP\u2019d with myc Ab followed by IB.See also\nFigure S4.Like NUMB depletion, HES1 depletion also impaired cisplatin/ICL-driven FANCD2 focus formation in CD44low MECs (Figure S4A). By contrast, neither HES1 nor NUMB depletion altered etoposide sensitivity (data not shown). In addition, HES1 depletion led to defective MMC-driven FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure 3H\u2013I), similar to either BRCA1 or NUMB depletion. HES1 expression was also lower in BRCA1-depleted CD44high than in mock-treated CD44low MECs (Figure S4B\u2013C). These observations fit well with the finding that BRCA1-depleted CD44high MECs also manifest a defect in ICL repair (Wang et al., 2016).To probe the context in which HES1 functions in ICL repair, we asked if BRCA1, like other FANC proteins, interacts with HES1. Indeed, BRCA1 co-IP\u2019d with endogenous HES1, FANCD2, and NUMB (Figure 4D). NUMB-WT also co-IP\u2019d with HES1 and FANCD2 (Figure 4E), and the ATM inhibitor KU55933 disrupted BRCA1-NUMB (Figure 1E) and NUMB-HES1 binding (Figure 4F). Importantly, mutations of NUMB phosphorylation sites (in the 2A mutant) reduced NUMB binding to HES1, and to other DNA damage repair proteins, i.e., BRCA1, FANCD2, and BARD1 (Figure 4E), suggesting that NUMB phosphorylation contributes to BRCA1-NUMB-HES1 complex integrity. Indeed, BRCA1 bound HES1 weakly after siNUMB expression (Figure 4G). BRCA1/NUMB co-IP was also perturbed when HES1 was depleted (Figure 4G). These results imply that a) BRCA1, NUMB, and HES1 co-populate a common biochemical complex(es) that contribute(s) to ICL repair and b) the absence of any of them compromises BRCA1-NUMB-HES1 complex formation.BRCA1 also tethers both CtIP and FANCD2 to damaged chromatin (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2006), and the latter proteins are both required for crosslink lesion resolution (Murina et al., 2014; Unno et al., 2014). Therefore, since HES1-NUMB-BRCA1 complex formation depends upon all three proteins being simultaneously available, we asked if HES1 or NUMB is also required for the interaction of FANCD2 and CtIP with BRCA1. Indeed, when either NUMB or HES1 was depleted, BRCA1/CtIP/FANCD2 complex formation and the capacity for ICL repair (Figures 3,\u200b,4)4) also decreased. Therefore,BRCA1/FANCD2/CtIP/NUMB/HES1 interactivity may be necessary for proper ICL repair and, thus, for MEC differentiation maintenance.To assess HES1 participation in MEC differentiation maintenance, we stably depleted it in CD44low MECs and succeeded in isolating multiple, derivative CD44high clones. The latter exhibited mesenchymal morphology while CD44low cells remained largely epithelial. Western blotting also showed that HES1-depleted CD44high cells exhibited high ZEB1 and Vimentin and low E-Cadherin expression, consistent with EMT development (Figure S4E\u2013F). These HES1-depleted CD44high cells also exhibited spontaneously arising DNA damage in the form of anaphase bridges (Figure S4G). Therefore, similar to BRCA1, FANCD2, BRG1, and NUMB, HES1 also sustains an ICL DNA damage repair-associated differentiation program in MECs.To investigate the hypothesis that a CD44low to CD44high MEC transition represents a step during mammary tumorigenesis, we compared the soft agar colony formation ability of CD44low and CD44high cells that arose after BRCA1 depletion. CD44high cells formed agar colonies much more efficiently (>100 fold) than CD44low cells (Figure S4H\u2013I). This is consistent with DNA damage-associated transdifferentiation that appears after BRCA1 depletion representing a step towards BC development.Loss of BRCA1 function in luminal MECs promotes basal-like mammary tumorigenesisTo understand how BRCA1 loss affects luminal MEC fate and promotes BC development, we established a mouse BRCA1 BC model. It involved the intraductal injection of a Cre-expressing adenovirus under Krt8 promoter control (Ad-K8-Cre), leading to floxed Brca1 and/or Trp53 knockout and simultaneous activation of a conditional YFP-expressing Cre-reporter [Rosa26-LSL-YFP (R26Y)] in luminal MECs (Tao et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2017) (Figure 5A). Of note, Cre-mediated excision of floxed exons 22-24 of mouse Brca1 (McCarthy et al., 2007), resulted in disruption of the NUMB/CtIP/Abraxas/BACH1-interacting BRCA1 BRCT domains.Open in a separate windowFigure 5.BRCA1 loss in luminal MECs promotes development of basal-like mammary tumors(A) Schematic diagrams depicting Cre-mediated excision of either a floxed transcriptional Stop cassette (STOP) in the R26Y reporter, floxed exons 2-10 in the Trp53L allele, and floxed exons 22-24 in the Brca1L allele, leading to YFP expression, and disruption of Trp53 and Brca1.(B) FACS analysis of MECs from virgin females with the indicated genotypes 3 days or 3 weeks after intraductal injection of Ad-K8-Cre.

This vector restricts Cre expression to luminal MECs (Tao et al., 2017); thus, YFP+ MECs were detected solely in the Lin\u2212CD24hiCD29lo; luminal FACS gate 3 days after injection, in Trp53L/L;Brca1L/L;R26Y (PBY) females, as well as in R26Y (WT) and Trp53L/L;R26Y (PY) controls (Figure 5B). Three weeks after injection, we began to detect YFP+ MECs in the basal MEC gate in injected PBY females, but not in injected R26Y and PY controls (Figure 5B\u2013C). Thus, induced BRCA1 loss in luminal MECs likely led to a luminal-to-basal cell fate change soon thereafter.We also detected more YFP+ MECs in injected PBY mice than in controls (Figure 5B). Quantitation of YFP+ MECs in females 2-weeks post-injection confirmed the presence of more proliferating p53/BRCA1-deficient MECs compared to p53-deficient or WT MECs (Figure S5A). These data imply that a) BRCA1 maintains a luminal MEC fate in vivo and b) a corresponding loss of a luminal and the emergence of a basal-like cell fate accompanied BRCA1 loss. The latter correlated with enhanced BRCA1/p53-deficient MEC proliferation.All Ad-K8-cre-injected PBY female mice eventually developed mammary tumors (first palpated 8-12 months post-injection, Figures 5D\nand\nS5B). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining showed that the resulting tumor cells expressed basal markers (e.g., K5, K14) (Figures 5E\nand\nS5C). By gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005), we compared their microarray expression profiles to expression signatures of human and murine BC subtypes (Pfefferle et al., 2013). The mouse Brca1-deleted tumors most closely resembled the human BLBC subtype and murine MycEx, p53null-BasalEx, and C3TagEx subtypes, each a model of BLBC (Pfefferle et al., 2013) (Figures 5F\nand\nS5D).Employing an intraductal injection approach, p53 loss, alone, in Krt8+ luminal MECs resulted in Claudin-low mammary tumors, possibly due to an acquisition of secondary mutations [e.g., 9qA1 (Yap1) or 6qA2 (Met) amplification (Tao et al., 2017)]. However, genes from such regions in p53/BRCA1-deficient tumors lacked signs of amplification-driven overexpression (Figure S5E). Thus, co-induced loss of BRCA1 and p53 drove luminal MECs to develop BLBC and not Claudin-low cancer. Others argue that human Claudin-low BC is not a prevalent BRCA1 disease (Madaras et al., 2016). Lastly, analysis of gene sets that reflect MaSC (Lim et al., 2010) and EMT (Gotzmann et al., 2006) programs (Figure 5G) suggests that these BRCA1-deficient tumor cells, being derived from luminal MECs originally, acquired aberrant basal and mesenchymal (b&m) gene expression programs after BRCA1 loss.Loss of BRCA1 function elicits a luminal to basal/mesenchymal changeOur mouse model revealed the emergence of premalignant basal-like MECs and mammary cancer from luminal MECs following induced BRCA1 loss. To determine if these p53/BRCA1-deficient MECs had acquired an abnormal in vivo differentiation state, we FACS-purified YFP+ MECs from the corresponding mice one month after Ad-K8-Cre injection. These cells then underwent RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Several mesenchymal/EMT genes (e.g., Vim, Zeb1, Zeb2) were upregulated (unlike the case of p53-deficient or WT MECs) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, GSEA revealed that multiple, mesenchymal/EMT-related gene sets were enriched, again only in the BRCA1/p53-deficient MECs (Figures 6B\nand\nS5F), accompanied by enrichment of a mammary LP gene set (Lim et al., 2010) (Figure 6B). The latter may reflect the LP origin of BRCA1 BLBC (Lim et al., 2009; Molyneux et al., 2010; Proia et al., 2011).Open in a separate windowFigure 6.Loss of BRCA1 function elicits a luminal to basal/mesenchymal fate change and accumulation of DNA damage(A) Expression (relative to that of WT cells, normalized=1, from bulk RNAseq) of select EMT-related genes in YFP+ cells sorted from MGs of PBY or PY or R26Y-only females 1 month after Ad-K8-Cre injection.(B) GSEA plots showing enrichment of EMT and LP-related gene sets in Trp53/Brca1-null MECs compared to WT or Trp53-null MECs, based on RNAseq data as in A.(C) qRT-PCR data revealing an upregulation of selected b&m genes in Trp53/Brca1-null organoid cells compared to those obtained from PY or R26Y-only control females following Ad-K8-Cre injection.

See also Figure S6D for quantification.See also\nFigures S5\u2013S6.To further assess the aberrant differentiation state of p53/BRCA1-deficient MECs, we purified YFP+ MECs by FACS 7 days after Ad-K8-Cre injection and cultured them as organoids. Although their organoid-forming efficiency was similar to that of p53-deficient and WT luminal MECs, the doubly deficient cells were larger when cultivated in the presence (rather than the absence) of B27, which includes progesterone (Figure S5G\u2013I). When cultivated in B27-free medium, only the doubly (and the p53-deficient) MECs still formed organoids. Moreover, the organoid-forming efficiency and size of the doubly deficient MECs were greater than those of p53-deficient and WT MECs (Figure S5H\u2013I). B27-independent growth of BRCA1-deficient MECs was observed previously (Lim et al., 2009; Sau et al., 2016). The differentiation status of MECs in organoids, when characterized by qRT-PCR analysis, also revealed an upregulation of expression of b&m genes only in p53/BRCA1-deficient cells (Figure 6C\u2013D).We also detected 53BP1+ cells in these p53/BRCA1-deficient organoids, a sign of ongoing DNA damage. Furthermore, 53BP1 foci were more abundant in cells that manifest aberrant differentiation (i.e., exhibited robust K14 expression) (Figure S5J). Thus, aberrant differentiation of p53/BRCA1-deficient MECs was accompanied by DNA damage, as in BRCA1-depleted human MECs (Wang et al., 2016).Single cell expression analysis during the evolution of BRCA1-deficient tumorsTo assess the fate change of p53/BRCA1-deficient luminal MECs in vivo, we performed single cell (sc)RNAseq analysis (10X Genomics) on YFP+ MECs FACS-purified from injected MGs and from mammary tumors that arose in Ad-K8-Cre-injected PBY females. We used the Seurat tool (Butler et al., 2018) to analyze the top-50 enriched genes in each cell cluster (Supplemental Data 1).Two weeks after Ad-K8-Cre injection, we found that YFP-marked MECs included 5 luminal MEC clusters. The largest 4 were composed of hormone receptor (HR)+ luminal cells, that expressed Prlr, Pgr, and an estrogen receptor co-factor gene, Cited1 (Figure 6E). There was also a cluster that expressed Csn3 and Wfdc18 (Figure 6E\nand\nSupplemental Datal), likely reflecting HR\u2212 MECs with an LP/alveolar luminal phenotype (Giraddi et al., 2018). There was also a small cluster of MECs that expressed b&m genes (e.g., Acta2, Krt5, Krt14, Sparc, Postn, Igfbp7, Serpinh1, Sfn) and myoepithelial differentiation genes (e.g., Myl9, Mylk, and Tpm2) (B cluster, Figure 6E and Supplemental Data 1). The presence of this cluster is consistent with that of a sizeable number of YFP+ MECs in the basal FACS gate at this early post-Ad-K8-Cre injection stage (Figure 5B\u2013C).Five months post-injection, the YFP-marked MECs now included a large LP cluster (HR\u2212, high expression of Csn3 and Wfdc18) and a much smaller HL cluster (again expressing Prlr and Cited 1, Figure 6F). There was also a distinct EMT cluster expressing mesenchymal genes (e.g., Sparc, Postn, Aebp1, Figure 6F and Supplemental Data 1). Cells in this cluster may be related to those in the Basal-like cluster observed at 2-weeks (Figure 6E, cluster B) that subsequently underwent EMT and expressed mesenchymal genes (e.g., Sparc and Postn), and retained expression of the myoepithelial gene, Tpm (Figure 6E\u2013F).In addition, multiple, highly enriched RNAs in the 5-month LP cluster were the same as those in the LP cluster 2-weeks post injection, possibly reflecting a common LP origin (Figure 6E\u2013F and Supplemental Data 1). However, unlike MECs analyzed at 2-weeks, many cells in the LP cluster at 5-months had begun to express Sox4 (Figure 6F), a known EMT inducer (Tiwari et al., 2013), and several b&m genes initially found to be highly expressed in the Basal-like cluster at 2-weeks (e.g., Sfn, Igfbp7, Serpinh1, compare Figure 6E\ncluster B and\nFigure 6F cluster LP). Overall, these and bulk RNAseq data from the YFP+ premalignant MECs suggest that a) HR\u2212 LPs are the main MEC population detected following the loss of BRCA1 and p53, and that b) YFP+, p53/BRCA1-deficient LPs and basal-like cells continued to undergo b&m transdifferentiation over time.In the two tumors analyzed, we observed 1-2 cluster(s) of tumor epithelial cells as well as a cluster of mesenchymal cells (possibly reflecting stromal cells, though some of these cells may be tumor epithelial cells undergoing more complete mesenchymal transdifferentiation) (Figure 6G\u2013H). The tumor epithelial cell clusters (Figure 6G\u2013H\nand\nSupplemental Data 1) largely reflect their LP origin, given that they expressed LP/alveolar luminal genes (e.g., Sox9, Csn3, Wfdc18, Lcn2, Mfge8, Phldal, Tm4sf1, Fxyd3). Furthermore, many cells in these clusters also expressed mesenchymal (e.g., Sparc, Postn, Bgn, Mgp, Igfbp7, Serpinh1, Aebp1) and EMT inducer genes such as Sox4, suggesting that they might be undergoing an EMT.Using another t-SNE plotting approach (10X Genomics), we observed that tumor epithelial and mesenchymal cell clusters self-organized in a manner that reflected transdifferentiation from a luminal (purple-lettered genes) toward a mesenchymal fate (red and green-lettered genes) (Figure S6A). These included clusters that manifested signs of an LP origin (purple lettering), as reflected by their expression of LP/alveolar luminal genes (e.g. Sox9, Elf5, Kit, Csn3, Wfdc18). Yet other clusters seemed to be gradually losing expression of the pan-luminal gene Krt8, the EMT inhibitor/LP gene Elf5 (Chakrabarti et al., 2012) and the epithelial gene Cdh1, while gaining expression of the basal gene (Krt14) and eventually, certain EMT-associated TF-encoding (e.g., Zeb1, Twist1, Snai1, Sox4) and mesenchymal genes (e.g., Cdh2, Vim, Sparc, Postn, Aebpl). At the top of Figure S6A, in both tumors, an LP-like tumor cell cluster is on the left side, an EMT-like tumor cell cluster is in the middle/middle right, and a mesenchymal cell cluster is on the right.Compared to cells in the mesenchymal (M) clusters, which might be stromal cells, cells in the EMT clusters are tumor cells that manifest signs of an epithelial origin, as they expressed the above-noted LP/alveolar luminal genes (e.g., Csn3, Wfdc18, Sox9, Figure S6A). In tumor 1, cells in the EMT cluster also expressed Krt8 (Figure S6A left).Interestingly, cells in the B/M (basal/mesenchymal) and EMT clusters expressed several genes, defined above, that appear to reflect cell fate dynamics over time (e.g., basal: Sfn; mesenchymal: Sparc, Postn, Aebp1) (Figures 6E\u2013H\nand\nS6A). These clusters may be clinically relevant, since, from public database sources, we found that, among human BLBC cases, those with higher expression levels of any of these 4 genes experienced a worse clinical outcome (Figure S6B).Loss of BRCA1 function causes the accumulation of DNA damageTo determine whether the kinetics of cell fate change correlate with an accumulation of DNA damage in BRCA1/p53-deleted MECs, we stained MGs from Ad-K8-Cre--injected PBY females for DNA damage markers. A small number of 53BP1+ cells could already be detected one month after injection (Figure 6I). Fewer still were detected in p53-depleted MGs, and none were found in WT MGs (Figure S6C\u2013D).Five months after BRCA1/p53 deletion, the abundance of 53BP1+ cells had increased significantly in PBY MGs (Figures 6I and S6D). Subsequently, in the resulting tumors, most tumor epithelial cells exhibited nuclear 53BP1 staining (Figures 6I and S6E, green arrowheads), whereas the non-epithelial cells (Figure S6E, white arrowheads) in these tumors did not. There was an analogous pattern of \u03b3-H2AX accumulation in p53/BRCA1-deficient MECs and tumor cells (Figure S6F).Collectively, these data imply that normal differentiation maintenance by BRCA1 in luminal MECs is a major suppressor of BLBC development. By contrast, loss of BRCA1 (in a p53-deficient background) in primary luminal MECs resulted in the emergence of aberrantly differentiated, progesterone-independent, hyperproliferating, b&m-like cells. BRCA1 deficiency-linked aberrant MEC differentiation gave way to BLBC development, and both were accompanied by abundant DNA damage that likely arose, at least in part, from a defect in BRCA1 function.Inadequate DNA repair promotes aberrant transdifferentiation in primary luminal MECsTo further test if failed BRCA1 DNA repair function results in aberrant, ex vivo MEC transdifferentiation, we exposed Trp53\u2212/\u2212 organoids derived from sorted YFP+ luminal MECs of Ad-K8-Cre-injected PY mice to cisplatin (0.2\u03bcM, 1 week). After drug withdrawal, the cells were maintained in organoid culture for 14 days. By comparison with mock-treated cells, the cisplatin-treated cells experienced a dramatic increase in basal-like organoids with upregulated K5 expression (Figures 7A\nand\nS7A). When compared with mock-treated cells, 53BP1 staining reflected persistent cisplatin DNA damage in these cells (Figures 7A\nand\nS7B).Open in a separate windowFigure 7.Inadequate ICL repair promotes luminal to basal/mesenchymal transdifferentiation(A) IF staining for K5 and 53BP1 in organoids (as in Figure 6C\u2013D), with or without cisplatin or etoposide treatment.

Expression had risen to a level comparable to that detected in drug-free BRCA1/p53-deficient organoid cells (Figure 7B), suggesting that cisplatin treatment had, at least in part, phenocopied BRCA1 loss in p53-deficient luminal MECs. The same was true in human MECs (Wang et al., 2016).To determine whether this cell fate change resulted from DNA damage, in general, or more specifically from ICL DNA damage, we exposed p53-deficient luminal organoids to etoposide and then subjected the cells to the same analyses. Unlike cisplatin, etoposide exposure, which induces topoisomerase II-linked DSB as opposed to ICL (Baldwin and Osheroff, 2005), led to a significant increase in mRNA expression of basal (Trp63 and Krt5) but not mesenchymal markers (Vim and Zebl) (Figures 7B\nand\nS7A\u2013B), in keeping with our previous observations (Wang et al., 2016). Taken together, these data indicate that ongoing DSB-like DNA damage triggers a luminal to basal cell fate change in primary MECs and that ICL DNA damage induced by cisplatin or a loss of BRCA1 function phenocopy one another, leading to the acquisition by these transdifferentiated basal cells of a mesenchymal fate.Next, we asked if certain subunits of BRCA1-containing multiprotein complexes participate in DNA damage-associated differentiation maintenance in primary mouse luminal MECs. We disrupted NUMB expression in p53-deficient luminal organoid cells, using CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure S7D). As a positive control, we similarly disrupted BRCA1 in another aliquot of the same organoid cells and confirmed the absence of BRCA1 nuclear foci in proliferating organoid MECs (Figure S7C). As negative controls, we targeted either the mouse Rosa26 locus (leading to DSB in a neutral genomic region) or an unrelated plant gene (which is not expected to induce DNA breaks in mouse cells). Similar to BRCA1-loss, NUMB loss resulted in larger organoids by comparison with controls (Figures 7C\nand\nS7E); qRT-PCR analysis revealed upregulation of both b&m gene expression in NUMB-deficient organoid cells, like what occurred in BRCA1-deficient cells (Figure 7D).In addition, loss of either NUMB or BRCA1 led to an accumulation of DNA damage in aberrantly differentiated MECs, as measured by comet assay (Figures 7E\u2013F and S7F). More specifically, their DNA damage levels were significantly higher than those of MECs exposed to a Rosa26 gRNA, which should only have elicited a low level of DSB (Figure S7F). Thus, the DNA damage associated with loss of either NUMB or BRCA1 was not due to irrelevant CRISPR editing.Lastly, since HES1 links BRCA1 and NUMB to ICL DNA repair, we also tested if loss of HES1 in luminal MECs phenocopies the outcome of either BRCA1-loss or NUMB-loss. HES1 expression was disrupted in p53-deficient luminal organoid cells by CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure S7G). Similar to BRCA1- or NUMB-loss, HES1 loss also resulted in larger organoids (Figures S7H\u2013I) and an upregulation of both b&m gene expression (Figure S7J).Therefore, both NUMB and HES1 recapitulated the role of BRCA1 in suppressing a luminal to b&m transition of primary mouse luminal MECs. Importantly, in human BCs, both NUMB and HES1 are expressed at significantly lower levels in BLBC than other subtypes (except the luminal B subtype, Figure S7K), consistent with these two genes playing supporting roles as ICL-repair proteins during the suppression of BLBC development. DiscussionBRCA1 prevents in vivo DNA damage from promoting transdifferentiation of normal luminal MECs to basal-like cells that manifest a mesenchymal phenotype. Aberrant luminal MEC differentiation likely contributes to BRCA1 BLBC development (Lim et al., 2009; Molyneux et al., 2010; Proia et al., 2011). Others have detected heterogeneity in the results of primary MEC analysis performed on cells of BRCA1+/+ and tumor-free BRCA1 mutation carriers (Nakshatri et al., 2015). Therefore, we undertook a prospective, comparative analysis of primary MECs from BRCA1-mutated and relevant control mice to determine if aberrant MEC differentiation accompanies BRCA1 loss in tumor-free mammary tissue.Evidence of such a process was detected. Its central outcomes mimicked the aberrant DNA damage-associated transdifferentiative phenotypes induced in human MECs by BRCA1 p220 depletion or depletion of certain p220-associated proteins (Wang et al., 2016). Where tested, these DNA damage-associated outcomes developed rapidly after in vivo BRCA1 luminal cell depletion and persisted during BRCA1 mouse mammary tumorigenesis. Therefore, they may be signs of molecular missteps that lead to BRCA1-associated BC. This process operates in humans and in mice and is summarized in Figure 7G.Aberrant LPs exist both in human BRCA1 mutation carriers and mouse models (Lim et al., 2009; Molyneux et al., 2010; Proia et al., 2011). However, the mechanism by which a BRCA1 functional defect results in aberrant luminal MEC differentiation followed by BLBC has been unclear.Four, generic questions were posed during this study. First, does an integrated, BRCA1-containing, ICL repair-promoting process contribute to MEC differentiation control? If so, are any of its participants newly detected and how do they operate? Does such a process sustain normal MEC differentiation a) in multiple mammalian species, b) both in vitro and in vivo, and c) by executing the same steps in both instances? Lastly, is its failure material to BRCA1 BC development?The participants in this process are, at a minimum, BRCA1 and four, BRCA1-associated proteins-two established partners, BRG1 and FANCD2, a formerly suspected one, HES1 (Buckley et al, 2013), and a new one, NUMB. Yet others may exist. Some contribute to DSB repair (Houghtaling et al., 2005; Scully et al., 1997), and all contribute to ICL repair (Kim and D\u2019Andrea, 2012; Tremblay et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016). Depletion of any member of this group not only compromised ICL repair, it also led to the mesenchymal transdifferentiation of cultured, basal-like human and primary mouse luminal MECs analyzed during mouse BRCA1 mammary tumorigenesis.All of these associated proteins not only contribute to ICL repair, they likely do so in an organized, possibly even an integrated manner. In particular, much of the BRCA1 binding to the above-noted partner proteins depended upon it also binding to each subunit, individually. Leaving one out triggered a defect in multi-partner binding to BRCA1. BRCA1/multi-subunit complex formation is, therefore, subunit-interdependent, as if intact complex formation represents a well-organized and cooperative process. Each subunit that was tested also appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of normal, cultured basal-like human MEC differentiation and proper ICL repair. Since ICL damage, alone, triggered aberrant MEC transdifferentation, we suspect that subunit-interdependent BRCA1 complex formation and ICL repair contribute to efficient MEC differentiation maintenance.The studies reported here also revealed that the nature of the breakdown in MEC differentiation differed when cells were exposed to ICL vs DSB -inducing compounds. Defective DSB repair led to a luminal to basal change, while ICL damage contributed to a luminal to b&m change. Therefore, the quality of DNA damage affected the nature of its biological outcome. Better still, the mammary cancers that emerged from BRCA1-deficient luminal MECs were preceded by both advancing DNA damage and aberrant luminal transdifferentiation. These findings imply that BRCA1 elimination-dependent premalignant DNA damage and its associated luminal-to-b&m phenotypic changes represent vital contributions to BRCA1 mammary tumorigenesis.NUMB and HES1, both BRCA1 partners, contribute to ICL repair-driven MEC differentiation and communicate with one another (Flores et al., 2014; Buckley et al, 2013). HES1 also positively influences Fanconi core complex ICL repair function (Tremblay et al., 2008). Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that they co-participate in BRCA1 BC suppression.In both p53/BRCA1-deficient tumors that were analyzed, scRNAseq data showed that most tumor cells expressed LP/alveolar luminal markers, consistent with them having an LP origin (Lim et al., 2009; Molyneux et al., 2010; Proia et al., 2011). Importantly, a subset of tumor cells (e.g., the B/M and EMT clusters in tumor 1 and the EMT cluster in tumor 2, Figure S6A) expressed both LP/alveolar luminal markers and basal and/or mesenchymal genes. The premalignant single cell data and that derived from both tumors reflect the operation of an overarching luminal to mesenchymal transdifferentiation process. It involved an enlarging LP population and/or a rare basal-like population, that then underwent mesenchymal transdifferentiation (Figure S7L\u2013N).The subsequent development of BRCA1-deficient mammary tumor cells can be explained by at least three models (Figure S7L\u2013N). In one, LP cells represent the origin of each primary tumor (Figure S7L); and basal-like, EMT, and mesenchymal tumor cells are all derived from them. In another model, the cells in the Basal-like cluster originated from the earlier growth of a once relatively rare, Ad-K8-Cre targeted basal cell species that subsequently underwent EMT; alternatively, LP cells underwent aberrant expansion, gradually acquired b&m features, and became EMT cells. In both cases, the EMT cells may manifest multi-potent cancer stem cell activity (Figure S7M). In the third model, the tumor may be polyclonal, with cells in the LP and Basal-like clusters progressing independently and then jointly forming a tumor (Figure S7N).This notwithstanding, both LPs and basal-like cells revealed increasing mesenchymal gene expression, which correlated with and, possibly, even depended upon an accumulation of endogenous ICL or ICL-like DNA damage. Taken together, these findings suggest that linked defects in BRCA1-driven multi-protein complex formation, repair of ICL or ICL-like DNA damage, and MEC transdifferentiation suppression conspire to promote BRCA1 tumorigenesis. Our results also provide a first, longitudinal, mechanism-related picture of certain key events that give rise to BRCA1 mammary cancer.

To target luminal MECs in Trp53L/L;R26Y, Trp53L/L;Brca1L/L;R26Y, or R26Y-only adult female mice (2-3 months of age), animals were anaesthetized; and Ad-K8-Cre adenovirus [diluted in injection medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.1% Bromophenol blue and 0.01 M CaCl2)] was introduced into ducts of the #4 inguinal mammary gland (MG) via intraductal injection (Tao et al., 2014). Female mice were then monitored weekly for any sign of mammary tumor development. Once tumors were detected via palpation or visual inspection, animals were monitored 2\u20133 times per week for subsequent tumor growth. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.Immunoblotting and ImmunoprecipitationImmunoblotting was carried out using standard methods. In brief, cells were lysed for 2 hours on ice in NETN-250 lysis buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40 and 10% Glycerol) with proteinase inhibitors (Roche), and the lysate was cleared of residual cells by centrifugation. ~ 20-30\u03bcg of extract were electrophoresed in each lane of a 412% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) using MOPS buffer. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 350 mA for 3h at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were blocked in 3% non-fat milk in PBS + 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. After a brief wash with PBST, the membranes were incubated with Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE) for 2 hours at room temperature. The membranes were developed by ECL chemiluminescence (Thermo fisher). Primary antibodies are listed in the key resource table.To generate different subcellular fractions, cells were lysed for 5 minutes on ice in NETN-100 lysis buffer (100mM NaCl) and centrifuged at 8,000rpm for 5 minutes. The resulting pellets were suspended in the NETN 400 (400 mM NaCl) for 1 hour on ice and centrifuged at 13,200 for 10 minutes. The insoluble chromatin pellet was then suspended in 0.2N HCL for 15 minutes on ice and neutralized with an identical volume of 1M Tris-HCl (pH=8) and labelled p400. After clearance by centrifugation, the resulting fractions (S100/S400/P400) were subjected to immunoblotting assays.Immunoprecipitation was performed with NETN 250-based (250mM NaCl) soluble extracts, unless otherwise specified. To probe the BRCA1 and NUMB interaction, 293T cells were transiently transfected with HA-BRCA1 or myc-BRCA1 or Flag-NUMB plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 72 hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed with NETN 250. Cellular extracts were then incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein A-coupled Sepharose beads (GE) at 4\u00b0C overnight with continuous rocking. The resulting immunobeads were washed 4 times in NETN 100 buffer and suspended in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer (BIO-RAD) and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above.To analyze endogenous BRCA1/NUMB interactions, 239T or MCF7 cell extracts were incubated with BRCA1 antibody (D9) or NUMB antibody (Bethyl lab) and the resulting complex were analyzed by immunoblotting.To analyze the subunit interdependence of the BRCA1/HES1/NUMB/FANCD2/CTIP complex formation, 293T cells were transfected with both myc-BRCA1 and the indicated siRNA species. Transfected cells were collected after 72 hours, extracted, and the extracts incubated with myc antibody (9E10) at 4\u00b0C overnight. myc-BRCA1 associated protein complexes were then analyzed by immunoblotting.The antibodies used in these experiments were listed in the key resource tables.GST \u2013BRCA1 Fragment Binding experimentsGST-BRCA1 fragments (#1-#6) have been described (Chen et al., 1998; Scully et al., 1997). These GST-BRCA1 fusion proteins were synthesized in E.Coli and purified on glutathione-sepharose beads (GE healthcare 17075601). Cell extract from 293T cells was incubated with bead-bound GST fusion proteins or GST beads only. The bound complexes were then analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as described above. Coomassie blue staining that revealed the relative abundance of each GST fusion protein is indicated above each arrow.Mammary gland cell preparation and flow cytometryInguinal MGs injected with Ad-K8-Cre were dissected, minced, and incubated for 1\u20131.5 h in digestion medium (DMEM/F12 with 2% Penicillin/ Streptomycin, 0.1 mg ml\u22121 Gentamicin, 0.6% Nystatin, 2 mg ml\u22121 Collagenase A, 0.096 mg ml\u22121 Hyaluronidase) at 37 \u00b0C with continuous shaking. After digestion, the cells/tissues were treated sequentially with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (37 \u00b0C, 2 min), 5 mg ml\u22121 dispase with DNasel (0.1 mg ml\u22121, Sigma, St Louis, MO; 37 \u00b0C, 5 min), and cold red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (on ice, 2\u20133 min). Between each treatment step, cells/tissues were washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS containing 5% FCS. After treatment with RBC lysis buffer, cells/tissues were filtered through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer and washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS/5% FCS, to obtain a single-cell suspension (Tao et al., 2017). The resulting MECs are depleted with the CD45, CD31 and TER119 lineage markers and only YFP positive cells were used for analysis of CD24 and CD29. Flow cytometric (FACS) analysis and cell sorting were performed with a FACSAria sorter (BD Biosciences). Antibodies used in FACS analysis and cell sorting were purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA) and included, CD24-PE (clone M1/69, 12-0242-83; 1:250), CD29-APC (clone eBioHMb1-1, 120291-82; 1:250), and biotinylated lineage (Lin) markers: CD31 (clone 390, 13-0311-85; 1:100), CD45 (clone 30-F11, 17-0495-82; 1:100) and TER119 (clone Ter-119, 13-5921-85; 1:100) .Mammary organoid culture and manipulationThe long-term organoid culture system used in this study was developed with minor optimization based on the original formulation from (Drost et al., 2016) and adapted from (Jarde et al., 2016), and (Sachs et al., 2018), and (Duarte et al., 2018). Sorted YFP+ MECs were embedded in 15-20 \u03bcl Matrigel (Corning, 356231) in a 48-well plate, allowed to solidify for 5-10 mins, and then overlaid with DMEM/F12 advance media, supplemented with HEPES (1:100, GibcoTM, 15630080), GlutaMAX (1:100, GibcoTM, 35050-061), B27 (1:50, Thermo Fisher, 17504044), 100 ng/ml A83-01 (Tocris Bioscience, 2939), 50 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech, AF-100-15), 100 ng/ml Noggin (PeproTech, 120-10C), 500 ng/ml commercial R-spondin1 (Peprotech, 120-38) or conditioned R-spondin1 medium from RSPO cells (Cultrex, 3700-100-01), 100 ng/ml Nrg1 (R&D, 396-HB), 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, Sigma Aldrich, Y0503) which is only necessary when organoids are first prepared, thawed, or when organoids are dissociated to single cells. The organoid culture medium including the supplementaries described above will be referred to as \u201cfull medium\u201d for the subsequent work. The procedure for organoid transfection was developed with modifications mainly based on the protocol described by (Schwank et al., 2013). Briefly, following one day of culture in full medium, as described above, organoids were infected with lentivirus for 2-3 days before selection was initiated in full medium containing puromycin (1 \u03bcg/ml) for ~ one week. Stably infected and edited organoid cells were expanded in full medium.For drug treatment of organoids, cisplatin (final concentration=0.2\u03bcM, Sigma) and etoposide (final concentration=0.1\u03bcM, Sigma) were added to relevant full organoid culture medium for ~7 days. Drug-treated organoids were then digested for single cell suspensions by TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12604-013) for ~15 min in the cell culture incubator. Single organoid cells were re-plated in a 48-well plate and cultured in full organoid medium without cisplatin or etoposide treatment for another 14 days. At this point, organoids were digested and collected for RNA extraction, or single organoid cells were cultured in an 8-well chamber slide for at least 24 h followed by co-immunofluorescent staining for K5, 53BP1 and DAPI. In all these experiments, 250 \u03bcl of full organoid culture medium was added per well, and these organoids were maintained in a 37 \u00b0C humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence (IF) stainingPrior to embedding organoids in paraffin, organoids suspended in Matrigel were entirely embedded in Specimen Processing HistoGel\u2122 (Thermo Fisher, HG-4000-012), followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) for 2 hours and then overnight in 70% ethanol at room temperature. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining was performed on sections from MGs, mammary tumors and organoids. The IF staining was performed as described (Tao et al., 2017). Primary antibodies used included: anti-GFP (ab290, 1:500 or ab6673, 1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-Keratin 14 (K14) (PRB-155P, 1:400 or SIG-3476, 1:200, Covance, Dedham, MA), anti-Keratin 5 (K5) (PRB-160P, 1:500, Covance), antiKeratin 8 (K8) (MMS-162P, 1:200, Covance), anti-53BP-1 (BD 612522, 1:1000). For IF staining, the secondary antibodies used were: goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with AF488 (A11029, 1:250) or with AF647 (A31571, 1:250), donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with AF488 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Ab150129\",\"term_id\":\"62170947\",\"term_text\":\"AB150129\"}}Ab150129, 1:250), chicken anti-goat IgG conjugated with AF647 (A21469, 1:250), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with AF488 (A11008, 1:250) or with AF594 (A11037, 1:250), and goat anti-chicken IgG conjugated with AF594 (A11042, 1:250) or with AF488 (A11039, 1:250) (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were counterstained with DAPI (1 \u03bcg/ml).To stain mouse BRCA1 in the CRISPR/Cas9-affected organoids, organoids stably edited with gPlant/gRosa26/gBrca1/gNumb/ or gHes1 were first collected and resuspended as single cells and then seeded onto coverslips with overnight incubation. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed with PBS 3 times and permeablized with cold 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 3 hours and then with secondary antibodies for 1 hour, both at room temperature. After washing with PBST (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20), cells were then mounted with medium containing 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector lab H1500) and sealed with clear nail polish.Confocal microscope analysisConfocal images were captured as z-stacks (0.265gm thickness) using a Nikon Ti inverted microscope equipped with a CSU-X1 spinning disk head (Yokogawa), 100x oil objective (NA1.4; Nikon), and an iXon DU-897 EM-CCD camera (Andor). Confocal images were captured using Andor iQ2 software. HME cells for confocal imaging were cultured asynchronously on 1.5mm cover glasses at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS+0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were stained with mouse monoclonal \u03b1-BRCA1 antibody at 1:500 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS (sc-6954, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-NUMB antibody at 1:50 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS (A301-715A, Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) Secondary antibodies were FITC AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit (1:200 in PBS; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., 111-095-003) and Rhodamine Red-X AffiniPure goat anti-mouse (1:400 in PBS; Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories, Inc., 115-295-146). Image analysis was performed using the Fiji processing software package of ImageJ.Soft Agar AssayBottom layers were prepared in six well dishes with 0.6% noble agar (Difco 214220) in DMEM. HMECs were plated in a top layer composed of 0.3% agar in MEGM at a density of 12,500 cells per well. Each well was fed weekly with 1ml of MEGM. After three weeks, the media was aspirated and plates were fixed in a solution of 5% methanol and 5% acetic acid for 20-30 minutes, then stained overnight with 0.005% crystal violet in 10% ethanol. Crystal violet solution was aspirated prior to imaging and counting colonies. Counts represent the average of three wells.Clonogenic and Cell Growth AssaysTo measure cell growth, Cells were transfected with siLuc/siBRCA1/siNumb/ or siHes1 for 48 hours. ~300 cells/well were seeded in six-well plastic plates and treated with indicated drugs and cultivated for 10 days. Cells were fixed and visualized with crystal violet.To rescue NUMB depletion-associated ICL drug sensitivity, siRNA-resistant NUMB cDNA (WT or 2A) or empty vector was stably introduced into MCF10A cells by retrovirus infection followed by puromycin-based selection. The stable MCF10A-vector and MCF10A-NUMB (WT or 2A, both siRNA-resistant) -transduced cells were then transfected with siNUMB to deplete endogenous NUMB proteins and plated in 96 well plates (1,000 cells/well). These cells were exposed overnight to increasing concentrations of cisplatin. We measured the relative growth of NUMB-WT or NUMB-2A expressing MCF10A after siNUMB depletion by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) following the manufacture instructions.CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectorsThe lentiCRISPR-v2 plasmid was from Addgene (No. 52961, a gift from Dr, Feng Zhang). Two individual guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting Numb or Brca1 or Hes1 were designed based on http://crispr.mit.edu (with a high quality score of above 90). LentiGuide vectors constructed with gRNAs targeting the mouse Rosa26 region of mouse (gRosa26) and targeting a plant region (gPlant) were kind gifts from Prof. Richard Mass [Division of Genetics, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH)]. Sequences for all of these gRNAs are listed in the key resource table. Cloning of gRNAs in lentiCRISPR-v2 plasmid was performed as described (Shalem et al., 2014). All vectors were validated by Sanger sequencing. We produced concentrated lentiviral stocks, pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope protein, by transient transfection of their corresponding plasmids into 293T cells as previously described (Follenzi et al., 2000).Plasmid ConstructionThe NUMB long isoform was amplified from the PHAGE-CMV-dsRed-UBC-GFP-NUMB plasmid provided by Pengcheng Bu (Bu et al., 2013) and the NUMB short isoform was amplified from the Numb4-GFP plasmid provided by Dr. Hongyan Xing (Jiang et al., 2012). The amplified PCR products were then cloned into a vector with 3XHA or 3xFlag or an HA/Flag double tag.The NUMB S361A /S634A mutant was generated with the quickchange II site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Agilent 200523) followed by the manual instruction with following primers. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutations.siRNA and shRNAAll siRNAs were synthesized at Dharmacon Inc, and the sequences are listed in the key resource table. CD44low MECs were plated at 50% confluence, and the siRNAs were transfected with RNA MAX(Invitrogen) following the Manual\u2019s instructions.To test the effect of siRNA transfection on BRCA1/NUMB/53BP1/Cyclin A staining, cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hours, plated on coverslips, and allowed to incubate overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton, and then incubated with antibodies at room temperature.To test the effect of overexpression of short NUMB on differentiation, CD44low MECs stably infected with empty vector or short NUMB cDNA retrovirus were then transfected with SiLuc (Luc: luciferase) or SiNUMB. SiNUMB targeting its 3\u2019UTR depleted both endogenous short and long NUMB isoforms but had no effect on short NUMB cDNA.ShRNAs were delivered by lentivirus infection. Briefly, the shRNA and packaging plasmids (VSV-G and \u03948.9) were cotransfected into 293T cells using Lipfectomine 2000. Viral particles were collected at 48 and 72 hours after transfection. The supernatants were used for infection after filtration through 0.45 \u03bcM syringe filters. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (2\u03bcg/ml) and maintained in puromycin-containing MEGM. To produce retroviruses expressing HA/Flag-tagged NUMB, viral vectors were cotransfected with pMD-MLV and pMD-G using Lipfectomine 2000 in 293T cells. Supernatants were collected 48 or 72 hours after transfection and centrifuged to concentrate virus for infection.Comet AssayAlkaline comet assays were performed on mouse MECs engineered with CRISPR/Cas9 (gPlant/gRosa26/gNumb/ or gBrca1) using the CometAssay kit (Trevigen, 4250-050-K) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. ~ 100-300 cells were analyzed in each experiment.Anaphase bridgesProliferating CD44high cells following HES1 depletion were plated at ~ 60% confluence overnight, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes, and stained with 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs) prior to microscopy.Microarray expression profiling and analysisTotal RNAs from YFP+ MECs sorted from R26Y females ~2 weeks after intraductal induction of Ad-K8-Cre or from Trp53/Brca1-null mammary tumors were prepared using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The microarray experiment was performed in Dana-Faber Cancer Institute Core facility as described in (Tao et al., 2017). All arrays were normalized and processed in GenePattern (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the Molecular Signatures Database v5.2 (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) and the standalone GSEA program (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.isp). Gene sets for mouse or human intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were extracted from a recent study (Pfefferle et al., 2013) by using upregulated genes (SAM fold change >1) for each subtype, with SAM g-value of 0. A Multiple Experiment Viewer (MeV) program (http://www.tm4.org/) was used to visualize the expression data.RNA isolation and Bulk RNA sequencingSingle-cell suspensions of mammary glands (MGs, from Trp53L/L;Brca1L/L;R26Y or Trp53L/L;R26Y or R26Y female mice 1 month post Ad-K8-Cre injection were obtained as described in the \u201cMammary gland cell preparation and flow cytometry\u201d procedure. Cell preps were stained with DAPI and DAPFYFP+ cells were sorted in a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Cat# 74004). Libraries were prepared by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Molecular Biology Cores, using the Low Input mRNA Library (Clontech SMARTer) v4, following the vendor\u2019s protocol. Library quality was checked using High Sensitivity D1000 reagents in an Agilent Tape Station. Libraries were pooled and sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq500 (Single-End 75bp reads per sample). A Visualization Pipeline for RNAseq (Viper) analysis tool, developed by the Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics (CFCE) at DFCI, was used to generate standard outputs.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)Single-cell suspensions were generated as described in the \u201cMammary gland cell preparation and flow cytometry\u201d procedure. YFP+ premalignant MECs or mammary tumor cells from Trp53L/L;BRCA1L/L;R26Y mice post Ad-K8-Cre injection (at the indicated time points) were sorted by FACS into Dulbecco\u2019s PBS + 0.04% BSA and retained on ice. Barcoded scRNAseq libraries were generated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using a 10x Chromium Single Cell 3\u2019v2 reagent kit (10 \u00d7 Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Basically, cell suspensions were loaded onto a Chromium Single-Cell Chip along with the reverse transcription (RT) master mix and single cell 3\u2019 gel beads, aiming for maximum of 10,000 cells per channel. Following the generation of single-cell gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs), reverse transcription was performed using a Cl000 Touch Thermal Cycler with a Deep Well Reaction Module (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Amplified cDNA was purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) and sheared to approximately 200 bp with a Covaris S2 instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parameters. Sequencing libraries were generated with unique sample indices (SI) for each sample. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-RAPID High Output Mode at cycles of 26\u00d798 bps.scRNAseq data preprocessingFollowing sequencing, demultiplexing of cellular barcodes, mapping of reads to the mouse genome (build mm10), and production of matrices of gene counts were performed by the MIT Genome Technology Core or BWH Single Cell Genomics Core. We next processed the unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix using the Seurat R package (v3.0) (Butler et al., 2018). Cells that have either a unique gene count over 2,500 or less than 200, and genes detected in less than three cells, were filtered out. Seurat methodology uses principle component analysis (PCA) to visualize and explore these datasets and further summarize PCA with tSNE dimensionality using the default settings of the RunTSNE function. Cell clusters in the resulting two-dimensional representation were annotated to known biological cell types using FindAllMarkers for all clusters. For tumor single cell data, tSNE two-dimensional plots were also generated by the Loupe Cell Browser (10X Genomics) by using .cloupe files generated from the expression matrices derived from the Cell Ranger pipeline (10X Genomics).Quantitative RT-PCROrganoids were dissociated with TrypLE and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm, followed by RNA extraction with either TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026) or the Allprep DNA/RNA mini/micro kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. cDNA was generated with an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-RAD, 170-8891). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using FastStart SYBR Green Master (Roche, 04913850001, IN).StatisticsStudent\u2019s t-test (two-tailed) and Two-way ANOVA methods were used to calculate P values. Data were reported as Mean \u00b1 SEM or Mean\u00b1 S.D. Statistical methods were not used to predetermine mouse sample sizes. No randomization or blinding was used in the in vivo studies. \u200b\n                    HighlightsTwo BRCA1 partners, NUMB and HES1, participate in crosslink DNA repairNUMB or HES1 loss or cisplatin triggers a luminal to basal/mesenchymal transitionBRCA1 loss leads to growing DNA damage in the mammary epithelium and tumorigenesisBRCA1 tumorigenesis encompasses dynamic luminal/basal/mesenchymal fate transitions Supplementary Material1Figure S1 (Related to\nFigures 1\nand\n\u200b2)2) NUMB is a BRCA1-interacting nuclear protein(A) Sequence analysis of NUMB from different species emphasizing (in red type) two, putative BRCT-binding motifs SPTF and SPTXXF.
