{"title": "A new pumpless extracorporeal interventional lung assist in critical hypoxemia/hypercapnia", "pubDate": "2006", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1097/01.CCM.0000215111.85483.BD", "PMID": "16540950", "abstract": "Objective:                       Pump-driven extracorporeal gas exchange systems have been advocated in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome who are at risk for life-threatening hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. This requires extended technical and staff support.                  Design:                       We report retrospectively our experience with a new pumpless extracorporeal interventional lung assist (iLA) establishing an arteriovenous shunt as the driving pressure.                  Setting:                       University hospital.                  Patients:                       Ninety patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.                  Interventions:                       Interventional lung assist was inserted in 90 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.                  Measurements and main results:                       Oxygenation improvement, carbon dioxide elimination, hemodynamic variables, and the amount of vasopressor substitution were reported before, 2 hrs after, and 24 hrs after implementation of the system. Interventional lung assist led to an acute and moderate increase in arterial oxygenation (Pao2/Fio2 ratio 2 hrs after initiation of iLA [median and interquartile range], 82 mm Hg [64-103]) compared with pre-iLA (58 mm Hg [47-78], p < .05). Oxygenation continued to improve for 24 hrs after implementation (101 mm Hg [74-142], p < .05). Hypercapnia was promptly and markedly reversed by iLA within 2 hrs (Paco2, 36 mm Hg [30-44]) in comparison with before (60 mm Hg [48-80], p < .05], which allowed a less aggressive ventilation. For hemodynamic stability, all patients received continuous norepinephrine infusion. The incidence of complications was 24.4%, mostly due to ischemia in a lower limb. Thirty-seven of 90 patients survived, creating a lower mortality rate than expected from the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score.                  Conclusions:                       Interventional lung assist might provide a sufficient rescue measure with easy handling properties and low cost in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and persistent hypoxia/hypercapnia.", "author": [{"author": "Thomas Bein", "affiliation": ["Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany."], "href": "/?term=Bein+T&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Frank Weber", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Weber+F&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Alois Philipp", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Philipp+A&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Christopher Prasser", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Prasser+C&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Michael Pfeifer", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Pfeifer+M&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Franz-Xaver Schmid", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Schmid+FX&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Bernhard Butz", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Butz+B&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Dietrich Birnbaum", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Birnbaum+D&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Kai Taeger", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Taeger+K&cauthor_id=16540950"}, {"author": "Hans J Schlitt", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Schlitt+HJ&cauthor_id=16540950"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["16540950", "33709318", "32359363", "32288287", "31723647", "31267300", "31197492", "31090854", "29743094", "29434789", "29430448", "29312748", "29179681", "28875449", "28828371", "28828362", "28707030", "28500585", "28367279", "28132075", "27193131", "27127794", "26966691", "26861596", "26837543", "26537233", "26518584", "26507850", "26159104", "26109400", "25752302", "25653692", "25608845", "25260398", "25210957", "25046529", "25033302", "25028944", "24942014", "24936342", "24550626", "23991138", "23926463", "23786965", "23533547", "23460154", "23306584", "23074408", "23014710", "22962517", "22907520", "22836139", "22476703", "22451141", "22188792", "22147116", "22011235", "21031042", "20562704", "20224950", "20082167", "19548120", "19435467", "19318758", "19183941", "19183475", "19107104", "19014575", "18661121", "18511356", "17069660"], "body": ""}
