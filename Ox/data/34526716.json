{"title": "UTX condensation underlies its tumour-suppressive activity", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41586-021-03903-7", "PMID": "34526716", "abstract": "UTX (also known as KDM6A) encodes a histone H3K27 demethylase and is an important tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in human cancers1. However, as the demethylase activity of UTX is often dispensable for mediating tumour suppression and developmental regulation2-8, the underlying molecular activity of UTX remains unknown. Here we show that phase separation of UTX underlies its chromatin-regulatory activity in tumour suppression. A core intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of UTX forms phase-separated liquid condensates, and cIDR loss caused by the most frequent cancer mutation of UTX is mainly responsible for abolishing tumour suppression. Deletion, mutagenesis and replacement assays of the intrinsically disordered region demonstrate a critical role of UTX condensation in tumour suppression and embryonic stem cell differentiation. As shown by reconstitution in vitro and engineered systems in cells, UTX recruits the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (also known as KMT2D) to the same condensates and enriches the H3K4 methylation activity of MLL4. Moreover, UTX regulates genome-wide histone modifications and high-order chromatin interactions in a condensation-dependent manner. We also found that UTY, the Y chromosome homologue of UTX with weaker tumour-suppressive activity, forms condensates with reduced molecular dynamics. These studies demonstrate a crucial biological function of liquid condensates with proper material states in enabling the tumour-suppressive activity of a chromatin regulator.", "author": [{"author": "Bi Shi", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Shi+B&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Wei Li", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Li+W&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Yansu Song", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Song+Y&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Zhenjia Wang", "affiliation": ["Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Wang+Z&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Rui Ju", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ju+R&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Aleksandra Ulman", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ulman+A&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Jing Hu", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Hu+J&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Francesco Palomba", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Palomba+F&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Yanfang Zhao", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA."], "href": "/?term=Zhao+Y&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "John Philip Le", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Le+JP&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "William Jarrard", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jarrard+W&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "David Dimoff", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Dimoff+D&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Michelle A Digman", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Digman+MA&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Enrico Gratton", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Gratton+E&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Chongzhi Zang", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.", "Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.", "Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.", "UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Zang+C&cauthor_id=34526716"}, {"author": "Hao Jiang", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA. hj8d@virginia.edu.", "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, USA. hj8d@virginia.edu.", "UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA. hj8d@virginia.edu."], "href": "/?term=Jiang+H&cauthor_id=34526716"}], "refPMID": ["30753822", "29736013", "29533787", "23573229", "22949634", "23028370", "29073101", "21095589", "28225081", "32719551", "26412307", "32243837", "22801502", "7523656", "28041848", "24491801", "15006351", "28732206", "22493065", "27643841", "27886167", "27869828", "30006524", "27638352", "20212086", "33651988", "33169020", "30449618", "26944678", "26999603", "27992400", "27302555", "25139354", "21335234", "30628063", "6063760", "28076807", "6828386", "16418172", "21030952", "19067357", "23430654", "23104886", "21816040", "25516281", "19131956", "6447622", "2705234", "2723002", "18798982", "20110278", "19505939", "30986246", "31165883", "27466232", "26619908"], "citedInPMID": ["34526716", "35149762", "34859151"], "body": ""}
