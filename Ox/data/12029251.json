Applications and limitations", "pubDate": "2002", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "", "PMID": "12029251", "abstract": "We report the use of a pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (PECLA) in 70 patients with severe pulmonary failure of various causes. The device was used under rescue conditions in patients with preserved cardiac function. By establishing a shunt between femoral artery and vein using the arterio-venous pressure gradient as the driving force for the blood flow through the oxygenator, PECLA proved to be extremely effective in terms of oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal.", "author": [{"author": "A Liebold", "affiliation": ["University of Regensburg, Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Department of Internal Medicine, Regensburg, Germany. andreas.liebold@klinik.uni-regensburg.de"], "href": "/?term=Liebold+A&cauthor_id=12029251"}, {"author": "A Philipp", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Philipp+A&cauthor_id=12029251"}, {"author": "M Kaiser", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Kaiser+M&cauthor_id=12029251"}, {"author": "J Merk", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Merk+J&cauthor_id=12029251"}, {"author": "F X Schmid", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Schmid+FX&cauthor_id=12029251"}, {"author": "D E Birnbaum", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Birnbaum+DE&cauthor_id=12029251"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["12029251", "31197492", "28500585", "27904968", "25033302", "23922607", "22251792", "21769212", "21489261", "16902842"], "body": ""}
