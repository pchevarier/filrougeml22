Aneuploidy is the leading cause of congenital birth defects and associated with \u02dc\u200935% of all spontaneous human abortions (Nagaoka et\u2423al,\n2012). Furthermore, roughly 70% of human tumors are aneuploid, making it one of the most common genomic alterations in cancer (Duijf & Benezra, 2013; Knouse et\u2423al,\n2017). Despite this common association of aneuploidy with human disease, little is known about its genetic causes. The study of aneuploidy\u2010associated hereditary disorders can be instrumental in uncovering these causes.Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA; OMIM: 257300) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mosaic aneuploidies in multiple tissues. Patients often present with microcephaly, developmental delay, various congenital abnormalities, and childhood cancers (Garc\u00eda\u2010Castillo et\u2423al,\n2008). Pathogenic mutations in BUB1B, CEP57, or TRIP13, have been identified in roughly half of all MVA patients (Hanks et\u2423al,\n2004; Matsuura et\u2423al,\n2006; Snape et\u2423al,\n2011; Yost et\u2423al,\n2017). These genes have well\u2010documented roles in chromosome segregation (Suijkerbuijk et\u2423al,\n2010; Sacristan & Kops, 2015; Vader, 2015; Zhou et\u2423al,\n2016). All three gene products (BUBR1, CEP57, and TRIP13) promote spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function (Wang et\u2423al,\n2014; Musacchio, 2015; Ma et\u2423al,\n2016; Zhou et\u2423al,\n2016; Alfieri et\u2423al,\n2018), and BUBR1 and CEP57 additionally ensure correct kinetochore\u2013microtubule attachment (Emanuele & Stukenberg, 2007; Sacristan & Kops, 2015). As predicted, such mitotic processes are defective in cells from MVA patients carrying biallelic mutations in these genes, explaining the chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype and resulting aneuploid karyotypes. CIN can also result from mutations in regulators of expression of mitotic genes. For example, mutations in the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) cause CIN by overexpression of the SAC protein MAD2 (Hernando et\u2423al,\n2004; Sotillo et\u2423al,\n2007; Schvartzman et\u2423al,\n2011). In this work, we show that chromosome segregation errors can be caused by a specific defect in minor intron splicing, another process governing correct gene expression.While the conventional, major spliceosome targets most (>\u200999.5%) human introns, the minor spliceosome recognizes and excises only a small subset (\u02dc\u2009700 introns) (Turunen et\u2423al,\n2013a; Moyer et\u2423al,\n2020). These minor introns (also called U12\u2010type introns) have highly conserved 5\u2032 splice site (5\u2032ss) and branch point (BPS) sequences that are longer and differ at the sequence level from the respective sequences in major (U2\u2010type) introns. Most minor introns have AT\u2010AC or GT\u2010AG terminal dinucleotides (24 and 69%, respectively) (Sheth et\u2423al,\n2006; Moyer et\u2423al,\n2020). In addition, the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide can vary, thus giving rise to AT\u2010AN and GT\u2010AN classes of minor introns (Levine & Durbin, 2001; Dietrich et\u2423al,\n2005). For simplicity, we refer to these as A\u2010 and G\u2010type introns, respectively. Thus far, there has been no indication of mechanistic or functional differences between the minor intron subtypes.Minor intron \u201chost\u201d genes, the position of the minor intron within the gene, and intron subtypes, are all evolutionarily conserved (Burge et\u2423al,\n1998; Abril et\u2423al,\n2005; Sheth et\u2423al,\n2006; Alioto, 2007; Moyer et\u2423al,\n2020). Despite this high conservation, the functional significance of minor introns has remained elusive. Elevated levels of unspliced minor introns in various cell types have been reported, giving rise to the hypothesis that these are rate\u2010limiting controls for the expression of their host genes (Patel et\u2423al,\n2002; Younis et\u2423al,\n2013; Niemel\u00e4 & Frilander, 2014; Niemel\u00e4 et\u2423al,\n2014). Nevertheless, the overall significance of the elevated intron retention (IR) levels has been questioned particularly at individual gene level (Singh & Padgett, 2009).The overall architecture of the minor and major spliceosomes is highly similar. Both are composed of five small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complexes containing small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules and a large number of protein components. One of the snRNAs (U5) is shared between the spliceosomes, while U1, U2, U4, and U6 snRNAs are specific to the major spliceosome, and U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac snRNAs to the minor spliceosome. Introns are initially recognized by the U1 and U2 snRNPs (major spliceosome) or by the U11/U12 di\u2010snRNP (minor spliceosome), followed by the entry of the U4/U6.U5 or U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri\u2010snRNP and subsequent architectural changes leading to catalytic activation of the spliceosome (Turunen et\u2423al,\n2013a). At the protein level, the main difference between the spliceosomes is in the composition of the U11/U12 di\u2010snRNP that contains seven unique protein components that are needed for recognition of the unique minor intron splice sequences (Will et\u2423al,\n2004). In contrast, the protein composition of the minor and major tri\u2010snRNPs appears similar, but rigorous comparative analyses have been difficult due to the \u02dc\u2009100\u2010fold lower cellular abundance of the minor tri\u2010snRNP (Schneider et\u2423al,\n2002).Here, we report that germline mutations in a novel component of the minor spliceosome (CENATAC/CCDC84) cause chromosomal instability in MVA patients. We identify CENATAC as a minor spliceosome\u2010specific tri\u2010snRNP subunit that promotes the splicing of A\u2010type minor introns, but hardly contributes to G\u2010type minor intron splicing. We show that CENATAC depletion or disease mutations result in increased A\u2010type minor IR and mitotic chromosome congression defects. Congression defects are also seen when another minor spliceosome component is depleted, suggesting that the chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy observed in MVA patient cells are secondary effects of defective minor intron splicing. ResultsBiallelic truncating mutations in CENATAC (CCDC84) cause MVATo search for additional causes of MVA, we performed exome sequencing and variant analyses on MVA patients and family members, as previously described (Yost et\u2423al,\n2017). We identified biallelic truncating mutations in coiled\u2010coil domain\u2010containing 84 (CCDC84, hereafter named CENATAC, for centrosomal AT\u2010AC splicing factor, see below) in two affected siblings with 7.3 and 8.5% aneuploid blood cells, respectively (Figs\u20091A and EV1). Both siblings were alive at 47 and 33\u2009years of age and had microcephaly, mild developmental delay, and mild maculopathy. Neither individual had short stature, dysmorphism, or cancer. Each parent was heterozygous for one of the mutations, and the unaffected sibling had neither mutation. Moreover, the mutations were absent from the ExAC and ICR1000 series and we estimated the chance of an individual having two truncating CENATAC mutations to be 4.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210 (Fitzgerald et\u2423al,\n2015). We therefore consider it very likely that the CENATAC mutations are the cause of the siblings' phenotype. The paternal and maternal mutations (mutation 1 and mutation 2, respectively) both result in the creation of novel splice sites that lead to a frameshift and the loss of the C\u2010terminal 64 amino acids of CENATAC (Fig\u20091B and Appendix\u2423Fig S1). Although expression of the mutant alleles was very low in the parental cells, expression of the maternal allele was elevated in the cells of patient 1 (hereafter called patient) and was responsible for the low expression of wild\u2010type protein in these cells due to infrequent recognition of the original splice site (Fig\u20091C and Appendix\u2423Fig S1C).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Biallelic truncating mutations in CENATAC (CCDC84) cause MVA\nAClinical phenotypes of CENATAC\n(CCDC84) mutant patients.

Analysis of CENATAC sequence conservation in metazoan species revealed the presence of two N\u2010terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and four well\u2010conserved C\u2010terminal sequence motifs, of which the two most C\u2010terminal ones are lost as a result of the patient mutations (Fig\u20091B and Appendix\u2423Fig S2).CENATAC promotes error\u2010free chromosome segregationLive imaging of chromosome segregation in CENATAC mutant patient lymphoblasts stably expressing H2B\u2010mNeon (Yost et\u2423al,\n2017) revealed a mild chromosomal instability phenotype, consistent with the modest levels of aneuploidy in blood cells of these patients (Figs\u20091A and \u200band2A).2A). To examine whether CENATAC patient mutations cause chromosomal instability, we expressed mutant CENATAC alleles in HeLa cells in which the endogenous loci were modified to express AID\u2010degron\u2010tagged CENATAC (HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n, Appendix\u2423Fig S3) (Nishimura et\u2423al,\n2009). Efficient depletion of CENATAC through a combination of siRNA treatment and auxin addition caused chromosome congression defects and a subsequent mitotic arrest (Fig\u20092B and C, and Appendix\u2423Fig S3). This phenotype was fully rescued upon re\u2010expression of wild\u2010type but not MVA mutant CENATAC (Fig\u20092C and Appendix\u2423Figs S4 and S5), indicating that both MVA mutants are defective for CENATAC's function in mitotic chromosome congression. MVA mutant CENATAC caused a similar mitotic phenotype when expressed in near\u2010diploid DLD\u20101 cells (Appendix\u2423Fig S6). CENATAC alleles missing either of the two most C\u2010terminal conserved motifs that are absent from MVA mutant CENATAC (Fig \u200b(Fig1B,1B, motifs 3 and 4) did not rescue the mitotic defects. Instead, the expression of the MVA or motif 3/4 mutants exacerbated the phenotype, suggesting that these proteins dominantly repressed the function of any residual wild\u2010type protein (Fig\u20092C). Mutations in the zinc fingers or deletion of motifs 1 or 2 only partly compromised CENATAC function (Figs\u20091B and \u200band2C2C).Open in a separate windowFigure 2CENATAC promotes error\u2010free chromosome segregation\nAQuantification of chromosome segregation errors of patient and control lymphoblasts expressing H2B\u2010mNeon (four biological replicates, >\u2009200 cells in total per condition).BRepresentative images of H2B\u2010mNeon\u2010expressing HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells depleted of GAPDH (upper) or CENATAC (middle and lower) with or without re\u2010expression of CENATAC variants as indicated.

In addition, we did not observe centriole over\u2010duplication in CENATAC\u2010depleted cells (Fig EV2C and D). This is in contrast to what was recently reported for CENATAC knockout cells (Wang et\u2423al,\n2019), raising the possibility that centriole over\u2010duplication is a cumulative effect of prolonged CENATAC loss. Our attempts to examine this failed, as we were unable to create CENATAC knockout cells, consistent with it being an essential human gene (Blomen et\u2423al,\n2015; Hart et\u2423al,\n2015; Wang et\u2423al,\n2015). Taken together, these data show that CENATAC directly or indirectly promotes chromosome congression in mitosis (in a manner likely unrelated to its role in maintaining spindle bipolarity) and that MVA mutant CENATAC is a defective variant.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2CENATAC's congression phenotype is not the result of a multipolar mitotic spindle\nARepresentative stills of HeLaEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC cells expressing H2B\u2010mNeon and depleted of GAPDH.

Genes that function in the same biochemical process experience similar evolutionary pressures and therefore tend to co\u2010evolve, i.e., they are lost or retained in a coherent fashion (Pellegrini et\u2423al,\n1999). Genomes from a set of 90 informative eukaryotic species (Table\u2009EV1) were mined for the presence or absence of CENATAC orthologs (Hooff et\u2423al,\n2017). This provided a phylogenetic absence/presence profile that was used in an unbiased genome\u2010wide query for genes with similar phylogenetic profiles (Fig\u20093A). The resulting list of genes most strongly co\u2010occurring with CENATAC was significantly enriched for components of the minor (U12\u2010dependent) spliceosome complex, including the recently discovered SCNM1 (Bai et\u2423al,\n2021) (Fig\u20093B, Table\u2009EV2). We thus reasoned that CENATAC may play a role in splicing by the minor spliceosome.Open in a separate windowFigure 3CENATAC is a novel component of the minor spliceosome\nAPhylogenetic profiles (presences (blue) and absences (white)) of the top 15 genes co\u2010occurring with CENATAC in 90 eukaryotic species.

For simplicity, several stages of spliceosome assembly are omitted, such as the pre\u2010B complex, which consists of the intron recognition complex together with the tri\u2010snRNP before architectural changes lead to the exclusion of U11 to give rise to the B complex, after which subsequent architectural changes lead to the exclusion of U4atac to give rise to the BACT complex, which is a precursor stage for the catalytically active C complex depicted in this figure (Turunen et\u2423al,\n2013b).\nData information: In (C), data are presented as fold change of the mean log 2\u2010transformed LFQ intensity. In (E), data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.As predicted by our co\u2010evolution analysis and in agreement with a previous high\u2010throughput screen (Hart et\u2423al,\n2015; Hein et\u2423al,\n2015; Huttlin et\u2423al,\n2015, 2017), mass spectrometry analysis of proteins co\u2010purifying with CENATAC identified several known spliceosome components that are shared by both the major and minor spliceosomes (Fig\u20093C and Appendix\u2423Fig S7). Notably, the strongest CENATAC interactor (TXNL4B) was also the gene that showed the most significant co\u2010occurrence with CENATAC in eukaryotic species (Fig\u20093A). To determine whether CENATAC preferentially associates with major or minor spliceosome components, we analyzed CENATAC co\u2010immunoprecipitations by Northern blot analysis. This revealed a significant enrichment for the minor spliceosome\u2010specific U4atac and U6atac snRNAs (Fig\u20093D and E and Appendix\u2423Fig S8). CENATAC's association with the minor spliceosome was further supported by glycerol gradient analyses of HeLa nuclear extract preparations, which showed co\u2010migration of CENATAC with U6atac snRNP, U4atac/U6atac di\u2010snRNP, and U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri\u2010snRNP complexes (Fig\u20093F). Together, these data validate CENATAC as a bona fide functional component of the minor spliceosome and as the first identified protein component that is specific to the U4atac/U6atac and U4atac/U6atac.U5 snRNP complexes (Fig\u20093G).The role of CENATAC in minor spliceosome function was further supported by the presence of evolutionarily conserved competing major (U2\u2010type) and minor (U12\u2010type) 5\u2032 splice sequences (5\u2032ss) in animals, that are predicted to generate productive and unproductive CENATAC mRNAs, respectively (Appendix\u2423Fig S9A). This configuration is indicative of an autoregulatory circuit that is conceptually similar to the previously reported autoregulation of the minor spliceosome proteins 48K and 65K (Verbeeren et\u2423al,\n2010; Turunen et\u2423al,\n2013b). In agreement with this, impaired minor spliceosome function, such as in Taybi\u2013Linder syndrome (TALS/MOPD1, OMIM: 210710) patients, leads to a significant increase in the use of major 5\u2032ss and upregulation of CENATAC mRNA levels (Cologne et\u2423al,\n2019). Notably, evidence for a similar autoregulatory circuit is also present in plants (Appendix\u2423Fig S9B), where retention or splicing of a minor intron results in productive or unproductive CENATAC mRNA, respectively.Minor intron splicing defects in CENATAC mutant cells correlate with mitotic defectsIn agreement with our finding that CENATAC is a novel minor spliceosome component, splicing of several minor introns was impaired upon depletion of CENATAC in HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells, whereas up\u2010 or downstream major introns were unaffected (Fig\u20094A and B). This was true also for MVA patient cells and DLD\u20101 cells expressing MVA mutant CENATAC (Fig\u20094B and Appendix\u2423Fig S10). Importantly, the splicing defect of minor introns in CENATAC\u2010depleted cells was fully rescued by re\u2010expression of wild\u2010type but not MVA mutant alleles (Fig\u20094A). Similar to the mitotic phenotype, the expression of the disease alleles and mutants lacking motifs 3 and 4 exacerbated the splicing defect, whereas mutations in the zinc fingers and removal of motifs 1 and 2 partially rescued it (Fig\u20094A and Appendix\u2423Fig S10). Notably, the extent of the splicing defect strongly correlated with the extent of the mitotic phenotype for all mutations (Fig\u20094C), supporting the possibility that impaired minor spliceosome function and the chromosome congression phenotype are causally linked. To further investigate this, we depleted ZRSR2, a component of the U11/U12 di\u2010snRNP functioning in 3\u2032ss recognition of minor introns (see Fig\u20093G), in both HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n and DLD\u20101 cells. Similar to the depletion of CENATAC, this caused significant minor IR (Fig\u20094D) and a chromosome congression defect (Fig\u20094E). We therefore consider it likely that the chromosome congression phenotype is a secondary effect of impaired minor spliceosome function.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Minor intron splicing defects in CENATAC mutant cells fully correlate with mitotic defects\nART\u2013PCR (middle panel) and quantification (upper panel) of IPO5 minor intron 21 (U12\u2010type) splicing on RNA extracted from HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells treated as in Fig\u20092C (three biological replicates, normalized to siCENATAC\u2009+\u2009IAA).

To investigate this, we compared the transcriptomes of CENATAC\u2010depleted HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells to those of control\u2010depleted and parental cell lines. The resulting RNAseq dataset was analyzed for changes in IR using IntEREst (Oghabian et\u2423al,\n2018) and for alternative splicing (AS) using Whippet (Sterne\u2010Weiler et\u2423al,\n2018). In agreement with our RT\u2013PCR\u2010based observations (Fig\u20094), this analysis confirmed the significant retention of minor but not major introns after CENATAC depletion (Fig\u2009EV3). Surprisingly, it also uncovered a remarkable enrichment for a specific subclass of minor introns: While only 24% of G\u2010type introns (with GT\u2010AG, GT\u2010AT, GT\u2010TG, GC\u2010AG terminal dinucleotides) were affected by CENATAC depletion, virtually all (92%) of the A\u2010type introns (with AT\u2010AC\n1\n, AT\u2010AA, AT\u2010AG, or AT\u2010AT terminal dinucleotides) showed increased retention or activation of alternative major splice sites (cryptic or annotated), or both (Fig\u20095A and B, Appendix\u2423Fig S11, and Dataset EV1). For comparison, we carried out the same analysis on a previously published dataset derived from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients carrying somatic mutations in the gene encoding for the U11/12\u2010di\u2010snRNP subunit ZRSR2 (Madan et\u2423al,\n2015). This dataset showed a nearly identical response for A\u2010 and G\u2010type introns (Fig\u20095B and Dataset EV2). Whereas depletion of CENATAC or mutations in\u2423ZRSR2 led to an average increase of approximately 36 and 19% in retention of A\u2010type introns, respectively (average \u0394\u03a8CENATAC\u2009=\u2009\u02dc\u20090.36 and average \u0394\u03a8ZRSR2\u2009=\u2009\u02dc\u20090.19), G\u2010type introns were only strongly affected by ZRSR2 mutations (average \u0394\u03a8CENATAC\u2009=\u2009\u02dc\u20090.07 and average \u0394\u03a8 ZRSR2\u2009=\u2009\u02dc\u20090.19, Figs\u20095B\u2013D and EV3). Importantly, the effect on A\u2010type introns was specific to minor introns as none of the 85 major AT\u2010AC introns or related subtypes responded to CENATAC depletion (Fig\u20095E and Dataset EV1). The same subtype\u2010specific effect on minor intron splicing was also observed in CENATAC mutant MVA patient lymphoblasts (Fig\u20095F, Appendix\u2423Fig S12A, and Dataset EV3), in which the affected introns correlated strongly with those affected by CENATAC depletion (Fig\u20095G, Appendix\u2423Fig S12B, and Dataset EV4). Notably, the strongly affected transcripts did not include any of the genes associated with MVA but did contain various mitotic regulators (Appendix\u2423Fig S13, Datasets EV1, EV5, and EV6).Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Comparison of delta\u2010psi values (HeLaEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC cells 48h CENATAC depletion vs. parental cell line 48h GAPDH depletion)\nAComparison of all (statistically significant and not significant) minor A\u2010type (n\u2009=\u2009179) and minor G\u2010type (n\u2009=\u2009441) introns (three biological replicates).BComparison of statistically significant minor A\u2010type introns (n\u2009=\u2009133), minor G\u2010type introns (n\u2009=\u2009130), and major introns (n\u2009=\u20098,818; three biological replicates).

The CENATAC depletion dataset consists of three biological replicates, the ZRSR2 mutation (MDS) dataset of eight biological replicates, and the MVA dataset of four biological replicates.A\u2010type minor introns are spliced less efficientlyWe next wished to understand the selectivity of CENATAC\u2010dependent splicing for A\u2010type minor introns. The observation that also some G\u2010type introns were affected by CENATAC depletion (Fig\u20095D) argued against a direct interaction between CENATAC and intron terminal nucleotides. Moreover, A\u2010 and G\u2010type introns that were strongly affected by CENATAC depletion had higher basal levels of IR in control conditions compared with those unaffected by CENATAC depletion (Fig\u20096A). This suggested that CENATAC predominantly promotes splicing of minor introns that are normally spliced less efficiently and that A\u2010type introns as a group belong to this category. To test this hypothesis, we engineered the widely used P120 minigene (Hall & Padgett, 1996) to contain two tandem competing A\u2010 or G\u2010type splice sites in all possible configurations (Fig\u20096B). Significantly, minor GT\u2010AG splice sites were strongly preferred over AT\u2010AC sites when in direct competition (Fig\u20096B and C), and they also outcompeted\u2009a unique GC\u2010AG splice site that was significantly affected by CENATAC depletion (Figs\u20095D and EV4, LZTR1). We thus conclude that CENATAC promotes splicing of minor introns that are recognized or spliced less efficiently, most prominently A\u2010type minor introns.Open in a separate windowFigure 6A\u2010type minor introns are spliced less efficiently\nADensity plots showing intron retention (\u03a8) values in the HeLa unedited parental control cell line (depleted of GAPDH) of A\u2010 and G\u2010type minor introns that were either unchanged or retained after CENATAC depletion (top) or ZRSR2 mutation (bottom).

Using patient exome sequencing, evolutionary co\u2010occurrence analysis, and biochemistry, we identified CENATAC as a novel protein component of the U4atac/U6atac di\u2010snRNP and U4atac/U6atac.U5 tri\u2010snRNP complexes that are necessary for the formation of the catalytically active minor spliceosome. Our RNAseq analyses of CENATAC\u2010mutant MVA patient cells and CENATAC\u2010depleted HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells revealed widespread defects in minor intron splicing, particularly IR, but also cryptic splice site activation, indicating that CENATAC is required for proper functioning of the minor spliceosome. Unexpectedly, IR in CENATAC\u2010depleted cells was strongly biased for A\u2010type minor introns, which is a subtype that is defined by AT\u2010AN dinucleotide splice sites. This intron subtype\u2010specific function is unique among the minor spliceosome components and correlated tightly with mitotic fidelity. Furthermore, depletion of the minor spliceosome component ZRSR2 likewise caused a chromosome congression defect. Minor intron subtype mis\u2010splicing is therefore likely responsible, possibly in conjunction with centriolar defects (Wang et\u2423al,\n2019), for the inefficient chromosome congression in CENATAC\u2010mutant cells and for the aneuploidies observed in the two MVA siblings described in this study.The minor spliceosome was originally thought to splice only introns with AT\u2010AC termini (Hall & Padgett, 1994, 1996; Tarn & Steitz, 1996). Only later, it was shown that there are also major AT\u2010AC introns and that most of the minor introns in fact have GT\u2010AG termini (Dietrich et\u2423al,\n1997; Sharp & Burge, 1997; Wu & Krainer, 1997). Additionally, minor introns have infrequent variations in the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide (Levine & Durbin, 2001; Dietrich et\u2423al,\n2005), thus giving rise to the AT\u2010AN and GT\u2010AN classes of minor introns, here referred to as A\u2010 and G\u2010type introns, respectively. Significantly, in all known minor spliceosome diseases for which comprehensive transcriptome data are available, splicing defects are roughly uniformly distributed between the A\u2010 and G\u2010type introns (Argente et\u2423al,\n2014; Madan et\u2423al,\n2015; Merico et\u2423al,\n2015; Cologne et\u2423al,\n2019) (Fig\u20095A\u2013C, ZRSR2 mutation). The selective A\u2010type IR phenotype of CENATAC can therefore not solely be explained by a general loss of minor spliceosome function but instead suggests that CENATAC has a unique function in promoting the splicing of A\u2010type minor introns. Nonetheless, our observation that also a subset of G\u2010type introns was retained upon CENATAC depletion renders it unlikely that CENATAC directly recognizes the 5\u2032 adenosine of A\u2010type introns. Instead, our competition data, and the observed elevated IR baseline of the affected introns, suggest that a subset of minor introns with reduced intrinsic splicing activity (consisting not only of A\u2010type introns but also of a subset of G\u2010type introns) may be particularly dependent upon CENATAC activity.What could be the molecular function of CENATAC? Given its participation in di\u2010 and tri\u2010snRNP complexes and potential selectivity for 5\u2032ss identity, CENATAC may function during or after the transition from initial intron recognition (A complex) to pre\u2010catalytic spliceosome (B complex; Fig\u20093G) and may for instance participate in 5\u2032ss recognition analogous to U11\u201048K protein in the A complex (Turunen et\u2423al,\n2008). Of particular interest are the two well\u2010conserved C\u2010terminal motifs (M3 and M4), whose deletion caused severe impairment of minor intron splicing (Figs\u20091 and \u200band4).4). Although we have not been able to uncover their function based on sequence similarity to other motifs, our data argue they are crucial for CENATAC's role in minor intron splicing. Detailed mechanistic understanding will require cryo\u2010EM structures of relevant minor spliceosome assembly stages. Unlike the major spliceosome, of which high\u2010resolution structures are available throughout the entire spliceosome assembly/disassembly cycle (Wilkinson et\u2423al,\n2020), of the minor spliceosome only a single high\u2010resolution cryo\u2010EM structure is available of the catalytically activated form (BACT complex) (Bai et\u2423al,\n2021). This structure does not contain CENATAC, nor its main interactor TXNL4B (Fig\u20093). Even though the major spliceosome does not carry an obvious functional analog of the CENATAC protein, the major spliceosome TXNL4A/Dim1 protein is a paralog of TXNL4B, both at sequence and structural levels (Jin et\u2423al,\n2013). High\u2010resolution structures of both yeast and human spliceosomal B complexes have placed TXNL4A/Dim1 in close proximity of the 5\u2032ss and suggested a role in 5\u2032ss recognition (Wan et\u2423al,\n2016; Bertram et\u2423al,\n2017). Assuming that the minor spliceosome B complex shares the molecular architecture with its major spliceosome counterpart, this could place CENATAC with TXNL4B near the 5\u2032ss to participate in the recognition event. Furthermore, as both proteomics and structural work have shown that TXNL4A/Dim1 is released from the major spliceosome during the transition from B to BACT complex (Schmidt et\u2423al,\n2014; Bertram et\u2423al,\n2017; Haselbach et\u2423al,\n2018), it is possible that both TXNL4B and CENATAC may similarly detach from the minor spliceosome prior to BACT complex formation.Given that A\u2010type minor intron host genes and the locations of these introns within the host gene are evolutionarily highly conserved among metazoan species, the selectivity of CENATAC in splicing raises the possibility that minor intron subtypes are part of a conserved but unexplored regulatory mechanism for gene expression. CENATAC undergoes reversible modifications (acetylation and phosphorylation) (Wang et\u2423al,\n2019), which may provide the means to regulate its activity (also) in the minor spliceosome.Presently, all mutations associated with MVA have been mapped to genes that are known regulators of chromosome segregation. Our discovery of disease\u2010causing mutations in CENATAC extends this list for the first time with a mRNA splicing factor. Although a recent study showed that CENATAC regulates centriole duplication (Wang et\u2423al,\n2019), we were unable to verify this. Instead, our data argue that chromosomal instability by CENATAC malfunction may instead be the result of a primary defect in splicing of A\u2010type minor introns. Nevertheless, it remains possible that CENATAC can also promote high\u2010fidelity chromosome segregation more directly, as has been suggested for several other proteins involved in splicing (Montembault et\u2423al,\n2007; Pellacani et\u2423al,\n2018; Somma et\u2423al,\n2020).Strikingly, the clinical phenotype of CENATAC mutant MVA strongly resembles that of MOPD1/TALS, Roifman and Lowry\u2013Wood syndromes, which are caused by mutations in the U4atac snRNA component of the minor spliceosome. Patients with these syndromes likewise present with microcephaly, developmental delay, and retinal abnormalities (Farach et\u2423al,\n2018). No aneuploidies were reported (Hallermayr et\u2423al,\n2018; Wang et\u2423al,\n2018), but karyotype analyses were not performed for the majority of patients. It will therefore be of interest to examine whether aneuploidies occur in some of these patients, and whether (and to what extent) the affected transcripts and the splicing defect differ between MVA and these syndromes.Although the depletion of both ZRSR2 and CENATAC caused a chromosome congression defect in mitosis (Fig\u20094), patients with ZRSR2 mutations are clinically different from MVA patients with CENATAC mutations. This difference is most likely related to differences in their splice targets, such as the G\u2010type minor introns that are differentially affected by depletion of CENATAC vs ZRSR2 (Fig\u20095). Mutations in ZRSR2 are associated with MDS and clonal cytopenias of unknown significance (CCUS) (Madan et\u2423al,\n2015; Fleischman et\u2423al,\n2017). In line with ZRSR2's mitotic phenotype, various stable aneuploidies were observed in MDS and CCUS patients with ZRSR2 mutations (Madan et\u2423al,\n2015; Fleischman et\u2423al,\n2017; Hosono, 2019), though it is unclear whether mitotic defects contribute to these disease phenotypes. It would be of interest to investigate whether mitotic defects negatively impact erythropoiesis in these patients. Materials and MethodsSamplesThe MVA exome analyses were approved by the London Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (05/MRE02/17). Appropriate consent was obtained from patients and/or parents as applicable and the experiments conformed to the principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human Services Belmont Report. DNA was extracted from whole blood using standard protocols. RNA was extracted from EBV\u2010transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) using the RNeasy Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen).For the functional experiments, the following patient LCLs were used: ID_5728_1 (patient, biallelic CENATAC (CCDC84) mutations, ECACC ID: FACT5728DLB), ID_5728_3 (sibling, no CENATAC mutations, ECACC ID: FACT5728KC), ID_5728_4 (father, monoallelic CENATAC mutation, ECACC ID: FACT5728GLB), and ID_5728_5 (mother, monoallelic CENATAC mutation, ECACC ID: FACT5728ALB).Lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2\u2009mM alanyl glutamine. Cells expressing H2B\u2010mNeon were created by lentiviral transduction, using standard procedures. Imaging of LCLs was performed as previously described (Yost et\u2423al,\n2017).Exome sequencing, alignment and variant calling, reference data sets, PTV prioritization method, recessive analysis, and Sanger sequencing: as previously described (Yost et\u2423al,\n2017).cDNA analysis of CENATAC (CCDC84) mutationsWe synthesized cDNA using the ThermoScript RT\u2013PCR System (Life Technologies) with random hexamers and 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA. We amplified the mutation regions using cDNA\u2010specific primers and sequenced the PCR products as described above. Primer sequences are available on request.Conservation logosHidden Markov model (HMM) profiles were created from iterative jackhmmer searches (Potter et\u2423al,\n2018) (version: HMMER3/f [3.1b2 | January 2014]) with CENATAC's protein sequence against the sequences of all metazoan species within the UniProt database. In\u2010between successive iterations, non\u2010CENATAC sequences were manually removed. Logos were created using Skylign (Wheeler et\u2423al,\n2014); letter height: information content above background.ImmunoblotsFor Western blot samples, cells were treated as indicated and lysed in Laemmli lysis buffer (4% SDS, 120\u2009mM Tris pH 6.8, and 20% glycerol). Lysates were processed for SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using standard protocols. Visualization of signals was performed on an Amersham Imager 600 scanner using enhanced chemiluminescence. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti\u2010CENATAC (CCDC84; Sigma, HPA071715) and mouse anti\u2010Tubulin (Sigma; T5168). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti\u2010mouse HRP (170\u20106516) and goat anti\u2010rabbit HRP (170\u20106515), both obtained from Bio\u2010Rad.Cell cultureHeLa T\u2010REx Flp\u2010In osTIR\u20109Myc::NEO cells (gift from Andrew Holland) were cultured in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% Tet\u2010approved FBS, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2\u2009mM alanyl glutamine. DLD\u20101 cells (ATCC CCL\u2010221) were cultured in DMEM/F\u201012 supplemented with 10% Tet\u2010approved FBS, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2\u2009mM alanyl glutamine. HeLa S3 cells (a kind gift from Dr. Joan Steitz) were cultured in suspension in 1640 RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u2009mM glutamine, and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Stable expression of H2B\u2010mNeon was done by lentiviral transduction using standard procedures. All cell lines were regularly tested and at all times found to be mycoplasma\u2010free.Creation of HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n and HeLa\nEGFP \u2010CENATAC\n cell linesHeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n and HeLa\nEGFP\u2010CENATAC\n cell lines were derived from HeLa T\u2010REx Flp\u2010In osTIR\u20109Myc::NEO and HeLa T\u2010REx Flp\u2010In, respectively. Tagging of the endogenous locus of CENATAC was done according to the scCRISPR protocol (Arbab et\u2423al,\n2015) using the Protospacer, HDR_insert, and HDR_ext primers in Table\u2009EV3. pcDNA5\u2010FRT\u2010TO\u2010EGFP\u2010AID (Addgene, 80075) was used as template for both the EGFP\u2010AID and EGFP tags. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX using standard procedures and subsequently FACS\u2010sorted (single cells) based on EGFP expression. Endogenous tagging was confirmed by PCR (using the Genomic primers, Appendix\u2423Fig S3A) and immunoblotting of CENATAC protein (Appendix\u2423Fig S3B and C).Viral plasmids, cloning, and viral productionFor lentiviral re\u2010expression of CENATAC variants, first pcDNA5 PURO FRT TO EGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC was created by cloning CENATAC cDNA derived from HeLa cells into empty pcDNA5\u2010FRT\u2010TO\u2010EGFP\u2010AID (Addgene, 80075) using the cDNA PCR primers in Table\u2009EV3 and digestion of both the PCR product and the plasmid with NotI/ApaI. The CENATAC cDNA was subsequently cloned into pcDNA5 PURO FRT TO containing a LAP\u2010tag to create pcDNA5 PURO FRT TO LAP\u2010CENATAC by Gibson assembly (Gibson et\u2423al,\n2009) with the PCR primers Gibson1 and Gibson2. Mutagenesis was then performed to make this construct resistant to CENATAC siRNA treatment (CCDC84; Dharmacon, J\u2010027240\u201007) by Gibson assembly with PCR primers Gibson3. Next, in the siRNA\u2010resistant construct, CENATAC wild\u2010type cDNA was mutated to Mut1 (primers Gibson4), Mut2 (Gibson5), 2xZF (Gibson6; two consecutive rounds of cloning), \u03941 (Gibson7), \u03942 (Gibson8), \u03943 (Gibson9), or \u03944 (Gibson10) by Gibson assembly. Lentiviral CENATAC iresRFP constructs were derived from a lentiviral construct encoding fluorescently tagged histone 2B (H2B) and a puromycin\u2010resistant cassette (pLV\u2010H2B\u2010mNeon\u2010ires\u2010Puro) (Drost et\u2423al,\n2015). First, the fluorescently tagged H2B was substituted by CENATAC derived from pcDNA5 PURO FRT TO LAP\u2010CENATAC (see above) by Gibson assembly with PCR primers Gibson11 and digestion by AscI/NheI. Next, the puromycin\u2010resistant cassette was substituted by tagRFP by Gibson assembly with PCR primers Gibson12. Finally, all siRNA\u2010resistant variants of CENATAC were cloned from their respective pcDNA5 PURO FRT TO LAP\u2010CENATAC plasmids into pLV CENATAC ires\u2010tagRFP by Gibson assembly with PCR primers Gibson13 and PstI digestion of the plasmid. Virions were generated by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells with the transfer vector and separate plasmids that express Gag\u2010Pol, Rev, Tat, and VSV\u2010G. Supernatants were clarified by filtration.ImmunoprecipitationFor each sample, a full 10\u2010cm plate of HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells was used, treated as indicated (Appendix\u2423Fig S3C). The cells were lysed in ice\u2010cold lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 2% NP\u201040, 0.1% deoxycholate, proteasome inhibitors) and treated with benzonase for 15\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with beads (GFP\u2010Trap, Chromotek) for 2.5\u2009h at 4\u00b0C and washed three times with ice\u2010cold lysis buffer. The samples were finally eluted in Laemmli sample buffer.Live cell imaging analysis of mitotic fidelityLymphoblastoid cell lines were imaged as previously described (Yost et\u2423al,\n2017). siRNA transfections (RNAiMAX, Thermo Fisher) in HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n (40\u2009nM siRNA) and DLD\u20101 cells (50\u2009nM siRNA) were done against CENATAC (CCDC84; Dharmacon, J\u2010027240\u201007), GAPDH (Dharmacon, D\u2010001830\u201001\u201005), or ZRSR2 (Sigma, SASI_Hs02_00338940). In the case of CENATAC depletion in HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells, transfections were done in the presence of 1\u2009mM 3\u2010indoleacetic acid (IAA) or ethanol (IAA vehicle) for 24\u2009h in a 24\u2010well plate before the cells were re\u2010plated to eight\u2010well ibidi \u03bc\u2010slides with 2\u2009mM thymidine (for early S\u2010phase synchronization) and 100\u2009\u03bcl lentivirus for CENATAC re\u2010expression. After 18\u2009h, the cells were released from thymidine for 6\u2009h and imaged in CO2\u2010independent medium in a heated chamber (37\u00b0C), while air\u2010tight\u2010sealed in the well plate with parafilm. These cells were therefore imaged \u02dc\u200948\u2009h after siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of CENATAC and \u02dc\u200924\u2009h after lentivirus addition. For CENATAC depletion and re\u2010expression in DLD\u20101 cells, the lentivirus (150\u2009\u03bcl) was immediately added together with the siRNA treatment (instead of 24\u2009h later together with the 2\u2009mM thymidine). These cells were therefore imaged \u02dc\u200948\u2009h after siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of CENATAC and \u02dc\u200948\u2009h after lentivirus addition. For the experiments in Figs\u20092D and EV2A, the cells were additionally incubated with 200\u2009nM SiR\u2010tubulin dye (Spirochrome) for 6\u2009h prior to imaging to facilitate visualization of the mitotic spindle. For the depletion of ZRSR2 in both HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n and DLD\u20101 cells, the cells were re\u2010plated to 8\u2010well ibidi \u03bc\u2010slides with 2\u2009mM thymidine 48\u2009h (instead of 24\u2009h) after transfection and therefore imaged \u02dc\u200972\u2009h after siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of ZRSR2. Images were acquired every 3 or 5\u2009min at 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091 binning in 7\u2009\u00d7\u20092.5\u2009\u03bcm z\u2010stacks (RFP as in Appendix\u2423Figs S4 and S6 was imaged in only 1 z\u2010stack per position) and projected to a single layer by maximum intensity projection using NIS\u2010Elements Software 4.45. Imaging was performed with a Nikon Ti\u2010Eclipse wide\u2010field microscope equipped with an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS Camera, 40\u00d7 oil objective NA 1.3 WD 0.2\u2009mm, and Lumencor SPECTRA X light engine. Analysis of these experiments was carried out with ImageJ software. When applicable, cells re\u2010expressing CENATAC variants were identified through co\u2010expression of cytosolic RFP (via ires\u2010tagRFP); RFP\u2010negative cells were omitted from the quantifications (Appendix\u2423Figs S4 and S6).Immunofluorescence imagingAfter treating the cells with siRNAs and IAA (see above) for 24\u2009h in a 24\u2010well plate, the cells were re\u2010plated on round 12\u2010mm coverslips and treated with 2\u2009mM thymidine (for early S\u2010phase synchronization) for 24\u2009h. 10\u2009h after release, MG132 was added for 45\u2009min after which the cells were pre\u2010extracted with 0.1% Triton X\u2010100 in PEM (100\u2009mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, and 5\u2009mM EGTA) for \u00b1\u200960\u2009s. After 60\u2009s, 4% paraformaldehyde was added on top of the PEM in a 1:1 ratio (400\u2009\u03bcl each) for 20\u2009min to fixate the cells. The coverslips were subsequently washed twice with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 16\u2009h at 4\u00b0C, incubated with primary antibodies for 2\u2009h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X\u2010100, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed four times with PBS/0.1% Triton X\u2010100 and mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Molecular Probes). All images were acquired on a deconvolution system (DeltaVision Elite; Applied Precision/GE Healthcare) equipped with a 100\u00d7/1.40 NA UPlanSAPO objective (Olympus) using Softworx 6.0 software (Applied Precision/GE Healthcare). The images are maximum intensity projections of deconvoluted stacks. Random pro\u2010metaphase and metaphase cells were selected, and centrioles were counted by hand. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti\u2010Centrin1 (Abcam, ab101332, 1/500) and mouse anti\u2010Tubulin (Sigma, T5168, 1/10,000). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti\u2010mouse 647 (A21236) and goat anti\u2010rabbit 568 (A11036), both obtained from Thermo Fisher.Co\u2010evolution analysisFirst, a phylogenetically diverse set of complete eukaryotic\u2010predicted proteomes was utilized. This set was previously compiled to contain the protein sequences of 90 eukaryotic species (Hooff et\u2423al,\n2017; preprint: van Wijk & Snel, 2020). These species were selected based on their representation of eukaryotic diversity. If available, we selected two species per clade and model organisms were preferred over other species. If multiple proteomes or proteomes of different strains were available, the most complete proteome was selected. When multiple splicing variants of a single gene were annotated, the longest protein was chosen. A unique protein identifier was assigned to each protein, consisting of four letters and six numbers. The letters combine the first letter of the genus name with the first three letters of the species name. The versions and sources of the selected proteomes can be found in Table\u2009EV1.To define phylogenetic profiles for all human proteins, we determined automatic orthologous groups (OG) across the database using information from PANTHER 9.0 (Mi et\u2423al,\n2016). PANTHER 9.0 contains 85 genomes within total of 1,136,213 genes. Of these genes, 759,627 genes are in PANTHER families with phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments, and HMM profiles. In total, there are 7,180 PANTHER families and 52,768 subfamilies. Families are groups of evolutionary\u2010related proteins and subfamilies are related proteins that are likely to have the same function. The division into subfamilies is done manually, by biological experts. Every subfamily of PANTHER is an OG at some taxonomic level in the tree of life. We used \u201chmmscan\u201d tool from the HMMER package (Potter et\u2423al,\n2018) (HMMER 3.1b1) to find for each protein sequence in our database, the best matching profile of a main family or subfamily in PANTHER9.0. The phylogenetic profile of panther main or subfamily was subsequently defined by utilizing the hierarchical nature of the panther classification. Specifically, the phylogenetic profile of a main or subfamily also includes all members of daughter families (and if relevant their daughter families, etc.). Note that due to the automatic nature of orthology definition and the draft quality of a few genomes, phylogenetic profiles of the human proteins are not as accurate as those defined by manual analysis (van Hooff et\u2423al,\n2019).To determine the phylogenetic profile similarity, Pearson's correlation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_coefficient) was computed between the phylogenetic profile of the CENATAC panther (PTHR31198) and the phylogenetic profile of all other panther sub\u2010 and main families using in\u2010house scripts. To detect functional patterns in orthologous groups with similar phylogenetic profiles (correlation\u2009>\u20090.5), a GO enrichment analysis was performed (Ashburner et\u2423al,\n2000; Carbon et\u2423al,\n2019; Mi et\u2423al,\n2019). GO cellular component overrepresentation (GO Ontology database: released 2020\u201001\u201003) was computed using PANTHER (test release 2019\u201007\u201011) with the human reference genome gene set as background. Statistical significance of overrepresented GO terms was computed using Fisher's exact test with FDR correction.Nuclear extract and GFP pull\u2010down and mass spectrometryNuclear extract of wild\u2010type and HeLa\nEGFP \u2010CENATAC\n cells was prepared as described earlier (Kloet et\u2423al,\n2016). In short, cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer (10\u2009mM HEPES KOH pH 7.9, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 10\u2009mM KCl). Afterward, the cell pellet was homogenized using a Douncer with type B pestle (tight) to lyse the cell membrane. After centrifuging, the nuclei were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in cold buffer for lysis (420\u2009mM NaCl, 20\u2009mM HEPES KOH pH 7.9, 20% v/v glycerol, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA) followed by rotation, centrifugation, and collection of the nuclear extract. 450\u2009\u03bcl of nuclear extract was used for each GFP pull\u2010down using 15\u2009\u03bcl slurry of GFP\u2010Trap agarose beads (Chromotek), performed in triplicate. GFP pull\u2010downs were done as described earlier (Smits et\u2423al,\n2013), without the addition of EtBr during the incubation, and with an adapted buffer C (150\u2009mM NaCl, 20\u2009mM HEPES KOH pH 7.9, 20 % v/v glycerol, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA, complete protease inhibitors w/o EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM DTT) for the incubation (+0.1% NP\u201040) and washes (+0.5% NP\u201040). Samples were digested using on\u2010bead digestion with trypsin overnight (Hubner & Mann, 2011). The tryptic peptides were acidified with TFA and purified on C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et\u2423al,\n2007).After elution from the C18 StageTips, tryptic peptides were separated on an Easy\u2010nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific), connected online to a Q Exactive HF\u2010X Hybrid Quadrupole\u2010Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), using an acetonitrile gradient of 7\u201330% for 48\u2009min followed by washes of 50\u201390% acetonitrile, for 60\u2009min of total data collection. Full scans were measured with a resolution of 120,000, and the top twenty most intense precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with a resolution of 15,000 and dynamic exclusion set at 30\u2009s. Peptides were searched against the UniProt human proteome (downloaded June 2017) using MaxQuant (Cox & Mann, 2008) (version 1.6.0.1) with default settings, and iBAQ, LFQ, and match\u2010between\u2010runs enabled. Data analysis was done using Perseus (version 1.5.5.3), and the volcano plot and stoichiometry calculations were done as described earlier (Smits et\u2423al,\n2013) using in\u2010house\u2010made scripts for R (version 3.6.1).Nuclear extract preparations for Northern blotsNuclear extract from HeLa S3 suspension cells was prepared according to the protocol described by Dignam et\u2423al (1983) using buffer D containing 50\u2009mM KCL in the final dialysis step.Immunoprecipitation and Northern blots100\u2009\u00b5l nuclear extract diluted in lysis buffer to a final volume of 200\u2009\u00b5l was incubated with 2\u2009\u00b5g of anti\u2010CCDC84 antibody (SIGMA\u2010HPA071715) overnight in the cold room with end\u2010to\u2010end rotation. The following day capture of antibody\u2013antigen complexes was done using 50\u2009\u00b5l of resuspended Protein G Dynabeads prepared according to manufacturer's instructions and incubated with the nuclear extract antibody samples for 2\u2009h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer lacking protease and RNase inhibitors. RNA was eluted by proteinase K treatment, extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; pH 4.8) followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA was dissolved in H2O or 0.1X TE buffer.Total volumes of 2\u2009\u00b5l (input) and 5\u2009\u00b5l (IP) RNA samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide\u2013urea gel and analyzed by Northern blotting essentially as described by Tarn and Steitz (1996). Individual snRNAs were detected using 32P 5\u2032\u2010end\u2010labeled DNA or LNA oligonucleotides complementary to individual snRNAs. Northern blots were exposed to image plates and visualized using Typhoon FLA\u20109400 Scanner (GE Healthcare, USA) at 50\u2010micron resolution. The data were quantified using AIDA Software (Raytest, Germany).Glycerol gradient and ultracentrifugationHeLa S3 nuclear extracts were preincubated for 0\u201320\u2009min at +30\u00b0C in a buffer containing 13\u2009mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 2.4\u2009mM MgCl2, 20\u2009mM creatine phosphate, 2\u2009mM DTT, 40\u2009mM KCl, and 0.5\u2009mM ATP. Aggregates were subsequently removed by a brief centrifugation (20,000\u2009g, 1\u2009min, +4\u00b0C), and the supernatant was subsequently ultracentrifuged on a linear 10\u201330% glycerol gradient (20\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 40\u2009mM KCl, 2\u2009mM DTT, 2.4\u2009mM MgCl2) for 18\u2009h at 29,000\u2009rpm, +4\u00b0C, Sorvall TH641 rotor (RCF(max) = 143,915.6 g). Following ultracentrifugation, the samples were fractionated. 20% of each fraction was deproteinized and used for RNA isolation and Northern blotting and the remaining 80% was subjected to TCA precipitation, separated on a 10% SDS\u2013PAGE, and analyzed by Western blots. Each blot was probed for CENATAC (CCDC84\u2010HPA071715; Sigma\u2010Aldrich\u2013Merck), PRPF4 (#HPA0221794, Sigma\u2010Aldrich\u2013Merck).RT\u2013PCRsFor Figs\u20094A and 4D, and Appendix\u2423Fig S10: Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit Protocol (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I amplification grade (Invitrogen) to remove potential genomic DNA contamination. cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript\u2122 II RT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Oligo(dT)18 primers. PCRs were performed with Phusion High\u2010Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation (98\u00b0C for 60\u2009s), followed by 28\u201330 cycles of denaturing (98\u00b0C for 10\u2009s), annealing (gene\u2010specific temp. for 30\u2009s), extension (72\u00b0C for 15\u201320\u2009s), and a final extension (72\u00b0C for 1\u2009min 30\u2009s). PCR primers and relevant annealing temperatures are listed in Table\u2009EV3. PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel run using 1X TBE buffer. For Figs\u20094B and \u200band5E,5E, total RNA isolated was isolated from HeLa cells or patient/control subject lymphoblasts using TRIzol extraction followed by an additional acidic phenol (pH 5.0) extraction. 1\u2009\u00b5g of RNA was converted to cDNA using maxima H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCRs were performed essentially as described above, and gene\u2010specific primers and annealing temperatures are listed in Table\u2009EV3.RNA isolation and high\u2010throughput sequencingTotal RNA isolated was isolated from HeLa\nEGFP\u2010AID\u2010CENATAC\n cells treated with siGAPDH (Dharmacon, D\u2010001830\u201001\u201005) for 48\u2009h or with siCENATAC (CCDC84, Dharmacon, J\u2010027240\u201007) and 1\u2009mM 3\u2010indoleacetic acid (IAA) for 24 or 48\u2009h, or unedited HeLa parental cells treated with siGAPDH for 48\u2009h, or patient/control subject lymphoblasts using TRIzol extraction followed by an additional acidic phenol (pH 5.0) extraction. RNAseq libraries were constructed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Illumina) Human Ribo\u2010Zero rRNA Depletion Kit (Illumina). Paired\u2010end 150\u2009+\u2009150\u2009bp sequencing was done with Illumina NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 for HeLa samples and with Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using partial S4 flow cell lane for patient samples.Mapping the reads to the genomeThe STAR aligner (Dobin et\u2423al,\n2013) was used for mapping the paired sequence reads to the genome (hg38/GRCh38). Transcript annotations were obtained from GENCODE (v29). The length of genomic sequence flanking the annotated junctions (sjdbOverhang parameter) was set to 161. The Illumina adapter sequences AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC and AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT were, respectively, clipped from the 3\u2032 of the first and the second pairs in the read libraries (using clip3pAdapterSeq parameter).Differential alternative splicing analysisDifferential AS analysis was done using Whippet (v0.11) (Sterne\u2010Weiler et\u2423al,\n2018). Both merged aligned reads (bam files) and AS event annotations from GENCODE (v29) were used to build the index reference for AS events. To detect the significantly differential events, probability cutoff of Pr\u2009>\u20090.9 and percentage spliced in deviation cutoff of |\u0394\u03a8|\u2009>\u20090.1 were used.Differential intron retention analysisFor a comprehensive and sensitive IR analysis, the IntEREst R/Bioconductor package was used (Oghabian et\u2423al,\n2018). After reading binary alignment (.bam) files, IntEREst detects introns with significantly higher and lower number of mapped reads relative to the number of reads that span the introns. The DESeq2\u2010based function of IntEREst, i.e., deseqInterest(), was used for the differential IR analysis. The Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method was used for adjusting the P\u2010values, and a cutoff of P\nadj\u2009<\u20090.05 was applied to extract the significantly differential IRs. The reference table was built from the NCBI RefSeq transcription annotations based on hg38/GRCh38 genome assembly.Annotating minor intronsWe used IntEREst R/Bioconductor package to annotate the minor (U12\u2010type) introns as described previously (Oghabian et\u2423al,\n2018) using threshold values of 0.07 and 0.14 for 5\u2032ss and BPS scores, respectively. BPS was identified by scanning intronic region from position \u221240 to position \u22123 upstream of the 3\u2032ss, and the highest scoring sequence was selected as the BPS. This list was manually appended with additional introns that did not fulfill our annotation criteria (typically because of poor BPS), but have been previously identified as minor introns (Chang et\u2423al,\n2007).P120 minigene cloning, transfection, and analysis of RNAThe double 5\u00b4ss constructs were created by insertion mutagenesis PCR using the P120 minigene (Hall & Padgett, 1996) as a template, and further modifications of 5\u2032 splice sites were made by PCR using mutagenic primers (for a list of primers used see Table\u2009EV3). The 3\u2032ss was modified to accommodate for GT\u2010subtype splicing by insertion of a CAG trinucleotide sequence through insertion mutagenesis PCR. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the double 5\u2032ss constructs (1,600\u2009ng per well of a 12\u2010well plate) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and after 24\u2009h, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following DNase treatment, a pCB6 vector\u2010specific oligonucleotide (ACAGGGATGCCA) was used for reverse transcription of the RNA with RevertAid (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT\u2013PCR was performed with primers binding exon 6 (GGATGAGGAACCATTTGTGC) and exon 7 (AGAACGAGACCGCCCTTC), and the resulting PCR products were analyzed on a 3% MetaPhor\u2122 (Lonza) agarose gel. The gel was imaged using Fuji LAS\u20103000 CCD Camera, and the band intensities were quantified using AIDA Software (Raytest, Germany). Identities of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Author contributionsBW, GJPLK, MJF, NR, and ECT conceptualized the data.
