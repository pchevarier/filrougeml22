(2018).Subject areas: Cell separation/fractionation, Sequencing, RNA-seq, Molecular Biology, Gene Expression, CRISPR, Protein expression and purification, Structural Biology Graphical AbstractOpen in a separate window Before you beginThe pervasiveness and wide-ranging abundance of ncRNAs have spurred debates on how their functionalities should be defined (Palazzo and Lee, 2015, Boland, 2017, Cech and Steitz, 2014). Needless to say, RNA structure provides the underlying basis for functions of ncRNAs/RNPs. Methods to capture the relevant RNP conformation in action during intracellular trafficking and catalysis are valuable to elucidate RNP regulations in vivo and in vitro. Here, we describe an experimental pipeline that enables direct coupling and cross-referencing of RNP\u2019s cellular localization (step 1), assembly and catalytic activity (step 2) with RNA conformation captured by icSHAPE-seq (step 3).icSHAPE (in vivo click selective 2-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiments) was initially described to derive RNA secondary structure profile at a transcriptomic level by treating live cells with the icSHAPE modifier NAI-N3 (Flynn et\u00a0al., 2016b, Flynn et\u00a0al., 2016a, Spitale et\u00a0al., 2015). We uniquely define how to adapt this versatile technique on endogenous assembled RNPs purified from distinct cellular contexts. Combining with genetic and biochemical manipulations of a specific RNP component, these approaches allow an unambiguous assignment of structural and functional changes in the RNP to a specific RNA binding protein (RBP) subunit.CRITICAL: All steps should be carried out using RNase-free grade reagents and with standard practices to avoid RNase contamination. In addition, keep cells and all fractions of RNA/RNP/enzymes chilled throughout;snap-freeze and store any unused reagents in aliquots to minimize exposures in aqueous form and freeze-thawing cycles.In-house production of Cas9-sgRNA RNPs for gene deletionTiming: 6 hTo interrogate an RBP\u2019s contributions to RNP functions, we use loss-of-function approaches, such as siRNA-mediated knockdown (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020a, Roake et\u00a0al., 2019, Venteicher et\u00a0al., 2009), and CRISPR-mediated gene inactivation (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020a, Roake et\u00a0al., 2019, Chen et\u00a0al., 2018). For non-essential genes, CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts are preferred, because incomplete knockdown of the targeted gene can result in low level of the RBP proteinsufficient to sustain RNP functions, thereby masking RNP\u2019s functional dependency on the RBP - in the case of TCAB1 (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018, Venteicher et\u00a0al., 2009). For essential genes, CRISPR-based inactivation tends to yield hypermorphs with only mild target reduction (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020a, Chen et\u00a0al., 2020b); whereas more efficient target depletion can be achieved using transiently introduced siRNAs (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020b).CRISPR editing can be achieved with ectopic expression of Cas9 and gRNAs from a plasmid, such as PX459 (Ran et\u00a0al., 2013). Though the plasmid-borne method is widely used and user-friendly, we prefer to reconstitute the Cas9-gRNA RNP complex for these following reasons: firstly, promoters used to drive Cas9 cDNA and gDNA on the plasmid do not work for every target cells; secondly, plasmids can be integrated into the genome, causing prolonged Cas9 expression and cytotoxicity; thirdly, Cas9-sgRNA RNPs can readily edit genome upon cell entry without accumulating off-targeting edits due to cellular decay (Chen et\u00a0al., 2016, Zuris et\u00a0al., 2015). Here, we describe how to design and produce recombinant Cas9-sgRNA RNPs in-house.1.Design and synthesis of sgRNAs by in vitro\ntranscription (IVT)a.To engineer reliable loss-of-function alleles of a given RBP gene, we introduce genomic deletion at early exon(s) using a pair of CRISPR sgRNAs, which flank a genomic region up to 1kb.Note: Ideally, the flanked region should be exonic sequences of a high degree of conservation and/or functionality, such as an RNA binding motif or a catalytic domain. The design of sgRNAs can be facilitated by online tools such as CRISPOR/Tefor (Concordet and Haeussler, 2018).b.To enable IVT of sgRNAs by T7 RNA polymerase, order two overlapping DNA oligos as described in (Bassett et\u00a0al., 2013), see materials and equipment for sequence details.c.Perform an overlapping PCR reaction to generate a dsDNA template for IVT.i.We use the Phusion PCR enzyme and the HF-buffer in a 100\u00a0\u03bcL reaction, see materials and equipment for the recipe and the PCR program.ii.Run an analytic gel for QC: if the PCR product does not appear predominantly as 123\u00a0bp, optimize the PCR reaction to maximize full-length yield.iii.Resuspend the bulk reaction using 5\u00d7 volume of the PNI buffer (from the Qiagen PCR purification kit) and purify with a mini-Elute column.Note: To obtain the full-length PCR product with high yield, We tend to avoid gel extraction procedure for PCR-cleanup, as certain carry-overs using the commercial gel purification kit appear to interfere with IVT reactions.iv.Elute purified dsDNA templates in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of ddH2O.CRITICAL: High concentration and purity of the eluted dsDNA are the keys to an optimal IVT reaction. Use cautions during the column washing step to avoid introducing any carryovers.d.In\u00a0vitro transcription (IVT) of sgRNAs using T7 polymerase.i.Set up a 20\u00a0\u03bcL reaction in PCR tubes at an ambient temperature around 22\u00b0C using the T7 high yield synthesis kit, with the maximum volume of dsDNA template included (see materials and equipment).ii.Incubate the reaction in a PCR machine at 37\u00b0C, do not exceed 2 h.Note: The reaction solution may become turbid which usually indicates high RNA yield.iii.Spike in 1\u00a0\u03bcL of turbo DNase, continue the 37\u00b0C incubation for 15min.iv.Purify the sgRNA using an RNA spin column.Alternatives: we purified high-quality RNAs with either the Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit or standard Trizol extraction.v.For QC of RNA integrity, mix 1\u00a0\u03bcg of the product with an equal volume of RNA loading dye (recipe in materials and equipment), heat at 75\u00b0C for 5min, and resolve in 7% Urea-PAGE gel (See materials and equipment), followed by SYBR-Gold staining.Note: The final sgRNAs are expected to run as a 100 nt band without apparent degradation. See Figure\u00a01 and troubleshooting 1.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Quality control outcomes for RNAs produced by in vitro transcription\u201cgood\u201d lanes exemplify optimal RNA preparations, where the majority of the products migrate at the molecular weight of the expected size (marked by black triangles); \u201cbad\u201d lanes show suboptimal reactions, where a significant portion of the products are either truncated or shorter than full length - comet tailing, potentially due to RNase contamination or incomplete elongation by the T7 polymerase.(A) 1\u00a0\u03bcg of IVT-sgRNAs (100nt) separated by a 6% UREA PAGE.(B) 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg of IVT-xCas9-ABE mRNA (5.4 kb) separated by a 1.5% agarose/MOPS gel.Pause point: Snap freeze aliquots of sgRNAs; store in \u221280\u00b0C.2.Reconstitute Cas9-sgRNA RNPsa.Dilute the Cas9 protein in the Cas9 working buffer (see materials and equipment), mix in equal molar of sgRNAs.b.Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 5min to allow the Cas9-sgRNA RNP to assemble. Use immediately for RNP transfection into target cell lines in Major step 1-b.Generation of an antibody for RNP purificationTiming: 6\u00a0monthsAffinity purification of RNPs greatly enriches the resident ncRNA, allowing ex\u00a0vivo probing by icSHAPE with improved resolution (Major step 3), and enabling in\u00a0vitro functional characterizations and biochemical reconstitution with recombinant RBPs (Major step 2). To this end, a high-quality antibody allows enrichment of endogenous RNPs from unedited cells, avoiding epitope-tagging or ectopic expression, both of which can alter the structural and functional properties of the RNP (Chiba et\u00a0al., 2017, Stern et\u00a0al., 2012). Affinity-purified, IP-grade antibodies for endogenous RNPs are not always available from commercial vendors. Whether an antibody can quantitatively enrich a specific RNP activity or components should be empirically determined, as shown in Figure\u00a03 and in (Cohen and Reddel, 2008).3.Choose an antigenic region(s) of RBP as an antigen:a.For low yield expressers, select a 70-80 amino acid region with high antigenicity score, high surface probability, and hign density of predicted turns.b.For high yield expressers, express the full-length protein as antigen.4.Clone selected antigenic regions into two bacterial expression vectors,a.for antigen production, pMCH vector with an MBP tag.b.for affinity purification from serums, pGCH vector with a GST tag.5.Express the MBP fusion protein in BL21 (DE3) competent cells by induction with 0.3\u00a0mM IPTG for 4\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C.6.Purify the MBP fusion protein with standard amylose affinity chromatography, and elute by competitive maltose elution, according to the manual of NEB (E8021S) and (Bonhoure et\u00a0al., 2018).7.Immunize a host animal such as a rabbit or sheep with the purified antigen for polyclonal antibody production.8.To prepare the affinity resin for antibody purification from serums.a.express the corresponding GST-tagged antigen in BL21(DE3) cells.b.Pass antigen-expressing lysates through an affinity column packed with glutathione resin, onto which the antigen is immobilized and crosslinked, using 14\u00a0mM DSS in DMF, rotating at 30\u00b0C for 45\u00a0min.c.Wash the affinity resin by gravity flow with 10\u00d7 Column-Volume (CV) of 50\u00a0mM of Glutathione\u00a0(GSH) blocking buffer (see materials and equipment) at an ambient temperature around 22\u00b0C.d.Wash by gravity flow with 5\u00d7 CV of 0.1\u00a0M Glycine (pH 2.5) solution, followed by neutralization with 10\u00d7 CV of 0.1\u00a0M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at an ambient temperature around 22\u00b0C.Pause point: Store the sealed resin in 4\u00b0C for up to a year.Note: For QC purpose, set aside a small aliquot from each of these fractions: Input, flowthrough lysates, resins prior to DSS, and resins post-glycine wash. Assess the abundance of the antigen by anti-GST western blotting or Coomassie Blue staining.9.To affinity-purify antibody from a crude serum:a.Load 5\u00d7 CV of serum onto the affinity column, gentle rotating 10\u201314\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.b.Wash the resin with 50\u00d7 CV of PBS.c.Sequential elute the bound antibody with 12\u00d7 50% CV of 0.1M Glycine (pH 2.5), each into individual tubes containing 5% CV of 1\u00a0M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Neutralize by gently inverting the capped tube immediately after each elution.CRITICAL: minimize the exposure of the eluted antibody with the acidic glycine.d.Assess eluates for IgG by western blotting or Coomassie Blue staining.e.Pool peak fractions.Optional: Concentrate the peak fractions through a centrifugal filter device (molecular weight cutoff of 10\u00a0kDa).Note: the integrity of the affinity-purified IgG can be assessed by Coomassie blue staining, and by quantitative immune-depletion of a specific RNP activity shown in Figure\u00a03.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03The anti-TERT antibody efficiently purifies and quantitatively depletes the endogenous telomerase RNP from nuclear extractsThe ladder-like bands are Telomerase Repeated Amplification Protocol (TRAP) products- specific activity pattern of the telomerase RNP, serving as a surrogate to evaluate the presence of active telomerase RNP in each fraction tested (Major Step 4). The anti-TERT antibody \uff08T421\uff09 was produced by immunizing a rabbit with the amino acid 421-493 of the human TERT protein fused with MBP, and affinity-purified using the GST-tagged antigen, as in Preparation 3-9. 1x and 3x denote the relative amount of each fraction assayed to demonstrate the linear range; 1x representing the corresponding percentage of total fraction volume as indicated for Input (1%), depleted (1%), and IP (2%).In\u00a0vitro transcription to synthesize naked RNAsTiming: 5 hThe structural profiling of a naked RNA by icSHAPE provides an important reference point for the default RNA folding state. When compared with the profile in its RNP context, base-resolution footprints of an RBP can be identified unbiasedly. Heredescribes the procedure we used to synthesize hTR - the noncoding RNA subunit of the human telomerase.10.Clone hTR (451 nt) into a T7 promoter-containing vector- pCMV-T7-hTR (Fu and Collins, 2003).11.Linearize the plasmid with EcoR1, which cuts right at the end of the hTR sequence. Digest 2\u00a0\u03bcg of plasmid DNA for 10\u201314\u00a0h with 5\u00a0\u03bcL EcoR1-HF in a 50\u00a0\u03bcL restriction digestion.12.Resuspend the reaction thoroughly with 450\u00a0\u03bcL of PNI, and proceed with reaction cleanup with a DNA spin column.Note: wash the bound DNA twice with the Qiagen column washing buffer PE. Avoid any carry-overs.Pause point: Elute DNA in 30\u00a0\u03bcL of ddH2O.13.IVT synthesis using the NEB T7 high yield kit, using all 30\u00a0\u03bcL of linearized DNA as the template. Follow similar instructions in Preparation-1-d14.For RNA species\u00a0< 0.5 kb, QC the final IVT product by UREA-TBE PAGE; for longer RNAs, using a 1.5% MOPS-agarose gel instead (see materials and equipment)Note: for good and bad QC examples, see Figure\u00a01 and troubleshooting 1.

We also describe how to genetically rescue these KO cells with the RBP cDNA. These cell lines can be used to dissect RNP\u2019s cellular functions that depend on the contribution of a given RBP (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018, Chen et\u00a0al., 2020a, Chen et\u00a0al., 2020b). Finally, genetically reconstituted cell lines expressing an epitope-tagged RBP provide a convenient source for recombinant RBPs to be used in the subsequent biochemical reconstitution (Major step 5).1.Genomic targeting of the RBP by Cas9-sgRNA RNPsa.Seed 3\u00a0\u00d7 104 HeLa or mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in a 48-well plate one night before the transfection.b.Transfect reconstituted Cas9-sgRNA RNPs (20 pmol of Cas9 protein, and 20 pmol of sgRNA), together with 2 pmol of pcDNA-GFP, using 1.5\u00a0\u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in Opti-mem.Alternatives: plasmid-borne Cas9 and sgRNAs, e.g., PX459 (Ran et\u00a0al., 2013), can also deliver genome-editing to cells by transfection, also see the discussion in Preparative step 1.Note: co-transfect with the GFP-expressing vector enables the enrichment of positive-transfectants by FACS-sorting.c.3\u00a0days post-transfection, sort GFP-expressing single cells into two 96-plates.Alternatives: seed 1000 cells sparsely in a 10cm dish for cell cloning.d.Pick single HeLa colonies after about 14\u00a0days, and about 10\u00a0days for mESCs.Pause point: Prepare cells for colony screeening and freeze down a replicate plate.Note: No medium change is necessary during clonal growth.e.Screen for KO clones based on the RBP expression using western blotting or immunofluorescence.f.To analyze the genomic sequence of the targeted locus, design two PCR primer pairs,i.Inside amplicon for detecting unedited alleles: within the two sgRNA cutting sites.ii.Outside amplicon for detecting edited alleles: flanking the region to be deleted.Note: Successful homozygous deleted clones are expected to be negative for the inside amplicon, while positive for the outside amplicon.g.The outside amplicon can be further cloned into a TOPO vector, followed by colony sequencing to examine the exact genomic composition post-editing.Note: we routinely observe \u223c25% clones with monoallelic deletions and \u223c7% clones with biallelic deletions.2.Genetic rescuing the KO cell line with an epitope-tagged cDNA of RBP.a.Clone cDNA of the RBP in-frame with an epitope tag, into a lentiviral packaging vector such as pCDH-CMV-puro.CRITICAL: since the pCDH contains long terminal repeats (LTRs) that are prone to recombination, we recommend propagating them in the Stbl3 stain with reduced recombination frequency.b.For lentivirus packaging, we transfect 293T cells seeded one-night prior in a 10-cm dish at 50% confluency.c.dilute the following 3rd generation packaging plasmids in 1\u00a0mL Opti-MEM:i.pMDLg/pRRE: 4.5ugii.pCMV-VSVG: 2.5ugiii.pRSV-Rev: 1.5ugiv.pCDH-tag-RBP-PuroR or pCDH-GFP-PuroR control: 7ugd.In a separate tube, resuspend 50\u00a0\u03bcL of lipofectamine in 1\u00a0mL of OptiMEM.e.Combine and mix contents from two tubes, incubate at an ambient temperature around 22\u00b0Cfor 20\u00a0min.f.Add the 2mL cocktail into 293T cells in Opti-mem, incubate for 6\u00a0h under standard tissue culture condition.g.Replace the dish with a complete culture medium.h.48\u00a0h post-transfection, collect the 1st batch of culture medium, and store it at 4\u00b0C; replenish the remaining cells with fresh medium.CRITICAL: protect the viral supernatant from lights, and handle it with biosafety level 2 precautions.i.72\u00a0h post-transfection, combine both supernatants, pass through a 0.45\u00a0\u03bcM polyethersulfone filter using a syringe.CRITICAL: do not use the 0.22 uM filter, as virus particles may be damaged.j.To concentrate the viral supernatant, add 1/3 the volume of Lenti-X concentrator, incubate 10\u201314\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. Protect it from light.Alternatives: the filtered unconcentrated viral supernatant can be directly used to infect cells.k.The next day, spin at 1500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 45min at 4\u00b0Cl.Resuspend the visible viral pellet in an 800\u00a0\u03bcL complete culture medium containing 10% FBS. This concentrated viral solution can be directly applied to infect target cell hosts.Alternatives: concentrated viral supernatants can be aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored in \u221280\u00b0C for future infection. Note potential drop of viral titer can occur during freezing and thawing.m.To infect target host cells, seed 5\u00a0\u00d7 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate with a complete medium containing 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL polybrene, incubate for 1\u00a0h in the TC incubator.n.Swirl-in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of concentrated viral solution into the culture medium.Note: GFP expression in the GFP-transduced cells should be visible by 24 h, which can be used to track the progression of the transgene expression.o.48\u00a0h post-infection or whenever most control cells become GFP-positive, begin antibiotic selection by adding 2\u00a0ng/\u03bcL puromycin.Note: We expect complete killing of the mock-transduced control cell within 2\u00a0days; while expecting pCDH-transduced cells to show minimum cell death, if at all. Minimum cell death indicates efficient viral transduction. These rescued cells can be further expanded in reduced puromycin.CRITICAL: To maintain stable expression of the transgene, avoid extensive passages; instead, go back to a low-passage stock.p.Instructions and examples for immunofluorescence, single-molecule RNA FISH, and biochemical assays can be found in (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020a, Chen et\u00a0al., 2018)RNP purification and biochemical reconstitutionTiming: 5\u00a0daysEfficient cellular fractionations can achieve a significant enrichment for RNPs. Cellular compartments and fractionation procedures may differ per RNP of interest. Here we describe a fractionation procedure relevant for multiple RNPs that differentially distribute between the cytosolic, nucleoplasm, and chromatin compartments. Specifically, we avoid detergent usage, minimize mechanical disruptions, and rely on high salt extraction; thereby, a pool of RNP complexes with high solubility, specific activity, and native folding states are preferentially extracted and enriched. The subsequent purification step depends on an affinity-purified, homemade antibody to purify endogenous RNP complexes with native stoichiometry and specific activity (Figure\u00a03), avoiding potential complications introduced by epitope tagging or overexpression of exogenous constructs (Chiba et\u00a0al., 2017, Stern et\u00a0al., 2012).Quality controls during extract preparation and RNP purification are crucial because introducing molecular aggregates and insolubles into the icSHAPE reaction can complicate data interpretation. For QC of RNP purification and production, assaying a specific activity of RNPs is preferred, as shown with the telomerase assay in Figure\u00a03. If such an assay is not available, it is recommended to track the abundance of RNP components in solubilized fractions, e.g., quantitatively assessing protein or RNA levels in \u201cInput extract\u201d, \u201cantibody-depleted extract\u201d, and \u201celuate\u201d using western and northern blottings.3.Fractionate cells into a cytosolic extract \u201cS100\u201d, a high salt nuclear extract, and a DNase I-sensitive chromatin extract.Note: The procedure is modified from (Dignam et\u00a0al., 1983), and was described in (Chen et al., 2014). For a large-scale extraction, we grow a minimum of 10\u00a0ml of Packed Cell Volume (PCV), an equivalent of \u223c3\u00a0\u00d7 109 cells. The large-scale ensures a sufficient amount of purified RNPs for multiple biochemical and structural readouts with necessary replicates, particularly helpful for low-expression RNPs, e.g., telomerase RNP - a couple of hundred assembled RNPs per HeLa cell (Xi and Cech, 2014).Alternatives: the original Dignam extraction has also been adopted at a smaller scale, with 3\u00d7 15\u00a0cm tissue culture plates \u223cabout 1\u00a0\u00d7 108 mammalian cells (Folco et\u00a0al., 2012). The smaller scale is sufficient to study more abundant RNPs, such as snRNPs with about 0.5 million copies per cell (Castle et\u00a0al., 2010, Kiss and Filipowicz, 1992).CRITICAL: All tubes, homogenizers, and buffers should be pre-chilled before contacting cells and extracts. For all buffers, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 200\u00a0\u03bcM PMSF, RNase inhibitor, and a protease inhibitor cocktail should be added immediately upon usage. RNase-free grade reagents and practices should be used throughout.a.Harvest and wash cells with PBS, aspirate supernatant thoroughly, and measure the PCV (Figure\u00a02E).CRITICAL: high viability (>95%) of starting cells is crucial for the procedure, as shown in the trypan blue-stained 293T cells (Figure\u00a02A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Key visualizations during the Dignam nuclear extraction in Major step 3(A\u2013D) 293T cells or their nuclei stained by 0.2% Trypan Blue.

The timing and gentle handling are keys to minimize rupturing prior to homogenization.e.Resuspend the pellet in 2\u00d7 PCV of Buffer A, and transfer to a Dounce homogenizer.f.homogenize cell suspension with a LOOSE pestle, until 90% of cells are positively stained with Trypan Blue (0.2% final concentration) under a light microscope (see Figure\u00a02C for an example of incomplete homogenization, and Figure\u00a02D for the desired endpoint).CRITICAL: avoid over-homogenizing the nuclei, which compromises the quality of the final extract. The minimum necessary number of strokes for each cell type needs to be determined empirically (Figures 2C and 2D).g.Spin down the homogenates at 25,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 20min at 4\u00b0C.h.Transfer the supernatant, add 11.1% (v/v) of glycerol and 11.1% (v/v) of Buffer B (see materials and equipment) to reconstitute the final S100.Note: the salt concentration of the final S100 extract is \u223c280\u00a0mM.Note: S100 contains soluble cytosolic molecules and a fraction of nuclear molecules that inevitably leak out.CRITICAL: Avoid collecting debris from the nuclei pellet; also avoid introducing any insoluble debris from the S100 supernatant; re-centrifuge the S100 to pellet any insoluble if necessary.i.Aspirate and discard any leftover supernatant with a pipette and add Buffer C (see materials and equipment) to the nuclei pellet, swirl gently to resuspend, and transfer to a homogenizer.Note: For every 1mL of starting PCV - an equivalent of \u223c3\u00a0\u00d7 108 mammalian cells, add 0.83mL of Buffer C.j.Homogenize nuclei by a couple of strokes using a LOOSE glass pestle.CRITICAL: avoid over-homogenizing the nuclei resuspension.k.Pour the homogenates into a chilled beaker.Note: choose a properly sized beaker to allow efficient mixing of the solution (see Methods video S1)Methods video S1.

Harsh handling or over-homogenizing of cells or nuclei can introduce unwanted damages to the chromatin, resulting in insoluble debris that refrains from centrifugation. See troubleshooting 2.q.To release chromatin-bound molecules, rinse the pellet with PBS twice, and resuspend in a volume of 1x DNaseI digestion buffer (400 Kunitz Unit/mL) that is proportional to the starting cell number.Note: use 200 Kunitz Units of DNase I per 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells (for the recipe of a 10\u00d7 stock buffer, see materials and equipment).r.Gently rotate for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0Cs.Spin down 21,000\u00a0\u00d7 g, 1min at RT to pellet any insoluble.t.Store the supernatant as the salt-resistant, DNase-sensitive chromatin-bound fraction.Note: for QC of the chromatin-bound extracts by western blotting, histones and other chromatin-associating factors such as PCNA should be relatively enriched; whereas, the \u03b2-tubulin signal should be relatively depleted.4.Affinity-purify endogenous RNPsCRITICAL: For all buffers used here, add 0.2\u00a0mM DTT (reduced to preserve IgG), 200\u00a0\u03bcM PMSF, RNase inhibitor, and a protease inhibitor cocktail immediately upon usage. RNase-free grade reagents and practices should be used throughout.Note: high-salt (420 \u2013 450\u00a0mM) purification aims to reduce non-specific interactions, and to enrich salt-resistant, high-confidence components of RNP complexes.Alternatives: to preserve the salt-sensitive RNP components, dilute the nuclear extract 3-fold with 0.42\u00d7 Buffer C (diluted in ddH2O) \u2013 the final NaCl will be \u223c140\u00a0mM. Also, adjust NaCl to 140\u00a0mM in subsequent steps. Otherwise, proceed to the high salt purification as follows.a.Spinning down the input extract at 21,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C.

Proceed to enzymatic assays or icSHAPE pipeline.Structural probing of purified RNPs by icSHAPE-seqTiming: 6\u00a0daysIn\u00a0vivo icSHAPE-seq has been described in a step-by-step protocol (Flynn et\u00a0al., 2016b), by which structural dynamics of the whole RNA transcriptome can be extrapolated from living cells. To gain insights into RBP binding in vivo, deproteinized, in vitro-folded RNA transcriptomes have been compared side-by-side to yield protein-independent, RNA-intrinsic structure profile (Spitale et\u00a0al., 2015, Flynn et\u00a0al., 2016a). However, the icSHAPE reactions inside living cells vs. test tubes are performed with different conditions and substrate complexity, potentially introducing experimental variations. Additionally, reliable extrapolation of full length, base-resolution structural profile of RNA demands sequencing depth and sufficient coverage , which can be challenging for noncoding RNAs and RNPs of low abundance.To ensure high-quality structural profiling of candidate RNPs, we modified the icSHAPE protocol with the following considerations: firstly, to alleviate the complication related to depth and coverage, we enriched RNPs and RNAs of interest at a sufficient scale. Specifically, low abundant endogenous RNPs were affinity-purified from large-scale cultures of mammalian cells, and the corresponding RNA in naked form was synthesized at a high yield by in vitro transcription. Consequently, natively purified RNPs and their matching naked RNA can be normalized in terms of abundance and buffer condition, and be processed in parallel through the icSHAPE-seq pipeline (see the Graphic Abstract). Thirdly, to pinpoint the structural footprints of a given RBP in an unbiased fashion, the icSHAPE activity of RNPs with or without the RBP can be differentially compared (Figure\u00a04). To further validate an observed structural alternation that depends on an RBP, recombinant RBP can be reconstituted at controlled stoichiometry with the RNP (Figure\u00a04) or the naked RNA (data not shown). This discovery provides a structural framework to understand TCAB1\u2019s contributions to catalysis and assembly of the telomerase RNP and attests to the unbiased power of icSHAPE in revealing structural dynamics within an RNP.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Pinpoint the structural footprint of a given RBP by comparing the icSHAPE reactivity of RNPs with or without the RBP(A) Raw icSHAPE reactivity, as a probability score (0%\u2013100%), is graphed for RNA residues (298-430) of the telomerase RNA. The Blue track, telomerase RNP purified from WT cells; the Purple track, telomerase RNP purified from RBP-KO cell lines. RBP\u2019s binding site is boxed in Gray.(B) Tracking the RBP footprint by RBP-KO and biochemical reconstitution. Relative icSHAPE reactivity from various RNP contexts is graphed onto an RNA secondary structure model. The RBP binding site \u201cUGAG\u201d is boxed in gray. Increased reactivity (shown in Red) at the UGAG is attributed to the loss of RBP from the RNP complex; decreased reactivity (shown in Blue) is caused by saturation of the binding site by adding back of excessive recombinant RBP in vitro, which assembled with the RNP purified from RBP-KO cells (RNP w/o RBP). The RBP\u2019s additional distal binding sites at the P6.1 and P6b of telomerase RNA are not shown for simplicity. The differential icSHAPE reactivity profile (\u22121.0 to 1.0) from each context is derived by subtracting the value of an independent WT-RNP sample. Error bars represent the SD from two technical replicates.As a proof-of-concept, the biochemical reconstitution of TCAB1, a WD40-containing RBP, decreases the icSHAPE signal at the \u201cUGAG\u201d box \u2013 terminal loop residues of the telomerase RNA (Figure\u00a04), indicating icSHAPE can accurately capture TCAB1\u2019s footprint at the conserved CAB box important for telomerase localization in cells (Cristofari et\u00a0al., 2007). Moreover, we revealed TCAB1\u2019s distal structural footprints at P6.1 and P6b, two base-paired stem helices within the three-way-junction of the telomerase RNA. Lastly, structural dynamics specific to the RNP context can be uncovered by comparing and contrasting with the structure of the naked RNA (Figure\u00a05), generated in Preparative steps 10\u201315.6.Parallel icSHAPE modifications of purified RNPs and IVT-RNA by NAI-N3a.Normalize the molar concentration of complexed RNA and the IVT-RNA by northern blotting.b.Equilibrate WT-RNP, KO-RNP, and RNP\u00a0+ reconstituted RBP, and the IVT-RNA at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min.CRITICAL: for accurate structural comparison, it is important to process relevant samples throughout the icSHAPE pipeline in parallel to minimize variations caused by the batch effect.Note: all fractions should be in the same buffer condition, such as in 1x direct assay buffer.c.For each fraction, divide evenly into 4\u00d7 reaction tubes.i.TUBE1: NAI-N3-treatment, replicate1ii.TUBE2: NAI-N3-treatment, replicate2iii.TUBE3: DMSO/mock-treatment, replicate1iv.TUBE4: DMSO/mock-treatment, replicate2d.Add 100\u00a0\u03bcM of NAI-N3 or an equal volume of DMSO to corresponding reaction tubes, incubate reactions at 37\u00b0C for 12\u00a0min in a thermomixer at 1000\u00a0rpm.Pause point: Stop reactions by addition of Trizol LS reagent.CRITICAL: the timing and the incubation condition across samples should be handled with precision and consistency.e.Precipitate total RNAs, and resuspend them in ddH2O.f.Resuspend RNAs in 2.5\u00d7 volume of 100% ethanol, and purify RNAs using an RNA spin column.g.Quantitate the purified RNAs with the Qubit RNA HS assay and agarose gel.Note: 500\u00a0ng of purified RNAs are needed for successful library construction.7.cDNA library construction for NGS sequencing, and data analysis according to (Flynn et\u00a0al., 2016b)Note: Visualize icSHAPE reactivity at base-resolution onto an RNA secondary structure model (Figures 4 and \u200band5),5), using the HiTRACE software package version 2.0 (Yoon et\u00a0al., 2011).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Differential icSHAPE profile of RNPs vs. naked RNA distinguishes RNA-intrinsic vs. RNP-specific structural featuresRaw icSHAPE reactivity profiles of three RNPs are compared with the naked RNA that is IVT-synthesized and in vitro-folded. Regardless of the RBP status, icSHAPE profiles are similar among RNPs, particularly the high reactivity at the template region (boxed in gray). In comparison, the naked IVT-RNA shows a reactivity profile largely similar to RNPs, except for the template region, showing diminished reactivity instead. This unbiased comparison suggests that the template region of the RNA, upon assembling into the RNP context, undergoes a structural transition from a buried and inaccessible state, to an open, solvent-accessible state, which has implications in substrate binding and RNP catalysis. Expected outcomesA successful nuclear extraction procedure is expected to solubilize native RNPs with high specific activity and low level of contaminated DNase and RNase. Key visuals are provided in Figure\u00a02 as reference points for the extraction. In addition, IP-grade antibody \u2013 as instructed in the preparative step 2 \u2013 should be able to quantitatively enrich and deplete active RNP components and activity from the nuclear extract (Figure\u00a03). This serves as desired QC indicators for the quality of the antibody, for high solubility of extracted RNPs, and for the low background contamination of the extract.An icSHAPE-seq probing of endogenous telomerase RNPs with varying subunit composition is shown in Figure\u00a04. It is expected that known RBP binding sites, e.g., the \u201cCAB box\u201d bound by TCAB1, within the RNP should exhibit differential icSHAPE-reactivity. It is also expected that additional RBP footprints can be captured, providing unbiased structural probing of the intra-RNP dynamics, e.g., two helices of the CR4/5 domain of telomerase RNA distant from the CAB box.The icSHAPE profile of naked RNA synthesized in vitro provides a ground truth for RNA folding independent of RBPs and RNA PTMs. By comparing such with the very same endogenous RNA molecule \u2013assembled with RBPs and decorated with PTMs, it is expected to reveal RNP-specific structural dynamics, such as the decompaction of the template region of telomerase RNA upon its assembly into the RNP context (Figure\u00a05). LimitationsLimitation1. Engineering a reliable knockout cell line is crucial to reveal an RBP\u2019s structural and functional contributions to the RNP. However, for those RBP genes that are essential for cell growth, a clean knockout in cells is not feasible, following the CRISPR-KO approach described in Major Step-1. Instead of complete KO clones, hypomorphic clones with lowered target expression are often derived. Due to the heightened clonal variation and the residual RBP, analyzing multiple independent clones and genetic rescuing are recommended.Moreover, we do note that some of those apparent CRISPR-KO clones in early passages can develop \u201cescapers\u201d that partially or fully restore the expression and function of the once inactivated gene. This has been often observed in clones where a single CRISPR indel disrupted the ATG or the coding frame at an early exon. Cellular adaptive strategies, including alternative start codon usage, internal ribosome entry, alternative splicing, and paralog complementation have been reported to generate hypomorphic or neomorphic alleles. Thus, carefully designed guide RNA pairs that flank the functionally important region, or even the whole gene locus should be considered to generate reliable loss-of-function cells (Canver et\u00a0al., 2014, Bauer et al., 2015).Limitation2. We have observed a level of variations in icSHAPE measurements between biological replicates, and some considerable variations between experimental batches. These variations could be caused by differential amounts and complexities of the starting materials. In addition, the modification kinetics by NAI-N3 is sensitive to multiple parameters, including reaction time, temperature, substrate concentration, and complexity. Furthermore, the complexity and yield of the cDNA libraries between the NAI-N3 treatment and the DMSO-control groups become quite different after the biotin-selection step. Finally, the ensuing library amplification requires a different number of PCR cycles between the two groups, and the subsequent NGS needs differential depths to compensate for the lower yield of the NAI-N3 groups. These experimental variables could introduce challenges for quantitative assessment of icSHAPE reactivity at a given RNA base and across batches.Limitation3. A productive biochemical reconstitution provides direct evidence for RBP functions in vitro but depends on the availability of RBP preparations with sufficient quality and quantity, which are not always attainable. RBPs that are predominantly misfolded, aggregated, or copurified with contaminating activities that interfere with downstream biochemical readouts should not be used. Additionally, RBPs in certain cellular contexts may stably co-purify with (sub)stoichiometric endogenous factors, which would complicate the interpretation of the reconstitution result. Finally, certain RBP chaperons are responsible for proper folding and maturation of diverse RNA substrates (Yong et\u00a0al., 2010, Zhang et\u00a0al., 2008). The inactivation of such RBPs can lead to transcriptome-wide alternations that affect the specificity and efficiency of the antibody, thereby introducing variable background and complexity to the resulting RNP preparations. TroubleshootingProblem 1A significant portion of the in vitro-transcribed RNA products, including sgRNA (Preparative-1), Cas9 mRNA, or naked RNA for icSHAPE (Preparative-10), are shorter than the expected full-length. See Figure\u00a01 for the desired products and the \u201cbad\u201d outcome. This could be caused by RNase contamination or suboptimal conditions for the reverse transcription by T7 polymerase.Potential solutionTo limit the action of potential contaminating RNases, besides the standard precautions working with RNase-free environment and reagents, we keep RNA-containing tubes on ice whenever possible, and immediately snap-freeze any un-used RNAs using dry ice or liquid nitrogen for storage in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer.Secondly, prolonged incubation of T7 polymerase reactions in 37\u00b0C may increase the overall RNA yield, but negatively impact the RNA quality, potentially due to RNA degradation, enzyme exhaustion, and/or substrate depletion, which stalls the elongating RNA polymerase and results in the comet-tail pattern shown in Figure\u00a01. To combat this, we found that shortening the reaction time has improved the yield of full-length RNA products significantly. To compensate for the shortened reaction time, we saturate IVT reactions with DNA templates to maximize the (re)initiation rate of T7 polymerase. To prepare for DNA templates by PCR or by linearization of a circular plasmid, we recommend optimizing the PCR condition or the restriction digestion to maximize the yield of the desired DNA template, so that no further gel purification is needed. This is critical because we have found that carryovers from agarose gel extraction can negatively impact IVT reactions.Problem 2In Major step 3, the packed cell pellet is expected to swell in volume after the hypotonic incubation (Figures 2B and 2F). If not observed, a large fraction of cells may have ruptured cell membrane prematurely, which usually results in poor yield and quality of the final extracts.Potential solutionTo reduce premature damages to the cell membrane, the starting cells should have viability higher than 95% before harvesting (Figure\u00a02A). Secondly, we prefer to start the extraction protocol with freshly harvested cells, as both freezing/thawing and prolonged incubation on ice cause cell rupturing and clumping. Furthermore, cells, nuclei, and chromatin should be handled very gently, and be kept cold as much as possible.Problem 3As shown in Figure\u00a02G and Major step 3-p, a successful nuclear extraction should yield a transparent supernatant without visible debris. The appearance of debris in the extract can be caused by unwanted shearing/releasing of DNA and chromatin, which generally correlates with a higher level of contaminating nuclease and protease activities in the extract.Potential solutionIt is important to avoid exposing nuclei suspension to high NaCl concentration from the 5M stock during Major step 3-l. As instructed in Methods Video S1, we apply a slow but steady drop-wise stream of the 5M NaCl stock solution into the nuclei, while maintaining a gentle and efficient swirling to mix.Problem 4In Major step5, RBP add-back may not reconstitute structural or functional activities of interest.Potential solutionTo test the contribution of an RBP preparation to a given biochemical readout, we recommend titrating the RBP over a wide range of molar concentrations. To produce active RBPs for reconstitution, it is recommended to test different expression systems (prokaryotic vs. baculovirus vs. mammalian cell hosts). Also, different buffer usage, tagging, and purification strategies, e.g., the RNase pre-treatment in Major step 5. Furthermore, introducing mutations at the functional domain(s) of recombinant RBPs would help pinpoint the specific RBP property that contributes to any reconstituted activity.Problem 5In Major step 6, variations in icSHAPE profiles among biological replicates and assay batches.Potential solutionTo lower variations and batch effect, we recommend users handle relevant samples in parallel throughout the icSHAPE pipeline. Moreover, the starting cell numbers for RNA extraction or RNP purification should be kept at a comparable scale. Furthermore, RNAs/RNPs of a similar molar concentration, buffer condition, and complexity should be icSHAPE-treated and mixed using a multichannel pipet and processed with strict consistency across samples.
