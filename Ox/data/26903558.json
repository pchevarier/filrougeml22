INTRODUCTIONThe transcription elongation factor DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) is a highly conserved complex consisting of a large subunit, Spt5 (p160), and a small subunit, Spt4 (p14). DSIF plays a central role in promoter-proximal pausing by polymerase II (Pol II) (1). In addition, it was shown to facilitate capping (2,\u20135) and to coordinate elongation with mRNA splicing and export of a subset of inflammatory genes (6). Recently, DSIF was also reported to promote 3\u2032-end processing of snRNAs (7) and DNA cleavage during immunoglobulin class switching (8).Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that modulates many important physiological and pathological processes primarily through inflammation. It induces the production of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increases its own production (9). TNF-\u03b1, through the TNF receptor (TNFR), triggers a signaling cascade that leads to activation of NF-\u03baB, a family of transcription factors that is central to the inflammatory response elicited by TNF-\u03b1 and other extracellular signals. In the resting state NF-\u03baB resides in the cytoplasm as a dimer in complex with inhibitory proteins such as I\u03baB\u03b1 (10, 11). In response to TNF-\u03b1 or other signaling molecules, an I\u03baB kinase complex called IKK is activated and phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (10, 11). Freed of I\u03baB\u03b1, the NF-\u03baB dimer translocates into the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of genes that control inflammatory responses, cell survival, cell cycle, differentiation, and other functions (12, 13). The mRNAs induced by NF-\u03baB are divided into three major groups (I, II, and III) according to the kinetics of their expression, which represent early, slow, and very slow expression (12, 14, 15). This differential response was shown to be associated with differences in the mRNA half-lives in each group (14, 15) and to variations in splicing kinetics (12, 16, 17). However, the molecular features underlying the temporal transcriptional response are not fully understood. Additionally, very little is known about the potential of TNF-\u03b1 to modulate gene expression independently of NF-\u03baB.In recent years, it has become apparent that transcription elongation is a key regulatory stage in the activation pathway of NF-\u03baB (18). In particular, the cascade leading to phosphorylation and acetylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 was shown to mediate the recruitment of the elongation factor P-TEFb to many proinflammatory target genes, which in turn facilitate elongation and mRNA processing (19,\u201322). On the other hand, some anti-inflammatory genes, including A20 and I\u03baB\u03b1, are refractory to this pathway and are dependent on the elongation factor DSIF for efficient mRNA processing (6, 23). Presently, the scope of DSIF regulation of mRNA processing and its cooperation with TNF-\u03b1 are largely unknown.In the present study, we used cytosolic and chromatin RNA fractions to examine the effect of Spt5 on nascent and mature transcripts following TNF-\u03b1 induction. The data revealed a differential effect of TNF-\u03b1 on transcript release from chromatin, which is correlated with structural properties of genes and specific functional categories. Spt5 affects splicing and chromatin release of TNF-\u03b1-induced genes, and the effect is associated with the rate of transcriptional induction. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 also promotes splicing of a large number of genes in a manner that is, by and large, NF-\u03baB independent. This splicing facilitation is partially mediated by Spt5. Levels of Pol II but not Spt5 bound to these genes are diminished following TNF-\u03b1 induction. These findings suggest that the remaining Spt5-Pol II complex is highly efficient in coordinating transcription with mRNA splicing. Our findings extend the understanding of the transcriptional control of proinflammatory genes and reveal unknown molecular features of Spt5. MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culture and transfections. HeLa cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. To avoid basal NF-\u03baB activity, cells were kept from reaching confluence and replated after initial thawing no more than 10 times. Spt5 knockdown (KD) was carried out as previously described (6). Transfection was done using ICAFectin 441 transfection reagent (In-Cell-Art) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To induce NF-\u03baB activity, cells were treated with 20 ng/\u03bcl recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 (Peprotech) for the times indicated in the figures.RNA preparation. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (MRC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNA fractionation cells were detached from the dish with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and a cell scraper, centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 rpm, resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of cytosol lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40), gently vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 rpm. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and cytosolic RNA was extracted with 4 volumes of TRI reagent, along with an additional chloroform purification step. For isolation of nucleosol (nuclear soluble fraction) and chromatin-associated RNA, the nuclear pellets were resuspended in a glycerol buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.85 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]) by gentle finger flicking. One volume of nuclear lysis buffer was then added (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 1 M urea, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT). Nuclei were immediately vortexed for 2 s twice, incubated on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The nucleosolic supernatant was transferred to a new tube and harvested with 4 volumes of TRI reagent. The chromatin pellet was washed once in PBS\u20131 mM EDTA, and RNA was extracted with Tri reagent. RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and imaged with ethidium bromide to validate sample quality. In order to validate fractionation, small aliquots were taken from cytosolic, nuclear, and nucleosolic samples, and protein content was analyzed by Western blotting. The RNA was treated with DNase using a DNA-free Turbo DNase kit (Ambion). cDNA was prepared from 1 to 2 \u03bcg of RNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription (RT) kit (ABI) and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using an ABI 7300 real time PCR system and Power SYBR reaction mix (ABI). Primer information is available on request.High-throughput sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-Seq) and splicing analyses. Cytosolic and chromatin-associated RNA samples were depleted of rRNA using a Ribozero gold rRNA depletion kit (Epicentre). Samples were prepared for high-throughput sequencing using a TruSeq Total RNA prep kit (Illumina) and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system. Cytosolic samples were tagged, pooled, and sequenced in a single lane. Chromatin-associated samples were similarly sequenced in two lanes in order to obtain more reads as samples are expected to be more heterogeneous. After quality-control parameters of sequencing output were validated, reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome assembly (NCBI Reference Sequence [RefSeq] Database) using TopHat. Counts per gene were determined with HTSeq software, and statistical two-factor model analysis with the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate (FDR) was performed using DESeq software. Affected genes were clustered by the k-means algorithm using Expander software (upon several iterations with different cluster numbers, the k-means algorithm was deemed optimal), and a heat map visualization of clusters was created using Partek Genomics Suite software.Exon density is calculated as the ratio of the number of exons to gene length. Retention is calculated as the ratio of the fold induction detected in the chromatin to the fold induction in the cytosol fraction. For correlation analysis of length to fold induction, fold induction is calculated as average fold induction detected in the chromatin and cytosol fractions. The Spt5 RNA interference (RNAi) effect on chromatin retention in TNF-\u03b1-induced cells was calculated as the ratio of fold induction detected in the chromatin to that in the cytosol of TNF-\u03b1-treated Spt5 RNAi samples. Histograms depicting sequencing coverage were generated using the Broad Institute Integrative Genomics Viewer software.For analysis of splicing, all reads spanning known constitutive splice junctions (according to RefSeq annotation) were counted by HTSeq in the chromatin-associated samples and were designated either spliced (covering only exon-exon junction sequences) or unspliced (covering only exon-intron junction sequences). For each gene in each sample, the number of fragments per kilobase per million reads (FPKM) was calculated as follows: (number of fragments)/(total kilobase feature)/(millions of mapped reads in the sample). To assess the effect of treatment on splicing of each gene, Fisher's exact text was performed using spliced and unspliced reads. The test yields an odds ratio which expresses fold change effect on splicing and an FDR-adjusted P value. Genes with an FPKM of <2 for exonic reads and of <0.4 for intronic reads were omitted to avoid counting genes near or under background noise level. A list of genes with a splicing effect of 50% and over and with a P value of <0.01 was complied for further analysis.ChIP. HeLa cells (approximately 1.5 \u00d7 106 per immunoprecipitation [IP]) were treated or left untreated with 20 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 30 min and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Chromatin extraction and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) were carried out as previously described (6); DNA samples were purified using Qiagen PCR product purification columns and analyzed by qPCR (primer information is available on request).Western blotting and antibodies. Whole-cell extract was prepared by lysing cells in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentration of samples was measured by a Bradford assay and equalized. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Total (SWG16) and Ser2-specific (H5) Rbp1 antibodies were from Abcam (ab817 and ab24758, respectively). Total H3 antibody was also obtained from Abcam (ab1791). Spt5 antibody was previously described (23). The antibody against the Sm proteins was kindly provided by the late Josef Sperling (Weizmann Institute). RESULTSGenome-wide analysis of cytosolic and chromatin-associated transcripts following Spt5 knockdown and TNF-\u03b1 induction. To obtain a global and high-resolution view of the effects of Spt5 on TNF-\u03b1-induced transcript levels in different cellular compartments, we treated control and Spt5 knockdown (KD) cells (Fig. 1A, left) with TNF-\u03b1 for 1 h and then isolated RNA from the cytosol, nuclear soluble (nucleosol), and chromatin fractions. To validate the fractionation, we analyzed levels of tubulin (a cytosolic marker) and histone H3 (a chromatin marker) by Western blotting using cell-equivalent amounts of the subcellular fractions. As expected, tubulin was present exclusively in the cytosol, while H3 was present chiefly in the nuclear fraction and absent from the nucleosolic fraction (Fig. 1A, right). Analysis of individual genes revealed that the amount of nucleosolic mRNA is much lower than that of chromatin, consistent with rapid nuclear export of chromatin-released mRNA (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We therefore used the cytosolic and chromatin RNA for RNA-Seq analysis. After sequencing, reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly, and normalized expression of each RefSeq gene was determined. We then examined the following ratios: gene expression in TNF-\u03b1-treated cells versus that in controls, which describes the response to TNF-\u03b1; gene expression in Spt5 KD cells versus that in controls, which describes the effect of Spt5 KD on basal expression; and gene expression in TNF-\u03b1-treated Spt5 KD cells versus that in TNF-\u03b1-treated cells, which describes Spt5 KD effect on the rate of induction by TNF-\u03b1. This was done separately for both cytosol and chromatin samples. A total of 514 genes showed a statistically significant fold change in at least one of the ratios calculated (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Using the k-means algorithm, we clustered genes according to logs of calculated ratios into 10 distinct clusters (Fig. 1B). Clusters 1 through 4 consist of genes induced by TNF-\u03b1, representing 170 genes in total, with various ratios between induction in the chromatin and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1B, columns I and II). Cluster 5 genes are downregulated by Spt5 KD (Fig. 1B, columns III and IV). This cluster is highly enriched for histone genes (20 of 44), consistent with the reported role that Spt5 has in expression of histone genes (7). Cluster 6 consists of relatively very few genes that are inhibited by TNF-\u03b1. Cluster 7 genes are downregulated only in the cytosolic fraction, which we interpret as a posttranscriptional or indirect effect (the Spt5 gene itself appears in this cluster, downregulated by the RNAi). Clusters 8, 9, and 10 genes, 245 in total, are upregulated following Spt5 KD, but in cluster 10 this is mainly apparent in the chromatin fraction (Fig. 1B, columns III to VI).Open in a separate windowFIG 1Analysis of TNF-\u03b1-induced mRNAs in different subcellular compartments. (A) Fractionation of HeLa cells into cytosol, nucleosol, and chromatin fractions. Spt5 KD and control HeLa cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 1 h and harvested. Spt5 KD efficiency was validated using Western blotting (left panel). Cells were separated into cytosol and whole nuclei, and nuclei were further fractionated into nuclear soluble (nucleosol) and chromatin fractions. Cell-equivalent amounts of cytosol, whole nuclei, and nucleosol protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antitubulin and anti-H3 antibodies (right panel). (B) Global effects of TNF-\u03b1 and Spt5 KD on mRNA levels in subcellular compartments. Cytosolic and chromatin RNA samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing as described in Materials and Methods. Reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome assembly, and the indicated ratios were calculated between samples in each RNA fraction separately. The resulting gene list was clustered into 10 distinct groups. The heat map presents the log of the calculated ratios of differentially expressed genes for each fraction as indicated below the map.The four main TNF-\u03b1-induced gene clusters show gradual chromatin retention, with cluster 4 genes displaying a higher induction rate in the chromatin than in the cytosol (Fig. 1B, columns I and II). These phenomena may be related to the kinetics of induction, as NF-\u03baB response genes are known to be induced at different times in response to TNF-\u03b1 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (12, 14, 15). To examine this, we stimulated cells with TNF-\u03b1 and harvested RNA from the cytosol and chromatin fractions after 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. We then analyzed the relative mature mRNA levels of representative genes from each TNF-\u03b1-induced cluster by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2). The findings confirm that there are various rates of chromatin retention among TNF-\u03b1-induced genes. Notably, in some of the representative genes of cluster 4 (ECE1, NFKB2, and LAMB3 genes), the cytosolic levels do not reach the chromatin level even at late time points. Thus, it appears that in addition to the timing of transcriptional induction, chromatin retention substantially contributes to the differential expression kinetics of genes in the NF-\u03baB pathway.Open in a separate windowFIG 2Transcript accumulation kinetics. HeLa cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 for the indicated durations. Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted from the cytosolic and chromatin fractions. mRNA (mature) levels of representative genes from the TNF-\u03b1-induced clusters 1 to 4 were analyzed by RT-qPCR (primer information available on request). Graphs present RNA levels normalized to the level of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) in both fractions and calibrated to that of the untreated cytosolic sample, which was set to 1.To estimate transcript chromatin retention, we defined the retention of each gene by the ratio of its induction rate in the chromatin to that in the cytosolic fractions. We then plotted the retention rate of each cluster using a box plot (Fig. 3A) and looked for gene features that may be associated with retention. We plotted the gene length distribution in each cluster (Fig. 3B) and found that the plots of chromatin retention and gene length are remarkably similar. To test whether gene length correlates with chromatin retention, all TNF-\u03b1-induced genes were pooled and subjected to a nonparametric Spearman rank correlation test. The resulting coefficient (r) of 0.567 (two-tailed P value of <0.0001) indicates that there is indeed a clear correlation between the length and chromatin retention rate of TNF-\u03b1-induced genes. We also determined total intron and exon lengths (Fig. 3C and \u200bandD,D, respectively) and exon density (number of exons/kb) (Fig. 3E) of each gene and compared the distribution of this parameter in the different clusters; we found that cluster 4 displays the highest intron length and lowest exon density. These findings indicate that chromatin retention is not likely to be governed by the load of splicing events following TNF-\u03b1 induction but is mainly governed by intron length and probably exon location.Open in a separate windowFIG 3Features associated with genes affected by TNF-\u03b1 and Spt5 at the level of chromatin retention. (A) Box plot presentation of the distribution of chromatin retention levels in clusters 1 to 4 following TNF-\u03b1 induction. The bars represent the median, 25%, and 75% quartile values; the top and the bottom whiskers represent the 75 to 87.5% and 12.5 to 25% ranges of the population, respectively.

AU, arbitrary units.An additional aspect of chromatin retention is that of Spt5 following TNF-\u03b1 induction. Cluster 2 stands out in this regard as, following Spt5 KD, the induction of this cluster is enhanced in the chromatin-associated fraction but inhibited in the cytosol (Fig. 1B, columns V and VI). A graphical view of sequencing coverage of a few selected genes in which intronic reads are elevated following Spt5 KD is shown in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. To shed light on the differential regulation of inflammatory genes by Spt5, we determined the effect of its KD on retention values after TNF-\u03b1 induction on each gene, as described above (Fig. 3F). In parallel, the TNF-\u03b1 induction rates of each cluster in the chromatin fraction were also determined (Fig. 3G). Using a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, we found that induction rates differ most significantly between cluster 2 and each of the others. Likewise, differences in retention following Spt5 KD are significant only between cluster 2 and each of the other clusters. The Spearman correlation rank indicates a positive but modest coefficient (r) of 0.286 and a P value of <0.05 for comparisons between the effect of Spt5 KD on chromatin retention and the induction rate. This may suggest that there is a threshold of induction beyond which Spt5 is necessary to promote efficient splicing and chromatin release. The highly induced gene cluster 2 is specifically enriched with genes that promote inflammation, suggesting that Spt5 mediates part of the TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory response. To examine this further, we determined the effect of Spt5 KD on the expression of several important inflammation-promoting genes from this cluster. As shown in Fig. S3 in the supplemental material, the TNF-\u03b1-induced levels of the chemokines CXCL2 and CCL20, the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are, indeed, diminished by Spt5 depletion, supporting its important role in the TNF-\u03b1-mediated inflammatory response.TNF-\u03b1 promotes splicing of both transcriptionally induced and noninduced genes. The chromatin-associated RNA-Seq data represent reads of newly synthesized primary transcripts, enabling us to examine the effect of TNF-\u03b1 and Spt5 on splicing at a genomic scale using a previously described approach (17). For this purpose we generated two pools from the chromatin reads, one consisting of constitutive exon-exon junction reads and the second consisting of constitutive exon-intron junctions, representing spliced and unspliced transcripts, respectively. We compiled all genes with exonic FPKM values greater than 2 (see Materials and Methods), thereby omitting genes with very low expression and leaving 5,487 genes. We then calculated the distribution of spliced and unspliced reads for each chromatin sample. Interestingly, we found that TNF-\u03b1 treatment increased the number of spliced reads while decreasing the number of unspliced reads in chromatin, indicating that it promotes splicing (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, KD of Spt5 partially diminished TNF-\u03b1-induced splicing enhancement but not basal splicing (Fig. 4A).Open in a separate windowFIG 4Analysis of splicing following TNF-\u03b1 induction and Spt5 KD. (A) The upper panel shows a scheme of the RNA-Seq splicing analysis. Chromatin-associated reads aligned to the exon-exon junction or the exon-intron junction were separately combined to generate spliced and unspliced pools. Counted reads are from genes whose FPKM values were >2 for exonic reads and >0.4 for intronic reads. The distribution of the spliced and unspliced pools from each of the indicated samples is shown in box plots. Asterisks denote statistically significant differences (P < 0.0001). The genes in each pool were further analyzed using Fisher's exact test, which yields an odds ratio (measure of the difference in splicing efficiency in a given gene between samples) and a P value. (B) HeLa cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 for the noted durations and harvested. RNA samples were produced from the chromatin-associated fraction, reverse transcribed with random hexamers, and subjected to splicing efficiency analysis. The upper panel shows a schematic representation of the primer pairs used to detect the levels of spliced and unspliced transcripts. Validation of the PCR products was done by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material for several examples). Spliced and unspliced transcripts from representative genes from the list of genes whose splicing was induced by TNF-\u03b1 were analyzed by RT-qPCR and normalized to the level of GAPDH. The graphs present the ratios between spliced and unspliced transcripts at different time points of two independent experiments.Next, we analyzed the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on splicing of individual genes by performing Fisher's exact test to compare the ratio of the numbers of spliced to unspliced reads in control chromatin samples and the same ratio in induced chromatin samples (odds ratio) and to calculate P values (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). We found 1,346 genes whose splicing had increased after TNF-\u03b1 induction by at least 50%. Only 9 genes presented decreased splicing upon TNF-\u03b1 treatment, indicating that the effect exerted by this cytokine on splicing is almost entirely positive. Looking at the four TNF-\u03b1-induced clusters, we found increased splicing by TNF-\u03b1 in genes of clusters 1 to 3 but much less so in cluster 4, supporting the idea that the splicing delay is associated with the observed chromatin retention (Fig. 3H).By filtering out the TNF-\u03b1-induced genes, we found that the vast majority, 1,008 genes, display enhanced splicing in the absence of a transcriptional effect. A graphical view of the sequence coverage demonstrating the splicing effect of TNF-\u03b1 on a few selected noninduced genes is shown in Fig. S4 in the supplemental material.To validate the surprisingly broad effect of TNF-\u03b1 on splicing and to determine its kinetics, we selected eight transcriptionally noninduced genes and determined their splicing as described in scheme shown in Fig. 4B at several time points after TNF-\u03b1 induction, using RNA extracted from the chromatin fraction and RT-qPCR. We confirmed increased splicing following TNF-\u03b1 treatment in all of the eight genes (Fig. 4B). The splicing effect is transient in all cases but with various kinetics: rapid (KIF20A, CDC20, ECHS1, and ARL6IP1 genes), delayed (DDX3, PRMT5, and FXYD5 genes), and slow (SNRNP70 gene). We validated that these genes are not transcriptionally induced as their levels were not significantly changed following TNF-\u03b1 induction (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material).To examine whether the TNF-\u03b1-enhanced splicing of transcriptionally noninduced genes is mediated by NF-\u03baB, we transfected into cells an I\u03baB\u03b1 mutant that has a deletion of the N-terminal phosphorylation sites (I\u03baB\u03b1\u0394N) and that is resistant to TNF-\u03b1-induced degradation. With this mutant, the induction of the endogenous A20 and I\u03baB\u03b1 proteins (Fig. 5A; expression of I\u03baB\u03b1\u0394N is not seen as the epitope recognized by the antibody is in the absent N terminus) and the level of the A20 mRNA (Fig. 5B) are clearly diminished. Splicing analysis of the above-selected genes revealed that splicing enhancement was even slightly increased upon NF-\u03baB inhibition by I\u03baB\u03b1\u0394N (Fig. 5C), indicating that the TNF-\u03b1 effect on splicing is independent of NF-\u03baB.Open in a separate windowFIG 5TNF-\u03b1-facilitated splicing of noninduced genes is independent of NF-\u03baB. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with dominant I\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1\u0394N) or control vector for 48 h and then treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 120 min or left untreated. Cells were then harvested and subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (B and C) I\u03baB\u03b1\u0394N transfected HeLa cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 30 and 60 min, and RNA was prepared from the chromatin fraction. Levels of the A20 and GAPDH mRNAs were determined by RT-qPCR (B). The levels of spliced and unspliced transcripts of representative genes were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4B (C). The graphs are representative of two independent repeats.To determine whether specific functional categories are associated with this effect, we subjected the 1,008 genes whose splicing was enhanced by TNF-\u03b1 to gene ontology analysis. Interestingly, in spite of the large number of affected genes, there is a clear and highly significant enrichment of several categories, in particular, cell cycle and RNA metabolism (Table 1). Taken together, the data presented above uncovered an interesting phenomenon whereby TNF-\u03b1 induction preferentially enhances the splicing of genes that belong to specific functions.TABLE 1Functional classification of noninduced genes which show improved splicing following TNF-\u03b1 treatmentaFunctional groupEnrichment scoreNo. of genesP valueFDRCell cycle21.001287.98E\u2212231.43E\u221219Mitotic cell cycle21.00881.22E\u2212262.20E\u221223Nucleotide binding19.832586.18E\u2212259.79E\u221222RNA processing12.39925.44E\u2212179.76E\u221214Cytoskeleton11.591501.83E\u2212102.69E\u221207Chromatin modification7.11481.09E\u2212091.95E\u221206Nuclear envelope6.79428.38E\u2212111.23E\u221207mRNA transport6.79216.54E\u2212070.0011739Open in a separate windowaThe Web-based DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) program was used for functional annotation.

The global analysis of splicing shown in Fig. 4A also suggests the involvement of Spt5 in the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on splicing. We therefore examined the Spt5 KD effect on splicing of individual genes from the RNA-Seq data as described above and found 182 genes that showed decreased splicing. The sequencing coverage of a few genes is shown in Fig. S7 in the supplemental material. Of these 182 genes, 82% also overlapped with the set of genes whose splicing was increased by TNF-\u03b1 in the absence of a transcription effect (Fig. 6A), suggesting that splicing enhancement is partially dependent on Spt5.Open in a separate windowFIG 6TNF-\u03b1 and Spt5 regulate splicing cooperatively. (A) Venn diagram showing the number of genes whose splicing was enhanced by TNF-\u03b1 independently of NF-\u03baB and the number of genes with inhibited splicing following Spt5 KD and TNF-\u03b1 treatment. (B) Control and Spt5 KD HeLa cells were treated with TNF-\u03b1 for the indicated times. Spt5 KD efficiency is shown in the upper panel. Chromatin-associated fractions were then produced and reverse transcribed. The levels of spliced and unspliced transcripts of representative genes were analyzed by RT-PCR and normalized to the level of GAPDH. Graphs present three independent experiments (average \u00b1 standard error of the mean). (C) HeLa cells either left untreated or treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 30 min were harvested. Cell lysates were then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation using anti-Spt5 antibody or rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitated proteins were detected using anti-Spt5, anti-Pol II, anti-SM proteins, and anti-hnRNPA1 antibodies.To gain further support for the role of Spt5 in this effect, we extracted chromatin-associated RNA from Spt5 KD cells (Fig. 6B, top) treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 30 and 60 min and determined the splicing of several transcriptionally noninduced genes selected from the RNA-Seq splicing analysis using RT-qPCR. The results revealed that in the absence of Spt5, the increase in TNF-\u03b1-mediated splicing was abolished in 9/12 selected genes (Fig. 6B). Notably, some of the analyzed genes that display Spt5 dependency (KIF20A, CDC20, ECHS1, and ARL6IP1 genes) were recorded as Spt5 independent in the RNA-Seq data. This can be explained by the fact that the RNA-Seq was done following a 1-h TNF-\u03b1 induction while the peak of the splicing enhancement in these genes is 30 min. Splicing enhancement by TNF-\u03b1 and its elimination by Spt5 were validated in two additional splice junctions of a few genes (see Fig. S8 in the supplemental material). In addition, we determined the effect of Spt5 KD on the expression of these 12 genes and found that the mRNA levels of 7 genes were unaffected while 5 genes displayed lower basal levels (see Fig. S9), suggesting that the effect of Spt5 on splicing is unlikely to be a consequence of its effect on transcription.To elucidate the mechanism underlying splicing control by Spt5, we asked whether it could interact with components of the splicing machinery. To test this possibility, control and TNF-\u03b1-treated cell extracts were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation assays with Spt5 or control antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting. We detected a fraction of Pol II in the Spt5 but not in the control IP, as expected (Fig. 6C). Likewise, the core splicing factors, Sm proteins, clearly coprecipitated with Spt5 (Fig. 6C). The association of the Sm proteins with Spt5 is specific as another splicing factor analyzed, hnRNPA1, was not detected in the Spt5 IP (Fig. 6C). Neither Pol II nor Sm protein interaction with Spt5 seems to be modulated by TNF-\u03b1.Splicing-induced genes are enriched with a Pol II form that is associated with Spt5. To elucidate further the underlying basis of the splicing effect exerted by TNF-\u03b1 and Spt5, we considered the phosphoserine-2 (p-Ser2) modification of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), which promotes cotranscriptional mRNA processing. We determined the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on the global levels of p-Ser2 Pol II but found no significant change (see Fig. S10A in the supplemental material). Next, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine the occupancy of total and p-Ser2 forms of Pol II and Spt5 on the splicing-induced genes in control and TNF-\u03b1-treated cells. Interestingly, following TNF-\u03b1 induction, we observed a significant decrease in the total levels of Pol II in all the analyzed genes while there was no change in the levels of Spt5 (Fig. 7A). The effect of TNF-\u03b1 on Pol II levels was also seen in two additional, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 locations of a few genes (see Fig. S10C). The signal obtained with the p-Ser2 antibody was reproducibly close to that of the nonspecific IgG ChIP, which serves as a control of background. On the other hand, the p-Ser2 signal of two NF-\u03baB target genes was enhanced following TNF-\u03b1 induction (see Fig. S10B), as previously shown (6). Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion regarding the status of the p-Ser2 form of Pol II on these genes. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that under resting conditions, these genes are being transcribed by both Spt5-free and Spt5-associated Pol II. However, upon TNF-\u03b1 induction, the levels of Spt5-free Pol II are reduced, and the major transcribing form of Pol II that remains is the one associated with Spt5 (Fig. 7B). Considering the importance of Spt5 for splicing and the increased splicing efficiency observed in these genes, we conclude that the Pol II-Spt5 complex is a particularly splicing-competent form of Pol II.Open in a separate windowFIG 7Pol II-Spt5 complex is splicing competent. (A) HeLa cells, treated with TNF-\u03b1 for 30 min or left untreated, were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-Spt5, anti-Pol II, or control (for background levels) antibodies. Analysis was performed by qPCR using primers directed to the center of the genes. Graphs show occupancy levels normalized to the input levels. The uninduced sample was set to 1. ChIP analyses of additional 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 locations of a few genes are shown in Fig. S10C in the supplemental material. The results represent the average \u00b1 standard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05. (B) A model showing the occupancy of a splicing-induced non-NF-\u03baB target gene by Pol II, Spt5, and the splicing machinery under basal and TNF-\u03b1-induced conditions. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we explored the scope by which Spt5 regulates nascent and mature mRNAs in TNF-\u03b1-induced cells. We addressed this issue by analyzing RNA extracted from the cytosolic and chromatin compartments. The data presented here led us to three main observations. First, we identified new regulatory features associated with the splicing kinetics and chromatin release of TNF-\u03b1-induced mRNAs. Second, we uncovered an unexpected, broad splicing-stimulatory activity of TNF-\u03b1 that is partially mediated by Spt5. Third, we determined that Spt5 plays a much broader role than initially thought in coordinating elongation with mRNA splicing and that the Spt5-associated Pol II is highly splicing competent.Our RNA-Seq data along with the kinetic experiments of specific genes uncovered a subset of genes that are rapidly induced, but their release from chromatin is both slow and inefficient. These findings support the notion that chromatin retention of de novo-synthesized transcripts provides an effective mechanism of regulating the timing of inflammatory gene responses. Several previous studies addressed the accumulation of incomplete transcripts on the chromatin. Our findings are consistent with a previous report showing that in some LPS-inducible genes, splicing is delayed relative to complete transcription and that transcripts are retained on the chromatin until all introns have been spliced out (12, 17). Other papers suggest that many transcripts are retained on the chromatin after being transcribed and that only once they are properly spliced are they effectively cleaved at the 3\u2032 end and released from chromatin (17, 24). Our findings, however, provide a possible explanation for the reduced efficiency of productive mRNA synthesis and transcript release. By analyzing various gene features, we found that this regulation is correlated with intron lengths rather than exon density, suggesting that long introns are less efficiently spliced cotranscriptionally. It therefore appears that the characteristic of the splicing reaction rather than the number of splicing events is rate limiting for splicing and chromatin release.Our data link both Spt5 and TNF-\u03b1 to facilitation of splicing, independently of transcription. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this phenomenon has been reported. Further characterization of this effect revealed that the splicing enhancement exerted by TNF-\u03b1 is transient and displays differential kinetics. Interestingly, following TNF-\u03b1 induction, the levels of Pol II associated with these genes drop, and the remaining population of Pol II is the one engaged with Spt5. Considering the importance of Spt5 for the enhanced splicing of noninduced genes and its interaction with Sm core splicing proteins, the Spt5-Pol II complex emerges as highly splicing competent (Fig. 7B). We postulate that the splicing facilitation helps to maintain constant amounts of these mRNAs even though Pol II levels were reduced. It should be pointed out that in our previous study (6), as well as in the present RNA-Seq data, we did not detect downregulation of components of the basal splicing machinery, indicating that the Spt5-related splicing effects we detect are not indirect.The accumulation of chromatin-retained unspliced transcripts following Spt5 depletion and TNF-\u03b1 induction is differential as there are genes that are more susceptible than others to the absence of Spt5. It appears that the increased dependency on Spt5 for chromatin release is correlated with induction rates. We therefore suggest that, once induced by TNF-\u03b1, the NF-\u03baB target genes that present higher promoter firing rates and Pol II density require increased recruitment of mRNA processing factors during transcription. Taken together, the findings reported here established Spt5 as a splicing modulator of both noninduced genes and strongly induced genes that are characterized by heavy splicing load.A gene class whose expression is significantly upregulated upon Spt5 KD (Fig. 1B, clusters 8 to 10) was also uncovered. In light of the known role of DSIF in promoting proximal-promoter pausing, the apparent increase in their expression levels is likely a consequence of pause release. We have previously characterized the DSIF-mediated proximal-promoter pausing of the A20 gene under resting conditions and found that this feature is directed by the promoter and is mapped to an E-box motif (25, 26). Interestingly, examination of the promoters of the upregulated genes revealed that the top enriched elements are variants of the E-box motif. This finding suggests that the involvement of this element in conferring proximal-promoter pausing is not limited to the A20 gene. The notion that sequence-specific transcription factors control proximal-promoter pausing is also evident from other studies that uncovered an association of this phenomenon with specific promoter-regulatory elements in Drosophila (27,\u201329). It would be interesting to find which member of the E-box factors has the capability to support DSIF-mediated pausing and what the underlying mechanism is.
