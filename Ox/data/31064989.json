Remarkably, these early transcriptional events are affected by TFIIE and TFIIH mutations associated with the developmental disorder, trichothiodystrophy.Subject terms: Molecular biology, Transcription IntroductionIn eukaryotes, accurate transcription of protein-coding genes requires the synchronized action of multiple molecular actors. Among them, the general transcription factors (GTFs), including TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH assemble at the transcription start site with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to form the preinitiation complex (PIC). While the different GTFs have been characterized almost 30 years ago, little is known about the chronological order of the enzymatic activities that occurr during transcription initiation. Nonetheless, a conventional assembly order for a Pol II-PIC emerged, in which TBP (TATA Binding Protein), as part of TFIID, initially binds to the promoter and is further stabilized by TFIIB and TFIIA. Pol II and TFIIF then align to make a stable TFIID\u2013TFIIA\u2013TFIIB\u2013Pol II\u2013TFIIF promoter complex, which is finally completed by the addition of TFIIE and TFIIH1,2.The heterodimer TFIIE (composed of the TFIIE\u03b1 and TFIIE\u03b2 subunits) seems to play a pivotal role in transcription by directly influencing the transition from initiation to elongation3,4. TFIIE interacts with different factors within the PIC, including Pol II5,6 as well as with DNA immediately upstream of the transcription bubble region7,8. Furthermore, TFIIE seems to influence TFIIH activity9, although it is not clear how this molecular process can occur.TFIIH, which also intervenes during the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, contains 10 subunits that can be resolved into two sub-complexes: the Core (composed of the subunits XPB, p62, p52, p44, p34, and TTDA) and the CAK (containing the CDK7 kinase, MAT1, and Cyclin H). Both sub-complexes interact with XPD subunit, whose ATPase/helicase activity promotes DNA opening during NER10,11. The role of TFIIH during transcription initiation mainly relies on its XPB and CDK7 enzymatic activities, XPD having essentially a structural function12. Observations revealed that XPB is not a conventional helicase13,14, but an ATPase/translocase that pumps downstream DNA toward the Pol II to generate torsional and mechanical strain, leading to the formation of the DNA bubble15\u201318. For its part, CDK7 phosphorylates the serine 5 (Ser5-P) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest Pol II subunit (RPB1), thus contributing to promoter escape19\u201321. The CDK7 action is not restricted to Pol II, since other transcription factors are targeted by this kinase, including nuclear receptors (NRs), such as the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR\u03b1)22.A better understanding of the transcription mechanism arose from the study of diseases related to mutations in genes encoding transcription machinery components (e.g. TFIIH, Mediator, etc.)23,24. Remarkably, mutations within the TFIIE\u03b2 subunit recently have recently been associated with trichothiodystrophy (TTD), an autosomal recessive developmental disorder mainly related to TFIIH mutations (mostly in ERCC2/XPD gene and few cases in ERCC3/XPB or GFT2H5/p8/TTD-A genes) and characterized by brittle hairs with alternating dark and light (\u201cTiger tail\u201d) banding with polarized microscopy and low content of sulfur-containing amino acids25,26. TFIIE/TTD patients, like TFIIH/TTD patients also have dry, ichthyotic skin, short stature, microcephaly, cerebellar dysfunction, developmental delay, happy engaging personality, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and myopia27.Our work reveals an unexpected dynamic process during which TFIIE\u03b1 and TFIIE\u03b2 act as key factors to recruit the CAK of TFIIH within the PIC. Furthermore, we show that Pol II phosphorylation is accompanied by the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 from the promoter, a process that takes place before DNA opening. Once the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 are released, RNA synthesis is initiated, a process during which the Core-TFIIH and TFIIE\u03b2 are also removed while elongation factors including DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) are recruited. Strikingly, TTD-related mutations in either XPD or the TFIIE\u03b2-coding gene (GTF2E2) similarly disrupt these processes, which could explain why alterations of TFIIE or TFIIH lead to the same clinical syndrome. ResultsDefective TFIIE alters PIC formationKnowing that TTD cells with mutations in either XPB, XPD, or p8/TTD-A exhibit a decrease in the cellular concentration of TFIIH28,29, we first examined the levels of components of the transcription machinery in fibroblasts isolated from TTD patients bearing either TFIIE\u03b2/A150P or /D187Y mutations. Western Blot analysis showed that both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of TFIIE were reduced in TTD/TFIIE-mutated cells when compared to wild-type fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01a). Such deficiency was only observed for TFIIE, since no reduction of the cellular concentration of TFIIH (visualized by XPB, XPD, and CDK7) or for the other GTFs, namely TFIIA (p35), TFIIB (p33), TFIID (TAF1, TAF4, and TBP), TFIIF (RAP74 and RAP30), and Pol II (visualized by the hypo-IIA and hyper-IIO phosphorylated form of its RPB1 subunit) was observed. We also evaluated the levels of TFIIE in TTD fibroblasts bearing the most common XPD mutations (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Surprisingly, we repeatedly observed a drop in TFIIE concentration in XPD/R722W fibroblasts and to a lower extend in XPD/R112H, which accompanied the decrease of TFIIH (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).Open in a separate windowFig. 1Defective transcription in cells harboring TFIIE mutations. a Increasing amounts of whole-cell lysates isolated from fibroblasts of patients with TFIIE\u03b2/A150P, /D187Y, and of unaffected parents were used for immunoblot analysis of TFIIE (IIE\u03b1 and IIE\u03b2), TFIIH (XPB, XPD, and CDK7), TFIIA (p35), TFIIB (p33), TFIID (TAF1, TAF4, and TBP), TFIIF (RAP74 and RAP30), and Pol II (the hypo IIA- phosphorylated and hyper IIO-phosphorylated forms of RPB1). \u03b2-actin was used as loading control. b, c Wild-type (gray boxes) and TTD fibroblasts (open boxes) with the mutation IIE\u03b2/A150P (panel b) and IIE\u03b2/D187Y (panel c) have been treated with t-RA (10\u2009\u00b5M). Relative RAR\u03b22 gene expression have been measured by RT-PCR after 0, 6, and 8\u2009h of t-RA treatment (panels b and c). The mRNA levels were normalized to the 18S RNA amount. The results (n\u2009=\u20099, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) are presented as n-fold induction relative to non-treated cells. d\u2013i: ChIP experiments have been done 0, 6, and 8\u2009h post-t-RA treatment from wild-type (gray boxes) and TTD fibroblasts (open boxes) with the mutation IIE\u03b2/A150P (panels d, f, and h) and IIE\u03b2/D187Y (panels e, g, and i) to analyze the recruitment of Pol II (RPB1, d and e), TFIIH (CDK7, f and g) and TFIIE (TFIIE\u03b2, h and i) at the RARB2 proximal promoter.

The mRNA levels were normalized to the 18S RNA amount.

We analyzed at the RARB2 proximal promoter (panels k\u2013q) and exon 4 (panels r\u2013x) the recruitment of Pol II (RPB1, k, r), TFIIH (CDK7, l, s), TFIIB (p33, m, t), TFIIE\u03b2 (n, u), Ser5-P (o, v), Ser2-P (p, w), and DSIF (SPT5, q, x). The values (n\u2009=\u20098, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) are expressed as percentage of immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA relative to the input. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileWe next investigated whether the expression of protein-coding genes was affected by TFIIE mutations, using the all-trans retinoic acid (t-RA) inducible RAR\u03b22 gene as a model. After t-RA treatment, the pattern of RAR\u03b22 mRNA synthesis was reduced in both IIE\u03b2/A150P and IIE\u03b2/D187Y fibroblasts when compared with wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a01b, c). Interestingly, similar profiles of RAR\u03b22 deregulation were observed in XPD/R112H and /R722W fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c, d), revealing recurrent transcriptional failures in TTD.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were then performed to determine whether deficiencies occurred during the PIC assembly. In wild-type fibroblasts, the recruitment of both Pol II (visualized by its RPB1 subunit, Fig.\u00a01d, e) and TFIIH (CDK7, Fig.\u00a01f, g) at the RAR\u03b22 promoter highly increased at 6\u2009h, then decreased 8\u2009h post-treatment, which perfectly paralleled the profile of the RAR\u03b22 mRNA synthesis (panels b and c). Conversely, in TFIIE-deficient fibroblasts, Pol II and TFIIH were barely recruited 6\u2009h post-treatment, despite their unchanged cellular concentrations (Fig.\u00a01a). Contrary to what was observed in normal fibroblasts, the Pol II and TFIIH recruitment tended to increase at 8\u2009h in TFIIE-deficient fibroblasts. Defective recruitment of Pol II and TFIIH also occurred in XPD/R112H and XPD/R722W cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e, f, g, h). Surprisingly, we repeatedly observed that TFIIE, already detected at t\u2009=\u20090 on the RAR\u03b22 promoter, progressively decreased in normal fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01h, i, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i, j); we however noticed a recurrent lower recruitment of TFIIE in TTD/TFIIE as well as in TTD/XPD fibroblasts.In order to investigate whether TFIIE mutation might itself affect the expression of protein coding genes, homozygous knock-in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells were generated from the U2OS cell line by using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a; see \u201cMethods\u201d); non-mutated U2OS cells (IIE\u03b2/WT) were used as control. We first observed that the insertion of the missense mutation c.448G>C [p.Ala150Pro] within the GTF2E2 gene that encodes TFIIE\u03b2 was sufficient to drastically reduce the cellular levels of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of TFIIE complex (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). After t-RA treatment, we then observed that the pattern of RAR\u03b22 mRNA synthesis was reduced in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells when compared with that observed in wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a01j).ChIP assays next revealed that the recruitment of Pol II (visualized by the presence of RPB1), TFIIH (CDK7), and TFIIB (p33) was reduced in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells when compared with that observed in IIE\u03b2/WT cells (Fig.\u00a01k, l, m), which correlated with the profile of RAR\u03b22 mRNA synthesis (Fig.\u00a01j). Interestingly, and as previously observed (Fig.\u00a01h), TFIIE (using antibodies raised against TFIIE\u03b2) detected at t\u2009=\u20090 was progressively removed from RAR\u03b22 promoter in IIE\u03b2/WT cells (Fig.\u00a01n); its recruitment was however deficient in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells. Furthermore, an improper Ser5-P of Pol II was observed at the RAR\u03b22 promoter (Fig.\u00a01o). Interestingly, in IIE\u03b2/WT and KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells, the nuclear receptor RAR\u03b1 was similarly recruited to its response element (RARE) after 6\u2009h of t-RA treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c); however, RAR\u03b1 remained at the promoter 8\u2009h post-treatment in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells, a situation not observed in normal cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation by CDK7 of the nuclear receptor RAR\u03b1 (which is a prerequisite for accurate expression of its corresponding target genes)22 was not modified in t-RA-treated KI-IE\u03b2/A150P cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d). These results suggest that the disruption of the RAR\u03b22 mRNA synthesis did not result from deficiency of the RAR\u03b1-activation process, but rather from defects during PIC assembly.We also investigated the possible consequences of a defective PIC formation for ongoing transcription. ChIP assays at exon 4 showed increased phosphorylation of elongating Pol II at Ser2 (Ser2-P) in IIE\u03b2/WT cells after 6\u2009h t-RA treatment (Fig.\u00a01w). Persistence of phosphorylated elongating Pol II at 8\u2009h, when RAR\u03b22 mRNA tends to decrease, might be due to the cyclic profile of the RAR\u03b22 gene expression30 and the very distal position of exon 4 from the transcription start site (~140\u2009kb). Strikingly, Pol II phosphorylation was strongly disrupted in KI-IIE\u03b2/A150P cells (Fig.\u00a01w). It is worthwhile to notice that under our experimental conditions, neither TFIIB nor TFIIE (TFIIE\u03b2) were detected at exon 4 in normal and mutated cells (Fig.\u00a01t, u); only background levels were detected for CDK7 (Fig.\u00a01s). Finally, the recruitment of the transcription elongation factor DSIF31 (visualized via its SPT5 subunit) was clearly impaired in mutated cells (Fig.\u00a01x), suggesting that the previously observed alterations in PIC formation influence transcriptional elongation. All together our data show how the arrival of the transcriptional machinery with Pol II and the release of TFIIE occur at the promoter of activated gene to engage RNA synthesis, and how TFIIE and TFIIH mutations notably disturb such coordinated events.Mutations within TFIIE\u03b2 disrupt transcription initiationWe next asked how the TFIIE/TFIIH partnership occurred. Recombinant TFIIE (rIIE) containing rIIE\u03b1/WT subunit with either rIIE\u03b2/WT, /A150P, or /D187Y were produced and purified (Fig.\u00a02a). We first observed that addition of increasing amounts of either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P, or rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y in NER reaction (containing XPC, TFIIH, XPA, RPA, XPF/ERCC1, and XPG as well as a cisplatinated substrate)32, did not influence the removal of the damaged oligonucleotides (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). On the contrary, purified recombinants rIIH-XPD/R112H or rIIH-XPD/R722W (Fig.\u00a02b) drastically prevented NER (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). This strongly suggested that TFIIE did not modulate in vitro NER activity.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Defective TFIIE and TFIIH affect transcription initiation. a Production of the recombinant mutated forms of TFIIE (rIIE). Equal amounts of purified rIIE were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. Coomassie blue staining gel (top panel) and western blot (WB, bottom panel) with antibodies raised against TFIIE\u03b1 and TFIIE\u03b2 are shown. b Production of the recombinant mutated forms of TFIIH (rIIH). Equal amounts of purified rIIHs were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotted for XPB, XPD, p62, and CDK7. c, d Purified rIIEs (c) and rIIHs (d) were added to in vitro reconstituted transcription systems, as indicated. After addition of NTPs (including radiolabelled CTP), the transcription activity was assessed after 5, 10, and 20\u2009min of incubation. The length of the corresponding transcript (309nt) is indicated on the right side. The signals were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. e, f Abortive transcription assays using rIIEs (e) and rIIHs (f). After preinitiation complex assembly using equivalent amounts of the different purified rIIEs and rIIHs (as revealed by western blots), phosphodiester bond synthesis was initiated by the addition of priming dinucleotides CpA and radiolabelled CTP. After 30\u2009min of incubation, the radioactive trinucleotide (CpApC*) synthesis was stopped, quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of two independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileWe next investigated the consequences of TFIIE mutations during in vitro transcription assays. The rIIEs were incubated together with the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP, run-off of 309nt), TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), TFIIF, and TFIIH as well as Pol II12. We observed that 5, 10, and 20\u2009min after addition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs, including radiolabelled CTP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P and /D187Y led to a lower RNA synthesis than rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT (Fig.\u00a02c). The defect was slightly more pronounced with rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P than /D187Y (compare lanes 5\u20137 to 8\u201310). Similarly, transcriptional defect was observed in the presence of rIIH-XPD/R112H or /R722W (Fig.\u00a02d, lanes 5\u20137 and 8\u201310, respectively).To evaluate whether TFIIE mutations might interfere with the first steps of transcription, we performed in vitro abortive initiation assays (Fig.\u00a02e), during which we measured trinucleotide synthesis initiated by a reporter priming dinucleotide RNA (CpA) hybridized to the transcription start site of the AdMLP33,34. Upon addition of radiolabelled CTP and increasing amounts of either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P or /D187Y, trinucleotide (CpApC) synthesis was impaired (lanes 5\u20137 and 8\u201310). The defect was greater with rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P than /D187Y, which paralleled what was observed during in vitro run-off assays (Fig.\u00a02c). Interestingly, the difference between the two mutated forms of TFIIE was more pronounced in run-off than in abortive assays, suggesting that early transcriptional steps might be differently affected by rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P and rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y; the latter ensures initiation but may fail at subsequent steps. Finally, impairment of trinucleotide synthesis was also observed when increasing amounts of rIIH-XPD/R112H or /R722W together with rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT were used (Fig.\u00a02f).Together, the above results underlined the essential role of TFIIE during transcription initiation. In addition, it seems that TTD-related mutations within TFIIE and TFIIH both disrupt the early steps of transcription initiation.TFIIE\u03b1 is essential to incorporate the CAK within the PICWe then investigated the role of TFIIE during PIC formation. Biotinylated AdMLP was immobilized to streptavidin beads and incubated with all the GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF, TFIIH), Pol II, and either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P, or rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y (Fig.\u00a03a). After several washes, western blot analysis of the remaining proteins bound to DNA showed that Pol II (revealed by its RPB2 subunit), TFIIF (RAP74), and TBP were associated with DNA in the absence of TFIIE (lane 2); the signals corresponding to the Core-TFIIH (XPB) and the XPD bridging component of TFIIH were however reduced, with an even more severe for CAK (CDK7). Interestingly, addition of rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT promoted the recruitment of TFIIH (lane 3), consistent with the observation that TFIIH co-immunoprecipitated with rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT (Fig.\u00a03b, lanes 1 and 2). Strikingly, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P and /D187Y reduced the binding of CAK (CDK7) (Fig.\u00a03a, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 3 and histogram), related to the lower capacity of the mutated rIIEs to entirely co-immunoprecipitate with TFIIH (Fig.\u00a03b, lanes 3\u20136).Open in a separate windowFig. 3Defective TFIIE and TFIIH alter the preinitiation complex. a Biotinylated AdMLP bound to streptavidin magnetic beads was incubated with Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), TFIIF, and TFIIH, in the presence (+) of either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P, or rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y. After washes, the binding of different factors was evaluated by immunoblotting. The loading proteins used for PIC formation and the different rIIEs (in the following order rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P, and rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y) are indicated at the right part of the panel (load). The signals for IIE\u03b1, IIE\u03b2, XPB, XPD, and CDK7 were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. b Immunoprecipitated rIIH/WT (using anti-p62) was incubated with rIIEs at 150 and 500\u2009mM KCl. After washes, the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and blotted with anti-XPB, anti-IIE\u03b1, and anti-IIE\u03b2. Graph shows in arbitrary units (a.u.) the ratio IIE\u03b1/IIE\u03b2 for each rIIE. The results are representative of three independent experiments. c Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), and TFIIF were incubated with biotinylated AdMLP bound to streptavidin beads in presence (+) of rIIE\u03b1/WT, rIIE\u03b2/WT, and TFIIH. Immunoblot analysis has been done with different antibodies, as indicated. d TFIIH was immunoprecipitated with anti-p62 and incubated (+) with rIIE\u03b1/WT and/or rIIE\u03b2/WT. After washes, immunoblot analysis of TFIIH (XPD, p52, CDK7) and TFIIE (IIE\u03b1 and IIE\u03b2) has been done. e Recombinant rIIE\u03b1/WT, co-produced with either rIIE\u03b2/WT (lanes 1 and 2), rIIE\u03b2/A150P (lanes 3 and 4) or rIIE\u03b2/D187Y (lanes 5 and 6), was immunoprecipitated at 150 and 500\u2009mM KCl. After washes, the proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and blotted with antibodies against IIE\u03b1 and IIE\u03b2. Graph shows the ratio IIE\u03b2/IIE\u03b1 (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. f rIIH containing either XPD/WT (lanes 1 and 2), XPD/R112H (lanes 3 and 4), or XPD/R722W (lanes 5 and 6) were immunoprecipitated with anti-XPD and incubated at 150 and 500\u2009mM KCl. After washes, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. The immunoprecipitated signals (IP) for XPB, XPD, and CDK7 were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. g Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (when indicated, +) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, the Core-TFIIH, the CAK and either XPD/WT, /R112H, or /R722W. After washes, immunoblot analysis of different factors has been done. The results (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) are representative of three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileThe above observations prompted us to explore the involvement of TFIIE subunits in the recruitment of TFIIH within the PIC. In the absence of rIIE\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1/WT was unable to bind the AdMLP/Pol II/TBP/TFIIA/TFIIB/TFIIF complex (Fig.\u00a03c, lane 2). Strikingly, whereas TFIIH interacted with rIIE\u03b2/WT rather than rIIE\u03b1/WT in solution (Fig.\u00a03d, lanes 2 and 4), both TFIIE subunits were required to fully recruit entire TFIIH, including CAK, to the AdMLP (Fig.\u00a03c, lane 7). These observations may be related to the ability of rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT to interact with TFIIH (Fig.\u00a03b), in particular with the CAK (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04)35. Coimmunoprecipitation between TFIIE and TFIIH components were slightly reduced in the presence of rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P or rII\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y variants (Fig.\u00a03b, lanes 3\u20136). Interestingly, rIIE\u03b2 mutations weakened interaction with rIIE\u03b1/WT, as observed at high salt concentration (Fig.\u00a03e), possibly due to the position of the TFIIE\u03b2 mutations in the WH2 domain which interacts with TFIIE\u03b136,37. For their part, XPD/TTD mutations affected the integrity of TFIIH by destabilizing the interaction between the CAK (CDK7) and the Core (XPB) sub-complexes (Fig.\u00a03f). As a consequence, the recruitment of the CAK at the AdMLP was reduced, as observed for XPD/R722W (Fig.\u00a03g, compare lanes 5 to 3).Altogether, the above data underlined the role played by TFIIE\u03b2 to anchor TFIIE\u03b1, which further allows incorporation of the whole TFIIH within the PIC. Additionally, we showed that mutations in TFIIE and TFIIH disturb the integration of these factors within the PIC.ATP promotes the release of TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAKWe next investigated how TFIIE and TFIIH cooperate to phosphorylate Pol II and to open DNA during transcription13,38. Addition of ATP to the PIC formation assay (containing the immobilized AdMLP, Pol II, and all the GTFs including rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT) led to accumulation of Ser5-P of Pol II (Fig.\u00a04a, lane 3). Furthermore, in such conditions, the CAK (visualized by CDK7 and Cyclin H) and TFIIE\u03b1 were separated from the Core-TFIIH and TFIIE\u03b2, which were maintained at the DNA template together with Pol II (RPB2) and TFIIF (RAP74). In presence of ATP-\u03b3S, whose hydrolysis is very low compared to ATP, neither Pol II phosphorylation nor the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 occurred (lane 4). Interestingly, Pol II phosphorylation and TFIIE\u03b1 release were not observed in absence of the CAK (Fig.\u00a04b, lane 3). Immobilized AdMLP template was next incubated with Pol II and all the GTFs including rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT and rIIH/WT in presence of ATP and THZ1, a specific CDK7 inhibitor that covalently targets a cysteine residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain39. In these conditions, Pol II remained unphosphorylated and both TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK were maintained at the DNA template (Fig.\u00a04c, lanes 4 and 5). Taken together, the above data strongly suggested that once Pol II is phosphorylated by CDK7, TFIIE\u03b1 as well as the CAK are no longer required at the promoter.Open in a separate windowFig. 4TFIIE\u03b1 and CAK releases and Pol II phosphorylation occur before DNA opening. a Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (+) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF and rIIH/WT, in presence of either ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) or ATP\u03b3S (200\u2009\u03bcM). After washes, the binding of various factors has been evaluated by immunoblotting. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. b Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (when indicated, +) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, the Core-TFIIH, XPD/WT, and the CAK, in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM). After washes, immunoblot analysis was done for different proteins. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. c Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (+) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and rIIH/WT, in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and THZ1 (1 and 10\u2009\u03bcM). The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. d When indicated (+), biotinylated AdMLP bound to streptavidin magnetic beads were preincubated 20min (at 25\u2009\u00b0C) with the general transcription machinery (Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and rIIH/WT) in presence of Triptolide (TPL, 10\u2009\u03bcM) before addition of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM). The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. e Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (+) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, and TFIIF, in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and either rIIH-XPB/WT or /Fs740. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. f Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (+) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, and TFIIF, in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and either rIIH-XPB/WT or /K346R. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CyclinH, and Ser5-P were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileWe next examined whether promoter opening was required for Pol II phosphorylation and the release of TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK. In our in vitro assays, the addition of triptolide (TPL), a chemical compound known to inhibit the ATPase activity of XPB and to block transcription (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a)40, did not modify the ATP-dependent release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a04d). Furthermore, Ser5-P of Pol II was maintained (lane 5). Similarly, we also observed that the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 still occurred in the presence of the mutated form rIIH-XPB/Fs740 (Fig.\u00a04e, lanes 4 and 5), which prevented the XPB activity and affected transcription (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b)41. As a further control, we also found that rIIH-XPB/K346R, which harbors a mutation in the ATPase Walker motif that prevents ATP hydrolysis and disrupts transcription (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c)42,43, did not prevent the Pol II phosphorylation, as well as the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a04f, lanes 4 and 5). Altogether, the above data suggested that promoter opening was not a prerequisite for Pol II phosphorylation nor the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1.The CAK is released during RNA synthesisWe next tested whether the PIC was able to promote RNA synthesis after having released the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1. After incubation of the immobilized AdMLP template with Pol II and all the GTFs, we added ATP as indicated (Fig.\u00a05a). After washes, the remaining complex (containing the IIO-phosphorylated form of RPB1, lane 3) was incubated with all the NTPs to allow RNA synthesis (lane 4, 309nt run-off transcript). In such conditions, we observed a release of the CAK (as vizualized by CyclinH) and TFIIE\u03b1; the Core-TFIIH was partially released (as vizualized by XPB) while TFIIE\u03b2 was maintained at the promoter. It is noteworthy that less RNA synthesis occurred after an ATP pre-incubation was done (Fig.\u00a05b), which was in agreement with previous observations showing that the activity of PICs was reduced by exposure to ATP alone44,45. Since TFIIE can reactivate Pol II after ATP pre-incubation46, we supplemented with increasing amounts of IIE\u03b1 following ATP treatment, washes, and addition of NTPs (Fig.\u00a05c). This increased the presence of TFIIE\u03b1 at the promoter (lanes 5 and 6), and RNA synthesis (Fig.\u00a05d, lanes 4 and 5), as previously observed46.Open in a separate windowFig. 5The CAK is released during RNA synthesis. a Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (as depicted in the scheme, left part) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, and the GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and TFIIH/WT), in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM). After 15\u2009min of incubation with ATP, the beads were washed and NTPs (200\u2009\u03bcM) were added (lane 4). Immunoblot analysis (for TFIIE\u03b1, TFIIE\u03b2, XPB, CyclinH, RPB1) and the transcription activity (309nt run-off transcript) were assessed after 45\u2009min of incubation. The results are representative of three independent experiments. b Streptavidin magnetic beads with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, and the GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and TFIIH/WT) were pre incubated 15\u2009min (as depicted in the scheme) in presence (lane 2) or absence (lane 1) of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM). The beads were washed and NTPs (200\u2009\u03bcM) were added. Transcription activity (309nt run-off transcript) were assessed after 45\u2009min of incubation. The results are representative of three independent experiments. c, d Streptavidin magnetic beads were pre incubated (when indicated, +) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II and the GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and TFIIH/WT) in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM). After washes, NTP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and increasing amounts of rIIE\u03b1/WT were added. Immunoblot analysis (c) and transcription activity (d) were assessed after 45\u2009min of incubation. The transcription activities were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of two independent experiments. e, f Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (when indicated, +) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, and TFIIH/WT, in presence of whole cell extracts (WCE), ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) (f) and NTP (200\u2009\u03bcM) (e, f). Immunoblot analysis (for TFIIE\u03b1, TFIIE\u03b2, XPB, CyclinH, Ser5-P, and SPT5) and the transcription activity (309nt run-off transcript) were assessed after 45\u2009min of incubation. The results are representative of three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileWe next explored the fate of TFIIE\u03b2 during transcription. To determine whether additional factors might contribute to its release, the immobilized in vitro assay was supplemented with whole cell extracts (WCE, isolated from HeLa cells) in the presence of NTPs (Fig.\u00a05e, f). While RNA synthesis occurred, we observed the complete removal of the Core-TFIIH (lane 3). Remarkably, the TFIIE\u03b2 subunit was also released, concomitant with the recruitment of the elongation factor DSIF (SPT5), as observed during ChIP experiments (Fig.\u00a01q). TFIIE\u03b2 was partially removed in the presence of ATP alone (Fig.\u00a05f, lane 3). However, the elongation factor DSIF (SPT5) was not recruited when compared to what obtained in presence of NTP (lane 4), suggesting that ATP addition was sufficient for TFIIE\u03b1 eviction but that all four NTPs were needed for complete removal of TFIIE\u03b2 and DSIF recruitment.Taken together, these results strongly suggested that TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK, followed by the Core-TFIIH and TFIIE\u03b2, are sequentially released from the promoter while elongation factors take place to pursue transcription.TTD mutations prevent CAK recruitmentWe next investigated how TTD mutations might perturb the transcription initiation process. Immobilized AdMLP was first incubated with Pol II, the GTFs (TFIIA, TFIIB, TBP, TFIIF, TFIIH) and either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P, or rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y in the presence of ATP (Fig.\u00a06a). After washes, western blots showed that the ATP-dependent release of the CAK also occurred in presence of rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/A150P and rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/D187Y (lanes 4 and 6); it should be however noted that the CAK was recruited much less in the absence of ATP (lanes 3 and 5) as was previously observed (Fig.\u00a03a). Similarly, the CAK was released upon ATP addition in the presence of TFIIH XPD/WT (Fig.\u00a06b, lanes 2 and 3), XPD/R112H (lanes 4 and 5) and to some extent with XPD/R722W (lane 6 and 7). Consequently, TTD-causative mutations impaired the recruitment of the CAK subcomplex on transcription start sites.Open in a separate windowFig. 6TTD mutations alter CAK release and Pol II phosphorylation. a Biotinylated AdMLP bound to streptavidin magnetic beads was incubated with Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (TBP), TFIIF, and TFIIH/WT, in presence (when indicated, +) of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and either rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, /A150P, or /D187Y. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CDK7, and CyclinH were quantified and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) are representative of three independent experiments. b Streptavidin magnetic beads were incubated (when indicated, +) with biotinylated AdMLP, Pol II, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, rIIE\u03b1\u03b2/WT, TFIIF, the Core-TFIIH, and the CAK, in presence of ATP (200\u2009\u03bcM) and either XPD/WT, /R112H or /R722W. The immunoblot signals for TFIIE\u03b1, CDK7, and CyclinH were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. c, d In vitro reconstituted transcription systems with rIIEs (c) and rIIHs (d) have been performed in presence of cold NTPs. Immunoblot analysis next has been done using specific antibody against Ser5-P of Pol II. Signals were quantified (n\u2009=\u20093, means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.). The results are representative of three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data fileIn vitro transcription assays were also performed in the presence of the basal transcription machinery with the different rIIEs and rIIHs variants (Fig.\u00a06c, d). Reactions were stopped 5, 10, and 20\u2009min after addition of cold NTPs and analyzed by western blot using antibodies raised against Ser5-P of Pol II. The presence of rIIE\u03b2/A150P and /D187Y strongly prevented CAK-dependent Pol II phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a06c, lanes 5\u20137 and 8\u201310, respectively). Diminished Pol II phosphorylation was also observed with mutated forms of rIIH (Fig.\u00a06d), the defect being more pronounced for XPD/R722W than XPD/R112H (lanes 5\u20137 and 8\u201310, respectively).Taken together, these results suggested that TFIIE\u03b2 and XPD mutations cause in common a perturbation of Pol II phosphorylation by the CAK. DiscussionThe present study aimed to dissect the interplay between TFIIE and TFIIH during transcription, from their integration within the PIC until their release before the upcoming recruitment of elongation factors. This work also revealed how TTD mutations within TFIIE and TFIIH disrupt such processes, resulting in a decrease in transcription.Upon gene activation, the GTFs target the promoter in a sequential order, which is initiated by the recruitment of TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, and Pol II together with TFIIF1,2, the whole forming a structure ready to incorporate TFIIE and TFIIH (Fig.\u00a07). Using immobilized template and highly purified recombinant GTFs, we show that the TFIIE\u03b1 subunit is recruited at the promoter via TFIIE\u03b2, the latter interacting with Pol II (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a)37. While the Core-TFIIH can target the PIC in absence of TFIIE, through partnerships with Pol II (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b), we demonstrate that TFIIE\u03b1 promotes the incorporation of the CAK module of TFIIH within the PIC (Fig.\u00a03c), which is in accordance with structural analyses35. The PIC formation assays questions about the retention, and loss, of transcriptional components while Pol II advances to transcribe and is retained on the DNA template (Fig.\u00a05a, lane 4). In a reconstituted in vitro transcription assay, we cannot exclude Pol II retention at the end of the DNA template, a situation requiring additional factors for the release of the polymerase. Furthermore, formation of inactive complexes can occur, resulting from incorrectly folded proteins and/or incomplete PIC assembly. However, in our experimental conditions, almost all the Pol II was phosphorylated after ATP addition, which is illustrated by the complete conversion of RNA polymerase IIA to IIO (Fig.\u00a05a, lane 3). This suggests that the majority of the polymerase bound to the DNA template may be integrated into complexes that allow it to become active. Interestingly, a selective (i.e. TFIIE and TFIIH) but not complete removal of GTFs was observed once Pol II is engaged in elongation (lane 4), as previously suggested47. Such dynamic recruitment/release of factors illustrates the complexity of the sequential events that are required to accomplish promoter clearance48.Open in a separate windowFig. 7Sequential association/dissociation of TFIIE and TFIIH. Once a stable TFIID\u2013TFIIA\u2013TFIIB\u2013Pol II\u2013TFIIF promoter complex is assembled, TFIIE and TFIIH can be recruited. The TFIIE\u03b2 subunit is required to anchor TFIIE\u03b1. Altgough the Core-TFIIH sub-complex can incorporate the complex in absence of TFIIE, TFIIE\u03b1, and TFIIE\u03b2 are both required to anchor the CAK within the PIC. In presence of ATP, Pol II phosphorylation is accompanied by the release of the CAK and TFIIE\u03b1 from the promoter, a process that takes place before DNA opening. In presence of NTP, RNA synthesis is initiated, the Core-TFIIH and TFIIE\u03b2 are removed while DSIF and other elongation factors are recruitedMany questions remain unanswered about the fate of TFIIE and TFIIH during transcription initiation, their respective contributions being debated for a number of years6,33. Here we show that TFIIE allows the integration of the CAK within the PIC (Fig.\u00a03c), leading to Pol II phosphorylation by CDK7 (Fig.\u00a04a)9. Once Pol II is phosphorylated, TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK are released from the promoter (Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c). Interestingly, the CAK dissociation observed during transcription mirrors what happens during NER. Indeed, upon arrival of the NER factor XPA on the damaged DNA (already targeted by XPC and TFIIH), the CAK is released in an ATP-dependent manner from the Core-TFIIH49.Our results show that Pol II phosphorylation, and release of TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK, do not require DNA opening (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f), since these events are not impeded by TPL that inhibits XPB enzymatic activity40, or mutations in XPB that affect its promoter opening activity41\u201343.The ATP-dependent release of TFIIE\u03b1 and the CAK raises the question of the fate of the Core-TFIIH and TFIIE\u03b2 within the remaining complex. The Core-TFIIH is required for next transcriptional events; in particular, the translocase activity of XPB allows DNA pumping into the active site cleft of Pol II15,50. Interestingly, the Core-TFIIH is not longer associated with the promoter once RNA synthesis is undertaken (Fig.\u00a05a). Concerning TFIIE\u03b2, this subunit interacts with DNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07), which might prove useful during promoter opening6,7,51. TFIIE\u03b2 is also no longer maintained at the promoter (Figs.\u00a01h, i, n, \u200bn,5a5a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i, j); its release parallels the recruitment of elongation factors, such as DSIF (Figs.\u00a01q, 5e, f), a heterodimer of SPT4 and SPT5 that mediates pausing by Pol II early after initiation31. Remarkably, structural analyses showed that the stalk domain of Pol II binds TFIIE as well as DSIF52. The fact that DSIF and TFIIE bind overlapping sites in the clamp region of Pol II suggest that DSIF might substitute for TFIIE53\u201355, a situation strongly corroborated by our results (Fig.\u00a05e). Interestingly, reductions in DSIF and increases in TFIIE near promoters have been described as a result of CDK7 inhibition56\u201358. Whether or not the eviction of TFIIE requires post translational modifications remains to be determined. In this regard, it should be pointed out that a doublet for TFIIE\u03b1 was observed in presence of ATP (Figs.\u00a04, \u200b,55 and \u200band6).6). This might result from the phosphorylation of TFIIE\u03b1, likely by CDK7, as previously observed9,56. Although such apparent TFIIE\u03b1 phosphorylation is of interest, substantial investigations should be undertaken to identify the phosphorylation(s) sites(s) and to determine the function(s) of such modification(s) during transcription.The TFIIE\u03b2/A150P and /D187Y mutations have been recently associated with TTD syndrome25,26, which is so far mainly related to TFIIH mutations. The results presented here show that TTD-related mutations within TFIIE and TFIIH have in common (i) decreasing the cellular concentration of these complexes (Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b) by weakening their stability (Fig.\u00a03e, f), (ii) affecting the anchoring of the CAK within the PIC (Figs.\u00a03a, g and 6a, b), (iii) hampering Pol II phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a06c, d) and therefore (iv) disrupting transcription in an in vitro (Fig.\u00a02c, d) and ex vivo context (Fig.\u00a01b, c, j, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c, d). Consequently, mutations in either GTF2E2 (which affect the interaction of TFIIE\u03b2 with TFIIE\u03b1, Fig.\u00a03e) or XPD (which disturb the TFIIH stability, Fig.\u00a03f) share similar consequences, mainly the lack of recruitment of the CAK and of its activity during transcription. The fact that mutations in TFIIE do not alter NER (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a) support the idea that Trichothiodystrophy is mainly related to transcription deficiencies. Overall, TTD-related mutations in TFIIE and TFIIH lead to numerous similar impacts during transcription initiation, which might explain in part why mutations within two complexes can lead to the same transcriptional syndrome. MethodsReagents and resourcesThe key reagents and resources (antibodies, chemical, cell lines, oligonucleotides, recombinant DNA, software, and materials) are given in Supplementary Table\u00a01.Cell cultureCells were grown in DMEM/Ham-F10 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FCS and 40\u2009\u00b5g/ml gentamicin. Treatments with t-RA (10\u2009\u00b5M) were performed in the presence of red phenol-free medium containing 5% charcoal-treated FCS and 40\u2009\u00b5g/ml gentamicin.Generation of knock-in TFIIE\u03b2/A150P cell lineHuman osteosarcoma epithelial U2OS cells were co-transfected with the px2-Cas9WT(GFP)-Puro plasmid (overexpressing tagged GFP-Cas9 and functional guide RNA, gRNA) and a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) corresponding to an exon 5 region of GTF2E2 with the missense mutation c.448G>C [p.Ala150Pro]. The GFP-positive cells were sorted 24\u2009h post-transfection, and were diluted 48\u2009h later as 0.5 cells/well in p96 plates. Cells were grown in DMEM (1\u2009g/l glucose) supplemented with 10% FCS and 40\u2009\u00b5g/ml gentamicin. Clones were screened by PCR and enzymatic digestion followed by further sequencing to confirm the correct knock-in in the desired locus.Retrotranscription and real-time qPCRTotal RNAs (2\u2009\u00b5g) were reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Invitrogen) using random hexanucleotides. Real-time qPCR (denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, annealing at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, elongation at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s) was done using the \u201cFastStart DNA Master SYBR Green\u201d kit and the LightCycler apparatus (Roche Diagnostics). The RAR\u03b22 mRNA expression represents the ratio between values obtained from treated and untreated cells normalized to 18S RNA. The primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table\u00a01.ChIP assaysSubconfluent cells were treated with t-RA (10\u2009\u00b5M) and ChIP experiments were next performed with Protein G-magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen)59. Non-specific controls were performed with samples incubated with magnetic beads in the absence of antibodies. Primers were designed to amplify regions located either at the proximal promoter or at exon 4 of RARB2 (see\u00a0Supplementary Materials)30. The primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table\u00a01. PCR (denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, annealing at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, elongation at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s) was done using the \u201cFastStart DNA Master SYBR Green\u201d kit and the LightCycler apparatus (Roche Diagnostics).Construction and purification of rIIEs and rIIHsFlag-TFIIE\u03b1 as well as His-TFIIE\u03b2/WT, /A150P and /D187Y were produced in E. coli. Baculoviruses overexpressing Flag-XPD/WT, /R112H, /R722W, as well as XPB, p62, p52, p44, p34, cdk7, cyclin H, MAT1, and p8 were previously generated60,61. To purify entire rIIHs or XPD alone, Sf21 insect cells were infected with the corresponding baculoviruses. The whole cell extracts (WCE) were then incubated with agarose beads bound to anti-M2-Flag antibody. Recombinant TFIIH and the different forms of XPD were eluted with an epitope peptide.NER assaysThe single lesion (Pt-GTG) plasmid was prepared as described elsewhere62. Dual incision assay was carried out in the presence of XPG, XPF/ERCC1, XPC/hHR23B, RPA, XPA, the different rIIHs and rIIEs (when indicated)61.Transcription reactionsThe AdMLP template was preincubated for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C with Pol II, TFIIA, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and the different rIIEs and rIIHs63. RNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of NTPs (200\u2009\u03bcM), including radiolabelled CTP (0.15\u2009\u03bcM). In order to study Pol II phosphorylation during transcription, classical run-off transcription assays were carried out in presence of cold NTPs; after SDS\u2013PAGE, specific monoclonal antibody was used to reveal Ser5-P of Pol II.Abortive synthesis reactionsThe AdMLP template was preincubated with the GTFs (Pol II, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and the corresponding rIIEs and rIIHs) for 15\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C. Phosphodiester bond synthesis was then initiated by the addition of priming dinucleotides CpA (0.5\u2009mM), MgCl2 (6.5\u2009mM), dATP (4\u2009\u03bcM), and radiolabelled CTP (1\u2009\u03bcM). After 30\u2009min of CpApC synthesis, the reactions were stopped in the presence of proteinase K (0.5\u2009mg/ml).PIC formation assaysBiotinylated AdMLP bound to streptavidin magnetic beads was incubated 20\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C with Pol II, TFIIA, IIB, IIF, TBP, and the different rIIEs and rIIHs. After several washings at 50\u2009mM NaCl, the bound fractions were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE followed by immunoblottings. The abundance of each protein was assessed by immunoblot densitometry analysis (using ImageJ software). Each signal was quantified three times (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d.) and plotted in arbitrary units (a.u.).Interaction assaysDepending on the coimmunoprecipitation assay, purified Pol II, rIIEs, and rIIHs were coincubated together with specific antibody (raised against either RPB1, XPD, p62, or Flag-Tag, as indicated) bound to protein G magnetic beads. After extensive washings (at either 150 or 500\u2009mM KCl), Western blots were performed using antibodies raised against the proteins of interest.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
