{"title": "Transcription of adenovirus type 2 genes in a cell-free system: apparent heterogeneity of initiation at some promoters", "pubDate": "1981", "PMCID": "PMC369711", "DOI": "10.1128/mcb.1.7.635-651.1981", "PMID": "9279377", "abstract": "We examined the transcription of a variety of adenovirus type 2 genes in a cell-free system containing purified ribonucleic acid polymerase II and a crude extract from cultured human cells. The early EIA, EIB, EIII, and EIV genes and the intermediate polypeptide IX gene, all of which contain a recognizable TATAA sequence upstream from the cap site, were actively transcribed in vitro, albeit with apparently different efficiencies, whereas the early EII (map position 74.9) and IVa2 genes, both of which lack a TATAA sequence, were not actively transcribed. A reverse transcriptase-primer extension analysis showed that the 5' ends of the in vitro transcripts were identical to those of the corresponding in vivo ribonucleic acids and that, in those instances where initiation was heterogeneous in vivo, a similar kind of heterogeneity was observed in the cell-free system. Transcription of the polypeptide IX gene indicated that this transcript was not terminated at, or processed to, the polyadenylic acid addition site in vitro. We also failed to observe, using the in vitro system, any indication of transcriptional regulation based on the use of adenovirus type 2-infected cell extracts.", "author": [{"author": "D C Lee", "affiliation": ["Department of Biological Chemistry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Lee+DC&cauthor_id=9279377"}, {"author": "R G Roeder", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Roeder+RG&cauthor_id=9279377"}], "refPMID": ["6158093", "6985473", "7418005", "6252477", "6929526", "7383157", "6247829", "7407913", "6997307", "6253077", "6933441", "7440579", "7440580", "6255460", "7460018", "7253021", "6153931", "954090", "197523", "922890", "203722", "276858", "702645", "716228", "363277", "721067", "214573", "729003", "430604", "442530", "442531", "476833", "479179", "480353", "90157", "487437", "291030", "498279", "227610", "7350148", "513202", "7357599", "7357604", "537065", "6251548"], "citedInPMID": ["9279377", "20023156", "7143576", "6952232", "6828386", "6717442", "6275389", "6174941", "6100910", "6094498", "6093059", "4009788", "3919392", "3614200", "3600646", "3367909", "3302945", "3185540", "3125423", "3119989", "3062363", "3035538", "3023844", "3018278", "2968498", "2836708", "2834320", "1592829"], "body": ""}
