In BriefETS-family transcription factors are key regulators of early B cell\ndevelopment.

Graphical Abstract INTRODUCTIONB cell development requires the sequential assembly and expression of genes\nencoding the immunoglobin heavy (Igh) and immunoglobulin light (Igl) chains to\ngenerate a mature B cell receptor (BCR) (Rajewsky,\n1996). Ig genes are assembled through the process of\nV(D)J recombination, which joins distant variable (V), joining (J), and diversity\n(D) segments (Fugmann et al., 2000). The DNA\ndouble-strand breaks (DSBs) necessary for V(D)J recombination are generated by the\nRAG endonuclease, which is composed of the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (Fugmann et al., 2000). RAG-mediated DNA breaks are\ngenerated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and activate the DNA damage response\n(DDR) kinase ATM, which facilitates repair of the broken DNA ends through\nnonhomologous end joining (Helmink and Sleckman,\n2012). In response to RAG DSBs, ATM also activates a broad\ntranscriptional program that regulates genes involved in diverse B cell functions,\nincluding migration, cell-cycle arrest, survival, and differentiation (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016; Bredemeyer et al.,\n2008; Helmink and Sleckman, 2012;\nSteinel et al., 2013). This genetic\nprogram is mediated by ATM-dependent activation of several transcription factors,\nincluding NF-\u03baB1, NF-\u03baB2, and SPIC (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016;\nBredemeyer et al., 2008).The Igh gene is assembled first in pro-B cells and\nproductive rearrangement results in its surface expression with surrogate light\nchains (\u03bb5 and VpreB) to generate the pre-BCR, which signals\ntransition to the large pre-B cell stage (Clark et\nal., 2014; Herzog et al., 2009;\nRajewsky, 1996). Pre-BCR oligomerization\nsignals through the SYK tyrosine kinase to promote proliferation and clonal\nexpansion of large pre-B cells (Clark et al.,\n2014; Herzog et al., 2009).\nActivation of SYK also triggers IgI\u03ba (Igk)\ngene recombination (Clark et al., 2014). RAG\nexpression is suppressed in proliferating cells, and as such, Igk\ngene assembly requires induction of cell-cycle arrest and transition to the small,\nnon-proliferating pre-B cell stage (Clark et al.,\n2014; Desiderio et al., 1996;\nJohnson et al., 2008; Ochiai et al., 2012). RAG DSBs activate ATM-dependent DDR\nsignaling pathways that enforce cell-cycle arrest and promote survival to prevent\nproliferation of cells with unrepaired DSBs and permit time for proper assembly of\nIgk genes (Bednarski et al.,\n2012, 2016; DeMicco et al., 2016).B cell development and assembly of Ig genes are carefully\norchestrated by developmental stage-specific transcription factors, including E2A,\nEBF, Pax5, PU.1 and SPIB (Pang et al., 2014).\nThe ETS-family transcription factor PU.1 is required for B cell lineage commitment\nand is constitutively expressed throughout B cell development (Polli et al., 2005; Schweitzer and DeKoter, 2004; Scott et\nal., 1994, 1997). PU.1 has\ncritical functions during B cell maturation. In pre-B cells, PU.1 regulates\nexpression of a diverse genetic program, including genes involved in B cell\nproliferation, differentiation, and Ig gene rearrangement (Batista et al., 2017; Heinz et al., 2010; Solomon et al., 2015). Expression of SYK and germline transcription of\nIgk, which are required for pre-BCR signaling and initiating\nV(D) J recombination, respectively, depend on PU.1 activity (Batista et al., 2017; Herzog et al., 2009; Schwarzenbach et\nal., 1995; Schweitzer and DeKoter,\n2004). Interestingly, loss of PU.1 in B cell progenitors results in only\na mild defect in B cell development because of compensatory function of another\nETS-family transcription factor, SPIB (Polli et al.,\n2005; Sokalski et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2005). PU.1 and SPIB associate with\nnearly identical regions of the genome in B cells and regulate transcription of a\nsimilar cohort of genes (Solomon et al.,\n2015). Combined loss of PU.1 and SPIB impairs B cell maturation in the bone\nmarrow and predisposes to the development of B cell leukemia (Sokalski etal., 2011).We previously demonstrated that SPIC, an ETS-family transcriptional repressor\nwith homology to PU.1 and SPIB, also functions in pre-B cells (Bednarski et al., 2016; Bemark et al., 1999; Hashimoto et al.,\n1999). Unlike PU.1 and SPIB, SPIC is not constitutively expressed in\nearly B cells but, rather, is induced by signals from RAG DSBs (Bednarski et al., 2016). SPIC operates primarily as a\ntranscriptional repressor and counters the activating functions of PU.1 and SPIB\n(Li et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2008). In pre-B cells, SPIC suppresses\nexpression of Syk and Blnk, which inhibits pre-BCR\nsignaling and enforces cell-cycle arrest in pre-B cells with RAG DSBs (Bednarski et al., 2016). SPIC also inhibits\ntranscription of Igk to prevent generation of additional RAG DSBs\n(Bednarski et al., 2016). Binding of SPIC\nto gene-regulatory elements for Syk, Blnk, and Igk\nis associated with loss of PU.1 at these genomic regions. Thus, expression of SPIC\nantagonizes PU.1 as these identified genes to suppress transcription and coordinate\npre-B cell development.Whether SPIC has broader functions in gene regulation and its mechanism of\naction in B cells have not been defined. SPIC may oppose PU.1 at limited gene\ntargets or, alternatively, may modulate PU.1 activity throughout the genome. In this\nregard, attenuation of PU.1 activity by SPIC could suppress pre-B cell genetic\nprograms to promote continued B cell maturation. SPIC may function simply by\ndisplacing PU.1 through competition for DNA binding sites or may complex with other\ntranscriptional regulators to repress transcription. We show here that, in response\nto RAG DSBs, SPIC binds throughout the genome of pre-B cells and elicits global\nchanges in PU.1 chromatin association. SPIC associates with the transcriptional\nrepressor BCLAF1 (Bcl2-associated factor 1) to regulate a distinct subset of RAG\nDSB-dependent gene expression changes and to enforce transition from large to small\npre-B cells. These experiments provide insight into the regulation of ETS\ntranscription factors in early B cells and the impact of DDR signaling on B cell\ndevelopment. RESULTSRAG DSB Signals Induce Genome-Wide Changes in PU.1 BindingTo determine the effects of DNA damage signaling on PU.1 activity in\nearly B cells, we used Abelson-kinase transformed pre-B cells (abl pre-B cells)\ndeficient in RAG1 or the Artemis endonuclease that express the\nBcl2 transgene\n(Rag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 and\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2,\nrespectively) (Bredemeyer et al., 2008).\nExpression of the Abl kinase promotes pre-B cell proliferation and suppresses\nexpression of Rag1 and Rag2. Treatment with\nthe Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib triggers cell-cycle arrest, induction of RAG\nexpression, and recombination of Igk (Bredemeyer et al., 2008). The Bcl2\ntransgene supports survival of imatinib-treated cells. Following treatment with\nimatinib,\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells do not generate RAG DSBs. In contrast,\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells generate RAG DSBs at Igk, but these DSBs are not\nrepaired as Artemis is required to open hairpin-sealed coding DNA ends (Figure 1A) (Bredemeyer et al., 2008; Helmink and\nSleckman, 2012). The RAG DSBs in\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells activate ATM-dependent DDRs (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016;\nBredemeyer et al., 2008).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.RAG DSB Signals Induce Genome-wide Changes in PU.1 Binding(A) qPCR analysis of Igk genomic DNA from\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\n(red) and Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\n(blue) abl pre-B cells treated with imatinib for 48 h.

Induction of RAG DSBs results\nin gain of few new binding sites but loss of approximately 20% of the PU.1\nbinding sites identified in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells (Figure 1B). Gene Ontology\nanalysis demonstrates that genes within 12 kb of lost PU.1 binding sites are\ninvolved in immune cell activation and differentiation (Figure S1B). In contrast, PU.1\nbinding sites that are conserved between\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 and\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells are proximal to genes involved in cell homeostasis and maintenance\n(i.e., signaling, nuclear transport, apoptosis). Novel RAG DSB-induced PU.1\nbinding occurred near genes involved in cell adhesion and developmental\nprocesses. Induction of RAG DSBs did not alter PU.1 binding across genomic\nregulatory elements as equal binding to promoters, genes, or intergenic regions\n(i.e., enhancers) is observed in both\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 and\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells (Figure\nS1C). Thus, in response to RAG DSBs, pre-B cells have a genome-wide\nreduction in PU.1 chromatin binding, which is expected to result in changes in\ngene expression that affect important cellular functions.Expression of SPIC Alters PU.1 Binding in Pre-B CellsRAG DSBs trigger ATM-dependent induction of SPIC (Figure 2A). Expression of SPIC, in turn, results in\nloss of PU.1 binding at genes required for pre-BCR signaling (Bednarski et al., 2016). To determine if expression\nof SPIC is responsible for the global changes in PU.1 binding observed in\nresponse to RAG DSBs, we stably transduced\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells with a lentiviral vector encoding a tetracycline-inducible\nFLAG-HA-tagged SPIC\n(Rag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet).\nTreatment with doxycycline induced equivalent SPIC mRNA expression as triggered\nby RAG DSBs (Figures 2A and \u200band2B).2B). We performed ChIP-seq for PU.1 in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells treated with imatinib alone or in combination with doxycycline\nto induce expression of SPIC (Figure 2B).\nExpression of SPIC does not alter PU.1 expression but results in significant\nchanges in PU.1 chromatin binding (Figures\n2C and \u200band2D).2D). Moreover, expression\nof SPIC results in changes in PU.1 binding that are similar to changes induced\nby RAG DSBs (compare Figures 1B and \u200band2D).2D). These findings demonstrate that changes\nin PU.1 binding in response to RAG DSBs are, in large part, due to RAG\nDSB-mediated induction of SPIC.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Expression of SPIC Alters PU.1 Binding(A) Spic mRNA expression in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 and\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\nablpre-B cells treated with imatinib for 48 h.\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\nablpre-B cells were also treated with vehicle (\u2212) or 15 \u03bcM ATM\ninhibitor KU55933 (+ iATM).

Current commercial\nantibodies against endogenous SPIC do not work for ChIP. Thus, to determine if\nSPIC and PU.1 binding to chromatin is similarly distributed throughout the\ngenome, we performed ChIP-seq with anti-HA antibodies to precipitate\nFLAG-HA-SPIC in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells treated with doxycycline (to induce SPIC). Results were compared\nwith findings from ChIP-seq for PU.1 in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl\npre-B cells without SPIC expression. Peaks with \u22651 bp of overlap between\nthe two ChIP-seq datasets were considered as enriched for binding to both\ntranscription factors. We find that SPIC and PU.1 bind to similar locations\nthroughout the genome (Figure 3A).\nAdditionally, PU.1 binding is lost at sites where SPIC is bound (Figures 3B, \u200b,3C,\nand3C,\nand S2).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.SPIC and PU.1 Bind to Identical Genomic Regions(A) Dot plot and heatmap of fold changes and signal intensity for PU.1\nand SPIC (by anti-HA ChIP) peaks identified by ChIP-seq in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells treated with imatinib for 48 h in the absence (for PU.1 ChIP) or\npresence (for SPIC ChIP) of 2 \u03bcM doxycycline (Dox).

Indeed, the majority of these shared binding sites overlap by\n>70%, and the greatest number of ChIP peaks have >90% overlap.\nFurthermore, SPIC and PU.1 bind to similar regions throughout the genome (Figure 3E). Collectively, these findings\ndemonstrate that SPIC and PU.1 bind to similar regulatory elements in pre-B\ncells and that SPIC binding results in displacement of PU.1 from these\nregions.SPIC Recruits BCLAF1 to ChromatinPU.1 forms heterodimeric complexes with IRF4 or IRF8 to regulate\ntranscription initiation (Brass et al.,\n1996; Heinz et al., 2010).\nSPIC does not complex with IRF4 or IRF8 but binds to similar DNA sequences as\nPU.1 (Carlsson et al., 2003). These\nfindings raise the question of whether SPIC complexes with distinct protein\npartners to regulate gene expression. To identify SPIC interacting partners, we\ngenerated Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\nabl pre-B cells expressing either a tetracycline-inducible FLAG-HA-tagged SPIC\n(Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet)\nor a tetracycline-inducible FLAG-HA-tagged PU.1\n(Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Pu1tet).\nCells were treated with imatinib to induce RAG DSBs and with doxycycline to\ninduce comparable expression of the FLAG-tagged transcription factors (Figure S3). SPIC and PU.1\nwere immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies, and associated proteins were\nidentified by tandem mass spectrometry. Unique peptides were compared with\nidentify proteins enriched for binding to SPIC (Figure 4A; Table\nS1). We focused on nuclear proteins with functions in transcriptional\nregulation. One of these proteins that enriched for binding to SPIC and not PU.1\nis BCLAF1 (Figures 4A and \u200band4B).4B). BCLAF1 was originally identified as a\ntranscriptional repressor but has also been shown to promote gene expression in\nresponse to DNA damage (Kasof et al.,\n1999; Liu et al., 2007; Shao et al., 2016).\nBclaf1-deficient mice have reduced T cells and increased\nsplenic B cell numbers, suggesting that BCLAF1 may function in immune\ndevelopment (McPherson et al., 2009).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.SPIC Recruits BCLAF1 to Chromatin(A) FLAG-HA-SPIC and FLAG-HA-PU.1 were immunoprecipitated from\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nand\nArt-\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Pu.1tet,\nrespectively, after treatment with imatinib and 2 \u03bcM doxycycline for 48\nh.

In contrast, IRF4 and IRF8 associate\nwith PU.1 but do not complex with SPIC (Figure\n4B). To determine if BCLAF1 is recruited to SPIC-bound chromatin in\npre-B cells, we compared BCLAF1 ChIP-seq with SPIC ChIP-seq. A significant\nportion (>80%) of BCLAF1 and SPIC peaks overlap indicating that the two\nproteins associate with similar chromatin regions (Figure 4D). Consistent with ChIP-seq results, BCLAF1 binding to the\nSyk promoter is increased in cells expressing SPIC (Figure 4E). Additionally, ChIP-re-ChIP\nexperiments show that BCLAF1 only associates with the SPIC-bound\nSyk promoter and not with the PU.1-bound promoter (Figure 4F). Finally, BCLAF1 binding to the\nSyk promoter is increased in pre-B cells with RAG DSBs\n(Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2),\nwhich express SPIC (Figures 4G and \u200band2A).2A). BCLAF1 ChIP peaks contain the conserved\nETS DNA binding sequence (GGAA, p < 1 \u00d7 e\u221233)\nsuggesting that it may not directly bind DNA but rather is recruited to\nchromatin by SPIC in response to RAG DSBs in pre-B cells.SPIC and BCLAF1 Regulate Gene Expression in Pre-B CellsWe previously showed that in response to RAG DSBs, SPIC represses\nexpression of key genes required for pre-BCR signaling (Bednarski et al., 2016). Given our current findings\nthat SPIC and its partner BCLAF1 bind throughout the genome, we hypothesized\nthat this complex regulates a broad genetic program in pre-B cells. To identify\nthe genes regulated by SPIC, we compared transcriptional changes in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells with and without expression of SPIC. Expression of 866 genes was\nchanged \u2265 2-fold (adjusted p < 0.05) following expression of SPIC\n(Figures 5A and S4A; Table S2). Knockdown of BCLAF1 in\nSPIC-expressing\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells changes expression of 55% of SPIC-regulated genes (\u2265\n2-fold change, adjusted p < 0.05) (Figures\n5B, \u200b,5C,5C, and S4A; Table S2). Notably, genes repressed\nby SPIC were rescued following knockdown of BCLAF1 (Figures 5C and S4A). Gene Ontology analysis\nrevealed that SPIC- and BCLAF1-dependent genes are enriched for immune processes\nin B cells (Figure\nS4B). Importantly, loss of BCLAF1 does not alter SPIC binding to the\nSyk promoter, suggesting that recruitment of BCLAF1 is\nneeded for SPIC-mediated transcriptional changes but not for SPIC binding to\nchromatin (Figure 5D).Open in a separate windowFigure 5.SPIC and BCLAF1 Regulate Gene Expression in Pre-B Cells in Response to RAG\nDSBs(A) Volcano plot of gene expression changes (fold change \u2265 2, p\n\u2264 0.05) between\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2:Spictet\nabl pre-B cells with and without SPIC induction.

Gene profiling revealed that BCLAF1\nregulates a significant portion of RAG DSB-mediated genes (540 of 717 genes,\n\u22652-fold change, adjusted p < 0.05; Figure 5E; Table\nS3).

Pathway\nanalyses are enriched for diverse B cell functions, including proliferation,\ncell adhesion, and cell death (Figure S5B). These findings demonstrate that the SPIC/BCLAF1 complex\nregulates a distinct genetic program in pre-B cells with RAG DSBs.BCLAF1 Regulates Pre-BCR Signaling in Primary Pre-B CellsTo determine if BCLAF1 is required for regulation of SPIC function in\nprimary pre-B cells, we expanded pre-B cells from\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\nand\nArt\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\nmice in the presence of interleukin-7 (IL-7) (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016).\nThe \u03bcIgh transgene permits expression of a pre-BCR,\nwhich promotes transition to the pre-B cell developmental stage (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016). IL-7 promotes proliferation and expansion of\nlarge pre-B cells. Withdrawal of IL-7 induces cell-cycle arrest, transition to\nsmall pre-B cells, expression of RAG, and induction of RAG DSBs at\nIgk (Bednarski et al.,\n2012, 2016; Johnson et al., 2008; Ochiai et al., 2012; Rolink et al.,\n1991; Steinel et al., 2013).\nConsistent with our previous findings, withdrawal of IL-7 results in induction\nof SPIC and suppression of Syk transcripts in pre-B cells with\nRAG DSBs\n(Art\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2)\n(Figures 6A and \u200band6B)6B) (Bednarski et al.,\n2016). Loss of BCLAF1 does not alter induction of\nSpic but does lead to increased expression of\nSyk in\nArt\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\nsmall pre-B cells (Figures 6A and \u200band6B).6B). Consistent with the rescue of\nSyk mRNA levels, SYK protein is increased in\nArt\u2212/\u2212:Igh:Bcl2\npre-B cells lacking BCLAF1 to levels equivalent to those observed in\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\npre-B cells (Figure 6C). On the basis of\nthese results, we conclude that BCLAF1 is necessary for repression of SYK in\nresponse to RAG DSBs in primary small pre-B cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 6.BCLAF1 Regulates SYK Expression in Primary Pre-B Cells(A-C)\nArt\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\npre-B cells were transduced with a retrovirus expressing a scrambled shRNA\n(\u2212) or shBclaf1 (+) and then subsequently withdrawn from IL-7.(A and B) Spic and Syk mRNA expression\nassessed in indicated small pre-B cells 2 days after IL-7 withdrawal.

Approximately 2% of small pre-B cells from\nSpicigfp/igfp mice are EGFP\npositive, indicative of SPIC expression (Figures\n6D and \u200band6E).6E). EGFP-expressing\nsmall pre-B cells are not observed in\nAtm\u2212/\u2212:Spicigfp/igfp,\nindicating that induction of SPIC (and EGFP) depends on DNA damage signaling\n(Figure 6E). SPIC-expressing\nSpicigfp/igfp small pre-B cells\n(EGFP positive) have reduced PU.1 binding and increased BCLAF1 binding to the\nSyk promoter as well as decreased Syk\nexpression (Figures 6F\u20136H) (Bednarski\net al., 2016). These results suggest that SPIC/BCLAF1 complex is\ninduced by DNA damage signals from transient RAG DSBs generated during\nIgl rearrangement in wild-type small pre-B cells.Loss of BCLAF1 Alters Large to Small Pre-B Cell TransitionActivation of SYK downstream of the pre-BCR can promote pre-B cell\nproliferation in the absence of IL-7 signaling (Clark et al., 2014; Herzog et al.,\n2009; Ochiai et al., 2012;\nRolink et al., 2000; Wossning et al., 2006). Given that loss of BCLAF1\nprevents SPIC-mediated repression of SYK, we hypothesized that loss of BCLAF1\nmay alter pre-B cell proliferation and the transition from large to small pre-B\ncells during early B cell development. To test this, we generated\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice, which have selective loss of BCLAF1 in B cells (Figure 7A) (Hobeika et\nal., 2006). Pre-B cells from\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nand Bclaf1f/f mice were expanded in\nthe presence of IL-7. Following IL-7 withdrawal,\nBclaf1-deficient pre-B cells from\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice have increased S-phase progression and increased Syk\nexpression compared with pre-B cells from Bclaf1\u2122 and\nMb1-cre mice (Figures\n7B\u20137D). These findings\nsupport a role for BCLAF1 in the regulation of pre-B cell proliferation possibly\nthrough modulation of SYK activity downstream of pre-BCR signaling.Open in a separate windowFigure 7.BCLAF1 Regulates Large to Small Pre-B Cell Transition(A) Western blot of BCLAF1 in sorted CD19\u2212 (non-B cell) and CD19+\nB cell populations from bone marrow of 5-week-old\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice.

In our\nbreeding, Mb1-cre mice have normal numbers of pro-B cells but\nreduced pre-B cells relative to littermate wild-type\nBclaf1f/f mice (Figures 7E and S6). In contrast,\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice have increased numbers of pre-B cells compared with\nMb1-cre mice and are similar to\nBclaf1f/f mice (Figure 7E). Interestingly, the increase in\npre-B cells in\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice is due primarily to larger numbers of large pre-B cells (Figure 7E). Loss of Bclaf1 does not\nalter numbers of pro-B cells or small pre-B cells. Consistent with findings in\ncultured cells, in vivo large, proliferating pre-B cells from\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice have increased Syk mRNA levels (Figure 7F). Syk expression is not\naltered in small pre-B cells (Figure 7F).\nWe propose that BCLAF1 functions in response to RAG DSBs in pre-B cells to\nsuppress Syk and enforce transition from the large to small\npre-B cell developmental stage. DISCUSSIONHere we show that RAG DSBs induce genome-wide changes in PU.1 localization\nand function, which coordinates a distinct genetic program in B cells undergoing\nIg gene rearrangement. This modulation of PU.1 activity is\nmediated by RAG DSB activation of a SPIC/BCLAF1 transcriptional repressor complex.\nSPIC displaces PU.1 at gene regulatory sites but requires association with BCLAF1 to\nsuppress transcription. This antagonistic function of SPIC/BCLAF1 coordinates a\nbroad genetic program and enforces transition from large to small pre-B cells in\nresponse to RAG DSBs.PU.1 is a key regulator of cell fate decisions during early hematopoiesis\nand is essential for generating B cells from hematopoietic progenitors (Dakic et al., 2007; DeKoter et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2018; Scott et al.,\n1994, 1997). PU.1 expression is\nhigh in myeloid cells, in which it is required to promote lineage specific gene\nexpression (Heinz et al., 2010). In contrast,\nPU.1 expression is reduced during B cell differentiation and remains low in\nestablished B cells (Back et al., 2005; Nutt et al., 2005). This differential activity\nof PU.1 is critical for directing appropriate lineage commitment. Dysregulation of\nPU.1 expression leads to aberrant differentiation and can result in leukemic\ntransformation (Anderson et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2016; Rosenbauer et al., 2004, 2006; Sokalski et al., 2011).\nPU.1 activity is also regulated through interaction with other transcription\nfactors, which modulate its DNA binding properties or its transcriptional function\n(Maitra and Atchison, 2000; Nerlov et al., 2000; Rogers et al., 2016). For example, in early lymphoid\nprecursors, E2A association with PU.1 inhibits PU.1-induced transcription of myeloid\ngenes and promotes B lymphoid differentiation (Rogers et al., 2016). We find that PU.1 activity is regulated at the\npre-B cell developmental stage through RAG DSB-mediated induction of SPIC, which\nbinds chromatin and displaces PU.1. This transcription factor exchange results in\nchanges in expression of genes involved in pre-BCR signaling, B cell proliferation,\nand B cell differentiation.SPIC and PU.1 have homologous DNA binding domains (Bemark et al., 1999; Hashimoto et al., 1999). As such, SPIC can compete for DNA binding sites\noccupied by PU.1, and binding of SPIC results in displacement of PU.1 from these\nsites. Interestingly, SPIC associates with >90% of the PU.1 sites, but PU.1\nbinding is lost at only approximately 20% of the regions it binds in the absence of\nSPIC expression (Figures 2D and \u200band3A).3A). It is conceivable, then, that SPIC and PU.1 may\nsimultaneously bind specific regions of the genome, and SPIC binding may not always\nfully displace PU.1. Rather, binding of SPIC nearby PU.1 may alter PU.1\ntranscriptional activity or other transcriptional machinery at these sites.\nAlternatively, in an individual cell, each ETS site may be occupied by either SPIC\nor PU.1, but ChIP analysis on a bulk population is not sensitive enough to\ndiscriminate between these two different states.In early B cells, PU.1 and SPIB are constitutively expressed and have\ncomplementary functions (Schweitzer and DeKoter,\n2004; Scott et al., 1994, 1997; Sokalski\net al., 2011; Solomon et al.,\n2015). As such, conditional deletion of either PU.1 or SPIB alone mildly\nalters B cell development, but loss of both transcription factors results in a block\nin B cell differentiation at the pro-B cell stage (Polli et al., 2005; Sokalski et al.,\n2011; Su et al., 1997; Ye et al., 2005). PU.1 and SPIB bind to similar\nregions throughout the genome of pro-B cells and regulate expression of key\ndevelopmental genes, including Syk and Blnk, which\nare necessary for pre-BCR signaling and induction of proliferation of large pre-B\ncells (Solomon et al., 2015). We find that\nSPIC also binds to the same genomic sites as PU.1. Given that SPIB and PU.1 bind\nidentical regions and have complementary functions in early B cells, SPIC is also\nexpected to counter SPIB similar to our observed results for PU.1. In contrast to\nPU.1 and SPIB, SPIC is inducibly expressed in pre-B cells in response to RAG DSBs\nand functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. Expression of SPIC opposes\nPU.1 and SPIB activity resulting in suppression of pre-BCR and BCR signaling in\nearly B cells and mature B cells, respectively, leading to a block in B cell\nmaturation or function (Bednarski et al.,\n2016; Zhu et al., 2008). Importantly,\ncomplete or permanent inhibition of PU.1 and SPIB could be detrimental to B cell\ndevelopment, as combined loss of these transcription factors results in leukemic\ntransformation (Sokalski et al., 2011). In\nthis regard, induced expression of SPIC by RAG DSBs permits for stage-specific and\ntransient inhibition of PU.1 (and SPIB). SPIC expression is expected to be lost\nafter RAG DSBs are repaired and associated DDR signaling is terminated. The\nreduction in SPIC would allow PU.1 (and SPIB) to rebind to chromatin and resume\ntranscriptional activities necessary for mature B cell function. Thus, RAG DSBs\nregulate a temporary suppression of PU.1 to promote transition from large to small\npre-B cells and then permit continued transition to antibody-producing mature B\ncells.PU.1 forms heterodimeric complexes with IRF4 or IRF8 to promote\ntranscription (Brass et al., 1996; Heinz et al., 2010; Pongubala et al., 1992). As such, combined loss of IRF4\nand IRF8 results in similar abnormalities in B cell development as loss of PU.1\n(Lu et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2006). SPIC binds the same DNA sequence as\nPU.1 but has a distinct protein-interaction domain and does not bind IRF4 or IRF8\n(Carlsson et al., 2003). Thus, SPIC could\nmediate suppression of transcription simply through displacement of PU.1 and loss of\nassociated transcription activation machinery (i.e., IRF4). Displacement of the\nPU.1/IRF4 complex alone, though, may be insufficient to repress transcription as\nthis is not expected to result in rapid changes in histone modifications or RNA\npolymerase activity, which drive gene expression. Alternatively, in a manner similar\nto PU.1, SPIC may effect transcriptional inhibition by recruiting additional\nproteins to gene-regulatory elements. In this regard, we find that SPIC, but not\nPU.1, binds BCLAF1. BCLAF1 is not necessary for SPIC binding to chromatin but is\nrequired for transcriptional repression. On the basis of these findings, we propose\nthat antagonism of PU.1 activity is mediated by a SPIC-BCLAF1 complex that binds to\nchromatin and suppresses key PU.1-regulated genes. Further studies are needed to\ndetermine the mechanism by which the SPIC-BCLAF1 complex regulates transcription\n(i.e., activity on histone epigenetics, RNA polymerase activity, and locus\naccessibility).BCLAF1 was first identified as a transcriptional repressor but also\nfunctions as an activator to promote expression of p53 and cytokines in response to\nDNA damage (Kasof et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2007; Shao et al., 2016). BCLAF1 also has been identified as a\ncomponent of the RNA splicing complex (Savage et\nal., 2014; Vohhodina et al.,\n2017). We find that in early B cells, BCLAF1 complexes with SPIC to repress\ngene expression in response to RAG-mediated DSBs. BCLAF1 chromatin binding nearly\ncompletely overlaps with SPIC-bound genomic regions. SPIC and BCLAF1 could bind DNA\nindependently and then cooperatively suppress transcription. In this regard,\nin vitro studies have shown that BCLAF1 binds the\ninterferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (Qin\net al., 2019). The sequence for binding of the PU.1/IRF4 heterodimer\ncontains a portion of the ISRE site in series with an ETS motif. BCLAF1 and SPIC\ncould bind this same sequence, or, alternatively, BCLAF1 may be recruited to gene\nregulatory regions through protein-protein interactions with SPIC, which binds ETS\nDNA sequences. The domains that govern SPIC and BCLAF1 protein interactions and DNA\nbinding are currently being investigated.We find that loss of BCLAF1 prevents RAG DSB- and SPIC-mediated repression\nof Syk mRNA expression. SYK is a key signaling molecule downstream\nof the pre-BCR and is required for the pre-BCR to promote proliferation of large\npre-B cells (Clark et al., 2014; Herzog et al., 2009). We previously showed that\nin response to RAG DSBs, induction of SPIC suppresses pre-BCR signaling to enforce\ncell-cycle arrest in small pre-B cells (Bednarski et\nal., 2016). Thus, loss of BCLAF1 is expected to mitigate RAG DSB-induced\ninhibition of proliferation. Indeed, Bclaf1-deficient pre-B cells\nhave increased cell cycle entry, and mice with B cell-specific deletion of BCLAF1\nhave increased numbers of proliferating, large pre-B cells, consistent with\nincreased SYK activity. Loss of BCLAF1 does not result in a complete block in B cell\ndevelopment, which may reflect that additional mechanisms, such as p53, exist to\nregulate G1 arrest in small pre-B cells undergoing Ig gene\nrearrangement.In summary, we find that SPIC/BCLAF1 functions to modulate PU.1 activity in\npre-B cells. High activity of PU.1 promotes proliferation and expansion of large\npre-B cells. As cells transition to small pre-B cell stage and initiate\nIgl gene assembly, RAG DSBs induce expression of SPIC, which\npartners with BCLAF1, to oppose PU.1 activity resulting in gene expression changes,\nincluding suppression of Syk, that promote transition from large to\nsmall pre-B cells. After rearrangement of Igl is completed and DSBs\nare repaired, termination of DDR signaling would result in cessation of SPIC/BCLAF1\nactivity and reestablishment of PU.1 transcriptional activation, which could support\nBCR signaling to drive transition to the immature B cell stage. We propose that RAG\nDSB-dependent activation of SPIC/BCLAF1 functions as rheostat to titer PU.1 activity\nduring early B cell development. STAR\u2605METHODSLEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITYFurther information and request for resources and reagents should be\ndirected to the Lead Contact, Jeff Bednarski\n(ude.ltsuw@j_iksrandeb). All unique/stable reagents,\nincluding plasmids and mouse lines, are available from the Lead Contact with a\ncompleted Materials Transfer Agreement.EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSMice: All mice were bred and maintained\nunder specific pathogen-free conditions at the Washington University School of\nMedicine and were handled in accordance to the guidelines set forth by the\nDivision of Comparative Medicine of Washington University.\nMb1-cre\n(cd79atm1(cre)Reth)\nmice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.\nBclaf1f/f mice were\ngenerated by the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the\nKOMP Repository (www.komp.org).\nRag1\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\nand\nArt\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2\nwere generated as previously described (Bednarski\net al., 2012, 2016).\nSpicigfp/igfp\n(Spictm2.1Kmm) were kindly\nprovided by K. M. Murphy (Haldar et al.,\n2014). Spicigfp/igfp,\nMb1-cre, Bclaf1f/f and\nBclaf1f/f:Mb1-cre\nmice are on a B6 background. All other mice are on a mixed genetic background.\nBoth sexes were used equivalently in all experiments. In vivo\nstudies were conducted on 4\u20135 week old mice.Cell Lines and Primary Cultures Rag1\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\nand Art\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2\nabl pre-B cells were a gift from Barry Sleckman. Cell lines were\nauthenticated by genotyping. To induce cell cycle arrest and induction of\nRAG DSBs, cell lines were treated with 3 \u03bcM imatinib for indicated\ntimes (Bredemeyer et al., 2008).\nPrimary pre-B cell cultures were generated by culturing bone marrow from\n4\u20136 week old mice at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in media\ncontaining 5 ng/mL of IL-7 (Miltenyi Biotec) for 7\u201310 days (Bednarski et al., 2012, 2016). Both sexes were used equivalently in all\nexperiments. For IL-7 withdrawal experiments, cells were resuspended in\nmedia without IL-7 and maintained at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL for\nthe indicated times. ATM inhibitor KU55933 (15 \u03bcM; Tocris) was added\nto cultures at time of addition of imatinib or IL-7 withdrawal.METHOD DETAILScDNA Expression and shRNA-Mediated Knock-down cDNAs for SPIC and PU.1 with 5\u2032 FLAG-HA tag were individually\ncloned into the pFLRU-TRE-Ubc-rtTA-IRES-Thy1.2 lentiviral vector. shRNA\ntargeting Bclaf1 (sequence: 5\u2032-CCTCATAGTCCTTCAC\nCTATT-3\u2032) was cloned into the MSCV-hCD2-mir30 vector (Bednarski et al., 2012). Retrovirus was produced\nin platE cells by transfection of the retroviral plasmid with Lipofectamine\n2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nLentivirus was produced in 293T cells by transfection of the lentiviral\nplasmid along with pCMV-VZV-G and pCMV-d8.2R plasmids with Lipofectamine\n2000 (Stewart et al., 2003). Viral\nsupernatant was collected and pooled from 24\u201372 hours after\ntransfection. Viral supernatant was used immediately to transduce cells or\nwas concentrated prior to transduction. To concentrate viral particles,\nPEG-8000 (Sigma; final concentration 8%) was added to viral supernatant\nfollowed by incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight and centrifugation at 2500\nRPM for 20 minutes. Precipitated virus was resuspended at 300x concentration\nin sterile PBS. Pre-B cells were transduced with unconcentrated virus (10\n\u00d7 106 cells in 1 mL viral supernatant) or with\nconcentrated virus (40 \u00d7 106 in 1 mL with 10x viral\nparticles) in media with polybrene (5 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma) by centrifugation\nfor 90 min at 1300 RPM at room temperature. Four hours later fresh media was\nadded and the cells were incubated overnight. Virus-containing media was\nremoved and cells were cultured in fresh media (2 \u00d7\n106/ml). Cells expressing the retrovirus construct were\nidentified by flow cytometric assessment of hCD25 or hCD2 expression using a\nFACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Transduced cells were sorted using biotin\nconjugated anti-hCD2 or anti-hCD25 (BD Biosciences) and anti-biotin magnetic\nbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) on MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol.Flow Cytometric Analyses and Cell Sorting Flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur or BD\nLSRFortessa (BD Biosciences). Sorting was conducted on a Sony Sy3200 through\nthe Siteman Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Fluorescein\nisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD45R/B220 (clone RA3\u20136B2),\nphycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD43 (clone S7), FITC-conjugated\nanti-CD43 (clone S7), PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45/B220 (clone\nRA3\u20136B2), allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-IgM (clone II/41),\nAPC-conjugated anti-hCD2, and PE-conjugated anti-hCD2 were purchased from BD\nBiosciences. PE-conjugated anti-hCD25 (clone BC96) and APC-conjugated\nanti-hCD25 (clone BC96) were purchased from BioLegend.Cell Cycle Analysis To assess pre-BCR driven proliferation, pre-B cells were resuspended\nin media without IL-7 and maintained at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL.\nTwenty-four hours after removal from IL-7 cells were pulsed BrdU for two\nhours using the BrdU-FITC kit (BD Biosciences) per the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. DNA content was assessed by 7AAD (BD Biosciences).Western Blot Western blots were done on whole cell lysates (Bednarski et al., 2016). Anti-SYK (clone D1I5Q)\nand anti-GAPDH (clone D16H11) antibodies were from Cell Signaling\nTechnology. Anti-BCLAF1 antibody (A300\u2013608A) was from Bethyl\nLaboratories. Anti-PU.1 (PA5\u201317505) was from Thermo Fisher\nScientific. Anti-FLAG (clone M2) was from Sigma. Secondary reagents were\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling;\ncatalog # 7076) or anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling; catalog # 7074).\nWesterns were developed with ECL (Pierce) and ECL Prime (GE Healthcare).RT-PCR For genomic DNA isolation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mM\nTRIS pH8.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200mM NaCl and 0.2% SDS) and DNA was precipitated by\naddition of isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol and then resuspended in\nTris-EDTA buffer (Bredemeyer et al.,\n2008). RNA was isolated using RNeasy (QIAGEN) and reversed\ntranscribed using a polyT primer with SuperScriptII (Life Technologies)\naccording to the manufacturers\u2019 protocol. RT-PCR was performed using\nBrilliant II SYBR Green (Agilent) and acquired on an Mx3000P (Stratagene).\nEach reaction was run in triplicate. Values were normalized to housekeeping\ngenes as indicated, and fold change was determined by the \u0394\u0394\ncycle threshold method. Primer sequences are listed in Table S5.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-Seq ChIP was performed using anti-PU.1 (PA5-17505, Thermo Fisher\nScientific), anti-FLAG (clone M2, Sigma), anti-HA (ab9110, Abcam),\nanti-BCLAF1 (A300-608A, Bethyl Laboratories), control rabbit IgG (Millipore)\nand control mouse IgG antibodies (clone P3.6.2.8.1, eBioscience) as\npreviously described (Bednarski et al.,\n2016). Briefly, DNA was cross-linked with 2% formaldehyde for 10\nmin at room temp (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml). Reaction was stopped\nwith 125 \u03bcM Glycine. Cells were lysed with NP-40 and nuclei were\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen then lysed with SDS. DNA was fragmented by\nsonicating with 30 s pulses for 60 cycles using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). DNA\nfragmentation was in the range of 200\u2013500 bp and was monitored by\nagarose gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation was performed with\nanti-PU.1 (1:100), anti-HA (1 \u03bcg), anti-BCLAF1 (2 \u03bcg), or\ncontrol rabbit IgG and Protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies). DNA was\neluted, reverse cross-linked and then purified with QIAquick PCR\npurification kit (QIAGEN). For ChIP-PCR analysis, PCR was performed using\nBrilliant II SYBR Green (Agilent) and acquired on an Mx3000P (Stratagene).\nPrimers are listed in Table S5. For ChIP-seq analysis, fragmented DNA was quantified\nusing 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and DNA libraries were\nprepared using Illumina TruSeq. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina\nHiSeq 3000 by the Washington University Genome Technology Access Center.\nInput controls were used for all samples. FASTQ files were aligned to mm9\nusing Map with Bowtie for Illumina v. 1.1.2 to the reference genome\n(NCBI37/mm9) (Langmead and Salzberg,\n2012). MACS version 2 was used to call peaks with a tag size set\nto 45, band width of 300 and a p value of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125\n(Zhang et al., 2008). Input. bed\nfiles of total reads for MM-ChIP were generated using Convert from BAM to\nBED tool v0.1.0 in Galaxy V18.09 (Afgan et\nal., 2016). Promoter regions were defined as regions extending 12\nkb upstream of transcription start site. R package (GenomicRanges) and\nBedtools V2.25.0 were used to determine overlapping ChIP peaks (Lawrence et al., 2013; Quinlan and Hall, 2010). MAnorm using parameters\n-w 300-s1 50-s2 50 was used to calculate normalized fold changes for each\nChIP-seq comparison (Shao et al.,\n2012). A 1.5 fold change magnitude was used to separate enriched\nand unbiased peaks for each comparison. EaSeq v1.111 was used to generate\nratiometric heatmaps from RPM-normalized ChIP-seq signal (Lerdrup et al., 2016). Data will be deposited in\nNCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus.Ultra-Low-Input Native ChIP EGFP-negative (\u2212) and EGFP-expressing (+) small pre-B cells\nwere sorted from SPICigfp/igfp\nmice. ULI-NChIP was performed as previously described (Brind\u2019Amour et al., 2015). Briefly,\nchromatin was fragmented using micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs) at\n37\u00b0C for 5 mins and diluted in complete immunoprecipitation buffer\n(20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2mM EDTA, 15mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease and\nphosphatase inhibitors). Fragmented chromatin was precleared with Protein A\nDynabeads (Life Technologies). Immunoprecipitation was performed with\nanti-PU.1 (1:100), anti-BCLAF1 (10 \u03bcg), or control rabbit IgG and\nProtein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies). The antibody-beads complex was\nwashed with low salt (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1%SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%\ndeoxycholate, 2mM EDTA and 150mM NaCl) and high salt (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,\n0.1%SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 2mM EDTA and 300mM NaCl)\nbuffer. DNA was eluted in high salt buffer. DNA was purified and ChIP-PCR\nwas performed as above.RNA-Seq Analysis RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN). Libraries were prepared\nusing Illumina TrueSeq Adpaters and paired-end sequencing was performed\nusing an Illumina HiSeq 3000 by the Washington University Genome Technology\nAccess Center according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Sequencing\ndata were analyzed as previously described (Andley et al., 2018). Briefly, RNA-seq reads were aligned to mm9\nassembly with STAR version 2.0.4b1. Gene counts were derived from uniquely\naligned unambiguous reads by Subread-featureCount version 1.4.5. Gene-level\ncounts were imported into the R/Bioconductor package EdgeR and TMM\nnormalization size factors were calculated to adjust for differences in\nlibrary size (Robinson et al., 2010).\nDifferential expression analysis was then performed to analyze for\ndifferences between conditions using the R/Bioconductor package limma-voom\n(Law et al., 2014). Results were\nfiltered for only those genes with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate\nadjusted p values less than or equal to 0.05. DAVID (Database for\nAnnotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, v6.8) was used to test\nif differentially expressed genes resulted in perturbations in known Gene\nOntology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways (Huang\net al., 2009). Volcano plots were generated using R (ggplot2).\nJava TreeView Version 1.1.6r4 and R/Bioconductor package heatmap3 were used\nto display heat-maps (Saldanha, 2004;\nZhao et al., 2014). DAVID was\nused to display annotated KEGG graphs across groups of samples for each GO\nterm or KEGG pathway with a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate adjusted\np value \u2264 0.05.Tandem Affinity Purification and MS Analysis FLAG-HA-tagged SPIC and PU.1 were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG\nantibody as previously described with the following modifications (Mosammaparast et al., 2013; Nakatani and Ogryzko, 2003). Cells were\nlysed lysis of cells (1 \u00d7 109 cells/1.5 ml) in TAP buffer\n(50 mM Tris, pH 7.9,150 mM NaCI, 1% NP-40, and protease and phosphatase\ninhibitor cocktails (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and\nincubated with anti-FLAG beads (40 \u03bcl/109 cells; clone M2;\nSigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours. After extensive washing in the same buffer,\nbound material was eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) and analyzed by\nwestern blotting. Coomassie-stained bands were cut from SDS-PAGE and sent to\nTaplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School\n(taplin.med.harvard.edu). In-gel trypsin digestion was\nperformed and the detection of complexed proteins was done using Orbitrap\nion-trap mass spectrometers (ThermoFisher Scientific). Interacting proteins\nwere identified by matching protein database with acquired fragmentation\npattern by using Sequest (ThermoFisher Scientific) (Eng et al., 1994).QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISRNA-seq and ChIP-seq were analyzed for statistical significance using\nthe software packages described above. For all other analyses, statistics and\nfigures were generated using Prism 8 (v8.0.2). P values were generated via\nStudent\u2019s t test (unpaired, two-tailed). Error bars are SE. *p value\n\u2264 0.05, **p value \u2264 0.01, ***p value \u2264 0.001, ****p value\n\u2264 0.0001.DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITYThe ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data generated during this study are available\nat NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE129130\",\"term_id\":\"129130\"}}GSE129130. \u200b\n                    KEY RESOURCES TABLEREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERAntibodiesAPC human CD25 Clone BC96BioLegendCat# 302610; RRID: AB_314280biotin conjugated anti-hCD2BD BiosciencesCat# 555325; RRID: AB_395732PE- anti-hCD25 Clone BC96BioLegendCat# 302605; RRID: AB_314275FITC-conjugated anti-CD45R/B220 (clone\nRA3\u20136B2)BD BiosciencesCat# 553088; RRID: AB_394618PE-conjugated anti-CD43 (clone S7)BD BiosciencesCat# 553271: RRID: AB_394748FITC-conjugated anti-CD43 (clone S7)BD BiosciencesCat# 553270; RRID: AB_394747PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD45/B220 (clone\nRA3\u20136B2)BD BiosciencesCat # 552772: RRID: AB_394458allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-IgM\n(clone II/41)BD BiosciencesCat # 550676; RRID: AB_398464PE-conjugated anti-hCD2BD BiosciencesCat# 555327; RRID: AB_395734APC-conjugated anti-hCD2BD BiosciencesCat# 560642; RRID: AB_1727443Anti-SYK (clone D1I5Q)Cell Signaling TechnologyCat# 12358; RRID: AB_2687923Anti-BCLAF1 antibody (A300\u2013608A)Bethyl LaboratoriesCat# A300\u2013608A; RRID: AB_513581PU.1 (PA5\u201317505)Thermo FisherCat# 17505; RRID: AB_?0989141Anti-GAPDHCell SignalingCat# 5174; RRID: AB_10622025anti-FLAG (clone M2)SigmaCat# 1804; RRID: AB_262044HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgGCell SignalingCat # 7074; RRID: AB_2099233HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGCell SignalingCat# 7065; RRID: AB_10890862Anti-HAAbcamCat# ab9110; RRID: AB_307019control rabbit IgGMilliporeCat# 06\u2013371; RRID: AB_390146Chemicals, Peptides, and\nRecombinant ProteinsSuperScriptIILife Technologies18064\u2013014Brilliant II SYBR GreenAgilent600828Interleukin-7 (IL-7)Miltenyi Biotec130\u2013098\u2013222ImatinibNovartis00078\u20130438\u201315Lipofectamine 2000Life Technologies11668\u2013019PEG-8000FisherP156\u2013500SequabreneSigmaS 2667ATM inhibitor KU55933Tocris3544Micrococcal nucleaseNew England BiolabsM0247SCritical Commercial AssaysRNeasyQIAGEN74104Protein A DynabeadsThermo Fisher Scientific10002DQIAquick PCR purification kitQIAGEN28106Anti-biotin magnetic beadsMiltenyi Biotec130\u2013090\u2013485Anti-hCD25 magnetic beadsMiltenyi Biotec130\u2013092\u2013983Anti-hCD2 magnetic beadsMiltenyi Biotec130\u2013091\u2013114High sensitivity DNA ChiPsAgilent Technologies5067\u20134626Magnetic Separation columnsMiltenyi Biotec130\u2013042\u2013201ECLPierce32209ECL PrimeGE HealthcareRPN2232FITC BrdU Flow KitBD Bioscience559619Deposited DataChiP-seqThis paperNCBI GEO #: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE129130\",\"term_id\":\"129130\"}}GSE129130 (subseries:\n{\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE129124\",\"term_id\":\"129124\"}}GSE129124)RNA-seqThis paperNCBI GEO #: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE129130\",\"term_id\":\"129130\"}}GSE129130 (subseries:\n{\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE129129\",\"term_id\":\"129129\"}}GSE129129)Experimental Models: Cell\nLinesArt\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl pre-B\ncellBarry SleckmanN/ARag\u2212/\u2212:Bcl2 abl pre-B\ncellBarry SleckmanN/APlatECell Biolabs, IncRV-101Experimental Models:\nOrganisms/StrainsMb1-cre\n(Cd79atm1(cre)Reth) miceJackson Laboratory20505Bclaf1f/f\nmiceKOMP RepositoryBclaf1tm1aRag1\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2Barry SleckmanN/AArt\u2212/\u2212:\u03bcIgh:Bcl2Barry SleckmanN/AB6.Cg-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/JJackson Laboratory5703Spicigfp/igfpKenneth MurphyN/AOligonucleotidesPrimers are listed in Table S5This paperN/ARecombinant DNAMSCV-hCD2-mir30 vectorMark SchlisselN/ApFLRU-TRE-FLAG-HA-PU.1-Ubc-rtTA-IRES-Thy1.2This paperN/ApFLRU-TRE-FLAG-HA-SPIC-Ubc-rtTA-IRES-Thy1.2This paperN/ApCMV-VSV-GStewart et\nal., 2003Addgene #8454pCMV-d8.2R dvprStewart et\nal., 2003Addgene #8455Software and AlgorithmsBowtie v. 1.1.2Langmead and\nSalzberg, 2012http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml\nRRID:SCR_005476MACS version 2Zhang et al.,\n2008http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/\nRRID:SCR_013291Galaxy V18.09Afgan et al.,\n2016https://usegalaxy.org RRID:SCR_006281GenomicRangesLawrence et\nal., 2013https://www.bioconductor.org/packages//2.10/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html\nRRID:SCR_000025Bedtools V2.25.0Quinlan and\nHall, 2010https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2.
