Organizing pneumonia is known to be able to develop into interstitial fibrosis and increase mortality risk as well, but it is often responsive to steroids.8, 9\nCurrently, it remains unknown as to whether patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS, in comparison to those with non-COVID-19-induced ARDS, have slower or defective resolution of pulmonary inflammation characterized by interstitial abnormalities such as fibrotic-like changes and/or organizing pneumonia.Therefore, we will evaluate the presence of persistent or new-onset diffuse pulmonary opacities in these patients, as well as fibrotic-like changes with or without an organizing pneumonia pattern within the first week of ARDS diagnosis. Finally, in patients with COVID-19, we will analyze risk factors associated with the presence of fibrotic-like changes, and determine any possible association between these findings and clinical outcomes.We included all consecutive patients admitted to our institution for COVID-19- and non-COVID-19-induced ARDS10 between June 15th, 2019 and March 28th, 2020. Patients who presented with one of the following criteria were excluded from the study: mechanical ventilation >72\u00a0h before inclusion; PaO2/FiO2\n\u00a0>\u00a0300 within 24\u00a0h of inclusion; expected decisions to have life-sustaining treatment withdrawn in <24\u00a0h; refusal of study participation on behalf of relatives; and the presence of previously known interstitial lung disease. Patients were divided into two groups according to the cause of ARDS (i.e., COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts).We compared the presence of persistent or new-onset diffuse pulmonary opacities in chest X-rays (CXRs) beginning day 7 of ARDS diagnosis to death or intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Furthermore, we assessed the presence and severity of pulmonary fibrotic-like changes and organizing pneumonia pattern in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans during the same time frame. Patients with COVID-19-related ARDS were further divided into those who presented with fibrotic-like changes and those who did not. We analyzed risk factors for its development and compared clinical outcomes between both groups.Attending doctors ordered thoracic CT scans without following any research protocol. Time (days) from ARDS diagnosis to CT scan was recorded. CXRs were performed every 24\u201348\u00a0h per protocol until ICU discharge. A pulmonologist and experienced thoracic radiologist independently and blindly assessed CT features to diagnose fibrotic-like changes and organizing pneumonia pattern. Additionally, two pulmonologists independently and blindly assessed CXRs to diagnose persistent or new-onset diffuse pulmonary opacities. Agreement between evaluators was assessed for CT scans and CXRs using Cohen's Kappa. After the first independent analysis, and without unblinding the cohort, evaluators met to discuss the radiological images on which there was a disagreement.Persistent or new onset diffuse pulmonary opacities were defined as the presence of any of the following criteria between day 7 since ARDS diagnosis and death or ICU discharge: (1) persistence of \u226550% of radiological opacities found at ARDS diagnosis (2) an increase in or new-onset bilateral pulmonary opacities between day 7 since ARDS diagnosis and death or ICU discharge. An increase in radiological opacities had to be identified in both lungs. New-onset unilateral opacities did not meet this definition.Fibrotic-like changes were defined as the presence of traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, parenchymal bands and/or honeycombing in thoracic CT scans performed between day 7 since ARDS diagnosis and death or ICU discharge.11 Extension of fibrotic-like changes in thoracic CT scans was classified into one of three categories based on visual assessment and the percentage of bilateral lung involvement: mild (<25%), moderate (25%\u201350%) and severe (>50%).An organizing pneumonia pattern was defined as peribronchovascular consolidations with perilobular distribution and/or the reverse halo sign between day 7 since ARDS diagnosis and death or ICU discharge.11 Further, in the same manner, we assessed 30- and 90-day, hospital and ICU mortality, as well as ventilator- and ICU-free days, hospital and ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration and other epidemiological variables (Supplementary Methods).The study was approved by the Institution's Internal Review Board (HCB/2018/0231). For additional details on the method, see the online supplement.From June 15th, 2019 to March 28th, 2020, 122 patients with COVID-19- and non-COVID-19-induced ARDS were admitted to our interdepartmental ICUs. Twenty-one patients were excluded from the study (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of the 101 patients included in the analysis, 81 had sequential CXRs beginning day 7 since ARDS diagnosis to death or ICU discharge. In addition, and within the same time frame, fifty patients underwent a thoracic CT scan. Table 1\nshows the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients. Patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS (n\n\u00a0=\u00a024, 71%) presented with a higher incidence of fibrotic-like changes when compared to those with non-COVID-19-induced ARDS (n\n\u00a0=\u00a02, 12%) (P\n\u00a0=\u00a0.001). All patients with COVID-19 and fibrotic-like changes also presented with an organizing pneumonia pattern in thoracic CT scans. With respect to assessments of CT scan features, agreement between the thoracic radiologist and pulmonologist was 0.64; regarding assessments of CXRs, agreement between pulmonologists was 0.73.Table 1Epidemiology, Clinical Characteristics, Radiology and Microbiology of 101 Patients With ARDS, Presenting With or Without COVID-19.Non-COVID-19-inducedARDSn\u00a0=\u00a040COVID-19-induced ARDSn\u00a0=\u00a061P-valueSex, male/female, n (%)26 (65)/14 (35)42 (69)/19 (31).68Age, years, median (Q1; Q3)64 (50; 72)65 (56; 74).45Smoking, n (%)10 (29)5 (10).01Alcohol use, n (%)9 (28)7 (17).23Ischemic heart disease, n (%)1 (3)4 (7)1Congestive heart failure, n (%)2 (5)1 (2).56Peripheral vascular disease, n (%)0 (0)1 (2)1Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, n (%)1 (3)4 (7).64Chronic renal failure, n (%)3 (8)7 (12).73COPD, n (%)5 (13)7 (12)1Liver disease, n (%)12 (30)2 (3).006Diabetes mellitus, n (%)7 (18)11 (18).48Solid neoplasm, n (%)2 (5)0 (0).008Hematologic neoplasm, n (%)2 (5)2 (3).64Solid metastases, n (%)2 (5)0 (0).15AIDS, n (%)0 (0)2 (3).51Dementia, n (%)1 (3)0 (0).39Charlson Comorbidity Index, median (Q1; Q3)4 (0; 5)2 (1; 4).25APACHE-II upon ICU admission, median (Q1; Q3)26 (17; 29)13 (11; 17)<.001SOFA upon ARDS diagnosis, median (Q1; Q3)11 (8; 15)7 (6; 9)<.001Prone position, n (%)7 (18)13 (23).56Neuromuscular blockade, n (%)10 (26)27 (47).038ECMO, n (%)3 (8)0 (0).062Corticosteroid use upon ARDS diagnosis, n (%)20 (56)25 (43).24Time from hospital to ICU admission days, median (Q1; Q3)1 (0; 2)1 (0; 2).20Time from ICU admission to ETI, days, median (Q1; Q3)2 (1; 3)1 (0; 2).001ARDS risk factor, n (%)\u00a0Pulmonary sepsis21 (54)61 (100)<.001\u00a0Bronchoaspiration10 (26)\u2013\u2013\u00a0Extrapulmonary sepsis5 (13)\u2013\u2013\u00a0Postoperative1 (3)\u2013\u2013\u00a0Connective tissue disease1 (3)\u2013\u2013\u00a0Trauma1 (3)\u2013\u2013\u00a0Unknown1 (3)\u2013\u2013Radiology, n (%)a,b\u00a0Persistent or new-onset diffuse opacities\u00a0>\u00a07 daysa8 (29)25 (47).10\u00a0Fibrotic-like changesb2 (12)24 (71)<.001\u00a0Mildb1 (6)3 (9).002\u00a0Moderateb0 (0)8 (24).002\u00a0Extensiveb1 (6)12 (36).002\u00a0Organizing pneumonia patternb0 (0)24 (71)<.001\u00a0Time from ARDS to CT scan, days, median (Q1; Q3)15 (11; 18)24 (14; 36).054Microbiology, n (%)\u00a0VA-LTRI9 (23)25 (43).03\u00a0VAP6 (15)9 (15).97\u00a0VAT5 (13)18 (30).046\u00a0Candida spp. respiratory colonization5 (13)7 (12)1Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and ventilatory parameters upon ARDS diagnosis, median (Q1; Q3)\u00a0PaO2/FiO2163 (120; 218)175 (147; 232).14\u00a0Ventilatory ratio1.83 (1.59; 2.21)1.91 (1.57; 2.15).92\u00a0Tidal volume, mL/IBW6.61 (6.15; 7.89)6.80 (6.30; 7.45).67\u00a0PEEP, cmH2O9 (7; 10)13 (11; 14)<.001\u00a0Positive end-inspiratory pressure, cmH2O23 (22; 26)24 (21; 26).95\u00a0Driving pressure, cmH2O14 (11; 18)11 (9; 13)<.001\u00a0Mechanical power, J/min22 (17; 29)23 (18; 28).58\u00a0Respiratory system compliance, TV\u00a0*\u00a0cmH2O\u2212130 (26; 35)39 (31; 50).002Open in a separate windowaX-ray available for 81 patients from day 7 since ARDS diagnosis to ICU discharge.

Those patients who later developed fibrotic-like changes or an extensive manifestation of these changes had higher dead space (ventilatory ratio) on day 3 since the ARDS diagnosis. In addition, we more frequently identified ventilation with higher tidal volume and positive end-inspiratory pressure upon ARDS diagnosis in patients who later presented with fibrotic-like changes or its extensive manifestation, respectively. Likewise, administering mechanical ventilation with a higher tidal volume and driving pressure on day 3 since ARDS diagnosis was associated with the development of fibrotic-like changes and the extensive manifestation of such changes thereafter.Table 2Gas Exchange, Respiratory Mechanics and Ventilatory Parameters of 34 Patients With COVID-19-induced ARDS According to the Presence or Absence of Pulmonary Fibrotic-like Changes and Its Extensive Form.COVID-19-induced ARDS With Fibrotic-Like Changesn\u00a0=\u00a024COVID-19-induced ARDS Without Fibrotic-Like Changesn\u00a0=\u00a010COVID-19-induced ARDS With Extensive Fibrotic-like Changesn\u00a0=\u00a012P-valueFibrotic-like Changes vs. NoneP-valueExtensive Fibrotic-like Changes vs. NoneGas exchange, respiratory mechanics and ventilatory parameters upon ARDS diagnosis, median (Q1; Q3)\u00a0PaO2/FiO2177 (124; 232)170 (111; 191)183 (115; 237).34.42\u00a0Ventilatory ratio1.87 (1.68; 2.15)1.81 (1.28; 2.19)1.91 (1.70; 2.11).54.79\u00a0Tidal volume, mL/IBW7.13 (6.39; 7.59)6.42 (5.71; 7.04)6.84 (6.34; 7.65).042.14\u00a0PEEP, cmH2O13 (12; 14)12 (10; 13)13 (12; 14).16.28\u00a0Positive end-inspiratory pressure, cmH2O24 (21; 26)23 (21;25)25 (24; 27).19.044\u00a0Driving pressure, cmH2O11 (9; 13)11 (10; 13)12 (11; 15).69.25\u00a0Mechanical power, J/min22 (18; 28)22 (19; 33)21 (17; 24).66.36\u00a0Respiratory system compliance, TV\u00a0*\u00a0cmH2O\u2212140 (30; 53)39 (36; 45)35 (24; 43).67.23Gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and ventilatory parameters on day 3 since ARDS diagnosis, median (Q1; Q3)\u00a0PaO2/FiO2220 (155; 253)200 (157; 222)209 (162; 260).58.79\u00a0Ventilatory ratio2.03 (1.79; 2.26)1.56 (1.37; 1.94)1.98 (1.80; 2.39).011.015\u00a0Tidal volume, mL/IBW7.50 (6.81; 7.92)6.46 (5.71; 6.76)7.51 (6.85; 7.82).005.01\u00a0PEEP, cmH2O12 (10; 13)12 (10;13)12 (9; 13).82.66\u00a0Positive end-inspiratory pressure, cmH2O23 (22; 26)23 (16; 24)24 (22; 27).11.09\u00a0Driving pressure, cmH2O11 (10; 13)10 (6; 11)12 (11; 15).055.059\u00a0Mechanical power, J/min23.37 (21.1; 29.9)26.38 (18.7; 34.1)22.12 (16.7; 28.5).64.46\u00a0Respiratory system compliance, TV\u00a0*\u00a0cmH2O\u2212137 (31; 46)50 (41; 70)36 (27; 46).08.11Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; IBW: ideal body weight; mL: milliliters; PEEP: positive end-expiratory pressure; TV: tidal volume.Clinical outcomes from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-induced ARDS according to the presence or absence of fibrotic-like changes are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, as well as Supplementary Fig. 2.The main findings of this study are the following: first, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS more frequently presented with fibrotic-like changes and an organizing pneumonia pattern than those with non-COVID-19-induced ARDS. Second, higher dead space ventilation (i.e., ventilatory ratio), tidal volume, end-inspiratory pressure and driving pressure during the early course of ARDS were associated with the development of fibrotic-like changes in patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Finally, the manifestation of fibrotic-like changes in its extensive form occurred in 36% of patients, being associated with longer mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.Pulmonary fibrotic-like changes are a radiological manifestation of a defective healing process of the lung, which is related to higher mortality.12, 13 As in ARDS caused by other risk factors, exudative or fibroproliferative DAD is already known to be the main histological pattern in COVID-19-induced ARDS.14 In our study, we identified an organizing pneumonia pattern in all patients with COVID-19 who also presented with fibrotic-like changes. The fact that DAD can have regions with organizing pneumonia or acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia has been well-established.14 However, it remains unknown as to whether COVID-19-induced ARDS includes larger lung areas of these two histological patterns (organizing pneumonia or acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia). Our findings raise concerns about whether SARS-CoV-2 more frequently elicits a transition from inflammation to an organizing process. Further, our findings invite the consideration of whether steroids would confer a benefit even if DAD is present as well.We found that, during the early course of ARDS, several variables related to VILI (i.e., tidal volume, positive end-inspiratory pressure and driving pressure) were associated with the development of fibrotic-like changes. Interestingly, this association was identified even when all of these parameters were within the range that is currently believed to be protective.The degree of impairment in oxygenation at days 1 and 3 since ARDS diagnosis was not related to the development of fibrotic-like changes. Conversely, on day 3, higher dead space ventilation was found in patients who developed extensive and non-extensive fibrotic-like changes. In comparison to oxygenation, dead space ventilation is a better marker of lung inhomogeneities and is strongly related to a higher mortality risk.15\nThis study has several limitations. First, due to the observational design of the study, there was no specific protocol to perform CT scans. A selection bias may therefore have overestimated the presence of fibrotic-like changes in COVID-19-induced ARDS. Indeed, patients with COVID-19 underwent more thoracic CT scans and at a different time point than those without COVID-19. Second, as a result of the low sample size of patients with available CT scans, a large type II error may have occurred. Third, organizing pneumonia is a pathological diagnosis, and information provided by CT scans should be interpreted with caution.
