To determine how the two processes are coordinated throughout S phase, we characterize both processes together at high resolution. We find that transcription occurs during DNA replication, with transcription start sites (TSSs) not fully replicated along with surrounding regions and remaining under-replicated until late in the cell cycle. TSSs undergo completion of DNA replication specifically when cells enter mitosis, when RNA polymerase II is removed. Intriguingly, G2/M DNA synthesis occurs at high frequency in unperturbed cell culture, but it is not associated with increased DNA damage and is fundamentally separated from mitotic DNA synthesis. TSSs duplicated in G2/M are characterized by a series of specific features, including high levels of antisense transcription, making them difficult to duplicate during S phase.Keywords: RNA polymerase II transcription, DNA replication, G2/M DNA synthesis, transcription-associated genome instability, Replication origins, DNA damage Graphical AbstractOpen in a separate window IntroductionA large body of evidence has established that RNA transcription can impair DNA replication progression, inducing replication stress and DNA damage (Brewer and Fangman, 1988; Deshpande and Newlon, 1996; Huertas and Aguilera, 2003; Helmrich et\u00a0al., 2011; Alzu et\u00a0al., 2012; Akamatsu and Kobayashi, 2015). Defective transcription caused by deregulation of transcription factors correlates with even greater DNA damage levels (Gaillard and Aguilera, 2016; Hamperl and Cimprich, 2016). Indeed, transcription factors are identified as major drivers of genome instability in human cells (Paulsen et\u00a0al., 2009). Transcription-associated genome instability is often linked to a specific transcriptional defect, including (1) formation or persistence of RNA-DNA hybrids (so-called R-loops; Huertas and Aguilera, 2003), (2) increased topological constraints (Bermejo et\u00a0al., 2009; Tuduri et\u00a0al., 2009), and (3) accumulation of stalled/paused RNA polymerase (Dutta et\u00a0al., 2011; Saponaro et\u00a0al., 2014). To avoid head-to-head collisions between the transcription and replication machineries, bacterial genomes have transcription of major genes in a codirectional orientation with the replication fork emanating from the replication origin (Brewer, 1988). However, such organization is not possible in higher eukaryotes because of the inherent variability of cell-type-specific transcription and replication programs (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2010). One possible solution to avoid conflicts would be to keep the two processes separated spatially (different parts of the genome used by the two processes) or temporally (different moments when a cell transcribes from when it replicates). Regarding the spatial separation, previous studies examining the nuclear distribution of transcription and replication sites have shown contrasting results, with some showing overlap between transcription and DNA synthesis (Hassan et\u00a0al., 1994) and others showing spatial separation (Wansink et\u00a0al., 1994; Wei et\u00a0al., 1998). Regarding temporal separation, while DNA replication occurs during S phase, transcription can occur in any cell-cycle stage (Liang et\u00a0al., 2015). In particular, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is responsible for the transcription of protein-coding genes and the majority of the genome (Djebali et\u00a0al., 2012), transcribes replication machinery factors and histones specifically during S phase (van der Meijden et\u00a0al., 2002). Moreover, replication timing and distribution of replication origins are affected by RNAPII transcription, with early-replicated regions and replication origins enriched around transcribed genes (Cayrou et\u00a0al., 2015; Petryk et\u00a0al., 2016). Nevertheless, it is unclear how this reciprocal relationship is arranged in mammalian cells, despite its importance for genome stability and direct links to several human diseases (Gaillard and Aguilera, 2016).For this reason, we set out to characterize both transcription and replication throughout S phase with a combination of genomic approaches. We uncovered that (1) replication of a transcribed gene leads to a transient shut down in transcription activity; (2) replication of transcription start sites (TSSs) is delayed compared to nearby regions; (3) DNA synthesis across TSSs is completed when cells prepare for mitosis in 20% of cells; (4) G2/M DNA synthesis is not coinciding with sites of DNA damage, does not require canonical DNA damage repair pathways, and is different from mitotic DNA synthesis; and (5) TSSs that undergo G2/M DNA synthesis are conserved among different cell lines and characterized among other features by high levels of TSS-associated antisense transcription. Our findings provide an insight into how DNA replication and RNAPII transcription affect one another, with important consequences for completion of the DNA replication program and genome stability maintenance. ResultsGenomic approaches to characterize transcription and replication during S phasePreviously, several groups analyzed whether sites of transcription and replication overlapped by immunofluorescence, presenting conflicting results (Wansink et\u00a0al., 1994; Hassan et\u00a0al., 1994; Wei et\u00a0al., 1998). As these assays were not able to assess whether transcription and replication could affect each other, we decided to investigate the coordination between transcription and replication using a combination of genome-wide approaches. Human immortalized fibroblasts (BJ-hTERT) were synchronized by serum starvation for 26\u00a0h in G0/G1, reentering cell cycle once released in complete medium (Figure\u00a01A). To monitor entry of cells in S phase, we analyzed the incorporation of the nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) as a proxy for DNA synthesis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells started to enter S phase 14\u00a0h post-release, as evidenced by increased incorporation of BrdU by FACS, corresponding to the G1/S transition point. Entry and progression of cells through the S phase was highly reproducible, with nearly 70% of cells in S phase by the mid-S time point (Figure\u00a01A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01A system for analyzing transcription-replication coordination(A) Experimental design schematic and FACS analysis of propidium iodide (PI) and BrdU to monitor S-phase progression, with quantification of cells number in each box (bottom left, G0/G1 phase; top, S phase; bottom right, G2 phase; n\u00a0= 3).(B) Representative genomic view of BrdU-seq (in blue) and Chr-RNA-seq (in red) on the long arm of chromosome 7, with a 95-Mb view at all time points.(C) Single-gene analysis of BrdU incorporation levels as percentage of the input at each time point over the indicated genes; n\u00a0= 3.(D) Nascent transcription levels as relative ratio to G1/S compared to the fold changes measured by Chr-RNA-seq; n\u00a0= 3 for RT-PCR, n\u00a0= 2 for Chr-RNA-seq.

Pull-down of BrdU-labeled DNA followed by next-generation sequencing identified replicated DNA within each time point. Combining the BrdU-seq time points together as previously described (Rausch et\u00a0al., 2018) we obtained a replication timing profile from early to late S phase (Figure\u00a0S1A). Our synchronization and release strategy was highly reproducible, as shown by FACS analysis (Figure\u00a01A), overlap of the replication timing profiles for two biological replicates (Figure\u00a0S1A), and similarity with previously published Repli-seq profiles (Figure\u00a0S1B).To analyze transcription activity, we fractionate the BrdU-labeled cells to purify the chromatin fraction that contains transcriptionally engaged phosphorylated serine 5 RNAPII (hereafter Ser5-RNAPII; Figure\u00a0S1C). We then extracted RNA from this fraction and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of chromatin-bound RNA (hereafter Chr-RNA-seq). Gene Ontology analysis of the Chr-RNA-seq at the G1/S time point identified 13,473 transcripts with a read per million (RPM) \u22651, with cells primed for replication indicated by the transcription of DNA replication factors (van der Meijden et\u00a0al., 2002) (p value\u00a0= 1.1E-18; Table S1). We used this time point as reference in our analysis, investigating changes in transcription activity during S phase for 12,425 transcripts with RPM \u22651 in all time points. Interestingly, we found that overall transcription activity was not radically affected throughout S phase, with mainly cell-cycle-regulated genes changing transcription levels (Table S2; Chr-RNA-seq replicates correlations; Table S3). A snapshot of the long arm of chromosome 7 is presented in Figure\u00a01B, showing together BrdU-seq in blue and Chr-RNA-seq in red.We determined when replication passes through a transcribed gene as the time point with the highest BrdU level over such gene. Combining all datasets together, we confirmed that transcribed genes were preferentially replicated early (Hansen et\u00a0al., 2010), as >70% of all active transcripts were replicated by the early/mid-S time point, and only 6.5% replicated in the last time point (Figure\u00a0S1D). Overall, early-S-phase replicated genes were also more transcribed and shorter (Figure\u00a0S1E).We validated our experimental approach by single-gene analysis for both DNA replication (BrdU-IP [BrdU-immunoprecipitation]) and pre-mRNA levels in independent repeats. For the BrdU-IP, we selected two genes previously shown to be early replicated in BJ-hTERT cells (Marchal et\u00a0al., 2018) and another three whose replication peaked in other time points from our genomic analysis. We could prove significant differences in DNA replication levels across these genes in different time points, paralleling the DNA replication levels obtained quantifying BrdU-seq levels over such genes (Figures 1C and S1F). For transcription activity, we assessed nascent transcription levels by RT-PCR with primers designed across intron-exon junctions for the genes with the greatest fold changes throughout our kinetic plus two histone genes specifically transcribed in S phase. Also in this case, the single-gene analysis showed significant changes in transcription activity between time points, similar to the fold changes measured by Chr-RNA-seq (Figures 1D and S1G). A small proportion of cells is delayed for their cell-cycle entry (top left corner of late S/G2 in Figure\u00a01A); hence, we assessed the transcription contribution of these cells. We monitored transcription activity by incorporation of the ribonucleotide analog ethynyluridine (EU) followed by Click-iT reaction by FACS in all time points compared to asynchronous cells. When analyzing EU incorporation specifically in G0/G1 cells by DNA content, we found that in all time points EU incorporation is significantly lower compared to an asynchronous population of cells (Figure\u00a0S1H). On the contrary, when analyzing cells in G2 by DNA content, we found that once cells reenter the cell cycle and reach G2, transcription activity is the same of an untreated population of cells (Figure\u00a0S1H). This is further supported by the fact that transcription levels for MCM6 and ELN are 13- and 27-fold reduced compared to the G1/S time point (Figures 1D and S1G).Finally, based on the replication timing, we determined whether the leading fork was progressing along the Watson or the Crick strand of the DNA; leading replication forks move from peaks in the replication timing profile (indicating replication initiation regions) to troughs (indicating replication termination regions; Figure\u00a0S1I). As gene transcription occurs on the Watson or the Crick strand, from TSSs to transcription termination sites (TTSs) (Figure\u00a0S1I), we were able to define the reciprocal directionality of transcription and leading replication fork progression, determining whether these were in a codirectional (transcription and replication moving in the same direction) or a head-to-head (transcription and replication moving toward each other) conformation. Analyzing the frequency of the directionality of transcribed genes with the leading-strand replication fork, we found the same frequency in genes being codirectional (42.18%) or head to head (42.85%). The remaining transcripts were defined as \u201ctransition\u201d (14.96%), as not uniquely replicated across in one direction, hence with a transition point in DNA replication direction (Figure\u00a0S1J). This transition could be due to either the activation of replication origins or the presence of replication termination sites. Transition genes were significantly longer than those in the other groups (Figure\u00a0S1K), in agreement with previous data whereby long genes often contain an origin of replication downstream the TSS and a replication termination site inside the gene body (Pourkarimi et\u00a0al., 2016; Chen et\u00a0al., 2019). When comparing transcription levels of genes based on their directionality, we found no significant difference between codirectional and head-to-head genes (Figure\u00a0S1K) overall or at specific time points (data not shown). Similarly, the directionality between transcribed genes and DNA replication did not change throughout S phase (data not shown).Having established that our experimental setup is sensitive and reproducible, we investigated how transcription and replication impact each other during S phase.Transient shutdown of nascent transcription when genes are replicatedAlthough our Chr-RNA-seq showed no radical changes in transcription during S phase, we analyzed specifically how DNA replication of a gene affects its transcription activity. To achieve this, we monitored nascent transcription quantifying Chr-RNA-seq levels only over introns, as exonic signal could be derived from mature mRNA still bound to the chromatin (Tilgner et\u00a0al., 2012). We first analyzed the first time point, observing on average a 20% reduction in transcription activity specifically when genes are replicated, independently of directionality (Figure\u00a02A). This transcription shutdown was almost completely recovered by the following time point (Figure\u00a02A). Importantly, transcription shutdown was not detectable if we quantified Chr-RNA-seq over the whole gene, indicating that the shutdown was detectable only when assessing nascent transcription (Figure\u00a0S2A). By analyzing nascent transcription over single genes, we confirmed that when genes are replicated, there is a transient reduction in transcription activity (Figure\u00a02B), even for genes that increase their transcription throughout S/G2 (Figure\u00a0S2B). When reanalyzing these data clustered by gene length, we found that independently of directionality, longer genes presented a slightly more pronounced shutdown and delayed recovery in transcription activity than shorter genes (Figure\u00a02C). Furthermore, by analyzing the average Chr-RNA-seq profile around the TSS, we found that transcription was still active when early-S genes were replicated, explaining the quick recovery (Figure\u00a02D). In agreement, rapid recovery of transcription after replication has been previously reported in mouse embryonic stem cells (Stewart-Morgan et\u00a0al., 2019). Moreover, when we reanalyzed ChOR-seq (Ser5-RNAPII chromatin occupancy after replication) data from Stewart-Morgan et\u00a0al. (2019), we found that RNAPII persisted at TSSs in nascent synthesized DNA, more on genes >100 kb than those <5 kb (Figures S2C\u2013S2E).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Transient transcription shutdown when genes are replicated(A) Quantification of Chr-RNA-seq levels over introns at the indicated time points, as fold change to G1/S.

The analysis includes 514 genes in early/mid-S, 144 genes in mid-S, 178 genes in mid-/late S, and all 716 genes in late S/G2; paired t test analysis.(F) As in (D) but specifically over the genes highlighted in (E).Box whiskers plots with line at the median, Mann-Whitney t test; ns, not significant; \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.For the later time points, we identified the genes that showed reduced transcription activity when replicated, generally recovering transcription activity by the following time point (Figure\u00a02E). These genes were enriched for shorter transcripts within those replicated in each time point (Figure\u00a0S2G), suggesting that replication of longer genes may take longer than one time point. We could also detect a reduction of transcription activity for all genes replicated in the late-S/G2 time point compared to the previous one (Figure\u00a02E). Importantly, despite the dip in transcription activity, at all time points, these genes showed persistent levels of transcription around the TSS region (Figures 2F and S2H).Taken together, these data demonstrate that DNA replication has a transient impact on transcription only when genes get replicated throughout S phase. We hypothesize that this is due to maintenance of RNAPII near the TSS also during replication to restart transcription once replication has traversed (Figures 2D and 2F).Paucity of DNA replication around TSSs of transcribed genesSince our data highlighted that transcription persists while genes were replicated, we analyzed how this impacted DNA replication. Strikingly, we found that TSSs of transcribed genes exhibited decreased levels of BrdU signal, suggesting that they were under-replicated (Figure\u00a03A). This was specifically due to a decrease in BrdU levels and independent of directionality (Figures S3A and S3B). Other transcription pausing sites, such as TTSs and exons, showed no visible effect on the BrdU-seq profile, irrespective of directionality, while enhancers showed only a very small decreased BrdU signal in the early/mid-S and mid-S time points (Figures S3C\u2013S3E and data not shown). The size of this gap correlated with gene lengths, with longer transcripts correlating with larger and deeper gaps than shorter genes, but transcription levels did not affect gap size, except for the lowest transcribed genes (Figure\u00a03B). To test whether gaps were a consequence of our synchronization strategy, we performed a Repli-seq experiment. Exponentially growing cells were pulsed with BrdU for 30\u00a0min and sorted in five fractions according to DNA content (Figure\u00a0S3F). We validated that Repli-seq fractions recapitulate replication timings identified from our single-gene analysis of Figure\u00a01C (Figure\u00a0S3G). Importantly, also analyzing the Repli-seq samples, we found a gap across the TSSs of transcribed genes in all fractions (Figure\u00a03C), correlating with timing of replication of the transcribed genes from our Chr-RNA-seq and gene length (Figures S3H and S3I). Equally, we could identify the presence of under-replicated DNA at TSSs in EdU-seq datasets from RPE and U2OS cells released from mitotic shake-off (Macheret and Halazonetis, 2018; Figure\u00a0S3J).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03TSSs of transcribed genes remain under-replicated throughout S phase(A) Average metagene profile of BrdU-seq levels normalized to input DNA in early S at TSSs \u00b12.5 kb for all genes, transcribed genes, or not transcribed genes.(B) As for (A) for genes replicated in early S according to Figure\u00a0S1D, separated in four groups by gene length or transcription levels.(C) As for (A) for transcribed and not transcribed genes in all five fractions of the Repli-seq.(D) As for (A) for genes >100 kb replicated in early S in all time points.(E) BrdU incorporation at TSSs and in the gene body for the indicated genes in all time points.

Importantly, gaps that formed at the TSS of genes >100 kb replicated in early S persisted over all other time points (Figure\u00a03D). We could verify that the rate of BrdU incorporation over single genes was lower around the TSS when compared with the gene body (compare black bars with blue ones in Figure\u00a03E), even though transcription was relatively stable at both positions throughout the kinetic (compare red and purple bars in Figure\u00a03E). In the SMURF1 gene replicated in early S, we detected a significant increase in DNA synthesis specifically across the TSS at the late-S/G2 time point (Figure\u00a03E). Therefore, we analyzed at TSSs of genes >100 kb replicated in early S the relative enrichment of DNA synthesis of the later time points compared to early S, detecting an increase of DNA synthesis specifically at TSSs at the later time points (Figure\u00a03F). Together, these findings suggest that DNA replication across the TSS is less efficient and delayed compared to the rest of the gene.Next, we investigated whether RNAPII presence was the cause of the BrdU gaps at TSSs. Persistence of the RNAPII near TSS regions is controlled by promoter proximal pausing (PPP; Rahl et\u00a0al., 2010). To assess how much the RNAPII is promoter proximal paused at TSSs, we calculated the level of PPP release ratio (P3R2; Figure\u00a0S3K) using previously published GRO-seq data for BJ-hTERT (Li et\u00a0al., 2018). We found that transcripts with greater P3R2 levels (i.e., more RNAPII on the TSS than in the gene body, indicative of more PPP) tended to have also larger and deeper gaps than those with lower P3R2 (Figure\u00a03G), correlating with longer genes being also more promoter proximal paused (Figure\u00a0S3K).When combined with the findings above, these data indicate that persistence of RNAPII during gene replication near the TSS correlates with a concomitant under-replication of these sites.Duplication of TSSs requires G2/M DNA synthesisOur data highlight that DNA replication across TSSs is postponed compared to nearby regions, showing some evidence of DNA synthesis in late-S/G2 phase. DNA synthesis can still occur up until mitosis and is enhanced following DNA replication stress (Minocherhomji et\u00a0al., 2015; Maya-Mendoza et\u00a0al., 2018). In parallel, RNAPII is largely removed from the chromatin in G2/M when cells enter mitosis (Liang et\u00a0al., 2015). Hence, we hypothesized that some of the sites where G2/M DNA synthesis (hereafter G-MiDS) occurs may well be TSSs. We postulated that altering RNAPII levels at the TSS might affect G-MiDS levels. To test this, we analyzed the proportion of G2/M cells (positive for phospho-Ser10 H3, hereafter pS10-H3) that still underwent DNA synthesis, monitored by the incorporation of the nucleotide analog ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) followed by Click-iT reaction (Figure\u00a04A). Cells were synchronized in G2 with the CDK1 inhibitor Ro3306 for 16\u00a0h following our standard synchronization strategy, released in EdU for 30\u00a0min to label sites of DNA synthesis, and immunofluorescenced with pS10-H3 to identify G2/M cells. In parallel, we depleted two factors crucial for PPP, NELFA and SUPT5H, part of the negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) complexes (Figure\u00a0S4A). RNAi of these factors reduces RNAPII persistence at the TSS, moving it toward the gene body (Rahl et\u00a0al., 2010; Fitz et\u00a0al., 2018). In control (CTR) small interfering RNA (siRNA) cells, we observed that ~20% of cells were double positive for pS10-H3/EdU, suggesting a high level of late non-S-phase DNA synthesis (Figure\u00a04A). In agreement with our hypothesis, knockdown (KD) of either NELFA or SUPTH5 reduced the frequency of pS10-H3/EdU-positive cells to 12.8% and 13.1%, respectively (Figure\u00a04A). Moreover, treating cells in early S phase for 1\u00a0h with 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a CDK9 inhibitor that accumulates RNAPII near the TSS (Saponaro et\u00a0al., 2014), increased the frequency of G-MiDS-positive cells to 27% from 20.9% of the CTR DMSO-treated cells (Figure\u00a04B). Altogether, these data suggest that persistence of RNAPII near the TSS affects G-MiDS levels. Given this correlation, we decided to sequence G-MiDS sites.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Persistence of RNAPII at TSSs prevents timely replication in S phase(A) Immunofluorescence for pS10-H3 (green) for G2/M-mitotic cells, EdU Click-iT for DNA synthesis (red), and DAPI (blue) for nuclei staining.

We identified hotspot sites of DNA synthesis by calling BrdU peaks in the G2/M sample using a bioinformatic tool. We also identified sites of DNA synthesis in all S-phase time points using the same BrdU peak calling approach and defined G-MiDS-specific sites as peaks not overlapping with those identified in other time points. This approach identified >16,000 G-MiDS sites across the genome, present in both late- and early-replicated regions (Figure\u00a04C). Crucially, these analyses identified DNA synthesis specifically across the TSS of transcribed genes where previously there was a gap (Figures 4D and S4C). Furthermore, we also identified G-MiDS-specific peaks within the first 2 kb from the TSS over 1,306 transcripts belonging to 449 unique genes (Figure\u00a04E).To investigate further whether PPP regulates G-MiDS levels, we performed G-MiDS sequencing following KD of NELFA, as PPP regulation is the only role for the NELF complex in RNAPII transcription (Rahl et\u00a0al., 2010; Fitz et\u00a0al., 2018). Loss of NELFA reduced DNA synthesis levels specifically across the TSS of the 449 G-MiDS hotspots, in agreement with our previous finding (Figures 4F and S4D). We observed the gap at the TSS of these hotspot genes during S-phase time points, with reduced DNA synthesis across TSS in the later time points compared to all transcribed genes (Figure\u00a0S4E). This suggests that once the gap has been formed, cells may wait until G2/M to complete DNA synthesis across some of these TSS. Importantly, the difference in the shape of the profiles in Figure\u00a04D (all transcribed genes) and Figure\u00a04F (G-MiDS hotspots) indicated that G-MiDS across TSSs was more common than just over the hotspot genes identified using the BrdU peak calling strategy. To assess whether G-MiDS could be a response to serum starvation plus Ro3306 treatment, we sorted G2/M cells as above from untreated exponentially growing BJ cells pulsed for 30\u00a0min with BrdU. The profiles confirm a peak of DNA synthesis across TSSs, which was larger across TSSs of G-MiDS hotspots (Figure\u00a04G). Similarly, we sorted G2/M cells also from exponentially growing U2OS cells to assess whether G-MiDS was occurring only in fibroblasts. The profiles show also in this case an enrichment of DNA synthesis across TSSs that is even greater across G-MiDS TSSs, proving that G-MiDS hotspots are conserved across these two different cell lines (Figure\u00a04H and S4F).In concert, these results confirm that completion of DNA synthesis across TSS is a conserved process in G2/M and is linked to the persistence of RNAPII near TSS regions.Origins firing next to TSSs exhibit asymmetric replication fork progressionPrevious data showed that origins of replication are enriched next to TSSs of transcribed genes (Dellino et\u00a0al., 2013; Cayrou et\u00a0al., 2015; Petryk et\u00a0al., 2016; Chen et\u00a0al., 2019). However, our BrdU-seq analysis identified a gap of DNA synthesis across the TSSs of active genes. To determine how under-replicated DNA could occur next to an origin of replication, we reanalyzed data from studies using strand specific Okazaki fragments sequencing (Ok-seq). By analyzing Okazaki fragment levels for both lagging strands departing from the same replication origin, we could compare the efficiency of replication forks departing in the opposite direction. We used datasets from Chen et\u00a0al. (2019), which were generated from immortalized fibroblasts, as DNA replication programs are highly conserved among fibroblasts (Figure\u00a0S5A). Our reanalyses gave the same conclusions as in the Chen et\u00a0al. paper, with origins of replication enriched near the TSSs of transcribed genes >100 kb and preferential arrangement of the replication origins, so that leading forks progress through genes in the same direction of transcription (Figure\u00a05A). However, when we looked more closely at the TSS region, we could see that the positions where the two lagging-strand levels are at their highest were not the same (Figure\u00a05B, black and orange arrows), with one upstream and the other downstream of the TSS. These data suggest that it is specifically the lagging replication fork moving toward the TSS that can be affected by the presence of RNAPII. Indeed, if we analyze Ok-Seq data without strand specificity, we observe a gap across the TSS (Figure\u00a05C). The depth of this gap was smaller than the one observed in our BrdU-Seq, probably because the Chen et\u00a0al. analysis was performed in asynchronous cells, identifying both gap formation at the time of replication and gap filling later during S-G2 phases, as shown in our Figure\u00a03F. Interestingly, the defect in Okazaki fragment synthesis appeared more marked at G-MiDS-hotspot TSSs (Figures 5C and S5B). This agrees with our previous data that showed that once the gap has been formed, cells have to wait for G2/M to complete DNA synthesis across those sites (Figure\u00a0S4E). This uncoupling between the positions of the lagging-strand synthesis start could be observed also in genes of medium length, although to a lesser extent, like for our TSS gap (Figure\u00a0S5C). Importantly, and in agreement with our data, other transcription features like TTSs or enhancers did not show defects in Okazaki fragment distribution (Figures S5D and S5E), even though these have been identified as sites of replication termination or initiation (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Uncoupling of replication forks efficiency at origins of replication near TSSs(A) Average metagene profile for the denotated strand of strand-specific Ok-seq from Chen et\u00a0al.

As above, these data also demonstrated that replication forks are aligned with gene transcription in actively transcribed long genes (>100 kb) (Figure\u00a05D). To analyze replication origin efficiency, we also analyzed MCM7 (Sugimoto et\u00a0al., 2018), RPA2 (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017), and ORC1 (Dellino et\u00a0al., 2013) HeLa chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data at the TSSs of HeLa transcribed genes >100 kb. We found that ORC1 accumulates at TSSs as previously described (Figure\u00a05E). However, the distribution of MCM7 was polarized toward gene transcription direction, as observed for Ok-seq data (Figure\u00a05E). Furthermore, RPA2 was reduced in levels across TSSs, suggesting perhaps that under-replicated TSSs might not be single stranded (Figure\u00a05E). We also analyzed RPA2 and MCM7 levels around the TSSs of G-MiDS hotspots, finding a slight accumulation only of RPA2 upstream of TSSs (Figure\u00a0S5F). This would suggest that when MCM complexes get in the proximity of G-MiDS TSSs, they do not persist there waiting for the RNAPII to be removed in G2/M to complete duplication of the TSSs.These results suggested that although origins of replication were activated next to TSSs, the efficiency of the replication forks moving from these origins could be different. Replication forks moving toward the TSS could be hindered by the presence of RNAPII at TSSs. This is much more severe at genes >100 kb, as these have the highest levels of PPP (Figure\u00a03G) and preserve the highest levels of RNAPII at TSSs during replication (Figure\u00a0S2D). Origins of replication will not be activated next to the TSS of every transcribed gene (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019); therefore, for all other TSSs, we postulate that when a replication fork reaches these regions, it may encounter RNAPII, and this will lead to the formation of the BrdU gap.G-MiDS is not associated with DNA damage or canonical DNA damage repair pathwaysTranscribed regions present increased levels of endogenous DNA damage and are chromosomal translocations and double-strand breaks hotspots (Iacovoni et\u00a0al., 2010; Chiarle et\u00a0al., 2011; Seo et\u00a0al., 2012; Kantidakis et\u00a0al., 2016; Yan et\u00a0al., 2017). At the same time, DNA damage increases specifically during S phase in unperturbed cells (Saldivar et\u00a0al., 2018). Hence, we analyzed whether deferring duplication of TSS in G2/M was associated with increased DNA damage levels. To this end, we performed ChIP-seq for phospho-Ser139 H2AX (hereafter \u03b3H2AX) as a proxy for DNA damage (Iacovoni et\u00a0al., 2010; Kantidakis et\u00a0al., 2016) in asynchronous cells and for total histone H2AX for normalization.First, we analyzed the impact of G-MiDS on DNA damage levels, as mitotic DNA synthesis (hereafter MiDAS) had been proposed as a last resource DNA damage repair process following DNA replication stress, through RAD52-dependent break-induced replication (BIR) (Minocherhomji et\u00a0al., 2015). Intriguingly, average profile and heatmap of ChIP-seq data showed that G-MiDS sites are not enriched in \u03b3H2AX, indicating that they were not generally associated with sites of DNA damage (Figure\u00a06A). Following, we quantified the levels of \u03b3H2AX around the TSSs \u00b11 kb of the 449 G-MiDS hotspot genes compared to all transcribed genes, finding a decrease in \u03b3H2AX levels over G-MiDS hotspots (Figure\u00a06B). Then, we performed the same analysis also upon the KD of NELFA to assess how changing RNAPII levels at TSSs impacted on genome stability. We found that KD of NELFA limitedly reduced DNA damage levels around the TSSs but had a greater impact on the 449 G-MiDS-hotspot TSSs (Figure\u00a06C). As G-MiDS was also present in U2OS cells, we reanalyzed data from Clouaire et\u00a0al. (2018) for ChIP-seq levels of the DNA damage repair factors RAD51, 53BP1, and XRCC4 across TSSs. Also in this case, no difference was found in DNA damage repair factors levels across G-MiDS hotspots versus all transcribed genes (Figure\u00a0S6A). These data appear to indicate that G-MiDS sites are not associated with DNA damage or the recruitment of DNA damage repair factors, although reducing G-MiDS levels, like NELFA KD, might also reduce the risk of incurring DNA damage.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06G-MiDS is not dependent on the DNA damage response and is distinct from MiDAS(A) Average metagene profile and heatmap for \u03b3H2AX/H2AX at G-MiDS-specific peaks \u00b110 kb.(B) Quantification of \u03b3H2AX/H2AX levels around TSSs \u00b11 kb of all transcribed genes and G-MiDS hotspots.(C) Quantification of \u03b3H2AX/H2AX levels around TSSs \u00b11 kb of all transcribed genes and G-MiDS hotspots in CTR cells and after KD of NELFA.(D) G2/M-EdU double-positive cells quantified in CTR DMSO cells or with the inhibitors (Rad51i\u00a0= 25\u00a0\u03bcM, Rad52i\u00a0= 20\u00a0\u03bcM, ATMi\u00a0= 10\u00a0\u03bcM, ATRi\u00a0= 4\u00a0\u03bcM, CD437\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcM, aphidicolin [APH]\u00a0= 10\u00a0\u03bcM, camptothecin [Campto]\u00a0= 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and etoposide [Eto]\u00a0= 10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 30\u00a0min once released from G2 arrest; DRB (100\u00a0\u03bcM) treated for 1\u00a0h before and then 30\u00a0min once released from G2 arrest; n \u2265 3.(E) Immunofluorescence for pS10-H3 (green) to label mitotic cells, EdU Click-iT for DNA synthesis (red), and DAPI (blue) for nuclei staining.

For this, we adopted our Ro3306 protocol to quantify G2/M-EdU double positive cells in the presence of inhibitors against specific DNA repair factors. Inhibition of RAD52 (BIR) or RAD51 (homologous recombination repair) or the apical DNA damage checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR had no effect on G-MiDS levels (Figures 6D, S6B, and S6C). However, we found that treatment with aphidicolin, a replicative DNA polymerase inhibitor, reduced G2/M-EdU double-positive cell frequency and DNA synthesis levels in positive cells (Figures 6D and S6D), indicating that G-MiDS is executed by replicative polymerases. This was also the case when cells were treated with the DNA-polymerase-alpha-specific inhibitor CD437, although this was not a significant reduction (Figure\u00a06D). We also hypothesized that the extension of DNA synthesis across the TSS may lead to topological constraints and therefore tested the impact of topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. Indeed, we found that both a topoisomerase I inhibitor (camptothecin) and a topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide) reduced the frequency of DNA synthesis in G2/M cells (Figure\u00a06D). Finally, to link G-MiDS to RNAPII removal from the TSS, we released cells from the Ro3306 into DRB and found a significant reduction in G2/M DNA synthesis (Figure\u00a06D). Importantly, while treatment with DRB reduced G-MiDS levels, it led to a 3-fold increase in MiDAS levels (Figure\u00a06E), which was associated with a 2-fold increase in ultrafine bridges, anaphase bridges, and lagging chromosomes (Figure\u00a06F). All these findings support our conclusion that G-MiDS is a process distinct from MiDAS and that in fact hindering G-MiDS can lead to an increase in genome instability levels.G-MiDS-hotspot-specific featuresGiven that NELFA KD affected DNA synthesis levels across TSSs in G2/M, we analyzed whether PPP is also responsible for BrdU gap formation. However, KD of either NELFA or SUPT5H had no impact on BrdU gap formation independently of gene length or directionality (Figures 7A and S7A). This suggests that while reducing PPP levels creates a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to complete duplication across TSSs before G2/M, PPP is not responsible for the formation of BrdU gaps in the first instance. We also tested the impact of triptolide, a TFIIH (transcription factor II H) inhibitor that reduces RNAPII levels at the TSS by blocking transcription initiation (Erickson et\u00a0al., 2018). A short treatment with triptolide at the beginning of S phase had only a minor effect on BrdU gap formation, indicating that these gaps are also dependent on the whole set of transcription factors that regulate gene transcription at promoters (Figure\u00a0S7B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07G-MiDS-hotspot-gene-specific features(A) As in Figures 3A and 3B for all transcribed genes and transcripts separated by gene length in cells transfected with the indicated siRNA.(B) Gene length and transcription levels at the late-S/G2 time point for G-MiDS hotspot genes toward all other transcribed genes.(C) Directionality analysis of G-MiDS hotspot genes compared with directionality of all transcribed genes.(D) Replication timing of G-MiDS hotspot genes compared with all transcribed genes.(E) Quantification of the ratio between antisense and sense transcription at TSSs \u00b11 kb of all transcribed genes and the 449 G-MiDS hotspots.(F) Heatmap analysis of the levels of antisense and sense transcription at TSSs \u00b12.5 kb for all the transcribed genes and G-MiDS hotspots on the\u00a0+ and \u2212 strands.(G) Model describing how the TSS is occupied by RNAPII and general transcription factors (GTF) throughout the cell cycle, with the RNAPII moving along genes. When DNA replication approaches the TSS during S phase, it may encounter GTF/RNAPII, skipping the TSS and restarting downstream of it. This may be mediated by the activation of origins of replication near TSSs. Later during S phase, DNA replication may fill the resulting gaps. However, in cases of genes with high steady expression levels of sense and TSS-associated antisense transcription, completion of the duplication of TSSs will occur in G2/M, when RNAPII and GTF are removed from TSSs. Box and whisker plots with the line at the median; Mann-Whitney t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.Finally, we aimed to identify specific features characterizing G-MiDS hotspot genes. Overall, these 449 genes were longer and more transcribed than other transcripts (Figure\u00a07B), enriched for genes orientated in a head-to-head configuration (Figure\u00a07C; chi-square p value\u00a0= 0.033). Moreover, they were replicated at later stages of S phase compared to the general distribution, even though the majority were still replicated at the beginning of S phase (Figure\u00a07D; chi-square p value\u00a0= 0.012). Gene Ontology analysis showed enrichment in transcription factors, GTPases, cell migration, and vesicular transport factors (Table S4), with transcription levels stable throughout the cell cycle (Figure\u00a0S7C). Importantly, these genes were not specifically transcribed in mitosis in HUH7 and HeLa cells (hypergeometric p value\u00a0= 0.003 depleted for overlap in HUH7 cells and 0.458 for enrichment in HeLa cells), suggesting that on these genes, RNAPII will be removed when cells prepare for mitosis (Liang et\u00a0al., 2015; Palozola et\u00a0al., 2017).We also analyzed how transcription is arranged at TSSs of G-MiDS hotspots, quantifying the levels of sense and antisense transcription at TSSs. Intriguingly, G-MiDS hotspot genes had on average 3.8-fold more antisense/sense transcription across TSSs when compared to all transcribed genes. This is highlighted by heatmaps for sense (in red) and antisense (in blue) transcription across the TSS region (Figures 7E and 7F). This antisense transcription was genuine TSS-associated antisense, as only 14.7% of the G-MiDS hotspots had a bidirectional promoter with a transcribed gene on the other side.Taken together, these data suggest that because G-MiDS genes are stably expressed throughout the cell cycle with high levels of both sense and antisense transcription, this will render these TSSs particularly impassable for the replication machinery. Therefore, cells require passage into G2/M and the removal of RNAPII from TSSs to complete DNA synthesis. DiscussionRNA transcription and DNA replication are the two essential processes that allow cells to express the content of their genomes and generate two identical copies to pass on to daughter cells. As both processes use the DNA as a template, crosstalk is crucial to avoid reciprocal interference. Using genomic approaches, we have now uncovered the reciprocal impact of RNAPII transcription and DNA replication. Our data indicate that transcription is still active during DNA replication, with important consequences for timing of replication (Figures 3 and \u200band4)4) and replication fork progression (Figure\u00a05). In parallel, we observe a transient shutdown of gene transcription only when a gene is replicated (Figure\u00a02).However, the most surprising finding is that TSSs of transcribed genes can remain under-replicated throughout S phase, with TSSs completely duplicated in hundreds of cases only when cells are preparing for mitosis (Figure\u00a04D). We showed a direct correlation between RNAPII levels at TSSs and G-MiDS levels. The PPP role in transcription regulation is important also to preserve nucleosome organization at TSSs to maintain active gene transcription (Gilchrist et\u00a0al., 2010; Core et\u00a0al., 2012). Indeed, in newly replicated chromatin, the positional information of histone marks is conserved (Rever\u00f3n-G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al., 2018). One possibility could be that maintaining the RNAPII at the TSS might be required to maintain the nucleosome organization around TSSs when the region is replicated. The RNAPII would act as a \u201csignpost\u201d for TSSs, particularly relevant perhaps for longer genes where we identify wider and deeper BrdU gaps (Figure\u00a03B), and that preserve the greatest levels of RNAPII in newly replicated chromatin (Figure\u00a0S2D). This would allow duplication of the DNA preserving chromatin organization in order to create a fully functional genome to pass on to daughter cells.We identified 449 hotspot G-MiDS TSSs characterized by a series of features (Figures 7B\u20137E). High levels of sense and antisense transcription would make the TSS particularly difficult to replicate across, as indicated also by our relative enrichment profiles (Figure\u00a0S4E). In parallel, enhancers that are also characterized by high levels of antisense transcription show no enrichment for G2/M DNA synthesis, as their impact on DNA replication is very limited (Figure\u00a0S3E; data not shown). Determining how altering specifically antisense levels at G-MiDS-hotspot TSSs would allow these TSSs to be replicated within S phase is an important aspect to investigate in the future. Importantly, the NELF complex regulates both sense and antisense transcription levels at TSSs (Figure\u00a0S7D), suggesting that upon the KD of NELFA, both sense and antisense RNAPII will be moved away from the TSS, making TSSs overall more accessible throughout S phase.A large body of literature has shown how replication origins are enriched around TSSs of transcribed genes (Dellino et\u00a0al., 2013; Cayrou et\u00a0al., 2015; Petryk et\u00a0al., 2016; Chen et\u00a0al., 2019). However, for origins of replication activated near a TSS, the replication forks that will move from such origins may have different efficiencies depending on whether they get toward the TSS or away from it (Figure\u00a05).Contexts with defective transcription often present higher DNA damage levels (Huertas and Aguilera, 2003; Dutta et\u00a0al., 2011; Sollier et\u00a0al., 2014). Although our study does not analyze R-loops, we do not predict a role for physiologic R-loops in the phenotypes we observe. R-loops occur at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of genes and have roles in maintaining chromatin marks and regulating transcription termination (Ginno et\u00a0al., 2013; Skourti-Stathaki et\u00a0al., 2014; Chen et\u00a0al., 2015). Nevertheless, we do not observe phenotypes at the 3\u2032 end of genes (Figure\u00a0S3C). Moreover, although GC-skewed promoters are more prone to R-loops (Ginno et\u00a0al., 2013), BrdU gaps do not occur preferentially at GC-skewed promoters (Figure\u00a0S7E), but more generally at GC-rich promoters associated with longer genes and higher transcription levels (Figures S7F and S7G). R-loops were also shown to be important to regulate antisense transcription at TSSs (Tan-Wong et\u00a0al., 2019). We reanalyzed data from Tan-Wong et\u00a0al., confirming that over all transcribed genes, the overexpression of RNASEH1 leads to a more pronounced reduction of antisense transcription (Figure\u00a0S7H). However, for G-MiDS hotspot genes, the reduction in sense and antisense transcription is the same (Figure\u00a0S7H), suggesting that R-loops may play a role in supporting sense transcription over these genes as previously shown (Chen et\u00a0al., 2015).MiDAS was first described as a DNA damage repair mechanism that supports DNA duplication following replication stress (Minocherhomji et\u00a0al., 2015; Bhowmick et\u00a0al., 2016). In our experiments, we have shown that DNA synthesis in G2/M is not at DNA damage sites and does not depend on canonical DNA repair mechanisms (Figures 6B and 6D). However, altering RNAPII levels at TSSs either through the KD of NELFA or by maintaining the RNAPII at TSSs in G2/M with DRB impacts genome stability, affecting \u03b3H2AX, MiDAS, and defective mitosis (Figures 6C, 6E, and 6F). G-MiDS, therefore, is a process separated from MiDAS that is likely responsible for completion of DNA replication in G2/M, with MiDAS coming in mitosis as a DNA damage repair process. As origins of replication cannot be activated once cells pass the G1/S transition (Fragkos et\u00a0al., 2015), and because of the overall defect in Okazaki fragments at TSS (Figure\u00a05C), we envisage that G-MiDS is a gap filling process dependent on replicative polymerases. Replicative polymerases have the highest fidelity among DNA polymerases, preserving the genetic information present in those regions. Moreover, we have also identified other components of G-MiDS like topoisomerases I and II, both of which to our knowledge have never been shown to have a role in BIR.Surprisingly, we identify G2/M-specific replication occurring in one in five cells (Figures 4A and 4B), and DNA synthesis in late G2/M had already been described prior to MiDAS (Hansen et\u00a0al., 1993; Widrow et\u00a0al., 1998). Following DNA replication stress, the DNA damage checkpoint will block cells from entering mitosis; however, there are instances where the DNA damage checkpoint is not activated in the presence of under-replicated DNA (Bergoglio et\u00a0al., 2013; Yang et\u00a0al., 2017). Very likely, therefore, the under-replicated DNA at TSSs is not exposed as single-stranded DNA or bound by RPA or RAD51 (Figures 5E and S6A), persisting in some form of X-shaped molecule tolerated by cells throughout the cell cycle.Genome instability can arise as consequence of failed G-MiDS at TSSs. Intriguingly, 26 out of the 449 G-MiDS hotspot genes are listed as cancer genes in the COSMIC database, and many are associated with copy-number alterations and/or translocations (Figure\u00a0S7I; hypergeometric p value\u00a0= 0.052). Whether deferring the duplication of the TSS to G2/M comes with a risk that these TSSs do not get fully replicated, leading to the aberrations observed in cancer, is a very exciting speculative avenue that will need further investigations.Limitations of studyCurrent limitations in single-cell sequencing allow assessment at the population level of the reciprocal impact of transcription and replication at hotspots where interference is happening at high frequency (i.e., TSSs). Future developments in single-cell analysis will allow expanding this study to rarer events, proving that the two processes are happening at the same time on the same molecule of DNA. Moreover, it will be important in the future to assess whether reducing specifically antisense transcription levels at G-MiDS-hotspot TSSs is sufficient to allow duplication of TSS regions during S phase.

(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin; human osteosarcoma (U2OS cells) were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5A (Modified) Medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2\u00a0mM L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin, both grown in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Method detailsGrowing conditions and DNA Labeling Cells fully confluent were seeded at 20% confluence in 150\u00a0mm dishes, and grown overnight. Cells were synchronized in the G0/G1 phase in serum starvation medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin) in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C for 26 h, and released into S-phase with regular DMEM for the indicated time points. 15.5\u00a0h after release, 100\u00a0ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the later time point cell cultures (19 h, 22 h, 24 h, 28 h) to prevent cells from re-entering the cell cycle. The cells from two 150\u00a0mm dishes were incubated for 1\u00a0h with 50\u00a0\u03bcM BrdU before the indicated time point to label the newly replicating DNA. At each time point, labeled cells from two 150\u00a0mm dishes were quick washed once with ice-cold PBS and harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation. After washing the cells again with ice-cold PBS and split into three aliquots: 20% of cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for cell cycle analysis; 40% of cells were used for genomic DNA extraction with PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific); 40% of cells were used for cell fractionation and chromatin associated nascent RNA preparation as described below.For experiments with asynchronous cells, BJ-hTERT and U2OS grown in 150\u00a0mm dishes were incubated for 30\u00a0min with 50\u00a0\u03bcM BrdU to label the newly replicating DNA. Cells were quickly washed once with ice-cold PBS and harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation. After washing the cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for cell sorting (see below for details).BrdU-seq BrdU labeled genomic DNA (20\u03bcg) in 200\u00a0\u03bcl TE buffer was sonicated using VCX130 (Sonics & Materials, Inc) with the following settings: 6 cycles, 30% Amp, 15\u00a0s ON, 25\u00a0s OFF. Sonicated DNA was centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm at 4\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min and denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. Following denaturation, the DNA was put on ice immediately. 15\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA were mixed with 35\u00a0\u03bcl of elution buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS) as Input. 170\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA were mixed with 180\u00a0\u03bcl of 2Xblocking solution (2% BSA, 2XPBS, 0.2% Tween20), 10\u00a0\u03bcl Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2\u00a0\u03bcg anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in DNA low binding tubes (Sarstedt), incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with rotation. Before mixing with denatured DNA, 10\u00a0\u03bcl Dynabeads Protein A was prepared by incubating with 2\u00a0\u03bcg anti-BrdU antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight with rotation. After immunoprecipitation, BrdU-labeled DNA bound to beads was washed twice with 1\u00a0mL of lysis buffer 1 (50\u00a0mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na Deoxycholate), twice with 1\u00a0mL of lysis buffer 2 (50\u00a0mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na Deoxycholate), twice with 1\u00a0mL of wash buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250\u00a0mM LiCl,1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5% Na Deoxycholate, 0.5% Igepal CA-630). The beads were resuspended in 1\u00a0mL of TE and centrifuged for 3\u00a0min, 3000\u00a0rpm at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed and beads were resuspended in 50\u00a0\u03bcl elution buffer and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was transferred into new DNA low binding tubes after centrifugation for 5000\u00a0rpm, 1\u00a0min at room temperature and leaving the tubes on Magnet (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1\u00a0min. 50\u00a0\u03bcl TE and final concentration of 0.5\u00a0mg/ml Proteinase K (Promega) were added into the eluted fraction (IP DNA) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Meanwhile, 50\u00a0\u03bcl TE was added to 50\u00a0\u03bcl Input DNA. Both the IP DNA and Input DNA were purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research) and eluted twice with 7.5\u00a0\u03bcl nuclease-free water. Following purification, both the single-stranded BrdU-labeled DNA and the single-stranded Input DNA were converted to double-stranded by Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche). The double-strand DNA was purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 and eluted twice with 7\u00a0\u03bcl EB (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5). The purified DNA was quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from the random-primed BrdU-DNA material according to Illumina\u2019s Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After cleaning up, indexed libraries were quantified, normalized and pooled, before sequencing on Illumina NextSeq system in a single lane on a paired-end run.For the single gene analysis, the IP and Input samples were directly submitted to quantitative RT-PCR using SensiFast SYBR Lo-ROX kit (Bioline) and CFX96 Real-Time System (Biorad) Real-Time PCR. Results shown are average means of three independent experiments,\u00a0+/\u2212 standard error of the mean (SEM).Chromatin-bound RNA sequencing (Chr-RNA-seq) Chromatin bound RNA (Chr-RNA) was prepared as previously described (Mayer and Churchman, 2016), with slight modification. The cells which were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold PBS from synchronization were washed once with 1\u00a0mL ice-cold PBS. After collecting the cells, we followed Mayer and Churchman (2016) protocol washing twice the nuclei. Cell fractionation quality was assessed by western blotting as in Mayer and Churchman (1996). The chromatin fraction was quick frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). 200-300\u00a0ng of input RNA in each repeat were depleted of ribosomal RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The recovered RNA was concentrated in 12\u00a0\u03bcl nuclease-free water using RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research). The RNA samples were used to construct RNA libraries using KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Roche) according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, but without the rRNA depletion step. Instead, 10\u00a0\u03bcl concentrated RNA was directly mixed in PCR tube with equal volume of Fragment, Prime and Elute Buffer (2X) from KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit for fragmentation in a thermocycler for 8\u00a0min at 94\u00b0C. RNA libraries were prepared according to KAPA Kit instruction and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq system in a single lane on a single-end read run.Nascent transcription levels analysis For the nascent RNA levels analysis cells were grown as above and at the indicated time points total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer instructions. 1\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Primers were designed across exon-intron junctions or in intronic regions to monitor specifically nascent pre-mRNA transcription levels, either at the TSS region or in the gene body. Pre-mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using SensiFast SYBR Lo-ROX kit (Bioline) and CFX96 Real-Time System (Biorad). Results shown are average means of three independent experiments,\u00a0+/\u2212 standard error of the mean (SEM).Cell cycle analysis For cell cycle progression analysis cells that were pulsed with BrdU and fixed with 70% ethanol were washed twice with PBS at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 1\u00a0mL 2\u00a0M HCl (containing 0.1\u00a0mg/ml pepsin) for 20\u00a0min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS, 0.2% tween20, 1% goat serum). After the third PBS-T wash, cells were resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL PBS-T and incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcl mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS-T, resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL PBS-T and incubated with 2.5\u00a0\u03bcL of FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed once with PBS-T and resuspended in 0.5\u00a0mL PI/RNase A solution (RNaseA 0.1\u00a0mg/ml, Propidium iodide 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Cells were incubated for 5-15\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C or kept at 4\u00b0C overnight before analysis on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. FACS profiles were analyzed by BD Accuri C6 software.Transcription activity by EU incorporation analysis by FACS Global newly synthesized RNA was labeled by 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) 1mM for 1h in BJ-hTERT cells before each indicated time point, and in parallel in a population of asynchronous cells. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The incorporated EU was detected by CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) after click reaction using Click-iT RNA Imaging Kits (Invitrogen), and cells were stained with Violet DNA in parallel to measure DNA content. Cells were gated in different stages of the cell cycle by DNA content, and EU intensity was analyzed with FlowJo software measuring EU intensity in the different gates in the different time points and comparing EU levels to those of an asynchronous untreated population of cells.siRNA transfection siRNA treatment was performed using INTERFERin siRNA Transfection Reagent (Polyplus) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 37.5\u00a0nM of siRNAs from Dharmacon were used to target NELFA, SUPT5H, as well as a control siRNA against Luciferase (see Key resources table), respectively, for indicated transfection time. The efficiency of depletion was tested by western blotting.Western blotting For cell fractionation, proteins were prepared from each fraction. For siRNA knockdown, cell lysis was prepared by resuspending cells directly in SDS loading buffer followed by sonication using Bioruptor. Cell extracts were separated by electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% skimmed milk dissolved in 0.1%Tween20/TBS. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by washes in 0.1%Tween20/TBS. Membranes were incubated with appropriate HRP-linked secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1\u00a0h and washed three times prior to signal detection. Membranes were developed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent. Antibodies used were Ser5-P (4H8, 1:10,000), tubulin (Tat-1, 10,000), U1 snRNP70 (sc-390988, 1:1000), Histone H3 (9715S, 1:2000), NELF-A (sc-365004, 1:1000), SUPT5H (sc-133217, 1:1000), HRP-linked Horse anti-mouse IgG (7076S, 1:2000), HRP-linked Goat anti-rabbit IgG (7074S, 1:2000).Immunostaining For DRB treated experiments cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 26 h. For the Early S treatment, 15\u00a0h after release cells were treated with DMSO or 100\u00a0\u03bcM DRB (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, respectively, followed by three washes with warm PBS and cultured again in regular DMEM medium. 24\u00a0h after release, 9\u00a0\u03bcM Ro3306 (Adooq Bioscience) were added to the cells for 16\u00a0h to arrest cells in G2 similar to Minocherhomji et\u00a0al., 2015. Cells were released into mitosis by vigorous washing (3-4 times for up to 5\u00a0min) in pre-warmed PBS. Cells were pulsed with 10\u00a0\u03bcM EdU (Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh pre-warmed medium for 30\u00a0min incubated in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. After one quick wash with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed and permeabilized for 20\u00a0min in PTEMF buffer (20\u00a0mM PIPES pH 6.8, 10\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 4% formaldehyde) at room temperature. Fixed samples were washed 3 times in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. The \u2018Click-chemistry\u2019 reaction was performed using Click-iT RNA Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging Kit following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were quick washed with 1\u00a0mL rinse buffer and blocked for 1\u00a0h at room temperature using 10% FBS/PBS (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with 1:2000 diluted rabbit monoclonal anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (Cell Signaling Technology) in 1% FBS/PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and blocked with 1:1000 diluted Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1%FBS/PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with a drop of mounting medium with DAPI (GeneTex). Cells were imaged as described above.For the analysis of G-MiDS levels after DRB treatment, cells were grown as above and treated for 1h before release in DMSO or DRB (100\u00a0\u03bcM), followed by an additional treatment of 30\u2019 after the Ro3306 release in the presence of EdU. For the analysis of aberrant mitosis, cells were grown as above and treated for 1h before release in DMSO or DRB (100\u00a0\u03bcM), followed by an additional treatment of 80\u00a0min after the Ro3306 release. After one quick wash with ice-cold PBS, cells were fixed and permeabilized for 20\u00a0min in PTEMF buffer (20\u00a0mM PIPES pH 6.8, 10\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 4% formaldehyde) at room temperature. Fixed samples were washed 3 times in PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. The cells were quick washed with 1\u00a0mL rinse buffer and blocked for 1\u00a0h at room temperature using 10% FBS/PBS (Sigma Aldrich). Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with 1:200 diluted mouse monoclonal anti-Bloom (BLM, Cell Services, The Francis Crick Institute) in 1% FBS/PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and blocked with 1:1000 diluted Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1% FBS/PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with a drop of mounting medium with DAPI (GeneTex).For siRNA transfection experiments, at the beginning of serum starvation, transfection was performed as described in the corresponding method section. The transfected cells were synchronized for 26\u00a0h and released in regular DMEM medium. 24\u00a0h after release, 9\u00a0\u03bcM Ro3306 were added to the cells for 16\u00a0h to arrest cells and processed as described above.For the Rad52 inhibitor test experiment, asynchronous cells were first treated with 0.4uM aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich) and Ro-3306 for 16 h, then released into medium containing EdU and together with either DMSO (control) or 20\u00a0\u03bcM Rad52i (AICAR, Sigma, CAS 2627-69-2) for 30\u00a0min, followed by fixation and EdU Click-It as above. For the Rad51 inhibitor test experiment, asynchronous cells were treated with 1\u00a0\u03bcM PARP inhibitor (Olaparib, Adooq Bioscience, CAS:763113-22-0) and together with either DMSO (control) or 25\u00a0\u03bcM Rad51 inhibitor (BO2 Sigma, CAS: 1290541-46-6) for 24 h. The cells were incubated for 5\u00a0min in ice-cold extraction buffer (10\u00a0mM PIPES, 300\u00a0mM Sucrose, 20\u00a0mM NaCl, 3\u00a0mM MgCl2 and 0.5% Triton X-100) and fixed in 4% PFA (Paraformaldehyde) for 10\u00a0min. The cells were washed three times for 5\u00a0min in 1X PBS and stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C until the day of the staining. Rad51 antibody (Merck) was used in a 1:1000 dilution, followed by Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1%FBS/PBS for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted with a drop of mounting medium with DAPI as above. Other inhibitors were used as above ATMi (10\u00a0\u03bcM, KU-55933, Stratech), ATRi (4\u00a0\u03bcM, AZD6738, Stratech), Camptothecin (10\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich), Etoposide (10\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich), CD437 (5\u00a0\u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich).ChIP-seq Asynchronous cells were transfected with 37.5\u00a0nM of indicated siRNA for 72\u00a0h using the method as described above. Cells with 70%\u201380% of confluence were harvested by trypsinization. Regular DMEM medium was then added to the cells to inactivate the trypsin. Cells were immediately fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. Then, glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125\u00a0M and the reaction was incubated for 5\u00a0min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and lysed for 5\u00a0min in ice-cold ChIP cell lysis buffer (5\u00a0mM HEPES pH 8.0, 85\u00a0mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40 alternative, protease inhibitors). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3900\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and lysed for 5\u00a0min in ChIP nuclear lysis buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS, protease inhibitors) and incubated 5\u00a0minutes on ice. Lysates were sonicated using VCX130 (Sonics & Materials, Inc) with the following settings: 8 cycles, 30% Amp, 15\u00a0s ON, 25\u00a0s OFF. Sonicated chromatin was centrifuged at 17000\u00a0g at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and the supernatant was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until immunoprecipitation. Before immunoprecipitation, 15\u00a0\u03bcl of Dynabeads Protein A was washed twice with 900\u00a0\u03bcl 5\u00a0mg/ml BSA in PBS and reacted for 1\u00a0h or more with 3\u00a0\u03bcg of the corresponding antibody (Phospho-Histone H2A.X: ab2893, Abcam; H2A.X: 07-627, Merck Millipore; H3: ab1791, Abcam) in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of 5\u00a0mg/ml BSA in PBS at room temperature. The beads were washed again with 900\u00a0\u03bcl 5\u00a0mg/ml BSA in PBS before use. The concentration of sonicated chromatin was quantified by using Quick Start Bradford protein 1x dye reagent (Bio-Rad). 50\u00a0\u03bcl chromatin were used as Input. 0.6\u00a0mg of chromatin was 1:5 diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 16.7\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 167\u00a0mM NaCl, protease inhibitors), and incubated with prepared beads overnight at 4\u00b0C with rotation. Chromatin bound to beads was washed twice in ChIP low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150\u00a0mM NaCl), twice in ChIP high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500\u00a0mM NaCl), twice in ChIP LiCl buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250\u00a0mM LiCl, 1% NP40 alternative, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1\u00a0mM EDTA), and once in TE buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). Most of the TE buffer was removed after the beads were centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 3\u00a0min and put on Magnet. The remaining TE was removed after the beads were centrifuged again at 13200\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0min and put on Magnet. The beads were resuspended in 50\u00a0\u03bcl elution buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min followed by centrifugation at 12000\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0min. The supernatant was transferred to a new DNA low binding tube (Sarstedt) and incubated at 65\u00b0C overnight for de-crosslinking. Reverse cross-linked supernatant was mixed with 50\u00a0\u03bcl of TE and incubated with RNase A at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The supernatant was further incubated with 0.7\u00a0mg/ml proteinase K at 55\u00b0C for 2 h. DNA was purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 and eluted with 8\u00a0\u03bcl EB (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5). The purified DNA was quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1\u00a0ng of DNA was used to construct DNA library according to Illumina\u2019s Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit protocol. After being cleaned up, indexed libraries were quantified, normalized and pooled, sequenced on Illumina NextSeq system in a single lane on a paired-end run.Cell sorting by flow cytometry and G2/M BrdU-seq Cells with 20% confluence and grown in 150\u00a0mm dishes were synchronized by serum starvation. At the start of serum starvation, two-150\u00a0mm dishes of cells were transfected with each indicated siRNA as described in the corresponding method. In parallel, two-150\u00a0mm dishes of cells with no siRNA transfection were synchronized. In the following steps, both transfected and not-transfected cells were processed in the same way. The cells were synchronized for 26\u00a0h and released in regular DMEM medium. 24\u00a0h after release, 9\u00a0\u03bcM Ro3306 were added to the cells for 16\u00a0h to arrest cells in G2. Then cells were pulsed with both 25\u00a0\u03bcM EdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50\u00a0\u03bcM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh pre-warmed medium for 30\u00a0min in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. For the Repli-Seq experiment and the sorting of G2/M cells from asynchronous populations of BJ-hTERT and U2OS cells, cells were pulsed for 30\u00a0min with 50\u00a0\u03bcM BrdU. After one-time quick wash with ice-cold PBS, cells were collected by trypsinization followed by mixing with ice-cold regular DMEM to inactivate trypsin. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed and permeabilized for 20\u00a0min in PTEMF buffer at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice in PBS and stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C until use. Asynchronous cells that were pulsed with 25\u00a0\u03bcM EdU for 30\u00a0min in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C were also trypsinized, fixed with PTEMF, washed with PBS and stored in PBS until use.Collected cells from above were immunostained for cell sorting. For color compensation, one aliquot of fixed asynchronous cells were treated with RNase A and used as no dye control; one aliquot of fixed asynchronous cells were treated with RNase A and stained only with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to measure DNA content; one aliquot of fixed asynchronous cells were treated with RNase A and clicked with Alexa Fluor 594 azide to measure DNA synthesis; one aliquot of fixed synchronous but no-siRNA transfected cells were immunostained with Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10). For cell sorting, one aliquot of each fixed transected cells were immunostained for EdU (clicked with Alexa Fluor 594 azide), Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (with Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody), treated with RNase A and co-stained with Violet Stain for cell cycle analysis. The rest of each fixed transected cells and non-transfected cells were immunostained for Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (with Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody), treated with RNase A and co-stained with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain for cell sorting based on the positive Phospho-Histone H3 signal and in G2 by DNA content. Cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria cell sorter machine (Beckton Dickinson, USA). Sorted cells were pelleted using centrifugation, resuspended in 200\u00a0\u03bcl TE and transferred into DNA low binding tube. Cells were sonicated using VCX130 (Sonics & Materials, Inc) with the following settings: 5 cycles, 30% Amp, 15\u00a0s ON, 10\u00a0s OFF. Sonicated chromatin was briefly centrifuged and incubated at 65\u00b0C overnight for de-crosslinking. Reverse crosslinked supernatant was further incubated with 0.7\u00a0mg/ml proteinase K at 55\u00b0C for 3 h. DNA was purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 and eluted twice with 10\u00a0\u03bcl EB (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5). The purified DNA was quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA was used to perform BrdU pull-down as described above. After both the single-stranded BrdU-DNA and single-stranded Input DNA were converted to double-strand by Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche), the double-strand DNA was purified by DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 and eluted once with 7\u00a0\u03bcl EB (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5). The purified DNA was quantified with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed with 250 pg (or as much as available) of the random-primed BrdU-DNA material according to standard procedures. QIAseq Ultralow Input Library Kit protocol (QIAGEN) was used. After being cleaned up, indexed libraries were quantified, normalized and pooled, sequenced on Illumina NextSeq system in a single lane on a single-end run.Datasets alignment Paired-end BrdU-seq reads were aligned to the hg38 genome assembly using Bowtie 2 v.2.3.3.1 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). BAM files were sorted and indexed using SAMtools v.1.4 (Li et\u00a0al., 2009). The reads that mapped to region DAC blacklisted for mappability by the ENCODE project were removed. Single-end RNA-seq data were aligned to the hg38 genome assembly using STAR v.020201 (Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013) with options \u201c\u2013alignIntronMax 500000,\u201d \u201c\u2013outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.3\u201d and \u201c\u2013outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.3.\u201d Reads were trimmed to remove RNA contamination via BBDuk (Bushnell, JGI BBTools Team). BAM files were sorted and indexed using SAMtools v.1.4 (Li et\u00a0al., 2009). Counts for each transcribed gene were computed by featureCounts (Liao et\u00a0al., 2014) using the annotation of the GENCODE genes (GRCh38.p10). Read per million (RPM) were calculated over each gene in each replicate, and genes that had an RPM > 1 in each time point and each replicate were considered as those transcribed in our system. RPM over genes were averaged for the two replicates and used in the further analysis conducted using Bioconductor (Gentleman et\u00a0al., 2004). Single-end BrdU-Seq data from G2/M DNA synthesis samples were aligned to the hg38 genome using Bowtie 2 v.2.3.4.2 on the online platform Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org; Afgan et\u00a0al., 2018). MCM7 (Sugimoto et\u00a0al., 2018), RPA2 (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2017) and ORC1 (Dellino et\u00a0al., 2013) ChIP-Seq for HeLa cells read files, Ok-Seq from RPE (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019), Ok-Seq from HeLa cells (Petryk et\u00a0al., 2016), EdU-Seq from RPE and U2OS cells (Macheret and Halazonetis, 2018), CAP-Seq (Tan-Wong et\u00a0al., 2019) were mapped to hg38 using Bowtie2 v.2.3.4.2 on the online platform Galaxy; ChOR-Seq data from Stewart-Morgan et\u00a0al. (2019) were mapped to mm10 using the online platform Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org; Afgan et\u00a0al., 2018).Correlation The Pearson correlation coefficients between replicates and the time points, for each RNA-seq sample, were calculated using the library corrplot in R (Friendly, 2002).Peak calling Peaks were called in BrdU samples against the Input DNA using MACS2 v.2.1.0 (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2008) with human genome size and the following parameters: -m 8 30, -p 0.00001). Around 18,000 peaks were called in Early S; 9,000 in Early/Mid S; 3,000 in Mid S; 1,500 in Late S and 2,700 in Late S/G2. The -intersectBed command of Bedtools software (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) was used to get the overlaps for the transcribed genes and peaks in each replication time point.Similarly, G-MiDS peaks were called against the Input DNA using MACS2 v.2.1.1 with the same parameters listed above on the online platform Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org; Afgan et\u00a0al., 2018). The betools intersect intervals function on the online platform Galaxy was used to identify the G-MiDS specific peaks against the BrdU peaks called in all the S-phase time points combined together. This resulted in approximately 16600 G-MiDS specific peaks.Replication and transcription reciprocal directionality To analyze genome-wide replication timing in BrdU-Seq samples, we used a rapid and robust protocol previously described (https://github.com/tobiasrausch/repliseq; Rausch et\u00a0al., 2018), with a 10 kb bin window. Further analysis was conducted using an in-house script in R to get the directionality of replication (head to head, codirectional and transition) and to define Watson and Crick strands.Normalized profiles Read coverage was calculated over the region \u00b1 2.5 kb around the TSS of all the UCSC annotated genes for GRCh38 genome. The reads that mapped to region DAC blacklisted for mappability by the ENCODE project were removed. The scores per genome regions were used to construct a plot of the average TSS profile using deepTools (Ram\u00edrez et\u00a0al., 2014). In parallel read coverage profiles were generated also using the computational environment EaSeq version 1.101, normalizing the BrdU-Seq file to the Input DNA file with the function \u201caverage\u201d (Lerdrup et\u00a0al., 2016). This approach was also used to plot the average coverage for the gene length (4 categories where consider: genes length\u00a0< 5 kb; > 5 and\u00a0< 30 kb; > 30 and\u00a0< 100 kb; and > 100 kb); for the transcription level (100%\u201375%; 75%\u201350%; 50%\u201325%; 25%\u20130%), and for the BrdU-seq reads over the different time points, as well as for the majority of the metagene profiles presented in the paper.Heatmaps were generated with the function \u201cHeatMap\u201d of EaSeq around TSS \u00b1 10 kb using the \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018-\u2018 split Chr-RNA-Seq datafiles generated mapping reads to the Watson and the Crick strand using the Perl module bam_split.pl on https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::ViennaNGS (Wolfinger et\u00a0al., 2015). TDF profiles were generated using igvtools on IGV (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2011) with a window size of 10bp, and window functions of mean.ChIP-seq and RNA-seq quantifications ChIP-Seq levels for \u03b3H2AX and for histone H2AX were obtained using the function \u201cquantify\u201d in EaSeq, from the start to the end of the gene of all annotated genes, or only \u00b1 1 kb around TSS, as indicated in the figure legends. The relative level of \u03b3H2AX/H2AX was calculated over the gene or the genomic region, averaged for the two replicates and plotted.Similarly, coordinates of introns were derived from annotated genes list in EaSeq, and Chr-RNA-Seq levels calculated using the function \u201cquantify.\u201d The nascent Chr-RNA-Seq levels for each gene were calculated averaging the levels over each intron of that gene, averaged for the two replicates and plotted.To calculate the P3R2 values for BJ cells, we derived the coverage in the region \u221250/+300 and\u00a0+300/+1000 for all the transcribed genes, using GRO-Seq data from Li et\u00a0al. (2018) and the function \u201cquantify\u201d in EaSeq. The ratio between the TSS and gene body regions was calculated, discarding any gene with a coverage of 0 in one of the two regions.HeLa poly-A RNA-Seq file was downloaded from the Encode consortium (accession number ENCFF343WEZ) and quantified using the feature \u201cfeatureCounts\u201c on Galaxy. Only genes with FPKM > 1 were considered as transcribed, and filtered by gene length left 1621 genes > 100kb.To calculate sense and antisense levels around the TSS of genes, the Late S/G2 .bam file was split for reads mapping to the Watson and the Crick strand using the Perl module bam_split.pl on https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Bio-ViennaNGS (Wolfinger et\u00a0al., 2015), and coverage was quantified using the function \u201cquantify\u201d in EaSeq. Similarly, we used the Perl module bam_split.pl to generate the strand specific .bam files for the analysis of the RPE Ok-Seq (Chen et\u00a0al., 2019), HeLa Ok-Seq datasets (Petryk et\u00a0al., 2016) and CAP-Seq datasets (Tan-Wong et\u00a0al., 2019).Quantification and statistical analysesThe number of experimental repeats \u22653 is indicated in the figure legends. For the NGS files it was two biological repeats of the full time points sets of BrdU-Seq and Chr-RNA-Seq, two biological repeats for each gH2AX and H2AX ChIP-Seq in CTR siRNA and NELFA and SUPT5H siRNA, two biological repeats of the Repli-Seq experiment with BJ-hTERT, two biological repeats of the G2/M DNA synthesis on BJ-hTERT sorted cells after Ro3306 synchronization in CTR siRNA and NELFA siRNA, one repeat each of the G2/M DNA synthesis on asynchronous BJ-hTERT and U2OS. The repeats were all assessed for correlation before being analyzed together and averaged were specified. Student t test and Mann-Whitney t test were calculated using the software Prism (GraphPad).
