{"title": "Impact of preoperative comorbidities on postoperative complication rate and outcome in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer patients", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s11748-021-01710-5", "PMID": "34554366", "abstract": "Objective:                       This study aimed to analyze whether comorbidities impact postoperative complication rate or survival after anatomical lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).                  Methods:                       A retrospective analysis of 1219 patients who underwent NSCLC resection between 2000 and 2015 was performed. Analyzed comorbidities included chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction history, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency and other malignancies.                  Results:                       Most patients (78.9%) had comorbidities, most commonly hypertension (34.1%) followed by COPD (26.4%) and other malignancies (19%). The overall complication rate was 38.6% (26.4% pulmonary; 14.8% cardiac; and 3.0% gastrointestinal). Hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 1.492, p = 0.031) was associated with more cardiac complications. Heavy smoking (OR = 1.008, p = 0.003) and low body mass index (BMI) (OR = 0.932, p < 0.001) affected the pulmonary complication rate significantly. None of the included comorbidities affected the overall complication rate or the survival negatively. However, the patient characteristics of advanced age (p < 0.001), low BMI (p = 0.008), and low FEV1 (p = 0.008) affected the overall complication rate as well as survival (each p < 0.001).                  Conclusion:                       Advanced age, low BMI, and low FEV1 were predictive of greater complication risk and shorter long-term survival in patients who underwent NSCLC resection. Cardiac complications were associated with hypertension and CAD, whereas pulmonary complications were associated with a high pack year count.", "author": [{"author": "Martina Benker", "affiliation": ["Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zurich University Hospital, Raemistrasse 100, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland."], "href": "/?term=Benker+M&cauthor_id=34554366"}, {"author": "Necati Citak", "affiliation": ["Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zurich University Hospital, Raemistrasse 100, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland."], "href": "/?term=Citak+N&cauthor_id=34554366"}, {"author": "Thomas Neuer", "affiliation": ["Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zurich University Hospital, Raemistrasse 100, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland."], "href": "/?term=Neuer+T&cauthor_id=34554366"}, {"author": "Isabelle Opitz", "affiliation": ["Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zurich University Hospital, Raemistrasse 100, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland."], "href": "/?term=Opitz+I&cauthor_id=34554366"}, {"author": "Ilhan Inci", "affiliation": ["Department of Thoracic Surgery, Zurich University Hospital, Raemistrasse 100, 8091, Zurich, Switzerland. ilhan.inci@usz.ch."], "href": "/?term=Inci+I&cauthor_id=34554366"}], "refPMID": ["22797452", "24235821"], "citedInPMID": ["34554366"], "body": ""}
