Neither hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index nor elevated lactate levels could be identified as individual risk factors. IntroductionIntestinal ischemia (II) in critically ill patients is a life-threatening complication, leading to sepsis [1\u20133] caused by bacterial translocation [4\u20136] or direct fecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity. Congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery occlusive disease and age older than 60 years are recognized risk factors [7\u20139].The mortality in these patients is increased [10\u201312] and it is one of the major missed diagnoses in deceased patients treated in intensive care units (ICU), implying an even higher incidence [13\u201315]. Overall mortality is estimated between 50% to 80% [1\u20133].Surgical treatment within 24 hours (h) of diagnosis of II was identified as an independent predictor of survival, emphasizing the need for reliable risk stratification, specific markers, early detection and multidisciplinary management [16].Acute obstruction with or without previously stenotic arterial vessels, mesenteric venous thrombosis and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia because of impaired regional oxygen delivery are described as distinct pathophysiological entities leading to II. Although the splanchnic circulation receives approximately 20% of the cardiac output, several mechanisms like increased oxygen extraction and vascular autoregulation protect the intestines from ischemia. Nevertheless, a substantial reduction in oxygen delivery (DO2I in l/min/m\u00b2) can lead to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand and thereby cause II [7, 17\u201319]. The latter is of special interest for the intensivist as it might be preventable as insufficient DO2I due to low cardiac output (cardiac index, CI in l/min/m\u00b2) combined with mesenteric and systemic vasoconstriction (systemic vascular resistance index, SVRI) caused by endo- or exogenous catecholamines leading to insufficient locoregional oxygen supply [1, 2, 9, 12, 20, 21].Lactic acid, as well as pH, CO2 and central venous saturation (ScvO2), as routine parameters measured in the management of critically ill patients, are commonly used in a clinical setting to detect parenchymatous hypoxia, but the specificity for II is unknown. Furthermore, II per se induces lactic acid accumulation through parenchyma breakdown, as well as further pathological changes in the routine parameters.Thus, the primary aim of this study is:to define specific critical cut-off values for short term (the minimal DO2I during the 72 hours period before the diagnosis of II, minDO2I) or prolonged oxygen delivery (the mean DO2I during the 72 hours period before the diagnosis of II, meanDO2I) in the development of IISecondary objectives of this study are:to identify the role of the independent parameters (hemoglobin, Hb; arterial oxygen saturation, SaO2 and CI) of DO2I in the development of II;to identify the independent parameter (either Hb, SaO2 or CI) whose manipulation is most beneficial in order to increase DO2I to a noncritical value to reduce the risk of II;to evaluate the predictive power of elevated lactate levels, pH, CO2 and central venous saturation (ScvO2) for the diagnosis of II;to identify the influence of high SVRI on the development of II Material and methodsStudy designThis study was approved by the local ethics committee (Medizinische Ethikkommission II, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the University of Heidelberg, Mannheim) (registration number 2016-800R-MA). The study was also registered at the Deutsche Register f\u00fcr klinische Studien (ID: DRKS00016030).For this retrospective observational, non-interventional, monocenter case-control study the need for informed consent was waived by the local ethics committee.The study was conducted in the 25-bed ICU of the Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Medical Faculty Mannheim of the University of Heidelberg.Data were retrospectively analyzed. The inclusion period lasted from 02/2009 to 07/2017 with an average of 1869 patients per year.All patients who stayed longer than 72 hours, were older than 18 years and had a complete electronic medical record for calculating DO2I values were included in the analysis.Irreversible parenchymal ischemia is induced in a time frame between 6 and 12h of hypoxia in the intestinal vascular zone [12, 19, 22]. As the goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxemia on the development of II and to discriminate the diagnosis of II attributable to critical care management from the sequelae of underlying diseases associated with II and originated before ICU admission, we excluded patients with a length of stay (LOS) shorter than 72h to exclude patients with undiagnosed II at admission on the ICU.Furthermore, patients were excluded if they were <18 years old and if the electronic medical records were incomplete for calculating DO2I values.As the overall incidence of II is low [3, 23, 24] we opted to include commonly recognized factors and pre-existing conditions [1, 3, 9] for the stratification of the Cox proportional hazards model, that might predestine the patient for intestinal hypoxia in case of acute severe illness necessitating treatment on ICU. So, identified patients with an elevated baseline risk for II by the following criteria: 1) congestive heart failure, 2) diabetes mellitus, 3) peripheral artery occlusive disease, 4) age older than 60 years [7\u20139].Patients who developed II after admission with an ICU stay of at least 72h were grouped in the cases group to ensure a suitable amount of collected data for analysis.The diagnosis of II was confirmed by clinician validation of medical records when at least one of the following criteria was fulfilled:suggestive radiological signs for ischemiaendoscopic proof of ischemiaII specified in the pathology reportobvious ischemia detected intraoperatively without resection because of futility and an ICU stay of at least 72 hours before the surgical interventionAll other patients without the diagnosis of II during their treatment on ICU were included in the control group, were managed according to the standard operation procedures of our unit, and received radiological or endoscopic interventions respectively surgical interventions as indicated.Collection of dataAll data were collected through Philips IntelliVue Clinical Information Portfolio (ICIP) and Philips Intelli Space Critical Care and Anesthesia (ICCA) System. SaO2, Hb and lactic acid were measured routinely using a blood gas analyzer (Radiometer ABL 800 Flex, Radiometer, Willich, Germany).According to the standard operation procedures all patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function were managed with a triple-lumen central venous catheter. Additionally, a transpulmonary thermodilution catheter (Pulsiocath\u2122, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was utilized in patients, when indicated by the attending physician.The Pulse Contour Cardiac Output monitor (PiCCOplus\u2122, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was used for measuring CI and SVRI with routine calibrations around every 8h, averaging three daily DO2I-measurements.DO2I was calculated using a simplified version of the standard formula:\n\nDO2I(ml/min/m2)=CI(ml/min/m2)xSaO2xHb(g/dl)x1.34x10\n(Eq 1)\nAnd for calculating the SVRI we used the following formula:\n\nSVRI(dyn*s*cm\u22125*m2)=[(meanarterialpressure\u2212centralvenouspressure)CI]\u00d780\n(Eq 2)\nIn order to quantify an insufficient oxygen delivery index within 72h before the diagnosis, we calculated meanDO2I during the stay in ICU as a surrogate for a longer lasting hypoxic status and the minDO2I during the stay in ICU to capture shorter periods of hypoxia. Furthermore, we calculated the mean CI, mean SaO2, mean Hb and mean SVRI during the stay in ICU.Lactate levels were collected in the case group 72h before the diagnosis of II and in the control group we collected all lactate values over the ICU-stay. A plasma lactate concentration of 2mmol/l or less was defined as normal finding as this represents the clearing capacity for lactic acid in normal adults [25]. Statistical analysisMetric data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, categorical data as absolute frequency (percentage). P-values were calculated using the t-test and Fisher\u2019s exact test.Because some variables for the DO2I measurements were not synchronously recorded we allowed an 8h synchronization window for all variables for DO2I.Patients in the II group were matched according to the timepoint of the diagnosis of II (in hours) with patients in the control group and an equal LOS (in hours) without II. CI, SaO2, Hb, meanDO2I, minDO2I and meanSVRI from the last 72h was recorded in the individual patient with II and in all patients in the case group with a corresponding LOS.A stratified (by baseline risk) Cox proportional hazard model with time dependent covariates [26] was then applied to assess the relationship between these parameters and the development of II [7, 8].We allowed a nonlinear relationship between the regressor and the hazard to develop an II by the application of smoothed regression splines [27]. For each model we assessed the general model fit, the linearity and the non-linearity of the regressor function by appropriate likelihood ratio tests (LRT).In order to assess the effect of the individual components of DO2I (see Eq 1) we augmented the former meanDO2I model by the individual components (mean Hb, mean SaO2 or mean CI) to derive adjusted coefficients and compared them to the unadjusted coefficients derived from a model that contains only the component of DO2I (Hb, SaO2 and CI). Again, data from the last 72h of patients in the II group were matched with all control patients who had an equal LOS as the case.Furthermore, we compared the model fit of the augment model with the mean DO2I model and the model that contains only the component of DO2I as regressor by appropriate LRT to determine the relative importance of each independent component.We further conducted a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis\u2013sensitivity, specificity and Area under the ROC (AUROC) for lactate, pH, CO2, ScvO2 and their predictive value for II.Statistical analysis was performed with R 3.3.2 (The R foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [28] and the survival package and SAS 9.4 (Statistical Analysis System) [29, 30].A p-value \u2264 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. No adjustment for multiplicity was applied.All dedicated statistician (MH) was responsible for the calculations. ResultsFrom 02/2009 to 07/2017 we analyzed 15032 patients of whom 215 patients developed II during their ICU stay. 119 patients fulfilled the minimum required ICU stay of > 72h. 60 patients had to be excluded because no advanced hemodynamical monitoring was established. Thus, a total of 59 patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria (Fig 1). Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. We identified 33 female and 26 male II patients with an average age of 62.4 \u00b1 14.6 years. Patients with II had a significantly higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) score on admission than controls (47.3 \u00b1 13.7 vs. 43.1 \u00b1 13.1, p = 0.025). II was associated with a prolongation of the ICU stay (25.0 \u00b1 22.2 vs. 18.5 \u00b1 16.1, p = 0.032). ICU-mortality was higher in the II group (66.1%) compared to the control group (32.1%) (p < 0.0001). None of the evaluated comorbidities were significantly more prevalent in patients with II.Open in a separate windowFig 1Patient selection flow diagram.II = intestinal ischemia, LOS = length of stay, h = hour.Table 1Patients baseline characteristics.Intestinal ischemiaNonischemia controlsp-valuen59815Sex (m/f)26/33494/3210.0136Age (y)62.4 \u00b1 14.660.7 \u00b1 15.90.3766SAPS II (points)47.3 \u00b1 13.743.1 \u00b1 13.10.0247Length of stay (d)25.0 \u00b1 22.218.5 \u00b1 16.10.0316ICU-mortality39 (66.1%)262 (32.1%)<0.0001Congestive heart failure20 (33.9%)205 (25.2%)0.1642Diabetes mellitus25 (42.4%)378 (46.4%)0.5903Peripheral vascular occlusive disease8 (13.6%)56 (6.9%)0.0679Coronary heart disease8 (13.6%)155 (19.0%)0.3867COPD4 (6.8%)83 (10.2%)0.5041Artrial fibrillation29 (49.15%)297 (36.44%)0.069Chronic renal disease8 (13.56%)81 (9.94%)0.3714Nicotine abuse5 (8.47%)77 (9.45%)1.0Open in a separate windowPatients baseline characteristics; n = number of patients, m = male, f = female, y = year, SAPS II = simplified acute physiology score II, d = day, ICU = intensive care unit, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseWe found a significant non-linear influence of meanDO2I on ischemia hazard (LRT vs null model: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 3.23) = 10.536, p = 0.018; LRT for non-linearity: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 2.23) = 9.281, p = 0.012) (Fig 2A). The application of this model showed, that the relative ischemia hazard (reference: meanDO2I = 500ml/min/m2) is significantly elevated when meanDO2I falls below approximately 250ml/min/m2 and increases disproportionately with smaller values (Fig 2B).Open in a separate windowFig 2A.

B. Relative ischemia risk compared to mean DO2I within 72h before the onset of intestinal ischemia. Y-axis shows increasing relative ischemia risk with decreasing meanDO2I values (x-axis, solid line) by DO2I values below approximately 250ml/min/m2 (highlighted by the red marked area), dashed lines show the standard deviation, above the x-axis the 14.320 DO2I calculations are plotted as single small lines (critical DO2I values are highlighted as a red line), DO2I = oxygen delivery index, h = hours.We observed a qualitatively similar relationship between minDO2I and relative ischemia hazard (Fig 3). First, the influence of minDO2I was shown to be linear (LRT vs null model: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 1.39) = 6.8, p = 0.016; LRT for linearity: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 1.00) = 5.48, p = 0.019); LRT for non-linearity: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 0.39) = 1.103, p = 0.191), thus the increase for smaller values is less steep. Secondly, it was observed that the relative ischemia hazard is already significantly elevated at a minDO2I value of approximately 400ml/min/m2 compared to the reference value.Open in a separate windowFig 3Relative ischemia risk compared to min DO2I within 72h before the onset of intestinal ischemia.Y-axis shows increasing relative ischemia risk with lower minDO2I values (x-axis, solid line) by DO2I values below approximately 400ml/min/m2 (highlighted by the red marked area), dashed lines show the standard deviation, above the x-axis the 14.320 DO2I calculations are plotted as single small lines (critical DO2I values are highlighted as a red line), DO2I = oxygen delivery index, h = hours.Our assessment of the individual components of DO2I showed that no single component had a significant influence on the ischemia hazard no matter if we adjust for meanDO2I or not (Table 2). Consequently, we could not improve the model fit to our data of the meanDO2I model by adding individual components (all LRT p-values were at least 0.104), but we observed a significantly poorer model fit when we dropped meanDO2I from the model for each component (all LRT p-values were below 0.024).Table 2Individual component of DO2I.UnadjustedAdjustedComponentHRCoefSDp-valueHRCoefSDp-valueCI0.838-0.1770.1540.250.997-0.0030.2770.992SaO20.90-0.1080.0650.10.885-0.1220.0660.063Hb1.0010.0010.1010.9941.0300.030.1110.787Open in a separate windowIndividual component of DO2I; HR = hazard ratio, coef = coefficient, SD = standard deviation, p = p-value, CI = cardiac output index, SaO2 = arterial oxygen saturation, Hb = hemoglobinOur analysis of lactate levels showed that 51 Patients with II had lactate levels \u2265 2mmol/l (86%), eight patients showed lactate levels < 2mmol/l (14%) resulting in a sensitivity of 86.44%. In the control group there were 683 patients with lactate levels \u2265 2mmol/l (84%) and 132 (16%) patients with lactate levels < 2mmol/l, leading to a specificity of 16.2%. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was poor with an Area under the ROC of 0.5324. The analysis of pH also showed a very high sensitivity with 90%, but a very low specificity with 21%. Resulting in a poor receiver operating characteristics analysis with an area under the ROC of 0.52. Furthermore, the variables pCO2 and ScvO2 also did not perform well with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 38%, with a resulting ROC analysis of 0.6017 for CO2 and 77% sensitivity, specificity of 52%, and AUROC of 0.6786 for ScvO2, respectively (Fig 4).Open in a separate windowFig 4Receiver operating characteristics analysis for lactate, pH, CO2, ScvO2 and the development of intestinal ischemia.Panel A lactate: Area under the ROC curve: 0.5324; sensitivity 86.44% and specificity 16.2% for a cut-off value of lactate \u2265 2mmol/l; Panel B pH: Area under the ROC curve: 0.52; sensitivity 90% and specificity 21%; Panel C CO2: Area under the ROC curve: 0.6017; sensitivity 83% and specificity 38%; Panel D ScvO2: Area under the ROC curve: 06786.; sensitivity 77% and specificity 52%; ROC = Receiver operating characteristic.SVRI had no significant association with ischemia hazard (LRT vs null model: \u03c7\u00b2 (df = 1.41) = 2.522, p = 0.178) (Table 3).Table 3Influence of systemic vascular resistance.testchisqdfp-valuenull model2.5221.4140.178linear1.4001.0000.237non-linear0.6410.4140.219Open in a separate windowInfluence of systemic vascular resistance; Chisq = Chi-squared test, df = degrees of freedom DiscussionThe findings in this study were:There is a critical cut-off value for meanDO2I of approximately 250ml/min/m2 representing a longer state of insufficient oxygen delivery in a 72h timeframe before the clinical diagnosis of II which is affecting the risk for the development of II. Lower meanDO2I values strongly increase risk of II.Even a single minDO2I value smaller than 400ml/min/m2 increases the risk for II.Neither Hb, SaO2 nor CI as indiviual components of DO2I showed significant diagnostic superiority compared to DO2I in predicting II.Therapeutic decisions based on lactate, pH, CO2 or ScvO2 are not useful for the prevention or early detection of II especially because of their low specificity.In our analysis SVRI had no effect on the incidence of II.Delivery of oxygen and survivalTo our knowledge no prior study investigated whether there is a crucial DO2I cut off value for organ dysfunction like II. A meanDO2I of 250ml/min/m2 over 72h on ICU and a minDO2I value smaller than 400ml/min/m2 substantially increases the risk for developing II and could alert the attending clinician accordingly. The fact that minDO2I has an earlier effect on the development of II may be due to cellular compensatory mechanisms that have not yet been activated, in the sense of ischemic preconditioning.Ischemic preconditioning reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting and reducing the inflammatory response in the reperfusion phase [31].Single low DO2I events without ischemic preconditioning result in reduced mitochondrial ATP generation, as well as other pathological mechanisms. In the subsequent reperfusion, a pronounced inflammatory response occurs, which further exacerbates ischemia [31\u201333]. Guan et al. [34] showed using vivo microscopy that adverse effects due to short-term ischemia are partly completely reversible in the reperfusion phase. However, they showed that after prolonged periods of ischemia, normal cell structures and functions could not be fully restored in a large proportion of cells and during reperfusion further deterioration occurred.In the present study, this microscopically proven pathology by Guan et al. [34] is also supported, as short-term low DO2I values have a markedly lower risk of ischemia than longer-lasting low DO2I (meanDO2I) phases.There are no established guide values for DO2I and oxygen consumption for critically ill patients. In a normal resting adult the normal DO2I is approximately 500ml/kg/m\u00b2 assuming a CI of 2500 ml/min/m\u00b2, a Hb of 15 g/dl and a SaO2 of 100%, from which 125ml/min/m\u00b2 are consumed through the normal metabolism [35]. As a DO2I of 500ml/min/m\u00b2 is commonly reported as reference value in healthy subjects and typically not associated with II and post procedural complications it was chosen as a reference value [36, 37]. On top of that a DO2I of 500ml/min/m\u00b2 was tested as a safe endpoint for shock resuscitation [38].Shoemaker et al. studied hemodynamic parameters, DO2I and oxygen consumption in critically ill patients, showing a correlation between less organ failure as well as survival and supranormal values of DO2I, oxygen consumption and cardiac index [39\u201343]. The authors theorized that morbidity and mortality could be reduced in critically ill patients if these parameters were used as therapeutic goals.Subsequently, controlled randomized trials investigated the effect of hemodynamic optimization in critically ill patients, manipulating DO2I to supranormal values [43\u201350]. Several of these studies [43, 47\u201351] showed a decrease in mortality and morbidity when DO2I was manupilated to a supranormal value before surgery and during the peri- and postoperative period.A meta-analysis by Kern et al. [52] summarized relevant prospective randomized trials analyzing hemodynamic optimization in high-risk patients. In trials with hemodynamic optimization before the onset of organ dysfunction a significant reduction in mortality [47\u201351] could be demonstrated. Hemodynamic optimization after the onset of organ dysfunction however caused no related mortality reduction [44\u201346, 53]. Our data supports the idea that hemodynamic optimization before II became clinical apparent might prevent these complications in our cases. On the other hand, it remains speculative whether there is a significant risk reduction for II due to supranormal DO2I values.Effects of Hb, SaO2 and CO on IIRelevant studies in the field utilized standardized protocols to keep DO2I values in normal or supranormal levels by manipulating all DO2I components depending on arbitrarily elected cut-off values for CI, Hb and SaO2 [39\u201351, 53, 54]. None of them distinguished which component of DO2I is most effective to optimize. In this study we showed, that DO2I as a goal parameter for optimization might be relevant to prevent II, but the individual components seem equally important to prevent II.The role of lactate, pH, CO2 and ScvO2 in the diagnosis of IILactate is a well-known marker of parenchymatous hypoxia regularly reported in studies revising II [55\u201357] and its measurement is recommended in recent guidelines [3, 9]. On the other hand, many studies and meta-analyses confirm that the classical routine parameters are of no value in distinguishing patients with II from those without [9, 58, 59]. In a retrospective multicenter study by Leone et al. [60] investigating risk factors associated with ICU-mortality in patients with II, lactate levels higher than 2.7mmol/l were found to be an independent predictor for ICU-mortality. Yet the author pointed out that lactate is not a useful tool for diagnosis or exclusion of II, because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Bourcier et al. [61] investigated patients with suspected II and also collected lactate levels, showing no statistically significant difference between lactate levels of II patients and patients without II. In a prospective trial Murray et al. [62] found a significant elevation in D-lactate levels in patients with II compared to controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 87%. In summary, lactate not differentated in its D- and L- enantiomers appears to be a good parameter for mortality estimation [60, 63] but not a reliable paramter for the diagnosis of II.The goal of the study was to evaluate the correlation of DO2I and the development of II in patients treated on the ICU. So, we hypothesize a time dependent clinical inapparent sequence of clinical inapparent inadequate (locoregional) delivery of oxygen, inducing irreversible II and corresponding lactate accumulation leading to clinical detectable sequalae like vasomotor dysfunction and endothelial leak which then enable the clinician at the bedside to diagnose and manage II. We therefore wanted to connote our findings of a \u201ccut-off\u201d DO2I with the corresponding lactate levels. Our findings of relative high mean and minDO2I associated with II might help to explain the relative low sensitivity and specificity of lactate in the diagnosis of II.Cruz et al. [64] reported an increase in the intestinal-arterial pCO2 gradient in a model of small bowel ischemia-reperfusion that corresponded with the grade of the mucosal damage. In line with that finding, Siniscalchi et al. [65] found a significant lower pH and higher PaCO2 in patients who underwent small bowel transplantation comparing their baseline measurement and 120 minutes after reperfusion of the graft. The authors hypothesized that the fall of pH after the revascularization and the concomitant rise in PaCO2 was noted due the increased metabolic activity in the new organ. We hypothesized that an increase in PaCO2 or a reduction of pH, either due to lactic acidosis or due to transient reperfusion of underperfused intestinal organs might be a valuable parameter for II. As shown by our ROC analysis unfortunately neither pH nor PaCO2 showed a clinically useful specificity for the prediction of II. This might be caused by the relative insensitivity of global changes in both parameters compared to direct measurements in the intestinal mucosa. On the other hand, in a substantial part of critical ill patients hypercapnia and the corresponding acidosis are caused by guideline-compliant management [66, 67] and not associated with intestinal ischemia at all. The measurement of the central venous oxygen saturation is discussed in the recent guidelines for the management of septic shock and represents global oxygen extraction and utilization in critically ill patients [68]. As shown by Heino et al. [69] the oxygen extraction in II is increased. Unfortunately, as shown in our ROC analysis corresponding changes in ScvO2 lack the necessary specificity to represent a useful prognostic marker of II in a clinical setting. This finding might be caused by the dichotomy of the parameter regarding oxygen delivery. A low ScvO2 is usually a sign of hypoxia or insufficient cardiac output, an increased ScvO2 usually denotes an impaired oxygen extraction [70, 71].The role of SVRI in the development of intestinal ischemiaThe hypothesis that endo- or exogenouos catecholamines may induce II because of reduced oxygen delivery to intraabdominal organs due to mesenteric vasoconstriction is proposed in many guidelines and trials [1, 3, 9, 72]. In this study we utilized systemic vascular resistance index as surrogate for vasoconstriction irrespectively of exogenouos catecholamines. We found no significant correlation between SVRI and the incidence of II. It should be noted, as SVRI is the result of the physiological effects of endo- or exogenouos catecholamines, our analysis is indepented of the catechoalmine therapy and other therapeutical decisions of the attending physicians. LimitationsResults of this study were potential biased due to a different pre-existing disease profile, the heterogeneity of medical history and the clinical course, for example, new or different comorbidities in the investigated cohort. As it was the goal of this study to evaluate the effects of the delivery of oxygen and its independent parameters (Hb, arterial SaO2 and CI) on the development of II we tried to attenuate these factors by identifying and adjusting for anamenstic proxies and conditions for a higher risk of II like diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic heart failure, coronary heart and pulmonary diseases and used them for the stratification of the Cox model. Therefore we opted not to include factors like prognostic scores evaluating physiological criteria like APACHE II or SOFA score in the Cox model as they reflect acute severity of illness of the patient and not necessarily predestine the patient for II per se.As we had no opportunity to acquire advanced hemodynamic data like cardiac output from the patients included in this retrospective study prior to admission to the ICU we explicitly excluded patients with a length of stay shorter than 72h from the study. Naturally we suspect that patients suffering II prior to admission on the ICU might present a significant lower meanDO2I and minDO2I then the II group in this study. Therefore, we acknowledge that we probably evaluated a distinct subgroup of patients suffering II and our findings cannot be extrapolated to all patients with II.Furthermore we did not account for therapeutic interventions to manage II once the clinical diagnosis was made.Lastely, in the analysed cohort, surgical patients with abdominal pre-existing conditions might have biased the results. ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct correlation between the incidence of II and a critical DO2I value. Our findings emphasize the need to keep DO2I at an adequate level to prevent deterioration of the patients condition as well as their outcome due to the development of II. This crucial cut-off value for DO2I may enable intensive care physicians to identify patients at risk and also allow for optimization of therapy by manipulation of the DO2I parameters to prevent II.

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. It is a good retrospective study; however, I have some comments on the manuscript that need to be clarified or improved.In the introduction, they talk about the complications of intestinal ischemia and its incidence, however the bibliography used is not up-to-date. They talk about mortality percentages and the lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of intestinal ischemia using a 2004 work as a reference. There are works from the last 5 years on the subject that they could refer to. There are several publications on gastrointestinal dysfunction, Ischemia / reperfusion damage, which could be referenced.I think the study should be better founded, since several things that they mention about the variables they analyzed have already been studied and reported in critically ill patients and in various models of gastrointestinal ischemia.MethodologyWhat was the basis for defining the criteria used to define high risk of II? They were separated for being patients with cardiovascular problems and over 60 years of age. Why wasn't a criterion used like a certain score value on a scale like SOFA or APACHE? The criteria that they defined, in what way did they apply it?Why were patients with II on admission or who developed it in the first 72 hours in the ICU excluded from your study? It would have been interesting to evaluate his hemodynamic variables compared to what was observed days after admission to the ICU.How did you define the inclusion criteria for patients in the control group? In that group were there radiological studies, endoscopy or any pathology report that showed that they had no gastrointestinal involvement?Why was the DO2 not calculated based on LOS? If they have a lot of variability in the number of days of stay of the patients? They have patients of 3 days compared to patients of more than a month of stay.Nor does it seem appropriate to me that the variables of CI, SaO2, Hb and SVRI were averaged during the ICU stay with such variability in the days. Especially considering that these variables change rapidly in ICU according to the treatments.Why only analyze lactate, and not PCO2 or arterial and venous pH if you had the data?ResultsThe groups are very unbalanced, therefore the analyzes carried out have statistical significance when, in fact, due to the variability of the data, in groups with the same number of data, they would not present significant changes. Why not use some criteria to select the patients from the control group with whom the study cases are compared? If you have 59 cases of II vs. 815 as controls, why is there so much dispersion in the controls for all the variables analyzed?The figures have very poor quality, I suggest improving them all.Why use mean DO2I of 500 ml / min / m2 as a reference? If ICU patients normally have lower values?Regarding the lactate analysis, they have higher levels in the control group, if the n of each group are considered, for which I do not consider the ROC analysis they present adequate. Why not use venous oxygen saturation which reflects systemic oxygenation?There are studies reported in critically ill patients with ischemia showing that lactate is not a good marker. The same authors report some references related to its low sensitivity and specificity. So why did they use it to predict II?I believe that the discussion should better relate the results of this work with what was previously reported. Why not analyze gastrointestinal ischemia or ischemia / reperfusion studies and compare their findings if they are closely related to what they are presenting? Many of the ICU patients develop sepsis, did they record the comorbidities of the patients included in the study?It's interesting work, but I think the information and data analysis could be better presented.**********6.

In the introduction, they talk about the complications of intestinal ischemia and its incidence, however the bibliography used is not up-to-date. They talk about mortality percentages and the lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of intestinal ischemia using a 2004 work as a reference. There are works from the last 5 years on the subject that they could refer to. There are several publications on gastrointestinal dysfunction, Ischemia / reperfusion damage, which could be referenced.I think the study should be better founded, since several things that they mention about the variables they analyzed have already been studied and reported in critically ill patients and in various models of gastrointestinal ischemia.Re.: We thank the reviewer for addressing this important issue. We updated the references accordingly (citations 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 in the manuscript). Furthermore we precised the pathophysiological rationale of the study in the introduction (pages 3 and 4, lines 65-76).2. What was the basis for defining the criteria used to define high risk of II? They were separated for being patients with cardiovascular problems and over 60 years of age. Why wasn't a criterion used like a certain score value on a scale like SOFA or APACHE? The criteria that they defined, in what way did they apply it?Re.: This is a very important point and we would like to thank the Reviewer for this comment. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model we used to study the effect of various parameters on the instantaneous hazard experienced by individuals. For the stratification of the model, risk factors described in the literature (e.g. congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery occlusive disease and age older than 60 years) were considered and inserted into the model [1, 2]. As the overall incidence of intestinal ischemia is low [3-5] we opted to include commonly recognized factors and pre-existing conditions [5-7] in the hazards model, that might predestine the patient for intestinal hypoxia in case of acute severe illness necessitating treatment on ICU. We specified this in the materials section of the manuscript (pages 5 and 6, lines 119-124).Contrary to our knowledge prognostic scores evaluating acute physiological criteria like APACHE II or SOFA score are not recognized risk factors for the development of intestinal ischemia. As it was the goal of this study to evaluate the effects of the delivery of oxygen and its independent parameters (hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation and cardiac output) on the development of intestinal ischemia and not necessarily the acute severity of illness of the patient, acute physiological scores were not included in the stratification of the Cox proportional hazards model. We present the SAPS II score at admission of both groups in table 1 and included this point in the limitations (pages 19, lines 423-431).3. Why were patients with II on admission or who developed it in the first 72 hours in the ICU excluded from your study? It would have been interesting to evaluate his hemodynamic variables compared to what was observed days after admission to the ICU.Re.: This is an important point and merits careful consideration. The goal of the study was to evaluate the effects of the delivery of oxygen respectively hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation and cardiac output on the development of intestinal ischemia. Furthermore, we wanted to elaborate on the relevance of lactate, pH, PaCO2 and ScvO2 as indicators for parenchymal ischemia. As we had no opportunity to acquire advanced hemodynamic data like cardiac output from the patients included in this retrospective study prior to admission to the ICU, we explicitly excluded patients with a length of stay shorter than 72 hours from the study. Naturally we suspect that patients suffering II prior to admission on the ICU might present a significant lower meanDO2I and minDO2I then calculated in the II group in this study. Therefore, we acknowledge that we probably evaluated a distinct subgroup of patients suffering II and our findings cannot be extrapolated to all patients with II. We clarified this fact in the Material and Methods section (page 5, line 111-118) and discussed it in the limitations section of the manuscript (page 19, lines 432-438).4. How did you define the inclusion criteria for patients in the control group? In that group were there radiological studies, endoscopy or any pathology report that showed that they had no gastrointestinal involvement?Re.: We would like to thank the Reviewer for this important comment. For the control group all patients were included when they were older than 18 years and the ICU-stay was longer than 72 hours and there was no clinical diagnosis of II. Furthermore, all patients included in the study were managed according to the standard operation procedures of our unit and received radiological or endoscopic interventions respectively surgical interventions as indicated (page 6, line 136-139).5. Why was the DO2 not calculated based on LOS? If they have a lot of variability in the number of days of stay of the patients? They have patients of 3 days compared to patients of more than a month of stay.Re.: Patients in the II group were matched according to the timepoint of the diagnosis of II (in hours) with patients in the control group and an equal LOS (in hours) without II. CI, SaO2, Hb, meanDO2I, minDO2I and meanSVRI from the last 72 hours was recorded in the individual patient with II and in all patients in the case group with a corresponding LOS. A stratified (by baseline risk) Cox proportional hazard model with time dependent covariates [8] was then applied to assess the relationship between these parameters and the development of II.We also represented this fact graphically, by showing the number of DO2I measurements below the figures 2A, 2B and 3, respectively by means of dashes (page 11 lines 236-237, page 11 lines 242-244 and pages 11 and 12 lines 256-258). The more dashes are shown, the more DO2I calculations were performed, resulting in a total 14.320 single DO2I measurements for analysis. We clarified this in the Material and Methods section (page 8, lines 174-180 and lines 190-192).6. Nor does it seem appropriate to me that the variables of CI, SaO2, Hb and SVRI were averaged during the ICU stay with such variability in the days. Especially considering that these variables change rapidly in ICU according to the treatments.Re.: This is a very correct statement and we thank the reviewer for the chance to describe this point more detailed. This is a correct statement and we thank the reviewer for the chance to describe this point in more detail. Again, the length of stay was considered in the analysis. First the timepoint of intestinal ischemia was detected in the case group and subsequently the last 72 hours were reviewed. Within these 72 hours meanCI, minSaO2, meanHb and meanSVRI were calculated in patients with II and in the corresponding cases without II and an equal LOS.For the control group, all patients were considered who had the same length of stay and no intestinal ischemia at this timepoint. Then meanDO2I, minDO2I and SVRI were also calculated retrospectively for 72 hours. This allowed to take the possible rapid changes in CI, SaO2, Hb and SVRI into account.7. Why only analyze lactate, and not PCO2 or arterial and venous pH if you had the data?Re.: According to the recommendations of the reviewer we included ROC analysis of pH, paCO2 and ScvO2 in the manuscript and discussed their value for the prediction of II in the context of our retrospective study (discussion pages 17 and 18, lines 387-408).8. The groups are very unbalanced, therefore the analyzes carried out have statistical significance when, in fact, due to the variability of the data, in groups with the same number of data, they would not present significant changes. Why not use some criteria to select the patients from the control group with whom the study cases are compared? If you have 59 cases of II vs. 815 as controls, why is there so much dispersion in the controls for all the variables analyzed?Re.: We fully agree with the reviewer regarding the large difference in the patients included in the II and control group reflecting the low incidence of II and potentially compromising the analysis. Patients in the II group were matched according to the timepoint of the diagnosis of II (in hours) with patients in the control group and an equal LOS (in hours) without II.We specified this in the Materials and Methods section (page 8, lines 174-180 and lines 190-192). The project was accompanied by a dedicated statistician who is one of the authors of the manuscript (M.H.) to ensure comparability of the case and control groups.9. The figures have very poor quality, I suggest improving them all.Re.: We improved the quality of the figures accordingly to the recommendations of the reviewer.10. Why use mean DO2I of 500 ml / min / m2 as a reference? If ICU patients normally have lower values?Re.: The reviewer comments on an important issue regarding our chosen reference point for the analysis. Of course, we fully agree that critically ill patients often present with a low DO2I before and at admission on the ICU which we were not able to monitor reliably. It is reasonable to assume that this insufficient oxygen delivery might trigger pathophysiological mechanisms causing intestinal ischemia which is then detected at ICU. Because of this we choose to exclude patients with II manifesting in the first 72 hours of intensive care treatment. As a DO2I of 500ml/min/m\u00b2 is commonly reported as reference value in healthy subjects and typically not associated with intestinal ischemia and post procedural complications it was chosen as a reference value [9, 10]. On top of that a DO2I of 500ml/min/m2 was tested as a safe endpoint for shock resuscitation [11]. We commented on this in the Discussion section (page 15, lines 331-334).11. Regarding the lactate analysis, they have higher levels in the control group, if the n of each group are considered, for which I do not consider the ROC analysis they present adequate. Why not use venous oxygen saturation which reflects systemic oxygenation?Re.: The reviewer comments on the diagnostic value of lactate which we agree is an important fact. Regarding the apprehension of an uneven distribution of the lactate levels, please find enclosed in Fig 1 the lactate levels incorporated in the ROC analysis in the manuscript (control group: 3.5 (2.3/6.4) mmol/l vs. intestinal ischemia: 4.5 (2.3/7.3) mmol/l, p = 0.345). Furthermore, we now included ROC analyses of pH, PaCO2 and ScvO2 in the manuscript (page 12, lines 270-276 and Fig 4).Fig 1.: Lactate levels12. There are studies reported in critically ill patients with ischemia showing that lactate is not a good marker. The same authors report some references related to its low sensitivity and specificity. So why did they use it to predict II?Re.: We fully agree with the reviewer on the limited clinical value of lactate as a predictive marker on intestinal ischemia in a relevant part of the literature. Nevertheless, as it was the aim of this study to define a delivery of oxygen resulting in II. It is undisputed, that lactate is an important metabolic marker indicating parenchymal ischemia [12] and various shock states [13, 14]. Furthermore, the measurement of lactate is recommended in current guidelines for intestinal ischemia [5, 7]. We therefore wanted to connote our findings of a \u201ccut-off\u201d DO2I with the corresponding lactate levels. Because of this our findings of relative high mean and minDO2I associated with II might help to explain the relative low sensitivity and specificity of lactate in the diagnosis of II. We elaborated on this in the discussion (page 17, lines 377-385).13. I believe that the discussion should better relate the results of this work with what was previously reported. Why not analyze gastrointestinal ischemia or ischemia / reperfusion studies and compare their findings if they are closely related to what they are presenting? Many of the ICU patients develop sepsis, did they record the comorbidities of the patients included in the study?Re.: According to the recommendations of the reviewer we restructured the discussion (pages 13-18, lines 296-418)Literature: 1.
