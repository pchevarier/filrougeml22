{"title": "Using sequence clustering to identify clinically relevant subphenotypes in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit", "pubDate": "2022", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1093/jamia/ocab252", "PMID": "35092685", "abstract": "Objective:                       The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has heterogenous clinical courses, indicating that there might be distinct subphenotypes in critically ill patients. Although prior research has identified these subphenotypes, the temporal pattern of multiple clinical features has not been considered in cluster models. We aimed to identify temporal subphenotypes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 using a novel sequence cluster analysis and associate them with clinically relevant outcomes.                  Materials and methods:                       We analyzed 1036 confirmed critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York city. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering method was used with Levenshtein distance and Ward's minimum variance linkage.                  Results:                       We identified four subphenotypes. Subphenotype I (N = 233 [22.5%]) included patients with rapid respirations and a rapid heartbeat but less need for invasive interventions within the first 24 hours, along with a relatively good prognosis. Subphenotype II (N = 418 [40.3%]) represented patients with the least degree of ailments, relatively low mortality, and the highest probability of discharge from the hospital. Subphenotype III (N = 259 [25.0%]) represented patients who experienced clinical deterioration during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit admission, leading to poor outcomes. Subphenotype IV (N = 126 [12.2%]) represented an acute respiratory distress syndrome trajectory with an almost universal need for mechanical ventilation.                  Conclusion:                       We utilized the sequence cluster analysis to identify clinical subphenotypes in critically ill COVID-19 patients who had distinct temporal patterns and different clinical outcomes. This study points toward the utility of including temporal information in subphenotyping approaches.", "author": [{"author": "Wonsuk Oh", "affiliation": ["Hasso Plattner Institute of Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Division of Data Driven and Digital Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Oh+W&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Pushkala Jayaraman", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Division of Data Driven and Digital Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jayaraman+P&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Ashwin S Sawant", "affiliation": ["Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Sawant+AS&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Lili Chan", "affiliation": ["Division of Data Driven and Digital Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Chan+L&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Matthew A Levin", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Levin+MA&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Alexander W Charney", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Pamela Sklar Division of Psychiatric Genomics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Charney+AW&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Patricia Kovatch", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Pharmacological Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Kovatch+P&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Benjamin S Glicksberg", "affiliation": ["Hasso Plattner Institute of Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Glicksberg+BS&cauthor_id=35092685"}, {"author": "Girish N Nadkarni", "affiliation": ["Hasso Plattner Institute of Digital Health, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Mount Sinai Clinical Intelligence Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Division of Data Driven and Digital Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.", "Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA."], "href": "/?term=Nadkarni+GN&cauthor_id=35092685"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["35092685"], "body": ""}
