Here we identify a novel\nactivity of the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP in regulating\npromoter-proximal paused Pol II. We find that Drosophila CBP\ninhibition results in \u201cdribbling\u201d of Pol II from the pause site\nto positions further downstream, but impedes transcription through the\n+1 nucleosome genome-wide. Promoters strongly occupied by CBP and\nGAGA-factor have high levels of paused Pol II, a unique chromatin signature and\nare highly expressed regardless of cell type. Interestingly, CBP activity is\nrate-limiting for Pol II recruitment to these highly-paused promoters through an\ninteraction with TFIIB, but for transit into elongation by histone acetylation\nat other genes. Thus, CBP directly stimulates both Pol II recruitment and the\nability to traverse the first nucleosome, thereby promoting transcription of\nmost genes. IntroductionRegulation of transcription occurs at two major steps in metazoans (reviewed\nby Core and Lis, 2008). The first step is the\nrecruitment of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to the promoter, which is orchestrated by\nsequence-specific transcription factors that enable formation of a pre-initiation\ncomplex (PIC), consisting of Pol II and general transcription factors (GTFs). A\nsuccessful formation of the PIC leads to rapid initiation and transcription of 20 to\n60 nucleotides (Core et al., 2012). This\nbrings Pol II to the second step of regulation where it pauses on many genes, an\nevent mediated by the action of NELF and DSIF. The release of paused Pol II into\nproductive elongation requires recruitment of P-TEFb kinase, which phosphorylates\nthese pausing factors and the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) (reviewed in Zhou et al., 2012). Although pausing\ntemporarily restrains Pol II from entering elongation, a majority of paused genes\nare highly expressed (reviewed in Adelman and Lis,\n2012). In most instances, pausing may therefore be a rheostat-like\nmechanism to maintain and tune expression rather than to function as an on-off\nswitch.GAGA-factor (GAF, also known as Trithorax-like, Trl) is a sequence-specific\ntranscription factor that is associated with 20% of expressed genes in\nDrosophila, and appears to have a role in both regulated steps\n(Li et al., 2013). GAF affects the first\nstep by recruiting chromatin remodelers (Shimojima\net al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2001)\nleading to local removal of nucleosomes (Fuda et\nal., 2015), and it promotes PIC formation by interacting with TFIID\n(Chopra et al., 2008). GAF also recruits\nNELF, which helps to establish Pol II pausing (Li et\nal., 2013).Our understanding of how specific chromatin regulators are recruited to\npromoters and how they regulate the two major steps in transcription is incomplete.\nCREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 are widely used transcriptional\nco-regulators with over 400 interaction partners (reviewed in Bedford et al., 2010). p300/CBP has histone\nacetyltransferase (HAT) activity and is known to acetylate lysine 18 and 27 of\nhistone H3 and lysine 8 of histone H4, establishing an active chromatin state (Feller et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2011; Tie et\nal., 2009). p300/CBP is well known for its role at enhancers, and\ngenome-wide mapping of CBP occupancy has been used to find novel enhancers both in\nmice and flies (Negre et al., 2011; Visel et al., 2009). However, p300/CBP occupies\nalso other regulatory elements, including promoters (Philip et al., 2015; Wang et al.,\n2009). The mechanisms by which p300/CBP regulates transcription are not\nfully understood and a potential direct role for p300/CBP at promoters is a key\nunanswered question.In Drosophila, there is only one homolog of p300 and CBP\n(known as nejire), referred to as CBP in this manuscript. As in\nother organisms, a majority of Drosophila CBP peaks are found at\nenhancers (Philip et al., 2015). Herein, we\nanalyzed the functions of this sole p300/CBP homolog at gene promoters in\nDrosophila S2 cells. We discovered that promoters co-occupied\nby CBP and GAF identify the most highly paused genes in the genome, that these\npromoters are enriched for a unique set of chromatin factors and modifications, and\nthat transcription of these genes are the most CBP dependent. CBP is required for\nmaintaining Pol II at the pause site, and facilitates efficient release of paused\nPol II into productive elongation by overcoming the transcriptional barrier caused\nby the +1 nucleosome. CBP is also important for efficient Pol II recruitment\nto promoters by interacting with TFIIB. Our data suggest that CBP activity is\nrate-limiting for Pol II recruitment to promoters co-occupied by CBP and GAF, but\nfor transit into elongation by histone acetylation at other genes. Thus, we identify\na novel regulatory role for CBP at promoters. ResultsCBP occupies the promoters of virtually all expressed genes in S2\ncellsTo investigate the function of CBP in transcriptional control, we\nreanalyzed our previously described CBP ChIP-seq of Drosophila\nS2 cell chromatin (Philip et al., 2015)\nand determined the presence of CBP at expressed gene promoters (5400 genes based\non RNA-seq, as defined in Cherbas et al.,\n2011). We plotted CBP occupancy and compared it to GAF (Fuda et al., 2015) and Pol II (Roy et al., 2010) data (Fig. 1A). This showed that CBP occupancy is higher\nthan background (genomic mean) at virtually all promoters of expressed genes.\nConsistent with this notion, we found that the mean CBP occupancy was\nsignificantly higher at expressed than at non-expressed genes (Fig. 1B). It is possible that binding in the open\nchromatin of expressed promoters represent false positive \u201cphantom\npeaks\u201d described previously (Jain et\nal., 2015). However, there is a high concordance in the magnitude by\nwhich a CBP inhibitor affects transcription and the level of CBP occupancy\n(described in later sections, Fig. 3B),\nstrongly suggesting functional CBP binding to most expressed promoters. We\nconclude that CBP can be found at the promoters of almost all genes expressed in\nS2 cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Promoters occupied by both CBP and GAF are highly paused(A) CBP, GAF and Pol II occupancy in Drosophila S2\ncells plotted around the TSS of all expressed genes (defined in (Cherbas et al., 2011), n=5400), sorted on CBP\nbinding strength. (B) All Drosophila genes were\nbinned according to expression value (log2 RPKM) and the mean CBP\noccupancy calculated for each bin. Promoters of expressed genes (>300 RPKM\n(Cherbas et al., 2011), shaded green)\nshow stronger CBP enrichment than promoters of non- or less-expressed genes.\n(C) The 5400 expressed genes in S2 cells (as defined in (Cherbas et al., 2011)) were ranked according\nto the amount of CBP or GAF at their promoter and plotted against their pausing\nindex (Kwak et al., 2013).\n(D) Expressed genes were divided into 20 equally sized promoter\nbins based on the combined GAF + CBP rank order, and plotted against\naverage Pol II pausing index (Kwak et al.,\n2013). Bins 19 and 20 have the highest CBP + GAF enrichment\nand the highest pausing index, (high CBP + GAF, HCG, colored red in\npanels C\u2013D), bins 15\u201318 are medium-paused and have medium CBP\nand GAF enrichment (MCG, orange), and bins 1\u201314 are lowly-paused and\nhave the least CBP + GAF (LCG, grey). Whiskers represent\n+/\u2212 95% confidence interval. See also Figure S1 and Table S1.Strong CBP and GAF occupancy identifies a set of highly-paused\npromotersTo find factors that may be involved in recruiting CBP to promoters, we\nsearched for sequence motifs in a +/\u2212 100 bp window centered on\nthe CBP summit at expressed promoters. We found that a (GA)n repeat\nis the most enriched motif in these sequences (E-value of 3.8e-038, Fig. S1A), and that its\nmean distance to the TSS is 177 bp upstream. We therefore plotted the promoter\noccupancy of the GAGA-motif binding factor GAF (Adkins et al., 2006), sorted on CBP binding strength. This shows\nthat at promoters with the highest CBP enrichment, both CBP and GAF are present,\nwhereas promoters with less CBP occupancy in most cases have very little or no\nGAF (Fig. 1A). Although we could not detect\na direct interaction between GAF and CBP, we found that CBP occupancy was\nreduced at several loci upon GAF knock-down (Fig. S1B). Because GAF is known to\nbe required to generate nucleosome depleted regions (Fuda et al., 2015) through its interaction with\nnucleosome remodelers like NURF (Xiao et al.,\n2001), GAF may be facilitating CBP occupancy indirectly through its\nopening of chromatin.Whereas GAF is strongly associated with Pol II pausing (Duarte et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2008), a function for CBP in pausing has not been\npreviously described. To examine the relation between CBP, GAF and pausing, we\nranked the promoters of all 5400 expressed genes by the amount of CBP or GAF at\nthe promoter (to account for differences in ChIP-seq enrichment), and plotted\nthe CBP and GAF rank against the pausing index of the corresponding promoter\n(Fig. 1C). The pausing index (data from\nKwak et al., 2013) is the ratio of\nPol II occupancy at the promoter versus the gene-body. This shows that there is\na strong correlation between pausing, GAF, and CBP occupancy (Fig 1C). Because of this correlation, we sorted all\nexpressed genes according to the combined CBP and GAF promoter rank, and divided\nthem into 20 equally sized bins (Table S1). Bin 1 has the lowest\nenrichment of CBP + GAF and bin 20 the highest. We then plotted the\naverage pausing index of these 20 bins (Fig.\n1D). Bins 19 and 20 contain genes with significantly higher pausing\nindex than genes in the other bins (Fig.\n1D). We will refer to the 540 promoters in these bins as high CBP and GAF\n(HCG) promoters. Promoters in bin 15\u201318 are medium-paused and have\nmedium CBP and GAF enrichment (MCG), whereas promoters in bins 1\u201314 are\nlowly-paused and have the least CBP and GAF (LCG, Fig. 1D and Fig.\nS1C). We performed ChIP-seq with another antibody raised against a\ndifferent part of CBP (Lilja et al.,\n2007), which confirmed that HCG promoters are associated with the\ngreatest amount of CBP (Fig.\nS1C).Although the HCG class (labeled red in Fig. 1C and D) has the highest mean pausing index, not all\nhighly-paused genes are found in this class. Genes with a high pausing index but\nlow amounts of GAF and/or CBP are found in the other promoter bins. However,\nonly 6 promoters with a high GAF rank have a high pausing index but are in the\nLCG class due to a low CBP rank (Fig. S1D). Thus, most paused,\nGAF-bound promoters also contain plenty of CBP. There are also about 430 genes\nthat are paused but not expressed in S2 cells, but in this study we only examine\nexpressed genes.Together, our analyses show that promoters from genes bound by both CBP\nand GAF are highly paused, and indicate that CBP contributes to\npromoter-proximal pausing.High CBP and GAF promoters contain more PIC components than other\npromotersWe expected promoters of highly-paused genes to contain more\npause-related factors and polymerase than other gene promoters. We therefore\nplotted the average occupancy of the pause-inducing factor NELF (data from Gilchrist et al., 2010) and Pol II (data\nfrom Roy et al., 2010) at LCG, MCG and\nHCG promoters (+/\u2212 500 bp around the TSS, Fig. 2A). This showed that HCG promoters contain more\nof both NELF and Pol II than promoters of other expressed genes, as expected\n(2.8 fold more NELF and 1.7 fold more Pol II at HCG vs LCG promoters, Fig. 2A). More Pol II and more pausing at\nthese promoters relative to other promoters could be caused by inefficient\nrelease from pausing, more efficient Pol II recruitment, or a combination of\nboth. We therefore plotted mean occupancy of the GTF TFIIA, which is involved in\nPol II recruitment (data from Gilchrist et al.,\n2010), and found that the HCG promoters contain 2.0 fold higher\nlevels of TFIIA than LCG genes (Fig. 2A).\nThis result argues that efficient Pol II recruitment contributes to high pausing\nand Pol II occupancy. Our CBP inhibitor studies described below are consistent\nwith efficient recruitment of Pol II to HCG promoters.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Unique chromatin features of promoters with high CBP and GAF\nenrichment(A) Average Pol II, NELF and TFIIA (Gilchrist et al., 2010; Roy et al.,\n2010) scaled enrichment in the 5400 promoters of expressed genes with\nlow (LCG), medium (MCG), and high CBP + GAF (HCG).\n(B\u2013C) Enrichment (fold over 2 background\nloci) of Pol II (Rpb3 antibody) (B) and TBP (C) at LCG\n(flw, Gaq, CG14995), MCG (BTBD9), and HCG\npromoters (Mrp4, rho, hsp70) measured by ChIP-qPCR\n(n=2\u20135).

HCG,\nMCG and LCG promoters according to the S2 ranking are color coded. See also\nFigures\nS2\u2013S3 and Tables S1\u2013S2.To confirm a higher concentration of PIC components at HCG promoters, we\nselected seven genes with similar levels of expression in S2 cells for further\nanalysis. The genes flw, G\u03b1q, and\nCG14995 belong to the LCG class, BTBD9 to\nMCG, whereas Mrp4 and rho are in the HCG\nclass. We compared these genes to the most extensively characterized paused\ngene, the Drosophila hsp70 heat-shock gene,\nwhich is masked from our genome-wide dataset due to its repetitive nature.\nChIP-qPCR showed that HCG promoters (Mrp4, rho) and\nhsp70 contain significantly more Pol II (10 fold), CBP (2.4\nfold), GAF (10 fold) as well as the GTFs TBP (2.4 fold), TFIIA (2.6 fold), and\nTFIIB (3.2 fold) than the four other promoters (p<0.05, Fig. 2B, C and Fig. S2A). Together, these results\nshow that HCG promoters strongly occupied by CBP and GAF contain substantially\nmore of the general transcriptional machinery than promoters of other expressed\ngenes. This indicates that Pol II is efficiently recruited to these promoters,\nand that the forces that act to recruit Pol II might also conspire to retain\nearly elongating Pol II to the proximal pause region (Kwak et al., 2013).High CBP and GAF promoters are enriched in specific chromatin factors and\nhistone modificationsWe extended our analysis in order to identify other factors and\nchromatin modifications enriched at HCG promoters. We plotted 40 previously\nmapped factors in S2 cells (data from Enderle et\nal., 2011; Roy et al., 2010)\nand found that Trithorax, Ash1 and Mi-2 are also enriched at HCG promoters\n(Fig. S2B), whereas\nthe insulator proteins BEAF-32 and CP190 and the chromodomain protein MRG15 are\ndepleted compared to other promoters (Fig. S2C).Next, we plotted the mean levels of 25 previously mapped histone\nmodifications (Roy et al., 2010) and\nfound that HCG promoters are enriched in marks associated with enhancers, H3K4\nmonomethylation (H3K4me1, 2.5 fold), H3K18 and H3K27 acetylation (H3K18ac, 2.0\nfold and H3K27ac, 1.9 fold), but depleted in H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4K16ac (1.5,\n1.1, and 1.8 fold) relative to LCG promoters (Fig.\n2D and E). Furthermore, the chromatin state of HCG promoters differs\nfrom most other promoters of expressed genes (using the 30 chromatin states\nmodel defined in the modENCODE project (Roy et\nal., 2010), Fig.\nS2D). Many HCG promoters are found in open chromatin (Fig. S2D), and are more DNAseI\nhypersensitive than promoters of other expressed genes (Fig. S2E). An example of the\ndifference between HCG promoters and other promoters can be seen by comparing\nthe rho locus (HCG) to G\u03b1q (LCG, Fig. 2F). The rho locus is\nassociated with more Pol II, TFIIA and H3K27ac, but less H4K16ac and H3K4me3,\nthan G\u03b1q.We wanted to know if the characteristics of HCG promoters is mainly due\nto the presence of CBP or to GAF, and therefore plotted enrichment of all other\nfactors and histone modifications against CBP and GAF occupancy levels\nseparately (Fig. S3).\nHowever, these individual profiles are very similar to the ones obtained with\nthe combined CBP+GAF rank, thereby preventing us from separating the\nrole of CBP and GAF in the unique features of HCG promoters. Taken together, our\nresults show that promoters of some highly-paused genes are strongly occupied by\nboth CBP and GAF, and further enriched and depleted in specific chromatin\nfactors and histone modifications relative to promoters of other expressed\ngenes.High CBP and GAF promoters are largely shared among cell types and strongly\nexpressed during developmentGenes with these HCG promoters are among the most highly expressed in S2\ncells, despite their high pausing (Fig. S2F). Examination of gene\nexpression at different developmental stages showed that mRNAs from HCG genes\nare not the most abundant in early embryos (Fig.\n2G). However, at later stages of embryo development, expression of\nother genes decreases whereas HCG genes remain strongly expressed, so that in\nlate embryos, larvae, pupae and adults, they are the most highly expressed\n(Fig. 2G). Gene ontology analysis of\nthe HCG class showed that they are enriched for the developmental processes\nimaginal disc development, epithelium development and gamete generation (Fig. S2G and Table S2). Indeed, many\ndevelopmental transcription factors and signaling components, but also several\nhouse-keeping and metabolic genes are found within this class (Table S1). This combination of\ngenes may explain their high mean expression throughout development.Since many of the HCG genes are strongly expressed at different\ndevelopmental stages, some of their features may be found in other cell types.\nWe therefore used ChIP-seq data from early embryos to rank promoters according\nto CBP and GAF occupancy (Holmqvist et al.,\n2012; Roy et al., 2010).\nWhereas S2 cells are macrophage-like immune cells derived from late embryos\n(Schneider, 1972), early embryos\nconsist of multipotent cells that are yet to enter terminal differentiation. We\nplotted the CBP+GAF ranking in S2 cells versus the ranking in early\nembryos and found that most of the promoters from the HCG class in S2 cells are\nalso the most strongly occupied by CBP+GAF in embryos (Fig. 2H). This suggests that HCG promoters are largely\nshared between these very different cell types. Indeed, 318 of the 540 HCG\npromoters in S2 cells are among the 540 top CBP+GAF ranked promoters in\nearly embryos (Fig.\nS2H).Taken together, our results indicate that HCG genes are highly\naccessible for transcription in different cell types, allowing them to maintain\na strong expression and be tuned by various developmental and metabolic\nsignals.CBP is required for transcription of thousands of genes and impacts High CBP\nand GAF genes most stronglyTo investigate CBP\u2019s functions in transcription, we used a\npreviously described inhibitor, C646, that selectively inhibits the catalytic\nactivity of CBP (Bowers et al., 2010). To\naccount for potential off-target effects of C646 we used C37 as a control, a\ncompound very similar in structure to C646 but that shows no effect on CBP HAT\nactivity (Bowers et al., 2010). C646 and\nrelated inhibitors have previously been shown to affect histone acetylation in\nDrosophila and mammalian cells within minutes (Crump et al., 2011; Dancy et al., 2012). To assess the immediate\ntranscriptional response to CBP inhibition genome-wide, we performed precision\nrun-on sequencing (PRO-seq) with S2 cells treated with C37 (control) or C646 for\n10 min. This technique maps transcriptionally engaged Pol II with single\nnucleotide resolution (Kwak et al.,\n2013). The two biological replicates of each treatment showed strong\ncorrelation (Fig. S4).\nAfter normalization, we quantified the change in PRO-seq density upon CBP\ninhibition at all genes. We found 3790 genes with significant (p<0.001)\ndown-regulation but only 42 genes with significant upregulation in gene-body\nPRO-seq density in C646-treated cells (Fig.\n3A). However, all 42 up-regulated genes appear to represent\nfalse-positives, because the PRO-seq density increase occurs only in the\npromoter-proximal region. These reads were attributed to the gene-body because\nthe genes are very short (Fig.\nS4). We therefore conclude that the only direct effect of CBP\ninhibition is transcription down-regulation.Open in a separate windowFigure 3CBP inhibition affects Pol II occupancy and transcription(A) Difference in gene-body (500 bp downstream of TSS to 100 bp\nupstream of poly A site) precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) reads between 10\nmin CBP-inhibitor (C646, CBP-Inh) and control drug (C37, Ctrl)-treated S2 cells\nafter normalization. 3790 genes were down-regulated.

Occupancy at the indicated gene promoters is plotted\nrelative to control-treated cells. Error bars represent S.E.M.,\nn=2\u20135. A significant difference between C646- and\ncontrol-treated cells for the genes as a group is indicated by an asterisk below\nthe time points (two-tailed paired t-test, p<0.05). See also Figures S4\u2013S5.To determine if transcription down-regulation upon CBP inhibition is\nrelated to CBP levels, we plotted the change in gene-body PRO-seq density versus\nCBP enrichment (Fig. 3B). This shows an\nimpressive correlation between the level of CBP occupancy at the promoter and\nthe effect of CBP inhibition on transcription, arguing that C646 is indeed\nspecific to CBP and that CBP promoter occupancy is functionally relevant to\ntranscription. Note that even genes with the least CBP at their promoters are\ndown-regulated upon CBP inhibition, which is consistent with occupancy of CBP at\nvirtually all expressed genes (Fig. 1A and\nB). We then compared the PRO-seq change in LCG, MCG and HCG genes,\nand found that HCG genes are most strongly down-regulated after CBP inhibition\n(Fig. 3C). In summary, a large fraction\nof genes expressed in S2 cells require CBP for normal transcription, and those\nwith strongest CBP promoter enrichment are the most CBP-dependent.CBP inhibition reduces Pol II occupancy at High CBP and GAF promotersNext, we wanted to investigate the step or steps during transcription\nwhere CBP plays a key role and assess if this role differs between HCG and other\npromoters. We started by measuring CBP and Pol II occupancy at promoters after\nCBP inhibition by ChIP-qPCR. We found that CBP occupancy is affected as early as\n1 min after CBP inhibition at 6 out of 7 tested promoters, and is further\ndecreased as the CBP inhibition progressed (p<0.05, Fig. 3D). Using an antibody against the Rpb3 subunit\nof Pol II, we observed that LCG and MCG promoters showed an increase in total\nPol II occupancy at 10 and 60 min after CBP inhibition, followed by a decrease\nat 4 hours of treatment (Fig. 3E). By\ncontrast, Pol II occupancy decreased much earlier after CBP inhibition at HCG\npromoters (Mrp4, rho and hsp70).To confirm that these effects are specific to CBP, we knocked down CBP\nlevels by RNAi and used another CBP inhibitor. Treating cells for 60 min with\ncurcumin (that also inhibits CBP activity) resulted in a strong decrease of Pol\nII occupancy at HCG promoters, whereas LCG and MCG promoters were less strongly\naffected (Fig. S5A).\nSimilarly, CBP RNAi had a significantly stronger effect on Pol II occupancy at\nHCG promoters than at promoters of LCG and MCG genes, whereas occupancy of CBP\nitself was reduced to a comparable extent at all tested promoters (Fig. S5B). These\nobservations indicate that promoters differ in their response to CBP inhibition\nand that Pol II promoter occupancy at HCG genes is particularly\nCBP-dependent.CBP is essential for the release of paused Pol II into productive\nelongationThe difference in Pol II occupancy between HCG and other promoters upon\nCBP inhibition at individual genes prompted us to look at Pol II occupancy at\npromoters genome-wide. We measured the PRO-seq signal in the promoter-proximal\nregion (from TSS to 300 bp downstream) of all genes that show significant\ndown-regulation in gene-body (n=3790). This identified two different\nresponses to CBP inhibition - an increase in promoter-proximal Pol II at 2529\ngenes and a decrease at 1243 genes (Fig.\n4A). Next, we plotted the PRO-seq fold change in this promoter-proximal\nregion at LCG, MCG and HCG genes. Only HCG genes showed decreased\npromoter-proximal Pol II after CBP inhibition, whereas LCG and MCG genes showed\nincreased Pol II in this region (Fig. 4B).\nThis result is in accord with the Pol II ChIP-qPCR shown in Fig. 3E. Taken together, both PRO-seq and ChIP-qPCR\nshow that promoters of HCG genes respond differently than promoters of other\nexpressed genes by failing to maintain high levels of promoter-proximal Pol II\nafter CBP inhibition.Open in a separate windowFigure 4CBP regulates Pol II occupancy depending on promoter type, but is required\nfor release into elongation genome-wideEffects on promoters of genes (n=3790) with reduced gene body PRO-seq\nreads after 10 min of CBP inhibition (C646).

(E) Pausing\nIndex (PRO-seq reads from TSS to 300bp region versus gene-body) in control and\nafter 10 min of CBP inhibition. Increased pausing after inhibition suggests that\nCBP promotes release of Pol II into productive elongation.The increase in promoter-proximal Pol II upon CBP inhibition at LCG and\nMCG genes occurs mainly in the first 100 bp downstream of the TSS (Fig. 4C). Since all genes included in Fig. 4 are down-regulated in the gene body,\nthe increase in promoter-proximal signal suggests that CBP has a function in\nreleasing Pol II into productive elongation. At HCG genes (Fig. 4D), Pol II levels are decreased both in the\npromoter-proximal region and in the gene body, indicating that CBP has a crucial\nrole in recruiting Pol II to these promoters.We then compared the change in pausing index (calculated from the\nPRO-seq data) after CBP inhibition at these two classes of promoters. Genes with\nincreased promoter-proximal Pol II are weakly paused in control cells, but more\nstrongly paused after CBP inhibition as expected (Fig. 4E left). By contrast, genes with decreased PRO-seq reads in\nthe promoter-proximal region have a high pausing index in control cells (Fig. 4E right). Surprisingly, despite reduced\nlevels of promoter-proximal Pol II, the pausing index of these genes also\nincreased upon CBP inhibition (Fig. 4E\nright). This indicates that the decreased PRO-seq signal in the gene body is of\ngreater magnitude than in the promoter-proximal region, and that CBP is\nessential for the release of paused Pol II also at these genes. Thus, CBP may\nfunction to promote release of Pol II into productive elongation at all\ngenes.CBP regulates Pol II at High CBP and GAF promoters by controlling TFIIB\npromoter occupancySince CBP inhibition caused a reduction in Pol II occupancy at HCG\npromoters after 10 min of treatment, we performed a time-course study of Pol II\noccupancy after CBP inhibition using ChIP-qPCR. We used an antibody recognizing\nPol II phosphorylated at Ser5 in the C-terminal domain (S5P), the form of Pol II\nthat has initiated transcription. A statistically significant decrease in S5P\nPol II occupancy was detected at HCG promoters after CBP inhibition, starting\nwith a modest decline of approximately 20% at 3 min, 40% decline\nat 7 min and 80% decline after 60 min (p<0.05, Fig. 5A). The immediate effects of the inhibitor argue\nfor a direct role of CBP activity on paused Pol II occupancy. Another CBP\ninhibitor, curcumin, showed a similar effect (Fig. S6A). GAF occupancy was not\ndecreased after 10 min of CBP inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5B), indicating that reduced Pol II occupancy at HCG promoters\nupon CBP inhibition occurs while GAF is still bound. Interestingly, although\nTFIIB and TFIIF occupancy was reduced to approximately 50% after 10 min\nof CBP inhibition, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIA remained associated with\nHCG promoters (Fig. 5C). This indicates\nthat CBP regulates Pol II promoter association at a post-TBP step that may\ninvolve an interaction with TFIIB. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found\nthat TFIIB and CBP can be co-immunoprecipitated from untreated cells and that\nthey remain associated after CBP inhibition (Fig.\n5D). A CBP-TFIIB interaction in the presence of the inhibitor should\nresult in a global reduction in TFIIB occupancy, since CBP binding to chromatin\nis strongly diminished upon inhibition (Fig.\n3D). We performed TFIIB ChIP-seq in cells treated with C37 control or\nC646 inhibitor for 10 min to test this hypothesis. Indeed, we found that TFIIB\noccupancy is dramatically reduced genome-wide after 10 min of CBP inhibition\n(Fig. 5E). The two biological\nreplicates of each treatment were highly similar (Fig. S6B). Furthermore, the\nstronger CBP enrichment at the promoter, the more TFIIB was found in\ncontrol-treated cells, but not after CBP inhibition (Fig. S6C). Based on these results,\nwe propose that CBP recruits or stabilizes Pol II at promoters by regulating\nTFIIB occupancy, possibly through a direct interaction.Open in a separate windowFigure 5CBP recruits Pol II by promoting TFIIB occupancy(A) Serine 5 phosphorylated (S5P) Pol II ChIP-qPCR after CBP\ninhibitor (C646) treatment for the indicated time points\n(n=2\u20135).

See also Figure S6.PRO-seq reveals a Pol II gatekeeper function for CBPCBP inhibition not only affects the amount of Pol II at the\npromoter-proximal pause region but also the positioning of paused Pol II. A\nmetagene profile of PRO-seq reads over all expressed promoter-proximal regions\nshowed decreased amounts of Pol II over the canonical pause site, but\n\u201cdribbling\u201d of Pol II into positions downstream of the pause\nsite after CBP inhibition (Fig. 6A). This\ndribbling of Pol II beyond the promoter-proximal pause site upon CBP-inhibition\nis readily apparent at the single gene level (Fig.\n6B). To examine the prevalence of this effect, we generated a heatmap\nof the change in PRO-seq reads in 5 bp windows from the TSS to 600 bp downstream\nfor all down-regulated genes, ranked by their level of down-regulation (Fig. 6C). This shows a decrease in PRO-seq\nsignal over the canonical pause site (0\u201360bp downstream of the TSS) at\nvirtually all of the genes, suggesting that CBP could be important for Pol II\nrecruitment to most expressed genes and not only to HCG promoters. Importantly,\nessentially all genes also exhibit Pol II dribbling into the\n+60\u2013180 bp region (increased PRO-seq signal, Fig. 6C). Since this effect is observed already by 10\nmin of inhibitor treatment, it appears to be a direct effect of CBP inhibition.\nWe conclude that CBP is involved in maintaining Pol II at the canonical\npause-site genome-wide.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Promoter-proximal Pol II dribbles to more downstream positions after CBP\ninhibition but is retarded at the +1 nucleosome(A) Metagene profiles of summed PRO-seq counts in all expressed\ngenes, from TSS to 500 bp downstream in 5 bp bins, in control (C37) or\nCBP-inhibited (C646) S2 cells for 10 min.

See also Figure\nS7.CBP facilitates Pol II elongation by overcoming the +1 nucleosome\nbarrierIn order to examine the role of nucleosomes in Pol II dribbling after\nCBP inhibition, we performed MNase-seq and compared the PRO-seq profiles to a\nnucleosome density map after CBP inhibition (Fig.\n6D). Interestingly, the increased PRO-seq density correlates well\nwith the position of the +1 nucleosome, indicating that Pol II dribbles\nfrom the pause site but has difficulty overcoming the transcriptional barrier\ncaused by the first nucleosome when CBP is inhibited (compare Fig. 6C with D). We then plotted the PRO-seq ratio in\nCBP inhibited versus control cells as a function of distance from the average\nprofile of nucleosome position in inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 6E). This shows that the PRO-seq density in CBP\ninhibited cells is lower than in control cells in the pause region (around\n100\u2013200 bp upstream of the +1 nucleosome), but then increases\nuntil it reaches a maximum at the dyad axis of the +1 nucleosome, from\nwhere it decreases again (Fig. 6E). These\nresults indicate that Pol II is released from the canonical pause site, but\ntraverses the +1 nucleosome more slowly when CBP is inhibited.Interestingly, the positioning of the nucleosomes did not change between\ncontrol and inhibitor-treated cells, although occupancy was somewhat reduced for\nnucleosomes close to the TSS (Fig. 6F). A\ncloser look at the MNase-seq change shows a reciprocal relationship between Pol\nII and nucleosomes (Fig.\nS7A). Nucleosome density was decreased where the PRO-seq signal is\nstronger than in control, but slightly increased upstream and downstream of the\npeak of dribbled Pol II. This indicates that nucleosomes fill in the position\nvacated by paused Pol II, as previously suggested (Gilchrist et al., 2010; Gilchrist et al., 2008).Our data shows that chromatin is not more compacted and that nucleosome\nposition does not change after CBP inhibition, but that Pol II has difficulty\ntraversing the +1 nucleosome. Since CBP is a HAT that targets H4K8,\nH3K18 and H3K27 (Feller et al., 2015;\nJin et al., 2011; Tie et al., 2009), we investigated if the inhibition\nof CBP causes a reduction in acetylation of the +1 nucleosome. The level\nof H3K27ac in the promoter-proximal region, normalized for total H3 occupancy,\nwas decreased upon CBP inhibitor treatment at both HCG and at other promoters\n(Fig. 6G). There was only a small\neffect on H3K27ac in the first minutes of treatment, but a substantial reduction\nafter 10 min (Fig. 6G). These results show\nthat the effects on histone acetylation occur concurrently with accumulation of\nPol II upstream of the +1 nucleosome, and are consistent with a function\nfor CBP-mediated histone acetylation in facilitating Pol II release into\ntranscription elongation.Taken together, our results reveal that CBP is required genome-wide both\nfor recruitment of Pol II and for allowing Pol II to overcome the\ntranscriptional barrier caused by the +1 nucleosome that resides\ndownstream of the pause region. Upon CBP inhibition, release from Pol II pausing\nis unaffected but transcription through the +1 nucleosome is retarded,\nleading to dribbling of Pol II from the canonical pause site to some\n50\u2013100bp further downstream. DiscussionElucidating transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is of fundamental\nimportance for understanding cell behavior in both normal and pathological\nconditions. In metazoan genomes, pausing of Pol II at a position close to the\ntranscription start site is prevalent, occurring on a majority of active genes in a\ngiven cell type (Core et al., 2012). How Pol\nII pausing is regulated is not fully understood. Here we show that only 10 min of\nCBP inhibition results in dribbling of Pol II from the canonical pause site to\npositions further downstream. We propose that this effect can be explained by the\ncombination of two different CBP activities, recruitment of Pol II to the promoter\nand facilitation of transcription beyond the first nucleosome (Fig. 7). In this scenario, CBP inhibition causes less Pol\nII recruitment, resulting in diminished Pol II amounts at the canonical pause site.\nThe Pol II that has initiated transcription is released normally from the canonical\npause, but accumulates upstream of the +1 nucleosome. Due to different\nrate-limiting steps at different types of promoters, the final outcome of CBP\ninhibition is either a decrease or an accumulation of Pol II in the\npromoter-proximal region (Fig. 7).Open in a separate windowFigure 7Model showing the functions of CBP on HCG and LCG promoters(A) Genes with high CBP and GAF enrichment (HCG) are highly paused,\nenriched in enhancer chromatin marks, and contain high amounts of pre-initiation\ncomplex components. Release of Pol II into productive elongation is slow at\nthese genes, and Pol II recruitment is heavily dependent on CBP (top). In\nCBP-inhibited cells, Pol II is released from the pause site and dribbles further\ndownstream, but accumulates upstream of the +1 nucleosome that is\nhypo-acetylated. Moreover, CBP and TFIIB do not associate with chromatin, which\naffects Pol II recruitment, resulting in a decrease in promoter-proximal Pol II\n(bottom). Thus, CBP is rate-limiting for Pol II recruitment to these genes.\n(B) Low CBP and GAF (LCG) genes contain substantially less CBP,\nGAF and Pol II than HCG genes, are weakly paused and have promoters enriched in\nH3K4me3 and H4K16ac. Here, Pol II is efficiently released into elongation (top).\nAfter CBP inhibition, Pol II dribbles from the pause site but is retarded at the\n+1 nucleosome. The resulting accumulation of Pol II in the\npromoter-proximal region after CBP inhibition suggests that CBP is rate-limiting\nfor release into productive elongation.At HCG genes, CBP is critical for Pol II recruitment. A significant decrease\nin Pol II occupancy at HCG promoters can be observed already by 3 min whereas\nH3K27ac levels are not significantly different to that of control cells until 10 min\nof CBP inhibition. Thus, CBP has a direct effect on Pol II occupancy at HCG\npromoters that is at least partly independent of H3K27ac. This may involve an\ninteraction with TFIIB. Although TFIIB can be acetylated, which stabilizes the\ninteraction with TFIIF (Choi et al., 2003), we\nwere unable to detect CBP-mediated TFIIB acetylation in S2 cells. However, the\nC-terminal zinc-finger region in CBP is known to directly interact with TFIIB\nin vitro (Kwok et al.,\n1994), and our results support a model wherein CBP recruits TFIIB to\npromoters, possibly by this direct interaction. By recruiting TFIIB to promoters,\nCBP likely stimulates PIC assembly and Pol II recruitment, consistent with a highly\ndynamic TFIIB-promoter interaction (Zhang et al.,\n2016). Despite reduced Pol II levels in the promoter-proximal region\nafter CBP inhibition, pausing is not completely eliminated and the pausing index\nincreases, not decreases, indicating that CBP also modulates promoter escape. Thus,\nCBP promotes both recruitment and release of Pol II from these promoters.At promoters of LCG and MCG genes, paused Pol II dribbles to more downstream\npositions, accumulates upstream of the +1 nucleosome, and fails to\neffectively enter productive elongation, causing an increase in total Pol II\noccupancy around the pause region upon CBP inhibition. Thus, CBP is rate-limiting\nfor transcription of these genes at a post-recruitment step, likely by acetylation\nof the +1 nucleosome. This is consistent with single-cell analyses of\ntranscription induction of a tandem gene array in mouse cells, where H3K27ac and\np300/CBP were shown to be required for accumulation of elongating S2P Pol II (Stasevich et al., 2014). Together, these\nresults demonstrate a critical function for CBP in efficient release of Pol II from\nthe promoter-proximal pause into productive elongation.Another explanation for the altered positioning of Pol II could be that CBP\nacts more directly to maintain Pol II at the pause site upstream of the first\nnucleosome, which may in turn determine how effectively a gene is activated.\nDribbling of paused Pol II after CBP inhibition would shift its position into\nregions that are no longer efficiently targeted by activating mechanisms. The\ndribbled Pol II would then be slowed by the first, hypo-acetylated, nucleosome. In\nthis scenario, CBP would stabilize or capture Pol II at the pause site rather than\nstimulate recruitment of Pol II to the promoter. This activity could also involve an\ninteraction with TFIIB, and/or CBP-mediated acetylation of another protein involved\nin pausing. In mammalian cells, CBP can acetylate many proteins including the\nnon-consensus lysines in the Pol II CTD (Schroder et\nal., 2013). We found that the Drosophila Pol II CTD is\nalso acetylated in a CBP-dependent manner (Fig. S7). Another possibility is that\nCBP targets a pausing factor (e.g. NELF or DSIF) or core promoter factors.C646 selectively inhibits p300/CBP over other acetyltransferases (Bowers et al., 2010). Although it is a\ncompetitive inhibitor that does not covalently modify p300/CBP (Bowers et al., 2010), covalent off-target reactivity with\nabundant cellular proteins has also been described (Shrimp et al., 2016). However, we find it highly unlikely that our\nobserved effects on Pol II originate from merely off-target effects of C646. The\nshort exposure (10 min) of the treated cells, the use of the similarly reactive\ncompound C37 as a control, and the significant correlation between CBP occupancy and\nthe effects of C646 (Figs 3\u20136) argue that CBP inhibition accounts for the\ntranscriptional changes observed. Although C646 inhibits CBP\u2019s catalytic\nactivity, we discovered that occupancy of CBP itself is rapidly affected by the CBP\ninhibitor, consistent with in vitro data showing that the curcumin\ninhibitor causes a conformational change that dissociates p300/CBP from a chromatin\ntemplate (Black et al., 2006). We cannot\ntherefore distinguish between CBP-mediated acetylation and a non-enzymatic CBP\nfunction in transcription.Interestingly, typical features of active genes, such as H3K4me3 and H3K9ac\nare depleted in HCG promoters versus other expressed promoters. Instead, HCG\npromoters are associated with the enhancer features H3K4me1, H3K18ac, H3K27ac and\nenzymes mediating these modifications, Trithorax and CBP. One possibility is that\nlooping between enhancers and HCG promoters is more stable than at other promoters,\nleading to detection of enhancer features at HCG promoters and contributing to\nefficient transcription from these genes. Another possibility is that depletion of\nactive gene features and enrichment of enhancer marks at HCG promoters is\norchestrated by the associated core promoter elements, mediating an alternative mode\nof transcription regulation. Differences in the chromatin landscape between\npromoters have previously been noted in Drosophila (Gilchrist and Adelman, 2012; Natsume-Kitatani and Mamitsuka, 2016), and recent studies\nhave demonstrated unique chromatin features at different types of promoters also in\nhuman and yeast cells (Duttke et al., 2015;\nKubik et al., 2015).Our results demonstrate that CBP controls positioning of promoter-proximal\npaused Pol II at a majority of Drosophila genes by facilitating\ntranscription through the first nucleosome and by stimulating Pol II recruitment.\nThis global activator function for CBP is consistent with tethering experiments\nwhere a Gal4-CBP fusion protein strongly activated transcription from 24 different\nenhancer contexts (Stampfel et al., 2015).\nThis suggests that CBP has critical roles not only in the previously described\ncontrol of enhancer activity by H3K27 acetylation (reviewed in Holmqvist and Mannervik, 2013), but also in regulation of\nPol II activity at the promoter.

FCS containing media were added to a final\nconcentration of 10% FCS. Cells were harvested after 4 days of GAF\ndsRNA treatment. For CBP dsRNA treatment, cells were treated a second time\nafter 3 days and harvested after totally 6 days of treatment.ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq Drosophila S2 cells were grown to a density of\n0.2\u20131 \u00d7 107 cells/ml and fixed in 1 %\nformaldehyde for 15 min at ambient temperature. The reaction was quenched by\n0.16 M glycine pH 7.0 for 5 min and washed in PBS. Cells were sequentially\nwashed with ChIP A (10 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH\n8.0, 0.25 % Triton X100) and ChIP B (10 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 100 mM\nNaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 8.0, 0.01 % Triton X100) for\n10 min at 4\u00b0C followed by resuspension in Sonication buffer (50 mM\nHepes, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % Triton, 0.1 % sodium\ndeoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, supplemented with proteinase inhibitor\ntablets, Roche) to a final concentration of 5\u201310\n\u00d7107 cells/ml. Nuclei were sonicated for 15 minutes\nusing a Bioruptor (Diagenode), rotated for 10 minutes followed by\ncentrifugation for 10 min at 13 000 rpm at 4\u00b0C.A mix of Protein A and G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) blocked with BSA (1\nmg/ml) and salmon sperm DNA (1 mg/ml, omitted from ChIP-seq) were mixed with\nindicated antibodies. Beads and antibodies were incubated for at least 2\nhours followed by the addition of 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 107\ncells. Chromatin and antibody bead complexes were formed during at least 2\nhours followed by 5 minute washes with sonication buffer (50 mM Hepes, 140\nmM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate,\n0.1% SDS), WashA (as sonication buffer, but with 500 mM NaCl), WashB\n(20 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5%\nsodium deoxycholate) and TE.Beads were resuspended in Elution buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM\nNaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.75% SDS, 20 \u03bcg/ml RNase A, 20\n\u03bcg/ml glycogen) in a new tube. Cross-linking was reversed at\n68\u00b0C for at least 4 hours and proteins removed by Proteinase K. DNA\nwas purified with phenol-chloroform, ethanol precipitated and finally\nresuspended in 200 \u03bcl 0.1\u00d7TE.ChIP samples were analyzed by qPCR or sequenced at SciLifeLab,\nStockholm. 2 \u03bcl of DNA was used as template for qPCR, which was run\nin duplicates using 300nM primers and EvaGreen (Solis BioDyne) on a CFX96\nReal-Time system (BioRad). Average Cq was calculated for each ChIP sample\nand compared to input. To account for the background of each individual\nChIP, normalization was made to two intergenic sites devoid of known histone\nmodifications and chromatin factors. ChIP values of histone modifications\nwere further normalized to the total amount of histone H3. Primers are\nlisted in Table S3.\nChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep\nKit (NEB) and paired-end sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500, 2\u00d7125bp.\nThe total number of mapped Mreads were 22.9 (C37 input rep1), 61.8 (C37\nTFIIB rep1), 21.3 (C37 input rep2), 8.8 (C37 TFIIB rep2), 14.3 (C646 input\nrep1), 8.4 (C646 TFIIB rep1), 21.3 (C646 input rep2), and 7.1 (C646 TFIIB\nrep2). CBP ChIP-seq from Drosophila S2 cells (GEO\naccession: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE64464\",\"term_id\":\"64464\"}}GSE64464) is described in (Philip\net al., 2015).Antibodies The following antibodies were used in ChIP-qPCR; CBP (Holmqvist et al., 2012; Lilja et al., 2007; Lilja et al., 2003), GAF (kind gift from Susumu\nHirose, National Institute of Genetics, Japan), Rpb3, Ser5 phosphorylated\nPol II (Abcam, ab5131) H3K4me3 (Abcam, ab8580), H3K9ac (Abcam, ab4441),\nH3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729), H3 (Abcam, ab1791), Mrg15 (raised in rabbit), Ada2b\n(kind gift from Laszlo Tora, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg), TBP, TFIIA,\nTFIIB, TFIIF (kind gifts from Jim Kadonaga, UCSD). The TFIIB antibody from\nJim Kadonaga was used in ChIP-seq.MNase-seq 1\u00d7108 S2 cells were treated with C646 CBP\ninhibitor or C37 control drug for 10 min and fixed in 1%\nformaldehyde for 2 minutes. The reaction was quenched by adding glycine to\n125mM final concentration and incubated on ice. Cells were centrifuged at\n3000 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in Nuclei buffer A (10mM Tris HCl pH\n8, 300mM sucrose, 3mM CaCl2, 2mM MgAc2, 0.1%\nTritonX-100, 1x protease inhibitors (Roche)). Cells were homogenized in a\nDounce homogenizer using 30 strokes followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm.\nThe pellet was washed in Nuclei buffer A followed by Digest buffer (15mM\nTris HCl pH 8, 60mM KCl, 15mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 250mM sucrose, 1mM\nCaCl2) and finally resuspended in Digest buffer.\n1\u00d7107nuclei were treated with 750 gel units of MNase\n(NEB) for 30 minutes at room temperature to achieve about 80%\nmononucleosomes. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1X 100mM EGTA and 3.5X\nStop solution (143mM NaHCO3/1.43% SDS/357mM NaCl/17.9mM\nEDTA). The crosslink was reversed by incubating at 65\u00b0C for 3.5\nhours followed by a 30 minute incubation with Proteinase K. DNA was\nextracted using phenol-chloroform, precipitated and resuspended in RNase\ntreated water followed by a incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes.\nLibraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit\n(NEB) and paired-end sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500, 2\u00d7125bp. The\ntotal number of mapped Mreads were 20.3 (C37 rep1), 45.2 (C37 rep2), 34.3\n(C646 rep1), and 42.4 (C646 rep2).ChIP-seq and MNase-seq analysis Reads were mapped to the Release 5 Drosophila\nmelanogaster genome using Bowtie2 using default parameters. For\nthe TFIIB ChIP-seq, read density was extracted and a log2-ratio\nbetween IP and the input was calculated. The data was median smoothed using\na 100bp window and then subsampled to 10bp resolution. For the MNase-seq,\nthe read density was extracted and subsampled to 10bp resolution, and an\naverage of the two replicates was used for further analysis. The TFIIB data\nwas normalized so that the average IP to input ratio is zero and the MNase\ndata was normalized to the total number of mapped reads.Isolation of nuclei, nuclear run-on and PRO-seq library\npreparation Nuclei isolation and nuclear run-on were carried out essentially as\ndescribed previously (Kwak et al.,\n2013; Love and Minton,\n1985). In brief, S2 cells were treated with either C37 or C646\nfor 10 min followed by a PBS wash. Cells were resuspended in buffer L (10 mM\nTris-HCl pH 7.5, 300mM sucrose, 10mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2,\n0.1% Triton X, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche), 4\nu/ml RNase inhibitor (SUPERaseIN, Ambion) and immediately dounced 25 strokes\nwith a tight fitting pestle. Lysed cells were mixed with an equal amount of\nbuffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2M sucrose, 10mM NaCl2, 2 mM\nMgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche), 4\nu/ml RNase inhibitor (SUPERaseIN, Ambion) and loaded onto a buffer B sucrose\npillow. The sample was spun at 23000g on a SW-41 rotor, the supernatant was\nremoved, and the nuclei were washed once in storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl\npH 8, 25% glycerol, 5mM MgAc2, 0.1mM EDTA, 5mM DTT) and\nrecovered by centrifuging at 1000g for 5 minutes. Isolated nuclei were\nresuspended in storage buffer and kept at \u221280\u00b0C. Nuclei from\ntwo biological replicates were prepared for each condition.Nuclear run-on was carried out as described previously with some\nmodifications (Kwak et al., 2013).\nBriefly, 10 million nuclei in 100 \u03bcl of storage buffer were mixed\nwith 100 \u03bcl of 2x nuclear run-on buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM\nMgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 300 mM KCl, 1% Sarkosyl, 50 uM\nbiotin-11-A/C/G/UTP, 0.2 units/\u03bcl RNase inhibitor) and incubated at\n30\u00b0C for three minutes. RNAs were isolated using TRIZOL LS and\nbase-hydrolyzed with 200 nM final concentration of NaOH, generating an\naverage size of RNA between 100\u2013150 nucleotides. Nascent RNAs from\nrun-on reactions, characterized by the addition of biotinylated nucleotide,\nwere isolated with magnetic beads coated with streptavidin. After the\nligation of 3\u2032 adapter and a second biotin streptavidin affinity\npurification, the mRNA cap was removed and the 5\u2032 adapter was\nligated. Then a third biotin streptavidin affinity purification was carried\nout and cDNA was generated by reverse transcription. The generated cDNA was\namplified with 9 cycles of PCR using Illumina TruSeq small-RNA adaptors for\nsequencing.Normalization To analyze the effect of CBP inhibition on transcription, we\nidentified genes with differential PRO-seq signal. However, to normalize the\ndatasets from the two treatments we could not apply standard normalization\ntechniques as they assume that only a minority of the data are changed\nbetween treatments (Landfors et al.,\n2011). Since CBP occupancy is higher than the genomic mean at\nvirtually all expressed promoters (Fig.\n1B), we expect it to affect expression of a large number of\ngenes. We therefore normalized the PRO-seq datasets using the TSS proximal\nsignal (TSS +100 bp) of the 5% (n=270) expressed\ngenes with the least CBP signal. At these genes, we expect the smallest\nchanges after CBP inhibition. After this normalization, we quantified the\nchange in PRO-seq density upon CBP inhibition at all expressed genes.Differential expression analyses of pause region and gene body Significant change in PRO-seq density in the pause region and the\nbody of gene was calculated using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) by analyzing the two biological replicates\nseparately. PRO-seq count reads were calculated from the 100 bp pause region\nor gene body (500 bp downstream of TSS to 100 bp upstream of poly A site).\nAdjusted p-value cutoff of 0.001 and fold change of at least 1.25 was used\nin DESeq2. For all other analyzes of the PRO-seq data the reads from the two\nbiological replicates were merged.Data Data for chromatin factors, chromatin states, histone modifications\nand expression is from (Cherbas et al.,\n2011; Enderle et al.,\n2011; Roy et al., 2010), GAF\nfrom (Fuda et al., 2015), Pol II\npausing from (Kwak et al., 2013),\nNELF and TFIIA from (Gilchrist et al.,\n2010), CBP embryo data from (Holmqvist et al., 2012). Genome annotation 5.57 from Flybase was\nused (St Pierre et al., 2014).\nPromoters were defined as the +/\u2212 500 bp region around the\nTSS. For genes with more than one annotated TSS, the promoter with highest\nCBP+GAF enrichment was selected. Expressed gene promoters were\ndivided into 20 equally sized bins using CBP+GAF occupancy and\ngrouped into 3 classes based on their mean pausing index. Since the\nconfidence intervals of bins 19 and 20 overlap their mean pausing values,\nbut not the mean pausing value of bin 18, they were denoted high CBP and GAF\n(HCG). Similarly, the confidence interval of bin 15 does not overlap the\nmean pausing index of bin 14, distinguishing MCG from LCG promoters.To plot several ChIP datasets together they were linearly scaled so\nthat zero corresponds to the genomic mean and 1 to the mean of the top\n0.1% data points (to account for outliers with extremely high\nenrichment in some datasets). Zero then represents background levels of\nenrichment and 1 the strongest enrichment observed in the genome. For all\nplots, enrichment values of all factors were trimmed by their\n99th percentile in order to remove the extreme outliers.Heatmaps The heatmaps for CBP, GAF and Pol II were made in R, using Heatmap.3\nfunction from GMD package. Prior to making these heatmaps, promoters lacking\nmappable ChIP-seq reads were excluded (n=254).DNA motif discovery CBP peaks at expressed promoters were defined as the position of the\nhighest CBP enrichment in the promoter proximal region (TSS\n+/\u2212 500bp). These positions were then extended 100bp in each\ndirection and the corresponding sequences extracted using the getfasta\nfunction in BEDtools (Quinlan and Hall,\n2010). Next, de-novo motif discovery was\nperformed using the chip-meme module in the MEMEsuite (Machanick and Bailey, 2011). The parameters were\nset to find any number of motifs with minimum length of 6bp and maximum\nlength of 15bp.Cloning and expression of HA-tagged TFIIB cDNA from S2 cells was prepared by isolating total RNA using Trizol\n(Invitrogen) according to manufactorers\u2019 protocol. RNA was DNase\ntreated (Sigma) and used as template for cDNA synthesis (High capacity,\nApplied Biosystems). The resulting cDNA was PCR amplified with primers\n5\u2032 caccATGGCATCGACATCGAGACTG 3\u2032 and 5\u2032\nCATCTGTGGTAACTGATCAATGGGAGT 3\u2032 and cloned with the pENTR/D-TOPO\ncloning kit according to manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). TFIIB was\ntransferred from the resulting plasmid to the Actin5C-driven expression\nvector pAWH by Gateway LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) to introduce a C-terminal\nHA tag. 200ng of the expression plasmid was transfected to S2 cells by\nEffectene (QIAgen) according to manufacturers instructions, and harvested 2\ndays later.Co-Immunoprecipitation of Micrococcal Nuclease solubilized protein\nextracts S2 cells were washed in PBS, and resuspended in PBS +\n0.1% Triton X-100. After 3 min mixing by rotation at room\ntemperature, cells were collected at 2000g for 5 min and resuspended in\n160\u03bcl MNase buffer (5% glycerol, 20mM Tris pH7.4, 60mM KCl,\n15mM NaCl, 5mM CaCl2, 3mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40) to which 1mM DTT and\n4.5U/ul Micrococcal Nuclease was freshly added. Samples were incubated at\n25\u00b0C for 5 min. Reaction was stopped by the addition of\n240\u03bcl MNase coIP dilution buffer (3.6mM Tris pH8.8, 12mM EDTA, 225mM\nNaCl, 60mM KCl, 1.2% NP-40, proteinase inhibitor tablets, Roche).\nCells were shaken vigorously on a shaker at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, and\ncentrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 10000g for 5 min. Supernatant was pre-cleared\nwith 25\u03bcl of a mix of BSA blocked protein A and G Dynabeads\n(Invitrogen) at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Resulting protein extract was added\nto 25\u03bcl BSA blocked protein A and G Dynabeads pre-incubated with\nanti-HA (Abcam, ab9110) or rabbit anti-CBP. After overnight incubation, the\nbeads were washed twice with CoIP wash buffer (10mM Tris pH8.0, 140mM NaCl,\n1.5mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40), once each with TEN (10mM Tris pH8.0, 1mM\nEDTA, 100mM NaCl) and 50mM Tris pH6.8. Beads were resuspended in\n45\u03bcl Laemmli loading buffer, and 15\u03bcl was loaded on\n5% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot, and probed with\nguinea-pig anti-CBP (Lilja et al.,\n2003, 1:200) or anti-HA (Abcam, ab9110, 1:1000).Quantification and Statistical AnalysisFor all quantification analyses, sample size (N) and statistical tests\nperformed are described in the corresponding figure legends.Data and Software AvailabilityAccession Numbers The accession numbers for data reported in this paper are GEO:\n{\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE81649\",\"term_id\":\"81649\"}}GSE81649 (PRO-seq) and GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE100614\",\"term_id\":\"100614\"}}GSE100614 (TFIIB ChIP-seq and MNase-seq).
