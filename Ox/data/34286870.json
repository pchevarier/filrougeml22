BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, which are reported in up to 46% of patients with COVID\u201019, increase the severity of the disease, leading to hemodynamic deterioration and the appearance of adverse complications.1, 2 CV manifestations include myocardial injury, acute myocarditis, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic disease. The development of these complications conveys a worse prognosis for the patient.3\n1.2. ImportanceThe development of heart failure in patients with COVID\u201019 is not only a consequence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, but also right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, with an estimated frequency of 28%\u201339%.4, 5 The mechanism of RV dysfunction is multifactorial, including microvascular thrombi in the pulmonary vessels and pulmonary vasoconstriction produced by hypoxemia and hypercapnia, all producing an increase in RV afterload.6, 7 Severe COVID\u201019 disease usually requires invasive mechanical ventilation with high ventilatory parameters. This high transpulmonary pressure can lead to alveolar overdistension that causes compression of the alveolar capillaries, resulting in an increased pulmonary vascular resistance, which contributes to the RV dysfunction.8, 9 Garc\u00eda\u2010Cruz et\u00a0al. reported an increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in up to 69.5% of patients.4 Ventricular\u2013arterial coupling involves the relationship between contractility and afterload, which can be evaluated with echocardiography by the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/PASP ratio. Patients with a TAPSE/PASP ratio of\u00a0<\u00a0.31\u00a0mm/mm\u2009Hg had a significantly worse prognosis in cases of severe pulmonary hypertension.10\n1.3. Investigation goalsThe critical care ultrasonography algorithm\u2014the ORACLE protocol\u2014allows the evaluation of LV and RV function, valves, pericardial effusion, diastolic function and filling pressures, pulmonary hemodynamics, regional wall motion, and stratification of the severity of pulmonary affection, to obtain greater prognostic certainty and thereby determine the most appropriate treatment.4 The objective of our research was to evaluate the application of a critical care ultrasound protocol in patients admitted to three intensive care units with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection leading to COVID\u201019 to identify the most frequent alterations and their influence with adverse outcomes, especially those involving the RV (dilatation and dysfunction) and RV\u2013arterial coupling. 2.\u2003METHODSThis cross\u2010sectional study included 204 adult patients with confirmed COVID\u201019 disease admitted to the critical care unit at three centers (Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez and Hospital Naval de Especialidades Veracruz in Mexico and Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas in Bolivia) from April 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. The local institutional research and ethics committees of the three centers waived approval for this study. Written informed consent for patient information and images to be published were provided by the patient or a legally authorized representative. The echocardiography and lung ultrasound (LUS) images were acquired upon admission using the critical care ultrasonography algorithm \u201cthe ORACLE protocol\u201d as described (Appendix\u00a01).4 The feasibility of echocardiographic measurements was calculated by dividing the total number of echocardiographic parameters with the total number of patients and are reported as percentages.2.1 Statistical analysisWe performed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test of normality for continuous variables. After determining their distribution, we reported them as the mean and standard deviation if they were parametric and as the median and interquartile range (IQR) if they were nonparametric. We used Student's t or Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests for comparisons among continuous variables. We describe categorical variables as frequencies and percentages, and we used chi\u2010squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate for comparisons according to the expected values. We applied a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted by age and gender to evaluate the variables that helped in predicting mortality. All statistical analyses were considered significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.14 (https://www.stata.com). Some results (e.g., in Table\u00a01) are presented as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).TABLE 1Demographic and clinical characteristics of patientsVariableTotal n\u00a0=\u00a0204 n (%)PaO2/FiO2 >\u00a0300 n\u00a0=\u00a014 n (%)PaO2/FiO2 300\u2013200 n\u00a0=\u00a030 n (%)PaO2/FiO2 200\u2013100 n\u00a0=\u00a098 n (%)PaO2/FiO2 <\u00a0100 n\u00a0=\u00a062 n (%)\np\nMale121 (59.3)11 (78.6)24 (80)57 (58.2)29 (46.8)<0.001Female83 (40.7)3 (21.4)6 (20)41 (41.8)33 (53.2)Hypertension102 (50)6 (42.9)13 (43.3)48 (49)35 (56.4)0.60Diabetes67 (32.8)5 (35.7)13 (43.3)26 (26.5)23 (37.1)0.43Smoking55 (27)3 (21.4)9 (30)30 (30.6)13 (21)0.55Dyslipidemia54 (26.5)2 (14.3)9 (30)18 (18.4)25 (40.3)0.01Mechanical ventilation165 (82.5)9 (64.3)18 (60)82 (84.5)56 (94.9)<0.001In\u2010hospital mortality71 (37.6)7 (50)7 (24.1)15 (17)42 (72.4)<0.001Open in a separate windowVariable\nTotal\nMedian (IQR)\n\nPaO2/FiO2\n\u00a0>\u00a0300\nMedian (IQR)\n\nPaO2/FiO2\n300\u2013200\nMedian (IQR)\n\nPaO2/FiO2\n200\u2013100\nMedian (IQR)\n\nPaO2/FiO2 <\u00a0100\nMedian (IQR)\npAge (years)59 (48\u201367)61.5 (55\u201367)62 (51\u201367)57 (48\u201365)59 (51\u201371)0.33Heart rate (bpm)88 (78\u2013100)86 (75\u2013100)81 (70\u201393)88 (79\u201395)89 (79\u2013113)0.04Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)120 (109\u2013130)127 (113\u2013133)120 (109\u2013128)124 (110\u2013132)110 (100\u2013121)0.01Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)68 (60\u201376)75 (67\u201380)80 (65\u201385)68 (60\u201374)65 (57\u201369)<0.001Troponin I (pg/ml) (14\u201342.9 pg/ml)15 (5\u201456)23 (6\u201435)13 (6\u201489)15 (5\u2010\u201045)14 (2\u201456)0.11D\u2010dimer (ng/ml) (<\u00a0500\u00a0ng/ml)589 (250\u2013935)569 (246\u20137835)675 (310\u20132226)457 (200\u2013767)750 (428\u2013921)0.02NT\u2010proBNP (pg/ml) (15\u2013125 pg/ml)390 (154\u2013789)938 (316\u20133011)1659 (210\u20134353)345 (120\u2013672)389 (163\u2013629)0.01Creatinine (mg/dl)1.1 (.8\u20131.7).7 (.7\u20131)1 (.6\u20131.5)1.1 (.9\u20131.3)2.1 (1.2\u20132.6)<0.001C reactive protein (mg/L) (1\u20133\u00a0mg/L)68 (20\u2013155)171 (109\u2013307)121 (32\u2013193)56 (16\u2014133)51 (11\u2014111)<0.001Ferritin (ng/ml) (23.9\u2013 336\u00a0ng/ml)496 (122\u2013911)1058 (366\u20131470)721 (268\u20131488)380 (102\u2013775)234 (18\u2013901)<0.001Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: IQR, interquartile range; NT\u2010proBNP, N\u2010terminal B\u2010type natriuretic peptide. 3.\u2003RESULTSClinical data were collected from 204 consecutive patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 disease.3.1. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and in\u2010hospital outcomesMost of the patients were men (59.3%), with a median age of 59 (range 48\u201367) years, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes (50% and 32.8%, respectively) (Table\u00a02). Eighty\u2010two percent of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation at admission. According to the Berlin definition,11 14.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a030) had mild, 48% (n\u00a0=\u00a098) had moderate, and 30.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a062) had severe ARDS. Patients were hemodynamically stable at admission, with a median heart rate (HR) of 88 (78\u2013100) beats per minute (bpm), systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 (109\u2013130) mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 68 (60\u201376) mm Hg. Patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of\u00a0<\u00a0100 had lower SBP and DBP (medians of 110\u00a0mm Hg and 65\u00a0mm Hg, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00). Laboratory determinations revealed elevated troponin I, D\u2010dimer, NT\u2010proBNP, C\u2010reactive protein, and ferritin levels upon admission.

Pulmonary hemodynamicsThe median PASP was 30\u00a0mm Hg, and 119 patients (58.3%) demonstrated values of\u00a0>\u00a035\u00a0mm Hg, most frequently in the group with PaO2/FiO2\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0mm Hg (median 37, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00). The median pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) was 90 msec, and 162 patients (91%) demonstrated values\u00a0<\u00a0106 msec (Tables\u00a03 and\u00a04).3.5.

Twenty\u2010seven patients (13.2%) demonstrated an LVDD of\u00a0>\u00a055\u00a0mm, 33 (17.5%) had a LVEF of\u00a0<\u00a050%, and 46 (27.5%) had a MAPSE of\u00a0<\u00a013\u00a0mm (Table\u00a04). Regional wall motion abnormalities were observed in 18 patients (8.8%), with hypokinesia being more frequent in the inferior, anterior, and inferolateral segments (Table\u00a03).3.6.

PericardiumSixteen patients (8.4%) had pericardial effusion (Table\u00a03). Two patients had a final diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.3.8. Lung ultrasonographyAn average LUS score of 17 points was documented (Table\u00a03), without any statistically significant difference between different PaO2/FiO2 groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.22). PASP\u00a0\u2265\u00a035\u00a0mm Hg and a TAPSE/PASP ratio of\u00a0<\u00a00.31 were associated with a trend in augmentation according to LUS score (OR 1.11, p\u00a0=\u00a00.70; OR 4.11, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07, respectively).3.9. Other hemodynamic parametersConsidering diastolic function, the median of the E/e\u2032 ratio was 8.7, with 31 patients (18.9%) demonstrating values of\u00a0>\u00a014. The median E/A ratio was one, with 43 patients (21.1%) demonstrating values of\u00a0>\u00a02 (Tables\u00a03 and\u00a04). Considering fluid responsiveness, 130 patients (82.9%) had an inferior vena cava (IVC) distensibility index of\u00a0>\u00a018% (Table\u00a04).3.10. Other findingsPulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 17 patients, cardiac tamponade in two, and Takotsubo syndrome, pneumothorax, right atrium thrombus, ventricular septal defect, pleural effusion, apical aneurysm, and a left atrium thrombus each were found in one patient.Our multiple logistic regression model for predicting mortality showed that the echocardiographic findings associated with in\u2010hospital death were PASP\u00a0>\u00a035\u00a0mm Hg (OR 5.82, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00), RV FS of\u00a0<\u00a035% (OR 3.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), TAPSE\u00a0<\u00a017\u00a0mm (OR 3.06, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), RV S wave\u00a0<\u00a09.5 (OR 2.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), and TAPSE/PASP\u00a0<\u00a00.31\u00a0mm/mm Hg (OR 17.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00). Furthermore, the presence of a IVC distensibility\u00a0>\u00a018% protected against fatal outcomes (OR .3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00) (Table\u00a01). Among the clinical variables, a PaO2 / FiO2\u00a0<\u00a0100 (OR 11.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00) and a D\u2010dimer\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0mg/dl (OR 3.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00) also were associated with in\u2010hospital death. 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONOur study highlights not only the elevated rate of dysfunction and dilation of the RV (although less than previously reported) and the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics, but also the impact on mortality when detected at hospital admission. Routine critical care ultrasonographic evaluation is essential given the high frequency of CV manifestations in patients presenting with COVID\u201019 disease. Given the high frequency of refractory hypoxemia using prone position ventilation, these evaluations have been also described during this maneuver.12, 13 Critical care ultrasonography should be focused to maximize the time at the patient's bedside to limit exposure to airborne SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 shedding to protect the staff caring for the patient. One of the main conditions that determine the high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe COVID\u201019 is myocardial involvement and the risk of developing RV dysfunction along with pulmonary hypertension.14\nThe frequency of RV dysfunction and dilation was greater than 10% at hospital admission among these patients, and the elevation of PASP was close to 60%. RV alterations were not closely linked to PaO2/FiO2 levels when compared with PASP, which suggests that there could be other pathophysiological phenomena other than just hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and elevated intra\u2010thoracic pressure leading to pulmonary hypertension and an increased RV afterload (all which are related to the severity of pulmonary infection and the high mechanical ventilation parameters required in this group of patients).15 In our logistic regression model, all the altered RV functional parameters were associated with increased mortality at hospital admission. Thus, the RV FS\u00a0<\u00a035% (OR 3.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) showed the greatest trend. In patients with COVID\u201019, the ability of the RV to maintain ventricular\u2013arterial coupling was limited (established by the TAPSE/PASP ratio of\u00a0<\u00a0.31).16 In our study, this was clearly one of the parameters with the highest prediction of mortality. Thus, practically all the patients who presented with this altered parameter died, which suggests that the combination of RV dysfunction associated with pulmonary hypertension could be two independent and simultaneous pathophysiological phenomena. This finding challenges the notion that only pulmonary hypertension generates RV dysfunction in response to increased afterload. Likewise, the high percentage of patients with PAAT\u00a0<\u00a0106\u00a0msec suggests that there is elevated RV pressure in the context of pressure overload in a non\u2010adapted RV, which reflects its acute clinical presentation. Only a few of our patients (n\u00a0=\u00a014) had RV\u2013arterial uncoupling, but it was more common in the group with PaO2/FiO2\u00a0<\u00a0100 (10 patients), suggesting that this phenomenon could also be linked with the severity of COVID\u201019 disease; furthermore, lower PaO2/FiO2 is related to an increased mortality,17 which could be related to these hemodynamic phenomena. Another relevant finding was the high rate of fluid responsiveness protecting against death, which suggests that these patients were less overloaded. This has been demonstrated previously with the well\u2010known positive impact on mortality of negative fluid balances in the survival of critically ill patients.18 The ORACLE protocol, originally designed for rapid and safe hemodynamic and pulmonary evaluation in patients with severe COVID\u201019 disease, suggested these findings, especially those related to the elevation of PASP, but given the small cohort of patients in the original protocol (n\u00a0=\u00a084), it failed to fully demonstrate the impact of RV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and the presence of RV\u2013arterial uncoupling elucidated in this research. There is a marked difference in the rate of pulmonary hypertension in our study compared with other investigations,19 which could be related to the fact that our patients were critically ill, with a higher degree of hypoxemia and clinical severity. In addition, this study was conducted at three centers, where the protocol was applied by intensive care physicians with training in critical care ultrasonography and relevant measurements were obtained in more than 90% of the patients, except in the case of PASP and the TAPSE/PASP ratio. This situation could reflect the difficulty in achieving adequate aligning to obtain tricuspid regurgitation flow in all cases. Regarding the other relevant echocardiographic findings, the presence of low LVEF (<\u00a050%) was present in close to 20% of the patients with a pericardial effusion close to 10%. This was probably related to the myocardial and pericardial inflammatory involvement already described in patients with COVID 19.20, 21Elevation of the LV filling pressures (E/e\u2032\u00a0>\u00a014) was found in approximately 20% of patients. This could be linked with LV dysfunction or with the fluid overload following the initial aggressive fluid resuscitation usually required in these patients associated with severe sepsis or septic shock status at the hospital admission in this population.22 Finally, the ORACLE protocol orientated not only the hemodynamic profile and guided resuscitation in the patients, but also established the final diagnosis of a specific CV entity in 24 patients with the most common diagnosis being a pulmonary embolism. 5.\u2003STUDY LIMITATIONSThe cross\u2010sectional nature of our study precluded the possibility of ascertaining causal relationships but provided some rationale to establish questions about the pathophysiology of COVID\u201019. Furthermore, our research was conducted at three medical centers. Thus, this protocol should be replicated at other centers to assess its reproducibility. In addition, the parameters that showed higher mortality were more difficult to quantify than the rest of the echocardiographic variables. 6.\u2003CONCLUSIONSThe presence of RV dysfunction, elevated PASP, and a poor RV\u2013arterialcoupling at hospital admission in patients with COVID\u201019 disease conferred a higher risk for in\u2010hospital mortality. Therefore, these conditions should be searched for in a targeted manner to identify those at higher risk, especially in patients with a higher degree of hypoxemia. The ORACLE protocol can help to obtain these parameters quickly and safely at the bedside and is also a tool that\u2014given its ease and versatility\u2014allows most of the echocardiographic parameters to be acquired.
