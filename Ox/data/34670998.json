The pandemic of patients with ARDS due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection has stressed the need for more effective therapies in ARDS. Phenotyping may enable successful trials and precision therapeutics in this patient population.                  Recent findings:                       Clinical phenotypes that group patients by shared cause, time-course or radiographic presentation are of prognostic value, but their use is limited by misclassification. Physiological phenotypes, including the P/F ratio, ventilatory ratio and dead space fraction, predict poor outcomes but can rapidly change, making them unstable over time. Biologic phenotypes have prognostic value with composite clinical and biomarker sub-phenotypes additionally impacting treatment response but are yet to be prospectively validated.                  Summary:                       Although much progress has been made in ARDS phenotyping, implementation of precision medicine practices will depend on conducting phenotype-aware trials using rapid point of care assays or machine learning algorithms. Omics studies will enhance our understanding of biologic determinants of clinical outcomes in ARDS sub-phenotypes. Whether biologic ARDS sub-phenotypes are specific to this syndrome or rather more broadly identify endotypes of critical illness remains to be determined.", "author": [{"author": "Narges Alipanah", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine."], "href": "/?term=Alipanah+N&cauthor_id=34670998"}, {"author": "Carolyn S Calfee", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine.", "Department of Anesthesia, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA."], "href": "/?term=Calfee+CS&cauthor_id=34670998"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["34670998"], "body": ""}
