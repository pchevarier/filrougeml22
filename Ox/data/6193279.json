{"title": "Molecular cloning and characterization of a gene for rat U2 small nuclear RNA", "pubDate": "1983", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80303-9", "PMID": "6193279", "abstract": "Six phage clones that contain sequences hybridizable with the small nuclear RNA U2 were isolated from a rat gene library. Of these clones, one which includes a candidate for a functional U2 RNA gene was selected and characterized. The sequence within the clone which hybridizes with rat U2 RNA was completely co-linear with that of the RNA. A T-A-T-A box was not found in the region of more than 400 base-pairs which lies upstream of the gene. However, several block homologies were found with the upstream sequences of a rat U1 RNA gene candidate cloned in our laboratory. An \"identifier sequence\", which was reported to be an element of gene regulation related to differentiation, was found downstream of the coding region at the same distance and with the same orientation as the identifier sequence located downstream of the U1 RNA gene candidate. We detected a presumed U2 RNA precursor elongated by about 11 nucleotides at the 3' end by S1 nuclease mapping using a fragment from the clone. A potential termination signal for transcription was found within the elongated region of the presumed precursor. Southern blot analysis suggests that families of U2 RNA genes that have conserved flanking sequences are present in the genomes of rat, mouse, man, calf and chicken.", "author": [{"author": "T Tani", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Tani+T&cauthor_id=6193279"}, {"author": "N Watanabe-Nagasu", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Watanabe-Nagasu+N&cauthor_id=6193279"}, {"author": "N Okada", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Okada+N&cauthor_id=6193279"}, {"author": "Y Ohshima", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ohshima+Y&cauthor_id=6193279"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["6193279", "24310755", "16453831", "9372950", "8423779", "6208531", "6206077", "6203742", "6203126", "6201719", "6084596", "6083546", "3951991", "3837185", "3720730", "3670307", "3601664", "3459149", "3458178", "3025618", "2942763", "2922259", "2413344", "2411548", "2410771", "2137610"], "body": ""}
