Although general strategies exist to decrease the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in hospitalized patients, these infections are associated with significant mortality and morbidity, increased intensive care unit utilization and hospital length of stay, and substantial economic burden (3,\u20136). This is further complicated by the emergence of multiple drug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, including those resistant to carbapenems (7, 8).Preclinical animal efficacy models are crucial for the development of new antibacterial drugs (9). Nonventilated mouse and rabbit pneumonia models, using animals with normal immune systems and those rendered neutropenic, are used to predict efficacy of new antibacterial drugs for the ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) indication (10, 11). However, the lack of mechanical ventilation in these animals is a major limitation as discussed in recent reviews (12,\u201314). Moreover, because clinical trials of VABP and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) generally excluded the small subpopulation of patients with neutropenia (15, 16), preclinical efficacy data from neutropenic animals may be less clinically relevant, particularly because neutrophils play a critical role in disease pathogenesis (17).Herein, we reported on the development and validation of a rabbit model that could be used to predict efficacy of new drug candidates for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by P. aeruginosa. We utilized outbred, immunocompetent New Zealand White rabbits to develop a new ventilator-associated model because they are similar to humans in their susceptibility to Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (18, 19), they can develop natural infection with P. aeruginosa (20, 21), and their large size in the 3 to 4\u2009kg range allows for the use of neonatal/pediatric medical equipment for low tidal volume mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic monitoring (12). We showed here that the mechanically ventilated rabbit model reproduced hallmark clinical features of human VABP and that treatment with a humanized meropenem dosing regimen halted and reversed natural disease progression with P. aeruginosa. RESULTSNatural history study for a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. To establish a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia, we challenged endobronchially 19 mechanically ventilated rabbits with 9 different doses of P. aeruginosa strain 6206, which allowed for identification of approximately 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU as sufficient to cause lethal infection between 14 and 35 h postinfection (see Table S1). Next, to determine the extent to which human VABP could be reproduced in a rabbit model, we challenged another 40 rabbits with the 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU minimum lethal dose and euthanized these rabbits at different time points to correlate longitudinal histopathological changes in the lungs with changes in clinically relevant biomarkers. Of these, 6 rabbits were euthanized for each of the following time points, namely, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 h postinfection. The remaining 10 rabbits were monitored until they reached a terminal endpoint between 11 and 36 h postinfection when they died spontaneously or were euthanized because lactate increased to >10 mmol/liter and mean arterial pressure decreased by <50% of preinfection baseline.Three control rabbits instilled endobronchially with vehicle (lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, LRS, which was used to prepare the bacterial inoculum) were included to evaluate the effects of mechanical ventilation over a period of 38 h postinstillation. Four additional control rabbits instilled endobronchially with UV-killed P. aeruginosa were included to evaluate whether live bacteria were needed to cause lethal infection in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. All 7 control rabbits survived to the predetermined endpoint of the study at 35 to 38 h postinfection.Gross pathology of lungs from the 40 rabbits challenged endobronchially with live P. aeruginosa showed diffused areas of damage as early as 3 h postinfection, with widespread damage involving all six lung lobes evident by 10 h postinfection and at the terminal endpoint (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Longitudinal histopathological analysis of lung sections from the lower lobes of left lungs from the 40 rabbits showed increasing alveolar hemorrhage, edema, exudate/fibrin deposition, and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltrate over time, peaking at the terminal endpoint (Fig. 1A and Table 1). For comparison, lungs from rabbits instilled with LRS showed only minimal impact on the lungs with sporadic neutrophilic infiltrate, likely a consequence of mechanical ventilation over the 48-h study period. Although lungs from 3 of 4 rabbits instilled with UV-killed P. aeruginosa were similar to those from rabbits instilled with LRS except for slightly more neutrophilic infiltrate (Table 1), one rabbit developed moderate levels of consolidation and alveolar hemorrhage (Table 1 and Fig. S1).Open in a separate windowFIG 1Natural history of P. aeruginosa-induced ventilator-associated pneumonia in rabbits. Forty mechanically ventilated rabbits were infected by endobronchial instillation with 1.8\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU of P. aeruginosa strain 6206. Of these, 30 rabbits were euthanized at predetermined time points of 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10\u2009h postinfection (6 rabbits for each time point). The remaining 10 rabbits were euthanized at the terminal endpoint (TE) between 11 and 36 h postinfection when they died spontaneously or were euthanized when mean arterial pressure was decreased to <50% of preinfection baseline and when blood lactate exceeded 10\u2009mmol/liter. Three control rabbits instilled endobronchially with vehicle (lactated Ringer\u2019s solution, LRS, which was used to prepare the bacterial inoculum) were included to evaluate the effects of mechanical ventilation over the entire study period of 48 h. Four control rabbits instilled endobronchially with UV-killed P. aeruginosa strain 6206 were included to evaluate whether live bacteria were needed to cause lethal infection in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. All the rabbits challenged with LRS or UV-killed P. aeruginosa survived to 35 h post instillation. (A) Gross and histological changes in representative rabbit lungs at 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 h postinfection and terminal endpoint after endobronchial challenge with live P. aeruginosa strain 6206 or with LRS and UV-killed P. aeruginosa strain 6206. See Table 1 for blinded semiquantitative scoring of all 47 rabbit lungs. (B) Lung weight to body weight (LW/BW) ratios are shown for each of the 47 rabbits. Linear test for trend was used to evaluate whether means for LW/BW increase (or decrease) systematically over time (3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 hpi and terminal endpoint) for those rabbits challenged with live P. aeruginosa strain 6206.

Mean values (bold font) of individual pathology scores are shown in front of each corresponding parenthesis.Lung weight to body weight (LW/BW) ratio, a quantitative marker of pulmonary edema, for rabbits challenged with live P. aeruginosa remained relatively unchanged between 3 and 10 h postinfection (Fig. 1B). At terminal endpoint, 50% (5/10) of rabbits challenged with live P. aeruginosa had LW/BW of >10 g/kg, a cutoff previously associated with profound respiratory failure and death (22), but apparently the remaining rabbits (50%, 5/10) with LW/BW of <10 g/kg also succumbed to infection.Lung bacterial burden (no other bacteria species other than P. aeruginosa were cultured in organs) increased over time, peaking at the terminal endpoint when it averaged 129-fold increase from the number of bacteria used to challenge the rabbits (Fig. 2A). Bacteria in the lungs also disseminated to four other vital organs\u2014heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys\u2014in most rabbits (Fig. 2B to \u200btoEE).Open in a separate windowFIG 2Growth and dissemination of P. aeruginosa in a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Bacterial burden in (A) lung, (B) heart, (C) liver, (D) spleen, and (E) kidneys increased over time and peaked at the time of death for rabbits challenged endobronchially with live P. aeruginosa strain 6206 (limit of detection of 1.72 log10 CFU). Organs harvested from rabbits challenged with LRS or UV-killed P. aeruginosa strain 6206 did not yield any growth. Linear test for trend was used to evaluate whether means for log10 CFU increase (or decrease) systematically over time (3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 hpi and terminal endpoint) for those rabbits challenged with live P. aeruginosa strain 6206. Red symbols represent data from female rabbits, and blue symbols represent data from male rabbits.PaO2:FiO2, the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen, decreased progressively over time (linear test for trend P\u2009<\u20090.001), with this ratio in the 100 to 200 range for 6/10 rabbits and a range of <100 for 4/10 rabbits at the terminal endpoint (Fig. 3B), indicating moderate and severe ARDS, respectively, at the time when these rabbits succumbed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (23, 24). Other clinically relevant parameters associated with ARDS, including mean arterial pressure (Fig. 3A), PaCO2 (Fig. 3C), base excess (Fig. 3D), and lactate (Fig. 3E), also reached severe levels at the terminal endpoint.Open in a separate windowFIG 3Acute respiratory distress syndrome-associated biomarkers for a natural history study in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Arterial blood samples taken from the same 47 rabbits used in the natural history as described in Fig. 1 and \u200band22 were analyzed for (A) mean arterial pressure, (B) PaO2:FiO2, (C) PaCO2, (D) base excess, (E) lactate, (F) platelets, (G) white blood cells (WBCs), (H) neutrophils, and (I) monocytes. Linear test for trend was used to evaluate whether means for each parameter increase (or decrease) systematically over the seven sampling time points, namely, preinfection, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 h postinfection, and terminal endpoint, for those rabbits challenged with live P. aeruginosa strain 6206; this analysis does not include data from rabbits challenged with lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (LRS) or with UV-killed P. aeruginosa strain 6206. Red symbols represent data from female rabbits, and blue symbols represent data from male rabbits.White blood cells (Fig. 3G), neutrophils (Fig. 3H), and monocytes (Fig. 3I) decreased significantly by 3 h postinfection, bottomed at 5 h postinfection, rebounded from 6 to 10 h postinfection, and bottomed again at the terminal endpoint. Platelet counts also decreased to lowest levels at the terminal endpoint (Fig. 3F). Inasmuch as the disappearance of neutrophils from peripheral blood (Fig. 3H) corresponded with widespread infiltration of neutrophils throughout the lungs (Fig. 1 and Table 1) by 3 h postinfection, this time point may represent an early stage of ventilator-associated pneumonia when therapeutic intervention with antibiotic could be initiated in the rabbit model.Both male and female rabbits were used for the natural history study to explore differences between the sexes, but no differences were noted (Fig. 1 and \u200band33).Efficacy of a humanized meropenem dosing regimen in a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. We evaluated whether a humanized dosing regimen of meropenem with or without ICU-supportive care (fluid challenge plus norepinephrine) could halt or reverse lethal disease progression in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which would indicate whether this model can predict antibiotic efficacy in humans. Of the 82 rabbits that were used for this efficacy study, 14 (17%) were ineligible because they had one of the exclusion criteria noted in Fig. 4A. The remaining 68 (83%) were randomized into the four experimental groups in which rabbits were treated at 3 h postinfection with placebo (saline) (group I), placebo plus ICU-supportive care, including fluid challenge with 15\u2009ml/kg normal saline infused over 15\u2009min and minute-to-minute titration of norepinephrine (group II), humanized meropenem dosing regimen alone (group III), or humanized meropenem dosing regimen plus ICU-supportive care (group IV) (Fig. 4B). One rabbit from each of groups II, III, and IV died within 1 h of routine suctioning procedures to remove accumulated mucus that partially occluded their endotracheal tubes; these three rabbits were included in all subsequent statistical analyses per our preplanned intention-to-treat statistical analysis protocol (see supplemental material).Open in a separate windowFIG 4Study overview: (A) selection and randomization of rabbits for the efficacy study and (B) procedures and assessments performed during the 45-h study period. Of the 82 rabbits used in 7 studies, 14 rabbits were excluded before randomization into the four experimental groups for preexisting conditions as indicated.

See supplemental material for algorithms used for fluid challenge, minute-to-minute titration of norepinephrine, and humanized meropenem dosing regimen.To determine whether treatment efficacy of meropenem in the rabbit model mimics those of VABP patients infected with drug-susceptible P. aeruginosa, we reproduced the human plasma concentration-time curve for this drug in the rabbits. We used programmable syringe infusion pumps to administer a humanized meropenem dosing regimen by staggered-continuous infusion (S-CI) of 100\u2009mg/kg every 8 h (see supplemental material) to generate plasma concentration-time curves in uninfected and infected rabbits that mimicked those from VABP patients who were treated with 2 g meropenem every 8 h given via extended 3-h infusion (25). The percentage of the dosage interval in which plasma concentration exceeded the MIC (%T > MIC; meropenem MIC\u2009=\u20090.25\u2009\u03bcg/ml for P. aeruginosa strain 6206) was 100% for both the human and rabbit dosing regimens (Fig. 5A). Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0\u20138h; mean [95% confidence interval]) were 217 (157 to 277) \u03bcg/ml*h for VABP patients, 280 (220 to 339) \u03bcg/ml*h for uninfected rabbits, 622 (405 to 840) \u03bcg/ml*h for group III rabbits, and 399 (332 to 466) \u03bcg/ml*h for group IV rabbits (Fig. 5A).Open in a separate windowFIG 5Outcomes for rabbit ventilator-associated pneumonia efficacy study with humanized meropenem dosing regimen. (A) Meropenem plasma concentration-time curves for uninfected and infected rabbits dosed with 100\u2009mg/kg q8h by staggered-continuous infusion (S-CI) or patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with 2 g q8h administered as 3-h infusion. Mean and error bars (standard deviations) are shown for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (n\u2009=\u20099) from a published study (25) and for uninfected rabbits (n\u2009=\u20095) as well as for group III (n\u2009=\u20099) and group IV rabbits (n\u2009=\u20096) for the efficacy study shown in panels B to H. (B) Survival curves for 68 rabbits randomized into four experimental groups: 14 group I rabbits treated with placebo (saline), 18 group II rabbits treated with placebo plus ICU-supportive care (fluid challenge plus norepinephrine), 18 group III rabbits treated with humanized meropenem dosing regimen alone, and 18 group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem dosing regimen and ICU-supportive care. One-sided log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to test hypotheses that survival of group I is shorter than survival of group II, group III, or group IV rabbits, with a P value of <0.0167 (significance level of 0.05 divided by 3 different comparisons) being considered statistically significant to account for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. (C) Lung weight to body weight (LW/BW) ratio and bacterial densities log10 CFU/organ for (D) lungs, (E) heart, (F) liver, (G) spleen, and (H) kidneys for group I rabbits were compared to those for group II, group III, and group IV rabbits by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test. Statistical significance abbreviations: not significant, ns, P\u2009>\u20090.05; *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05; **, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01; ***, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001. Filled symbols represent data from dead animals, and open symbols represent data from surviving animals that were euthanized at 35\u2009h postinfection, the predetermined study endpoint.In the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia with the drug-susceptible P. aeruginosa strain 6206, overall survival rates were 0% (0/14) for group I rabbits treated with placebo, 17% (3/18) for group II rabbits treated with placebo plus ICU-supportive care, 56% (10/18) for group III rabbits treated with a humanized meropenem alone, and 78% (14/18) for group IV rabbits treated with a humanized meropenem plus ICU-supportive care (see Fig. 5B for log-rank test P values for comparisons of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for group I rabbits treated with placebo versus those of each of the other three experimental groups).LW/BW ratios were significantly reduced for group III rabbits treated with humanized meropenem alone or group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem plus ICU-supportive care compared to those of group I rabbits treated with placebo (multiplicity-adjusted P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.002, respectively; Fig. 5B). Group II rabbits treated with placebo plus ICU-supportive care had significantly greater LW/BW ratios compared to those of the group I rabbits treated with placebo alone (multiplicity-adjusted P\u2009=\u20090.01), which may be a consequence of (i) increased survival time afforded by ICU-supportive care that allowed the infection to progress longer and pulmonary edema to accumulate to greater levels, (ii) bolus fluid challenge used for group II rabbits that may result in fluid overload that exacerbates pulmonary edema and increases LW/BW, or (iii) a combination of the two possibilities noted above.Burden of P. aeruginosa 6206 in the lungs, expressed as log10 CFU/lung (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), was 9.94\u2009\u00b1\u20091.67 and 10.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62 for group I rabbits treated with placebo and group II rabbits treated with placebo plus ICU-supportive care, respectively (Fig. 5C), indicating a 33- to 190-fold increase compared to 8.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 of P. aeruginosa strain 6206 used for endobronchial instillation into the lungs to establish infection in these rabbits. Group III and group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem dosing regimen achieved reduction of >7 log10 CFU in the lungs (multiplicity-adjusted P\u2009<\u20090.001 compared to group I rabbits treated with placebo; Fig. 5C). Importantly, 22% (4/18) of group III rabbits and 61% (11/18) of group IV had no culturable P. aeruginosa strain 6206 in the lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys (Fig. 5C to \u200btoGG).Fluid challenge and vasopressor used in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia for the efficacy study. ICU-supportive care was administered to group II and group IV rabbits to manage severe hypotension associated with ARDS (see Fig. 4B for schematic of our overall treatment strategy). The cumulative amount of saline used for fluid challenge (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) was 59\u2009\u00b1\u200936\u2009ml/kg for group II rabbits and 40\u2009\u00b1\u200929\u2009ml/kg for group IV rabbits (P\u2009=\u20090.09 by unpaired t test). The cumulative amount of norepinephrine (mean \u00b1 SD) was 1.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min for group II rabbits and 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min for group IV rabbits (P\u2009=\u20090.07 by unpaired t test). Group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem and ICU-supportive care had mean arterial pressure maintained throughout the treatment period (Table 2), contributing to their improved survival (Fig. 5B). The greater amounts of normal saline and norepinephrine used for group II rabbits were needed to maintain mean arterial pressure at 9 h postinfection, but ultimately the vast majority of these rabbits still developed lethal hypotension in the absence of effective antibiotic therapy. In contrast, without ICU-supportive care, group I rabbits developed a lethal drop in mean arterial pressure (Table 2). Except for the one rabbit that died due to endotracheal tube occlusion/suctioning failure among group III rabbits treated with humanized meropenem alone, all seven remaining rabbits that died had a decrease of >30% in mean arterial pressure from preinfection baseline in the hour preceding death, indicating the clinical utility of ICU-supportive care to extend life and provide extra time for antibiotic to work.TABLE 2Baseline characteristics and outcomes of humanized meropenem in a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumoniaa,b,c,d,eParameterSampling timeGroup I placebo (saline)Group

The baseline characteristics of the 68 rabbits randomized into the four experimental groups were similar at the preinfection time point at 1 h before infection as well as at the time of treatment randomization at 3 h postinfection (Table 2). ARDS-associated biomarkers\u2014namely, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PaCO2, pH, base excess, lactate, white blood cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets\u2014for group I rabbits treated with placebo and group II rabbits treated with placebo plus ICU-supportive care worsened dramatically over the four blood sampling time points at preinfection, 3 h postinfection when treatment was initiated, 9 h postinfection, and terminal endpoint (P values for linear test for trend were all significant; see Table 2). In contrast, the worsening of these biomarkers was consistently halted or reversed temporally in group III rabbits treated with humanized meropenem alone or group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem plus ICU-supportive care (Table 2). In particular, comparison of these biomarkers at the terminal endpoint showed significantly improved biomarker outcomes for group III and group IV rabbits compared to those of group I rabbits (Table 2).ARDS has been associated with multiple organ dysfunction in a subset of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (26). Our results were consistent with this finding, as we found that blood biomarkers associated with acute heart injury (e.g., cardiac troponin I, CK-MB, myoglobin), acute liver injury (e.g., alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin), and acute kidney injury (e.g., creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) increased progressively in a subset of the rabbits (Table 2). Group III and group IV treated rabbits with humanized meropenem had significantly less increase in some of the biomarkers compared to those of group I rabbits treated with placebo (Table 2). DISCUSSIONWe have developed a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia using a drug-susceptible P. aeruginosa strain 6206, which recapitulated hallmark features of ARDS in humans, including acute lung injury and inflammation (Table 1), dissemination of bacteria from lung to other vital organs (Fig. 2), severe leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, progressive decrease in PaO2:FiO2, and hyperlactatemia (Fig. 3 and Table 2) (23, 24, 27). Strain 6206 was selected for rabbit model development because it is more virulent than other P. aeruginosa strains in mouse pneumonia models (28,\u201330). The enhanced pathogenicity of strain 6206 may be due to its production of the type III secretion system protein, ExoU (31), which had been associated with poor clinical outcomes in VABP patients (32, 33) and shown to be a major virulence determinant in mouse models of nonventilated pneumonia as well as in a rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia (29, 34, 35). ExoU is a cytotoxin that has potent phospholipase A2 activity when injected into a variety of eukaryotic cells (36), resulting in impairment of phagocytic cells as well as exacerbating their transepithelial migration into the inflamed lungs (37, 38). In our rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the ExoU-producing strain 6206 provoked as early as 3 h postinfection a state of profound neutropenia that was accompanied by widespread neutrophil influx into the alveolar space (Fig. 1 and \u200band33 and Table 1). Mortality in our rabbit model correlated with the severity of neutropenia in peripheral blood, neutrophilia in the lung, alveolar edema, and arterial hypoxemia (Fig. 1 and \u200band3),3), which are hallmark clinical features of ARDS (39). The infected rabbits developed severe hypotension and septic shock that were nonresponsive to fluid challenge alone and needed norepinephrine to maintain arterial blood pressure (Table 2). Although a subset of the rabbits also developed multiple organ dysfunction, as evidenced by increased in biomarkers associated with acute heart injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury (Table 2), they appeared more likely to die of hypoxemia (very low PaO2:FiO2 ratio) and less likely to die of multiple organ dysfunction, which is similar to the pattern seen in patients with ARDS (26).In the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia, therapeutic intervention starting at 3 h postinfection with humanized meropenem alone or humanized meropenem plus ICU-supportive care (norepinephrine and fluid challenge) not only improved survival (Fig. 5B) but also halted or reversed progression of ARDS as evidenced by significant improvement of clinically relevant biomarkers (e.g., PaO2:FiO2, PaCO2, pH, base excess, lactate white blood cells, neutrophils, platelets, etc., Table 2). We utilized a conservative, fluid restrictive approach, which relied on the use of norepinephrine more than fluid challenge with normal saline, to manage severe hypotension associated with ARDS, which appeared to be effective in minimizing resultant volume overload that could exacerbate pulmonary edema (Fig. 5C).Our efficacy study in the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia made use of a humanized meropenem dosing regimen that mimicked the plasma concentration-time profile of VABP patients dosed with 2 g of meropenem as a 3-h infusion every 8 h (Fig. 5A) (25). This extended meropenem dosing regimen maximized the time-dependent bacterial killing activity of meropenem, improved the probability of target attainment, and was used for the recently approved drug combination of 2 g meropenem and 2 g vaborbactam as a 3-h infusion (25, 40,\u201342). Our rabbits were exposed to only 32 h of meropenem (4 doses every 8 h), which was sufficient to achieve microbiological clearance of the drug-susceptible P. aeruginosa strain 6206 in 33% (6/18) and 61% (11/18) of group III rabbits treated with humanized meropenem alone and group IV rabbits treated with humanized meropenem and ICU-supportive care, respectively (Fig. 5D). We have monitored rabbits for up to 72 h postinfection in this model, potentially allowing for additional doses of antibiotics to be administered, but the risk of endotracheal tube occlusion with accumulated mucus also increased over time.Our study has limitations. First, because the strain 6206 is susceptible to all antibiotics used to treat P. aeruginosa infection, we were unable to show treatment failure that would be expected when rabbits are treated with an antibacterial drug for which the bacterial strain demonstrates in vitro resistance. Further development of the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia will benefit from use of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical strains that would not only allow for demonstration of lower or no efficacy based on the strain\u2019s in vitro resistance phenotype (e.g., meropenem treatment against a carbapenem-resistant strain) but also facilitate the development of new antibacterial drugs that restore activity against certain resistance mechanisms (e.g., \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor candidates that restore efficacy of meropenem against carbapenem-resistant strains). Second, prolonged mechanical ventilation of rabbits with humidified air resulted in accumulation of mucus in the distal lumen of the endotracheal tube over time. Although \u223c90% of partially occluded endotracheal tubes were cleared successfully by standard suctioning procedure, we failed to remove large mucus plugs that totally blocked endotracheal tubes in three rabbits, one from each of experimental groups II, III, and IV (Fig. 5). The available clinical, biomarker, and microbiological data indicate that the three rabbits did not die from ARDS but rather died from occluded endotracheal tube; nonetheless, we still included these three rabbits in all statistical analyses per our intention-to-treat plan. Third, treatment was initiated at 3 h postinfection, corresponding to an early stage of ventilator-associated pneumonia with the onset of leukopenia/neutropenia and histologic evidence of diffused neutrophilic infiltration throughout the rabbit lung (Fig. 1 and Table 1), but before the onset of ARDS as PaO2:FiO2 remained within the normal range (Fig. 3B and Table 2) (23, 24). Triggering antibiotic and ICU-supportive care at later stages of ventilator-associated pneumonia will likely reduce overall survival but may more closely mimic when therapy is initiated in patients. Fourth, despite our use of lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes of 6 to 7\u2009ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O and FiO2 of 35%, prone positioning, as well as minute-to-minute titration of ICU-supportive care like fluid challenge and norepinephrine, these measures failed to protect 3 of 18 group IV rabbits from death due to ARDS. A future refinement of this rabbit model will include increasing positive end-expiratory pressure and FiO2 in line with oxygen requirement, which may further enhance survival (43).In summary, the rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia reproduced hallmark clinical features of ARDS in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa. Treatment studies with humanized meropenem dosing regimen halted or reversed ARDS progression and improved survival, indicating that this rabbit model could be used for the preclinical development of new drugs and predict therapeutic efficacy in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy design. For the natural history, 19 rabbits were used to identify the minimum lethal dose of P. aeruginosa strain 6206 and 47 rabbits were used to determine the extent to which human VABP could be reproduced in the rabbit model. For the efficacy study, 82 rabbits were used to assess whether a humanized dosing regimen of meropenem with or without ICU-supportive care (fluid challenge plus norepinephrine) could halt or reverse lethal disease progression, which provides an indication as to whether this model can be used to predict antibiotic efficacy in humans. The strain 6206, originally isolated from a human corneal infection, was chosen for rabbit model development because it is more virulent than other P. aeruginosa strains in mouse pneumonia models, it has been used in many mouse pneumonia efficacy studies, and it is susceptible to all antipseudomonal antibiotics (28,\u201330). For strain 6206, the MIC is 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/ml for meropenem and 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml for tobramycin.The rabbit model of ventilator-associated pneumonia was approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.Experimental ICU. Our studies were conducted in an experimental ICU in which rabbits were mechanically ventilated with lung-protective low tidal volume of 6 to 7\u2009ml/kg, peak inspiratory pressure of 15\u2009cm H2O, positive end-expiration pressure of 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/minute, flow rate of 4 liters/min, fraction of inspired oxygen of 35%, and 2.0 to 2.5% isoflurane to maintain general anesthesia. Rabbits were instrumented with multiple intravenous catheters for individualized administration of fluid challenge and minute-to-minute titration of norepinephrine. Twelve rabbits may be used concurrently using 12 operating tables fully equipped with pressure-controlled ventilators (Engler ADS 2000 Anesthesia Delivery System), patient monitors (Philips MP90), and infusion pumps (Hospira Plum). Rabbits were infused with humanized antibiotic dosing regimen using computer-controlled syringe pumps. Patient monitors were networked to a central monitoring system to record the following data at 1-min resolution: SpO2 (oxygen saturation), ETCO2 (mainstream end-tidal CO2), heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and rectal temperature. A medical team of 4 physician-scientists and 4 to 6 technicians managed the 12 infected rabbits in shifts to cover the 48-h study period. Our experimental ICU afforded the opportunity to reproduce conditions that are encountered in the management of HABP/VABP patients and allowed for evaluation of new drug candidates in a manner mimicking how they will be administered in clinical practice.Intubation, catheterization, and anesthesia protocol. Each rabbit was sedated by administration of buprenorphine (0.02\u2009mg/kg) subcutaneously and then, after 30 min, injected intramuscularly with a solution containing 36\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 5.2\u2009mg/kg xylazine. Ophthalmic ointment was placed on each eye, which was then taped shut. Once the desired depth of anesthesia was achieved, a cuffed endotracheal tube (3.0\u2009mm diameter) was introduced orally into the trachea. The endotracheal tube was connected to a neonatal ventilatory circuit (Fisher & Paykel), which was then connected to a heated humidifier (Fisher & Paykel) and then a ventilator (ADS 2000, Engler). The ventilator settings remained constant for the duration of the study, except when various maneuvers were attempted to clear an occluded endotracheal tube (see below).The left or right marginal ear vein for each rabbit was cannulated with a 22G \u00d7 1\u201d intravenous (i.v.) catheter for continuous infusion of Normosol-R with 5% dextrose (4\u2009ml/kg/h) using an infusion pump (Hospira) for fluid replacement.The right carotid artery for each rabbit was cannulated with a catheter (18G for 3.0 to 3.4-kg rabbits and 16G for >3.4-kg rabbits) and positioned approximately 2 to 3\u2009cm from the common aortic arch using a common cutdown approach as detailed here. In brief, the surgical site was shaved, scrubbed, and prepped aseptically. The surgical site was then draped out with sterile towels. The rabbit was placed in a supine position and depth of anesthesia was assessed by pinching between the toes. If rabbit was responsive, isoflurane was increased to effect. A 2-to 3-cm incision was made to access the right carotid artery using aseptic technique. Blunt and sharp dissection was used to identify and isolate the carotid artery from the vagus nerve. A distal 3-0 silk ligature was placed around the carotid artery to prevent back bleeding. A loose proximal ligature was placed around the carotid artery. A small (approximately 1\u2009mm) cut was made at an angle across the vessel and 16G or 18G catheter was passed through the cut proximally and advanced about 5\u2009cm so that the catheter tip was positioned approximately 2 to 3\u2009cm from the common aortic arch. The proximal ligature was tied to secure the catheter in place. The carotid artery was repositioned below the sternocleidomastoid. The wound was closed in at least 2 layers. The catheter was connected to patient monitor (MP90, Philips) for arterial blood pressure monitoring. To maintain patency, the arterial catheter was flushed continuously with 3\u2009ml/h normal saline containing 1 unit/ml heparin and also manually flushed every 30\u2009min with three quick flushes of normal saline containing 1 unit/ml heparin.Preinfection monitoring. Each rabbit was mechanically ventilated for approximately 10 h in the period from the end of surgery for carotid catheterization to infection by direct lung instillation with P. aeruginosa. During this preinfection period, a subset of rabbits developed hypotension due to overstimulation of the vagus nerve during carotid catheterization. Fluid challenge with normal saline and norepinephrine was administered via the i.v. catheter in the marginal ear vein to correct the hypotension. For fluid challenge, 30\u2009ml/kg of normal saline was administered by 15-min infusion. If hypotension was not corrected so that mean arterial pressure exceeded 45\u2009mm Hg after the fluid challenge, then 0.1 to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/kg/min norepinephrine was administered. Fluid challenge with normal saline and norepinephrine administration was discontinued at least 3\u2009h before infection. In the hour preceding planned infection, rabbits were assessed and excluded from the study if they had the following preexisting/preinfection conditions: hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure of <39 mm Hg), rectal temperature exceeding 106.5\u00b0F, elevated cardiac troponin I of >0.5\u2009ng/ml (assayed at the point of care using Stratus CS, Siemens). The rest of the rabbits were included in the various studies.Direct lung instillation of inoculum. For endobronchial instillation of (i) vehicle control, LRS, (ii) live P. aeruginosa inoculum, or (iii) UV-killed P. aeruginosa inoculum, each rabbit was injected intramuscularly with a solution containing 36\u2009mg/kg ketamine and 5.2\u2009mg/kg xylazine. Allowing 6 to 8\u2009min for ketamine/xylazine to take effect, the rabbit was then disconnected from the breathing circuit. A 2.2-ml solution containing LRS or the desired number of washed bacteria (see supplemental material) was drawn into a syringe outfitted with an 8-cm catheter, which was then inserted through the endotracheal tube. A slow push (20 to 30 s) allowed for bilateral instillation of bacteria into the rabbit lungs. The rabbit was reconnected to the breathing circuit at 1\u2009min after bacterial instillation.Postinfection monitoring and euthanasia. Arterial blood samples were drawn at various time points for the natural history and efficacy studies. The total volume of blood drawn from all samples did not exceed 20\u2009ml per rabbit for the entire duration of each study. Blood samples (0.25\u2009ml of blood in EDTA-K2 microtainer) were analyzed for 5-part differential blood count analysis (HT5 Hematology System, Heska). Other blood samples (0.6\u2009ml in 1-ml lithium heparin syringe) were subjected to blood gas analysis (Rapidpoint 500, Siemens), cardiac biomarker analysis (cardiac troponin I, CK-MB, myoglobin on Stratus CS, Siemens), and liver and kidney biomarker analysis (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] on VETSCAN VS2 analyzer, Abaxis).Infected rabbits were monitored continuously up to 48 h postinfection for natural history studies and for up to 35 h postinfection for efficacy studies. All rabbits were euthanized while under general anesthesia and never allowed to wake up. Rabbits were euthanized when mean arterial pressure was decreased by >50% from preinfection baseline and blood lactate was >10\u2009mmol/liter, or when they reached the predetermine study end time of 35 or 48 h. Euthanasia was achieved by intravenous injection of lethal dose of >390\u2009mg sodium pentobarbital followed by bilateral thoracotomy. Necropsy was performed to harvest lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Organs were weighed, and gross lung images were photographed with ruler.Humanized meropenem dosing regimen. To mimic concentration-time profile of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with meropenem 2 g every 8 h as an extended 3-h infusion, we dosed rabbits with meropenem 100\u2009mg/kg every 8 h (q8h) (4 doses total) at 3 h postinfection using a staggered-continuous infusion protocol in which rabbits were dosed with 20, 28.5, 35, 10, 5, 1.5\u2009mg/kg during the respective intervals of 0 to 1 h, 1 to 2 h, 2 to 3 h, 3 to 4 h, 4 to 6 h, and 6 to 8 h, using a constant infusion rate within each interval using two programmed syringe pumps (Chemyx) for each rabbit. Meropenem powder was reconstituted in saline to 50\u2009mg/ml and then diluted further to 20\u2009mg/ml for intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of meropenem were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the first dose for uninfected rabbits at 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.9, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, and 8.0 h postdose and for the second dose for infected rabbits at 0, 1.5, 2.9, 4, 5, 5.9, 7.9 h postdose. The lower limit of quantification was 1.56\u2009\u03bcg/ml for meropenem in rabbit plasma. PK Solver v2.0 was used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using the module for one-compartment analysis of plasma data after intravenous infusion (44).See the supplemental material for detailed information on animal history, endotracheal tube suctioning to maintain patency, fluid challenge and norepinephrine algorithms, bacterial inoculum preparation, histopathological analyses, determination of bacterial burden in five vital organs, and statistical analyses.
