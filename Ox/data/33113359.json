CPSF73 is crucial because its depletion induces transcriptional read-through that is often hundreds of kilobases in length (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020). Its Pol-II-associated cleavage product is degraded 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 by XRN2, which promotes termination by the so-called \u201ctorpedo\u201d model (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2018; Fong et\u00a0al., 2015). This mechanism also incorporates allosteric features, defined as modifications to the elongation complex, which slow polymerases down at the end of the gene (Cortazar et\u00a0al., 2019; Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020; Eaton and West, 2020). However, Pol II transcribes multiple gene classes where transcriptional termination mechanisms are relatively unexplored. In many of these cases, primary transcripts are endoribonucleolytically cleaved, suggesting some common mechanistic features (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005; Fatica et\u00a0al., 2000).The spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are a prominent Pol-II-transcribed gene class. snRNA precursors are endoribonucleolytically cleaved by the Integrator complex, in which a paralog of CPSF73, called INTS11, provides endoribonuclease activity and promotes transcriptional termination (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005; O\u2019Reilly et\u00a0al., 2014; Skaar et\u00a0al., 2015). Cleavage is positioned by a 3\u2032 box sequence located after the cut site (Guiro and Murphy, 2017). Recent findings implicate Integrator in promoter-proximal regulation of Pol II transcription (Beckedorff et\u00a0al., 2020; Elrod et\u00a0al., 2019; Stadelmayer et\u00a0al., 2014; Tatomer et\u00a0al., 2019). Integrator is also involved in the termination of other non-coding transcripts, including enhancer RNAs and promoter upstream transcripts (Beckedorff et\u00a0al., 2020; Lai et\u00a0al., 2015; Nojima et\u00a0al., 2018). Lastly, Integrator mutations are associated with some neurological diseases (Oegema et\u00a0al., 2017).In budding yeast, termination of protein-coding gene transcription is similar to that in humans (Kim et\u00a0al., 2004; West et\u00a0al., 2004). However, snRNA termination uses the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which releases precursors that are then subject to 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 degradation (Allmang et\u00a0al., 1999; Schaughency et\u00a0al., 2014; Steinmetz et\u00a0al., 2001). Termination of many other RNA polymerases is not associated with prior endo- or exoribonuclease activity and defines 3\u2032 ends directly. For example, Pol III terminates at four or more Ts in the non-template strand, and the prokaryotic RNA polymerase often terminates at similar sequence elements aided by an upstream hairpin sequence (Arimbasseri et\u00a0al., 2014; Ray-Soni et\u00a0al., 2016; Zenkin, 2014). The weak thermodynamic stability of rU:dA hybrids may help this process (Martin and Tinoco, 1980). Interestingly, T-runs were identified decades ago as intrinsic terminators of purified human Pol II in\u00a0vitro (Dedrick et\u00a0al., 1987; Reines et\u00a0al., 1987).We have investigated the transcriptional termination mechanism on snRNA genes by asking whether there is obligate coupling to Integrator activities. There is clear involvement of Integrator, but termination still occurs without it. In some cases, this involves CPSF73; however, an alternative process seems to directly release 3\u2032 ends for exosome degradation. The characterization of exosome-targeted snRNAs reveals stochastic termination without upstream cleavage and sometimes at T-runs. This feature suggests a common underlying principle for transcriptional termination that, for Pol II, can be applied at snRNA genes. Results and DiscussionINTS11 Depletion Delays but Does Not Abolish Termination of snRNA TranscriptionTo study the role of Integrator in snRNA transcriptional termination, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to Carboxyl (C)-terminally tag endogenous INTS11 with a small-molecule-assisted shut-off (SMASh) modality (Chung et\u00a0al., 2015). An internal NS3 protease constitutively cleaves off the SMASh tag but is inhibited by Asunaprevir (ASN) whereupon the tagged factor is degraded (Figure\u00a01A). A constitutively removed tag was selected because the C-terminus of INTS11 is important for functional interactions (Albrecht and Wagner, 2012). HCT116 cells were edited due to their diploid karyotype. PCR confirmed homozygous targeting of INTS11 with SMASh (Figures S1A and S1B), and western blotting demonstrated depletion of the INTS11 protein after 48\u00a0h of ASN treatment (Figure\u00a01B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Termination of snRNA Transcription Is Partially Impaired by Integrator Depletion(A) Schematic of the SMASh tag system. Under normal conditions, the degron-encoded NS3 protease (green) removes the tag and the protein is stable.

Signal is RPKM.We analyzed the impact of INTS11 depletion on snRNA processing by using quantitative reverse transcription and PCR (qRT-PCR) with primers spanning the canonical Integrator cleavage sites on RNU4-1 and RNU5A-1. These species accumulate following ASN treatment, confirming the effectiveness of the system (Figure\u00a01C). Next, we analyzed extended transcripts at three other snRNA genes by using snRNA-proximal and -distal primers, with samples from unmodified HCT116 cells included as a control. ASN treatment increases the levels of snRNA-proximal amplicons in INTS11-SMASh cells but not in unmodified cells, showing the specificity of the system (Figure\u00a01D). The effect is lower at downstream regions, suggesting that termination occurs in delayed fashion when INTS11 is depleted. Nuclear RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), performed in INTS11-SMASh cells, showed this to be generally true for other expressed snRNAs (Figure\u00a01E). An analysis of published Pol II occupancy data confirmed that INTS11 depletion delays but does not abolish snRNA termination (Figure\u00a0S1C; Stadelmayer et\u00a0al., 2014).INTS1 Depletion Delays but Does Not Abolish snRNA Transcriptional TerminationOther Integrator components might be more critical for transcriptional termination than INTS11. To test this, we depleted INTS1 by RNAi\u2014chosen as the largest subunit and separate from the cleavage module (Albrecht et\u00a0al., 2018). We confirmed INTS1 protein depletion (Figure\u00a0S1D) and sequenced chromatin-associated RNA from cells treated with control or INTS1 small interfering RNA (siRNAs). Meta-analysis shows that INTS1 depletion increases snRNA read-through but that the effect declines within 1 kb (Figure\u00a01F). An analysis of individual snRNAs/small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) confirms that read-through RNA levels diminish to control levels within a few kb (Figure\u00a0S1E). This was also the case when RNU4-2 read-through was assayed following INTS1 and INTS11 co-depletion (Figure\u00a0S1F). Therefore, although efficient termination of snRNA transcription requires Integrator, other mechanisms can compensate for its depletion.The Exosome Degrades Precursor snRNAsIntegrator-independent termination should release 3\u2032 ends that might be susceptible to degradation by the 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoribonucleolytic exosome. To investigate this, INTS11-SMASh cells were transfected with control siRNAs or siRNAs against the EXOSC3 subunit of the exosome before treatment or not with ASN to degrade INTS11. Unprocessed RNU4-1 and RNU5A-1 precursors accumulate following INTS11 loss as expected (Figure\u00a02A). They also accumulate following EXOSC3 depletion, suggesting that some snRNA precursors are degraded by the exosome. Interestingly, co-depletion of EXOSC3 and INTS11 caused a much larger effect than their individual depletion. A similar result was seen following RNAi depletion of INTS1 and elimination of the catalytic subunit of the exosome DIS3 by an auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag (Figure\u00a02B). Despite this large accumulation of precursor snRNAs following exosome and Integrator co-depletion, read-through distance remains limited, indicating continued transcriptional termination (Figure\u00a02C). These data are supportive of exosome degradation of snRNA precursors that is more prominent upon reduced Integrator activity.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02snRNA Precursors Are Targeted for 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 Degradation by the Exosome(A) qRT-PCR analysis of INTS11-SMASh cells transfected with control or EXOSC3-siRNAs before treatment or not with ASN.

Data from two different INTS11 antibodies are displayed. The y axes shows RPKM (left for DIS3, right for INTS11).Another potential explanation for continued termination following Integrator depletion is that residual activity, remaining after knockdown, is sufficient to maintain an Integrator-dependent process. To test the functional extent of INTS1 depletion, DIS3-AID cells were transfected with control or INTS1 siRNAs before treatment or not with ASN. Transcription was then inhibited by actinomycin D (actD) for 15\u00a0min and unprocessed RNU4-2, RNU5A-1, and RNU1-1 transcripts were monitored by qRT-PCR (Figure\u00a02D). In control cells, actD caused a reduction in these precursors, reflecting continued processing/degradation following transcription inhibition. This reduction is less marked following DIS3 loss, which we confirmed using another method of transcriptional inhibition (Figure\u00a0S2A). As primers span the Integrator cleavage sites, this suggests that DIS3 targets transcripts that escape maturation rather than competing with processing. This idea is supported by recent findings that mature snRNA accumulation is unaffected by exosome depletion (Lardelli and Lykke-Andersen, 2020). Following INTS1 depletion, a substantial fraction of precursors are lost after actD treatment either because of residual Integrator activity or degradation of the resulting unprocessed products. The latter explanation is favored because INTS1 and DIS3 co-depletion prevents most turnover following actD treatment (almost 100% of each precursor remains after 15\u00a0min of treatment). This level of functional loss makes it unlikely that residual Integrator fully accounts for termination following its depletion and implicates additional mechanisms.The generation of precursor snRNA exosome substrates is likely to be common because 3\u2032 flanking transcripts accumulate within just 1\u00a0h of DIS3 depletion (Figure\u00a0S2B). Consistently, an analysis of published PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) shows DIS3 occupancy of snRNAs 3\u2032 flanking RNAs in otherwise unmodified cells (Figure\u00a02E). In contrast, published eCLIP (enhanced CLIP) shows no clear INTS11 crosslinking beyond annotated snRNAs, suggesting that Integrator-independent processes may generate DIS3 substrates (Figure\u00a02E). DIS3 does not occupy transcripts downstream of protein-coding genes, which are unaffected by its loss (Figure\u00a0S2C; Davidson et\u00a0al., 2019).Many Exosome-Targeted snRNA Precursors Are Released by Transcriptional TerminationWe hypothesized that the exosome degrades snRNA precursors produced by non-Integrator cleavage activities or by termination itself. CPSF73 could provide alternative endoribonuclease activity and can be rapidly depleted from our previously described CPSF73-AID cells by using auxin (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020). Although termination of snRNA transcription is unaffected by CPSF73 elimination (Figures S2D and S2E; Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020), its activity might only be relevant when Integrator is absent. We analyzed chromatin-associated RNA-seq performed in CPSF73-AID cells treated with control or INTS1 siRNAs before auxin addition. Co-depletion of CPSF73 with INTS1 enhances read-through at some (e.g., SNORD13 and RNU5B-1) sno/snRNAs (Figure\u00a03A). This finding implies auxiliary cleavage activities may be relevant when Integrator is depleted; however, this effect is not broadly apparent (Figure\u00a03B). An interesting feature of the metagene profiles in Figure\u00a03B is that CPSF73 depletion also reduces the effects of INTS1 loss, indicating some potential cross-talk between these nuclease activities. However, we previously noted reduced nascent transcription of many genes following CPSF73 depletion, with some evidence for this also seen downstream of snRNA genes (Figure\u00a0S2F; Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Redundant RNA Cleavage and Direct Termination Generate Some RNA 3\u2032 Ends at snRNA Genes(A) Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) traces of RNU5B-1, SNORD13, RNU12, and RNU4ATAC (location indicated by black bar under each trace) from chromatin-associated RNA-seq performed in CPSF73-AID cells transfected with control or INTS1 siRNAs before treatment or not with auxin.

The y axis signals are RPKM.(D) Metaplot of mNET-seq versus DIS3 PAR-CLIP (Szczepi\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2015) at all expressed snRNAs. The Pol II mNET-seq signal is very high at the final nucleotide of snRNAs because of the detection of their incorporation into spliceosomes (Nojima et\u00a0al., 2015). Therefore, a zoomed view is provided to highlight nascent signals beyond this region. The y axes show RPKM and signals are in 50-bp bins.(E) IGV tracks of RNU4-2 and SNORD13 (location indicated by black bar under each trace) comparing DIS3 PAR-CLIP signals (Szczepi\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2015) with nuclear RNA-seq obtained after auxin-dependent depletion of XRN2 (1-h depletion) (previously presented in Eaton et\u00a0al., 2018). The y axis signals are RPKM.Because CPSF73 activity does not generally explain Integrator-independent termination, we analyzed whether exosome-targeted snRNA precursors are generated by transcriptional termination. We mapped Pol II relative to DIS3 activity by using mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq), which has single-nucleotide resolution (Nojima et\u00a0al., 2015), and compared it to DIS3 occupancy uncovered by PAR-CLIP (Szczepi\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2015). Although individual DIS3 and Pol II mNET-seq signals do not necessarily reveal their last possible position, a direct termination mechanism predicts little Pol II occupancy beyond the extremity of the DIS3 PAR-CLIP signal. In contrast, an endoribonuclease-based mechanism classically leads to downstream transcription and 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 degradation of a 3\u2032 product (Eaton and West, 2020). Individual snRNAs show Pol II occupancy over DIS3-bound regions but much less coverage downstream of them, and a metagene analysis shows a close correlation between the decline of DIS3 and Pol II signals (Figures 3C and 3D). XRN2 elimination has no detectable impact on RNA surrounding these positions, suggesting that there are no substrates for its 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2018 and Figure\u00a03E). Although other 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonucleases cannot be completely ruled out, these data suggest that snRNA termination directly releases some DIS3 substrates.Exosome-Targeted Termination Occurs before snRNA Processing and Sometimes at T-RunsAllosteric/intrinsic termination in other systems often occurs at T-rich sequences in the non-template strand. To examine the terminal sequence(s) and upstream processing status of snRNA termination products, we used long-read nanopore sequencing on nuclear RNA from DIS3-AID cells treated or not with auxin. Long-read protocols normally detect polyadenylated RNA, but snRNA precursors may not have this modification. RNA was, therefore, GI-tailed to provide a common 3\u2032 end to amplify (Figure\u00a04A). To discriminate against RNA from within Pol II (which can also be GI-tailed in\u00a0vitro), reverse -transcription was designed to enrich oligoadenylated 3\u2032 ends, which are well-established features of exosome substrates (LaCava et\u00a0al., 2005; West et\u00a0al., 2006; Wyers et\u00a0al., 2005). RNA-derived products were enriched by GI-tailing, and complete transcripts were recovered from GI-tailed samples, exemplified by GAPDH mRNA (Figure\u00a04B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Analysis of Full-Length snRNA Precursors by Long-Read Sequencing(A) Schematic of long-read sequencing strategy. Nuclei contain mature polyadenylated RNAs with long poly(A) tails (black), terminated oligoadenylated species that might be exosome substrates (red), and unadenylated (blue) transcripts that, for example, might derive from Pol II. GI-tailing allows the sequencing of RNAs with pre-existing poly(A) (black) or oligoA (red) tails following an oligo-dC(T)3-primed cDNA synthesis step.(B) Agarose gel analysis of GAPDH transcripts isolated from DIS3-AID cells treated or not with auxin and/or GI-tailed, as indicated.

Individual reads show exons (pink) linked by introns removed by splicing. White space indicates unmapped regions between reads presumably truncated at their 5\u2032/3\u2032 ends. The blue signal coverage in auxin-treated samples derives from an annotated anti-sense RNA degraded by DIS3.(C\u2013E) Long-read sequencing tracks of RNU12, RNU11, and RNU5F-1 snRNAs from the GI-tailing experiment.

The black bar under each trace denotes the size and position of each mature snRNA as annotated.(F) qRT-PCR from HCT116 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing RNU4-2 or a derivative lacking a downstream T-tract (red circle). Primers were used to detect read-through RNA beyond the T-tract, as shown in the schematic. Graph shows fold increase relative to the unmodified construct after normalizing to GFP levels from a co-transfected control plasmid. n\u00a0= 5. Error bars are SEM.Full-length snRNA precursors were also recovered, of which many could be terminated products (Figures 4C\u20134E). They are strongly stabilized by DIS3 loss and are not processed by Integrator, which data above anticipated by showing that DIS3 targeted precursors are poorly processed. The 3\u2032 ends show a largely stochastic distribution, arguing against any sequence-defined endoribonucleolytic activity as predicted by our mNET-seq experiment and supporting termination as a possible source. Interestingly, precursors often stack over T-runs in the non-transcribed strand. In many systems, T-runs directly promote (e.g., Pol III) or facilitate (many prokaryotic RNA polymerases) transcriptional termination (Arimbasseri et\u00a0al., 2014; Ray-Soni et\u00a0al., 2016). 36% of the snRNAs that we analyzed showed evidence of termination at T > 4, a criteria selected because this is a minimal Pol III terminator (Table S1). Unlike for Pol III, Pol II termination is not inevitable at T-runs, as shown on RNU5F-1 where reads extend beyond some T-stretches (Figure\u00a04D). This has some analogy with bacterial intrinsic terminators, which culminate in a T-rich sequence but are variably efficient depending on other elements. Some snRNA precursors do not possess extensive T-runs but still exhibit stochastic 3\u2032 termini that are not processed at the upstream canonical Integrator site (Figure\u00a0S3). 3\u2032 end mapping using an Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase (EPAP) and short-read sequencing gave similar findings to these long-read data (Figures S4A\u2013S4F). Although some 3\u2032 ends detected in these experiments may still represent RNA cleavage sites, the absence of INTS11 cross-linking and the independence of such events from INTS1 argue against Integrator being responsible (Figure\u00a02E andFigure\u00a0S4G). Moreover, deletion of a single T-run from an RNU4-2 reporter plasmid caused an enhancement of read-through, further arguing for a function of such elements in termination (Figure\u00a04F).Here, we identify a transcriptional termination mechanism at snRNAs that does not require canonical Integrator processing. Many such events appear to be allosteric/intrinsic in nature on the basis that 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity (XRN2) is not implicated. We suggest that Pol II is generally prone to terminate stochastically downstream of snRNAs, with this activity focused by T-runs. T-runs are intrinsic terminators of other RNA polymerases and of purified Pol II in\u00a0vitro (Dedrick et\u00a0al., 1987), but we do not rule out the involvement of proteins. In budding yeast, termination of snRNA transcription uses the Sen1 helicase, and mapping of its terminated transcripts reveals U-rich regions at the 3\u2032 ends that could aid this process (Schaughency et\u00a0al., 2014). Finally, Integrator is broadly involved in early Pol II termination, including at promoter proximal and enhancer regions (Beckedorff et\u00a0al., 2020; Lai et\u00a0al., 2015; Nojima et\u00a0al., 2018; Stadelmayer et\u00a0al., 2014). In those cases, its depletion does not prevent termination to the extent that CPSF73 elimination does at protein-coding genes, which might be due to alternative pathways akin to those identified here.

These were maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and grown in dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. INTS11-SMASh cells were obtained by transfecting a subconfluent 6-well dish with 1ug px330, containing the INTS11 guide RNA sequence, and 1ug each of SMASh neomycin and hygromycin repair constructs using Jetprime. Media was refreshed after 16\u00a0hr and after a further 48\u00a0hr cells were expanded to a 100mm dish containing 30ug/ml hygromycin and 800ug/ml G418. \u223c10-14\u00a0days later, single colonies were picked and expanded for genomic PCR confirmation of INTS11 modification. DIS3-AID cells are described in detail elsewhere as are the nucleotide sequences of P2A, Neomycin, Hygromycin and the SV40 PAS included in the HDR templates (Davidson et\u00a0al., 2019; Eaton et\u00a0al., 2018).Method DetailsINTS11-SMASh cell line generation and other cloning INTS11 homology arms were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and inserted into a pUC-based plasmid using Gibson Assembly. The SMASh tag was PCR isolated from pCS6-YFP-SMASh and inserted into our previously described Hygromycin/Neomycin selection vectors (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2018), from which an AID tag had been removed by PCR. The resulting insert containing SMASh, a P2A cleavage sequence, the drug marker and an SV40 PAS was isolated by PCR and cloned into the INTS11 homology arm vector, that had been linearized at the stop codon by PCR, using Gibson assembly. The INTS11 guide RNA was designed using Benchling and cloned into px330 digested with BbsI. RNU4-2 sequences were isolated from HCT116 genomic DNA and inserted into a plasmid prepared by PCR amplification of a pcDNA5 FRT/TO plasmid containing the human beta-globin gene. The resulting plasmid replaced beta-globin and the upstream CMV promoter with the RNU4-2 sequence (see Table S2 for primers).Cell culture and experimental manipulation For INTS11 depletion ASN was added at 3uM final concentration for 48\u00a0hr. For INTS1/EXOSC3 RNAi, 6 well dishes were transfected with control or INTS1 siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX following the manufacturers protocol. The siRNA transfection was repeated after 24\u00a0hr and RNA was isolated 48\u00a0hr after that. For DIS3-AID depletion, auxin was added to a final concentration of 500uM. For CPSF73-AID depletion 1ug/ml doxycycline was added for 18\u00a0hr before treatment with auxin. ActD and triptolide were used at concentrations of 5ug/ml and 1uM triptolide respectively.RNA isolation for qRT-PCR This was generally performed in a 24-well dish using Tri-reagent following the manufacturer guidelines. Isolated RNA was treated with Turbo DNase for 1\u00a0hr at 37 degrees before phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 1ug of RNA was reverse transcribed using Protoscript II and 1/50th of the cDNA was used for real-time PCR which was performed on a QIAGEN Rotorgene using LUNA qPCR mastermix.Nuclear RNA-seq Nuclei were extracted from a sub-confluent 100mm dish of INTS11-SMASh cells after 0 or 48\u00a0h of asunaprevir treatment using 4ml HLB (10\u00a0mM Tris pH5.5, 10\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP40) underlayerd with 1ml HLB with 10% sucrose. After spinning for 5\u00a0min (500xg) the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1ml of Tri-reagent and RNA isolated as described for qRT-PCR above. RNA quantity was determined using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo) and its quality was assessed using a Tapestation (Agilent). 1\u00a0\u03bcg was rRNA-depleted and libraries were generated using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit.Chromatin-associated and nucleoplasmic RNA isolation and sequencing Nuclei were isolated as above then re-suspended in 100ul NUN1 (20mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 75\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.85\u00a0mM DTT) and incubated for 5\u00a0min on ice before the addition of 1\u00a0mL of NUN2 buffer (20\u00a0mM HEPES at pH 7.6, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 7.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA. 0.3\u00a0M NaCl, 1\u00a0M urea, 1% NP40). Cells were incubated on ice for 10\u00a0mins and shook at 2-3min intervals. After spinning (13000\u00a0rpm, 10\u00a0mins), nucleoplasmic RNA was phenol chloroform extracted from the supernatant and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The pellet (containing chromatin-associated RNA) was re-suspended in Trizol and incubated for \u223c30\u00a0mins at 37 degrees. RNA was then isolated as per the manufacturers guidelines. 1ug was prepared and used for RNA\u00a0sequencing as described for nuclear RNA. Chromatin-associated RNA-seq (Figures 1F, \u200bF,3A,3A, and 3B) was performed in CPSF73-AID cells and the control siRNA samples -/+IAA were previously analyzed for protein-coding termination defects (Eaton et\u00a0al., 2020). INTS1 siRNA samples are first described in the present paper.GI-tailing and nanopore sequencing Nuclear RNA extracted from DIS3-AID cells treated, or not, with IAA. This was first treated with RiboZero (Illumina) and GI-tailed using the poly(A) tail-length assay kit. The final RNA quantity and average length were determined using an HS Tapestation (Agilent). 50\u00a0ng of input RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a modified VNP primer, downstream steps were performed using the cDNA-PCR Sequencing Kit (SQK-PCS109) according to the protocol. For each library, we loaded 100 fmol sequentially on a MK 1 R9 flow cell and sequenced for \u223c4\u00a0h per library on a MinION device. The flow cell was washed between loading and sequencing of each library using a Wash Kit according to the user manual.EPAP tagging and sequencing 1ug of chromatin-associated or nucleoplasmic RNA was treated or not with EPAP (30 min, 30 degrees) then depleted of rRNA. Sequencing libraries were made using the QUANT-seq REV kit.mNET-seq The mNET-seq library protocol was performed as described by Nojima et\u00a0al. (2016) with the following modifications. Two sub-confluent 150mm dishes of cells were used per sample and chromatin pellets isolated as described above. The chromatin pellet was digested with micrococcal nuclease for 2\u00a0mins at 37 degrees. After inactivating the nuclease (25mM EGTA), the supernatant was incubated for 1\u00a0hr with magnetic beads (Sheep anti-mouse dynabeads) that had been preincubated for 2\u00a0hr with anti-Pol II. Immunoprecipitated RNA was 5\u2032 phosphorylated before purification of fragments between 17-200nt using a Quick-RNA microprep kit (Zymo). Libraries were prepared for sequencing using the NEB Next Small RNA sequencing kit.ChIP-sequencing One 100mm CPSF73-AID cells were used per condition. ChIP was performed with the Simple ChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit exactly as described in the product guidelines with one exception. Antibody (5ug Pol II, 8WG16) was coupled to sheep anti-mouse dynabeads instead of the beads included in the kit. Sequencing libraries were generated with the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit.BioinformaticsIllumina-Sequenced Short-Read Alignment The quality of demultiplexed raw 50\u00a0bp fastq reads was assessed using a combination of FastQC and MultiQC, before adaptor trimming using Trim_Galore (wrapper for Cutadapt) with default settings. Adaptor trimmed reads passing both length and quality cut-offs were then mapped to GRCh38 (Ensembl) using Hisat2 (Kim et\u00a0al., 2015). Unmapped and multi-mapped and reads with a MAPQ score\u00a0< 30 were discarded using SAMtools (Li et\u00a0al., 2009).EPAP Read Processing and Alignment Adaptor sequences were first removed from raw 50\u00a0bp fastq EPAP reads using Trim_Galore with default setting. Trimmed reads were screened using FastQC and MultiQC to confirm adaptor removal before trimming a second time using Trim_Galore, this time to remove long, non-encoded 3\u2032 poly(A) and poly(T) sequences. Following this, reads were mapped to GRCh38 using Hisat2 (Kim et\u00a0al., 2015), discarding unmapped, multi-mapped and low MAPRQ scored (< 30) reads using SAMTools (Li et\u00a0al., 2009).ONT Basecalling and Read Alignment The fast5 sequences were base-called and converted to a fastq file format using Guppy before being passed to pychopper to extract full-length reads and orientate them by strand. Adaptor sequences were then removed from full-length reads using porechop and mapped to GRCh38 using minimap2 (Li, 2018), with the following settings:-a -k 15 -w 5\u2013splice -g 2000 -G 200k -A 1 -B 2 -O 2,32 -E 1,0 -C 9 -z 200 -u f\u2013junc-bonus\u00a0= 9\u2013splice-flank\u00a0= yes\u2013no-long-join\u2013secondary\u00a0= noAligned reads were then filtered to remove unmapped, multi-mapped and low MAPQ (< 30) scored reads using the SAMTools suite (Li et\u00a0al., 2009).mNET-seq mapping The mNET-seq traces used single-nucleotide resolution BAM files corresponding to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA fragment (Nojima et\u00a0al., 2015).Generating Normalized Read Coverage BigWigs For IGV visualization and metagene analysis, libraries were merged with Bamtools (Barnett et\u00a0al., 2011). Normalized read coverage files of both short-read (Illumina) and long-reads (ONT) were produced using the deepTools at a single nucleotide resolution of sense and antisense separated strands (Ram\u00edrez et\u00a0al., 2014). Illumina reads were normalized to Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM), whereas ONT reads were normalized to Transcripts-Per-Million (TPM), ignoring reads with a MAPQ score\u00a0< 30.Metagene Analysis For snRNA metagene analysis, expressed snRNA genes (> 5 reads in untreated INTS11 cells) were selected from 157 ensembl annotated snRNA genes present in https://rnacentral.org/ and a window extending 1 kb downstream of each TES was then calculated and the snRNA gene body was scaled to 200bp. To prevent counting of ambiguous reads, snRNA genes near annotated genes (< 1kb downstream of their TES) were discarded using the BEDtools suite (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Pol III genes were removed. Metagene profiles were then calculated using RPKM normalized read coverage with further graphical processing performed in the R environment.For CPSF73-AID RNA Pol II ChIP metagene analysis all annotated snRNA genes were selected and a window of 1 kb downstream of the TES was incorporated. Due to differences in signal coverage between the CPSF73-AID samples, the auxin treated profile was scaled to the control profile using the mean signal difference over the gene body (scaled to 200\u00a0bp). Further graphical processing of metagene plots was performed in the R environment.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisqRT-PCR was quantitated using the comparative quantitation function associated with the QIAGEN Rotorgene instrument. Values were first normalized to a loading control (stated in the relevant figure legend) and then samples were compared by quantitating the experimental values relative to the control condition (given the value of 1 by the software). Bars show the average of at least three replicates (exact n provided in figure legends) and error bars show the standard deviation of the mean.
