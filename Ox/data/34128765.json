To January 7 of 2021, approximately 87,857,553 cases and 1,895,431 deaths (2.16%) from COVID-19 have been reported in the world [1]. Several prognosis factors have been reported as arterial hypertension, age, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, kidney dysfunction, cerebrovascular diseases, cardiac injury, coagulation alterations, the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), liver dysfunction, interleukin-6, genetic, red blood cell distribution width, and nitrates [2\u20139].Cell death by apoptosis, which is produced by a programmed and actively way, occurs in different physiological processes (tissue remodeling and morphogenesis) and in different diseases as infectious diseases [10]. There are two main apoptosis pathways, the intrinsic (also names as mitochondrial pathway) and the extrinsic (also named as death receptor pathway). The activation of extrinsic pathway occurs when a tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily (TNFSF) binding with its tumor necrosis factor membrane receptor superfamily (TNFRSF). The main receptors and ligands of the extrinsic pathway are the Fas receptor and its Fas ligand, and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAILR1\u20134) and its TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). When the TNFSF bindings with its TNFRSF is produced, a death signal leads to activation of pro-caspase-8 in caspase-8 (initiator caspase). Afterward, the activated caspase-8 produces the activation of caspase-3 (executor caspase) producing the cell death by apoptosis [10]. The activation of intrinsic pathway can occur through different stressors (oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, excitotoxicity deficits of growth factors, and genetic mutations) that open mitochondrial transition pores (MTP). Then, cytochrome c exits from mitochondria to cytosol and binds with procaspase-9 and apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf)-1 forming apoptosomes. These apoptosomes activate caspase-9 (initiator caspase). Afterward, the caspase-9 activated produces the activation of caspase-3 and 7 (executor caspases) producing the cell death death by apoptotic [10]. There are a family of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins that block MTP formation and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bclw) and a family of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that promote MTP formation and cytochrome c release (such as Bax, Bak, Bad, Bim, Bid) [10].There are scarce data published about apoptosis and COVID-19 patients [11\u201317]. Higher apoptosis of lymphocytes [11,12] and higher expression of Fas in lymphocytes [13,14] of COVID-19 patients than in control subjects have been found, and this is associated with lymphopenia of COVID-19 patients. In addition, higher blood concentrations of caspase-8 [15], caspase-3 [16], sFasL [16] and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 [17] in COVID-19 patients than in control subjects have been found. However, we have not found data about the association between apoptosis and mortality of COVID-19 patients. We had previously found a higher mortality in septic patients with high serum sFas concentrations [18] and low serum Bcl2 concentrations [19]. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze whether there is an association between serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2 and mortality of COVID-19 patients. 2.\u2003Methods2.1. Design and subjectsThe patients of this observational and prospective study were recruited during April 2020 in eight intensive care units from six hospitals from Canary Islands (Spain). The study (code CHUC-2020-26) was approved by the Ethics Committee of all hospitals. In the specific context in which the Spain Government forbid patient visits during the recruitment patient study time, the requirement of written informed consent was waived.We included patients with laboratory confirmation of SARSCoV-2 by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab sample or from bronchial aspirate.Previously, we have determined HLA genetic polymorphisms [4], serum nitrates [7], and red blood cell distribution width in some of the patients [9]. The objective of our study was to assess apoptosis by determining the serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2.2.2. Determination of serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2Serum samples at ICU admission were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until to blood determination time. We used the Human Fas ELISA Kit (Elabscience, Houston, Texas, USA) for the determination of serum sFas concentrations, with an assay detection limit of 19\u00a0pg/mL and coefficient of variation of intra-assay and inter-assay lower than 6%. We used the Human Bcl-2 ELISA Kit (Elabscience) for the determination of serum Bcl-2 concentrations, with an assay detection limit of 0.10\u00a0ng/mL, and coefficient of variation of intra-assay and inter-assay lower than 6%.20\u2013222.3. Variables recordedWe recorded demographic and clinical data at ICU admission as sex, age, body max index, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, COPD, ischemic heart disease, smoking, arterial hypertension, steroid agents, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), solid tumor, hematological tumor, ARDS [15], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score [16] Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score [17], and chest radiography findings. Also, we recorded laboratory data at ICU admission as lactic acid, creatinine, sodium, protein, glucose, creatine kinase, albumin, bilirubin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, interleukin-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell, lymphocytes, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, d-dimer, platelets, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and fraction inspired of oxygen (FIO2). Besides, we recorded data regarding ICU treatment as tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, steroid agents, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and respiratory support. In addition, survival at 30\u00a0days was the end point of our study.2.4. Statistical MethodsContinuous and categorical variables were reported and compared between patient groups using medians (percentile 25\u201375), frequencies (percentages), Mann\u2013Whitney U test and chi-square test and. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the capability of serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2 for mortality prediction. Kaplan\u2013Meier 30-day survival curves using serum concentrations of sFas higher and lower than 846.5\u00a0ng/mL and serum concentrations of Bcl2 higher and lower than 7.6\u00a0ng/mL (cutoffs selected by Youden J index) were performed. We used logistic regression to explore the association between serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2 and 30-day mortality after controlling by SOFA or APACHE-II. As only 11 patients deceased in our series, we reported fourth regression models including two predictor variables in each regression model. SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and p-values<0.05 were used for the statistical analysis and to establish significant differences. 3.\u2003ResultsSurviving patients (n =\u00a042) compared to non-surviving (n =\u00a011) had lower APACHE-II (p <\u00a00.001) and lower SOFA (p =\u00a00.004) (Table 1). Besides, surviving compared to non-surviving patients had lower serum sFas concentration (p =\u00a00.001), higher Bcl2 concentration (p <\u00a00.001) and higher platelet count (p =\u00a00.02) (Table 2).\n\n\nTable 1.Demographic data, clinical data, and treatment of non-surviving and surviving patients\u00a0Survivors(n =\u00a042)Non-survivors(n =\u00a011)p-ValueGender female, n (%)27 (64.3)7 (63.6)0.99COPD, n (%)5 (11.9)3 (27.3)0.34Smoking, n (%)2 (4.8)2 (18.2)0.19Chronic renal failure, n (%)1 (2.4)00.99Arterial hypertension, n (%)16 (38.1)6 (54.5)0.49Ischemic heart disease, n (%)1 (2.4)1 (9.1)0.38Diabetes mellitus, n (%)12 (28.6)3 (27.3)0.99Solid tumor, n (%)1 (2.4)00.99Hematological tumor, n (%)2 (4.8)00.99Steroid agents, n (%)1 (2.4)2 (18.2)0.11Human immunodeficiency virus, n (%)1 (2.4)00.99Chest radiography findings, n (%)\u00a0\u00a00.95\u2013 Consolidation only5 (11.9)1 (9.1)\u00a0\u2013 Ground glass opacity plus consolidation21 (50.0)6 (54.5)\u00a0\u2013 Ground glass opacity only16 (38.1)4 (36.4)\u00a0ARDS, n (%)36 (85.7)9 (81.8)0.67Age (years), median (p 25\u201375)65 (51\u201370)70 (59\u201375)0.10Body max index (kg/m2), median (p 25\u201375)28.1 (24.8\u201332.4)27.1 (23.0\u201330.2)0.29APACHE-II score, median (p 25\u201375)12 (7\u201315)18 (16\u201320)<0.001SOFA score, median (p 25\u201375)5 (3\u20137)8 (5\u20139)0.004Respiratory support, n (%)\u00a0\u00a00.30\u2013 Conventional oxygen therapy4 (9.5)0\u00a0\u2013 High-flow nasal cannula4 (9.5)0\u00a0\u2013 noninvasive mechanical ventilation3 (7.1)0\u00a0\u2013 Invasive mechanical ventilation31 (73.8)11 (100)\u00a0Tocilizumab, n (%)15 (35.7)6 (54.5)0.31Lopinavir/Ritonavir, n (%)39 (92.9)10 (90.9)0.99Interferon beta-1b, n (%)26 (61.9)7 (63.6)0.99Hydroxychloroquine, n (%)39 (92.9)11 (100)0.99Steroid agents, n (%)31 (73.8)9 (81.8)0.71Open in a separate windowCOPD,\u00a0chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;

The main new findings of our study were the association of high serum sFas concentrations and low Bcl2 concentrations with mortality of COVID-19 patients. Another interesting finding in our study was the similar mortality prediction by serum levels of sFas and Bcl2 than by SOFA and APACHE-II, and those findings could help in the prognosis estimation of those patients to clinicians.Recently, higher Fas expression on CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells has been reported in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls [13,14]; however, the association between serum sFas concentrations and COVID-19 mortality is a new finding of our study. We have no found data in respect to Bcl2 in COVID-19 patients; thus, the association between serum Bcl2 concentrations and COVID-19 mortality is another new finding of our study.Fas, one of the main death receptors of apoptosis extrinsic pathway, activates apoptosis when binding with its ligand. Then, a death signal is generated that will activate caspase-8 and then will activate caspase-3 leading to cellular damage by extrinsic apoptosis [10]. Bcl-2, one member of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family, blocks MTP formation that will avoid the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. Then, the formation of the apoptosis (between cytochrome c, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9) is blocked and therefore also the activation of caspase-9 is blocked. Thus, the activation of executor caspases (caspase-3 and -7) is decreased [10]. We think, that those higher serum sFas concentrations and lower blood Bcl-2 concentrations that we found in non-surviving patients compared to surviving patients contribute to higher apoptosis activation by the extrinsic pathway (due to high serum concentrations of proapoptotic sFas protein) and by the intrinsic pathway (due to low serum concentrations of antiapoptotic Bcl2 protein), which contribute in a higher activation of effector caspases, in a higher cellular damage by apoptosis, and finally in the death of patients.In septic animals, the use of different antiapoptotic agents has reduced apoptosis [23\u201327]. The use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Fas has reduced apoptosis and increased survival [23\u201326], and the use of adrenomedullin has increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased apoptosis [27].We recognize some limitations of our study. First, no serum levels of sFas and Bcl2 were determined in healthy subjects and in patients with other respiratory diseases; however, our objective study was to analyze whether serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2 could help in the prognosis estimation of COVID-19 and not whether serum concentrations of sFas and Bcl2 could help in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Second, no assays to assess cellular damage by apoptosis were performed as Annexin V or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Third, we performed regression analysis with only two variables due to the low number of deceased patients in our series. Fourth, another limitation was the reduced sample size of our study that could contribute in the absence of differences between survivor and non-survivor patients in other variables that have been found to be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients in different meta-analyses [28,29].However, we think that our study could have some strengths. First, the association between serum levels of sFas and Bcl2 and mortality is present in all regression models (controlling for SOFA or APACHE-II). Second, those high serum sFas concentrations and low serum Bcl2 concentrations in non-survivor patients are in line with the poor prognosis found in septic patient patients [18,19]. We think all those findings could motivate the research on apoptosis in COVID-19 patients. 5.\u2003ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting blood levels of sFas and Bcl2 in COVID-19 patients and its association with mortality. However, further study should be done to confirm the results of our study due to its limited sample size.
