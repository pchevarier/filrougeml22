Ventilations are always needed to correct hypoxemia.\n3\n, \n4\n To avoid or reduce pulmonary morbidity, low\u00a0tidal\u00a0volume ventilation is often applied.\n5\n, \n6\n The ventilation strategy will certainly result in hypercapnia, which is called \u201cpermissive hypercapnia\u201d.\n7\n, \n8\n Our previous study found that hypercapnia could induce IL\u20101\u03b2 overproduction in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia.\n9\n However, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear.The NLRP3 inflammasome is widely expressed in microglia, which plays an important role in initiating the central immune and inflammatory response.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n To exert its functions, the NLRP3 inflammasome requires to be activated. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be triggered by an array of stimuli, including ATP, potassium efflux, heme, urate, and reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can upregulate the expression of caspase\u20101 and then leads to interleukin (IL)\u201018 and IL\u20101\u03b2 maturation and pyroptosis activation. Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory cell death.\n18\n Recent studies have reported that gasdermin D (GSDMD) is the executioner of pyroptosis.\n19\n After being cleaved by caspase\u20101, gasdermin D\u2010N domains (GSDMD\u2010N) can form a pore in the plasma membrane. IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 are released through the pores, thereby perpetuating cascade inflammatory response.\n20\n\nMitochondria\u2010derived ROS is the key stimuli to trigger the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.\n21\n When the levels of oxygen fall, hypoxia would damage mitochondria and induce ROS production.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n Mitophagy can eliminate damaged mitochondria, reduce ROS production, and alleviate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n25\n It remains to be ascertained whether hypercapnia would activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through inhibiting mitophagy in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia.In the present study, we hypothesized that hypercapnia may promote microglial pyroptosis via inhibiting mitophagy in hypoxemic adult rats. It was surmised that hypercapnia might exert its effect through inhibiting mitophagy, inducing ROS production, activating NLRP3 inflammasome, which ultimately would lead to IL\u201018 and IL\u20101\u03b2 maturation and pyroptosis activation. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Animals and experimental groupsThe Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee at Jinan University approved all animal procedure protocols (No. 20\u00a0171\u00a0011\u00a0001), which conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health. All efforts were made to minimize the numbers of animals used and ensure minimal suffering. Male adult Sprague\u2010Dawley (SD) rats (n\u00a0=\u00a0128) aged about 3\u00a0months and weighing approximately 220 to 250\u00a0g were randomly divided into five groups: sham\u2010operated group (abbreviated Sham group), Hypercapnia group, Hypoxemia group, Hypercapnia\u00a0+\u00a0Hypoxemia group (abbreviated HH group), Hypercapnia\u00a0+\u00a0Hypoxemia +N\u2010Acetyl\u2010L\u2010cysteine group (abbreviated HH\u00a0+\u00a0NAC group).2.2. The rat model of hypercapnia/hypoxemiaAll rats were fasted with access to water overnight before the experiments. The rat model of hypercapnia/hypoxemia was established as described in our previous study.\n9\n Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30\u00a0mg/kg) followed by mechanical ventilation. The tidal volume (9 mL/kg body weight), respiratory rate (45 breaths/min), and inspiratory\u2010to\u2010expiratory ratio (1:1) were fixed. Sham group was exposed to the air. Hypercapnia group was exposed to 5% CO2 to maintain the potential of hydrogen (pH) of arterial blood at 7.20\u20137.25. Hypoxemia group was exposed to 16% O2 to maintain partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen (PaO2) at 55\u201360\u00a0mmHg. HH group was exposed to 16% O2 mixing with 5% CO2 to maintain PaO2 at 55\u201360\u00a0mmHg and pH at 7.20\u20137.25. Rats in the HH\u00a0+\u00a0NAC group were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 150\u00a0mg/kg NAC (MedChemExpress, Monmouth, NJ, USA; cat. no. HY\u2010B0215) for 30\u00a0minutes before being exposed to 5% CO2 and 16% O2. The rats, which were used for Western blotting analysis, immunofluorescence staining and ROS evaluation, were not performed invasive manipulation except ventilation. The rats were executed immediately after hypercapnia/hypoxemia treatment.2.3. Measurement of cerebral oxygen extraction ratioThe right femoral artery and the right jugular vein were cannulated upstream. The blood samples were collected at 3\u00a0hours after ventilation. The hemoglobin concentration (Hb), saturation of arterial blood oxygen (SaO2), PaO2, saturation of jugular venous blood oxygen (SjVO2), and pressure of jugular venous blood oxygen (PjVO2) were measured using a blood gas/electrolyte analyzer (Model 5700; San Diego, CA, USA). The content of arterial blood oxygen (CaO2), content of jugular venous blood oxygen (CjVO2), and cerebral oxygen extraction ratio (CERO2) were calculated using the following formulas:\nCaO2=Hb\u00d71.36\u00d7SaO2+0.0031\u00d7PaO2\nCjVO2=Hb\u00d71.36\u00d7SjVO2+0.0031\u00d7PjVO2\nCERO2= (CaO2\u2010CjVO2)/CaO2\n2.4. Measurement of the partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2)The levels of PbtO2 were measured at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3\u00a0hours after ventilation. To evaluate the PbtO2, a midline incision over vertex was performed after anesthesia. After this, a hole was drilled caudal to the coronal suture, 4\u00a0mm from the midline. The dura was punctured, and a microsensor for PbtO2 was inserted into brain tissue.\n26\n A monitor (Integra CAMO2, Integra LifeSciences Limited, County Offaly, Ireland) was used to measure the PbtO2.2.5. ROS evaluation of brain tissueThe ROS of brain tissue was evaluated using a ROS ELISA kit (Dogesce, Beijing, China; cat. no. DG21175D) at 3\u00a0hours after ventilation following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Briefly, samples and standards (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well) were added to the plate wells coated by antibodies labeled with HRP, which were used to capture ROS. The plate was incubated for 1\u00a0hour at 37\u00b0C. After washing completely, substrate A (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well) and substrate B (50\u00a0\u03bcL/well) were added to incubate the plate in a dark place for 15\u00a0minutes at 37\u00b0C. Then, the stop buffer was added, and the optical density (OD) was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450\u00a0nm. The concentrations of ROS in the samples were then determined by comparing the optical density of the samples to the standard curve.2.6. BV\u20102 microglial cell cultures and treatmentBV\u20102 microglial cells were purchased form CHI Scientific (cat. no. 7\u20101502) and were cultured and treated as described in our previous study.\n9\n Briefly, the cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. 8\u00a0117\u00a0121) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation; Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. 42F0374K) in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2/95% air. The microglial cells were randomly divided into five groups: Control group, high concentration of carbon dioxide group (abbreviated HC group), Hypoxia group, Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0HC group, and Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0HC +NAC group. Control group was exposed to 5% CO2\u00a0+\u00a020% O2. HC group was exposed to 15% CO2\u00a0+\u00a020% O2 to maintain the pH of the supernatant at 7.20\u20107.25. Hypoxia group was exposed to 5% CO2\u00a0+\u00a00.2% O2 to maintain partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of the supernatant at 55\u201060\u00a0mmHg. Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0HC group was exposed to 15% CO2\u00a0+\u00a00.2% O2 to maintain PO2 at 55\u201060\u00a0mmHg and pH at 7.20\u20107.25. The cells in the Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0HC\u00a0+\u00a0NAC group were treated with 2\u00a0mmol/L NAC (MedChemExpress, Monmouth, NJ, USA; cat. no. HY\u2010B0215) for 30\u00a0minutes before being exposed to 15% CO2\u00a0+\u00a00.2% O2.2.7. Oxygen consumption rate evaluation of BV\u20102 microglial cellsThe Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was evaluated using a cellulate OCR Assay Kit (cat. no. BB\u201048211; BestBio, Shanghai, China) after treatment with 0.2% O2 and 15% CO2 for 0\u00a0hour, 6\u00a0hours, 12\u00a0hours, and 24\u00a0hours. The intervention time and testing time were chosen, when the levels of OCR peaked (In this study, 12\u00a0hours was chosen as the intervention time, and 18\u00a0minutes was chosen as the testing time) (Figure\u00a01C). The OCR was measured following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Briefly, BV\u20102 microglial cells were seeded in 96\u2010well plates (5000 cells/well) and cultured in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. When the cells spread to 80% of the bottom of the well, they were treated with different concentrations of CO2 and O2. After the treatment, the medium was changed to DMEM high glucose without FBS, and then, fluorescent probes (10\u00a0\u03bcL/well) were added sequentially. Finally, an oxygen mounting medium was added (2 drops/well). The OCR levels were examined every three minutes until half an hour with a fluorescent microplate reader (Model 9260; IL\u2010COR\u00ae inc, Lincoln, NE, USA). The excited and emitted wavelengths were 485/20\u00a0nm and 590/35\u00a0nm, respectively.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Hypercapnia increased CERO2 and OCR in vivo and in vitro (n\u00a0=\u00a04). (A) There is an interaction effect between hypoxia treatment and hypercapnia treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). (B) Simple effects analyses show an increased CERO2 in Hypoxemia group (*P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), but not in Hypercapnia group (ns P\u00a0>\u00a0.05) compared with Sham group. HH group has the highest CERO2 levels as compared with Hypoxemia group (**P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and Hypercapnia group (**P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). (C) The OCR levels are the highest in 12\u00a0h group as compared with other groups (12\u00a0h vs 0\u00a0h: P\u00a0<\u00a0.01; 12\u00a0h vs 6\u00a0h: P\u00a0>\u00a0.05; 12\u00a0h vs 24\u00a0h: P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). The OCR levels are increased time\u2010dependently and achieved a stationary phase at 18\u00a0min. So the microglia cells were treated for 12\u00a0hours, and the OCR was examined at 18\u00a0min after the treatment, as shown in graph (D) and (E). (D) There is an interaction effect between 0.2% O2 treatment and 15% CO2 treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). (E) Simple effects analyses show increased levels of OCR in Hypoxia group (**P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), but not in HC group (ns P\u00a0>\u00a0.05) compared with Control group. Hypoxia\u00a0+\u00a0HC group has the highest levels of OCR as compared with Hypoxia group (**P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and HC group (**P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). ns, nonsignificant; Sham group, sham\u2010operated group; HH group, hypercapnia\u00a0+\u00a0hypoxemia group; HC group, high concentration of carbon dioxide group; CERO2, cerebral oxygen extraction rate; OCR, oxygen consumption rate. The concentrations of O2 and CO2 in the air are 21% and 0.03%2.8. ROS measurement in microgliaThe ROS production in BV\u20102 microglial cells was evaluated using a ROS assay kit (cat. no. BB\u20104705\u20102; BestBio, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Briefly, DCFH\u2010DA was diluted with DMEM high glucose without FBS (1:1500). The coverslips with adherent BV\u20102 microglial cells were cultured with DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. After the treatment, the medium was changed to diluted DCFH\u2010DA (2\u00a0mL/well). Then, the plates were incubated for 20\u00a0minutes at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The coverslips were washed with DMEM high glucose without FBS. Finally, the coverslips were mounted by a fluorescent mounting medium and detected using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus DP73 Microscope, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.9. Western blotting analysisTotal proteins from the hippocampus tissue and BV\u20102 microglial cells (n\u00a0=\u00a04 for each group) were extracted using a Total Protein Extraction Kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China; cat. no. BB\u20103101\u2010100T). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. 23\u00a0227). Equal amounts of protein (40\u00a0\u03bcg) from each sample were separated in a 15% SDS\u2010PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1\u00a0hours at room temperature. After this, the following primary antibodies were added to incubate the membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C: LC3B antibody (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab48394), SQSTM1/p62 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab56416), Gasdermin D (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology; cat. no. 93\u00a0709), caspase\u20101 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab1872), IL\u201018 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat. No. ab207323), and IL\u20101\u03b2 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat. No. ab9722). The membranes were washed on the following day, and the HRP\u2010labeled goat antirabbit antibody (1:3000; Cell Signaling Technology; cat. no. 7074S) was added to incubate the membranes for 2\u00a0hours at 4\u00b0C. The immunoblots were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Bioworld Technology, St. Louis Park, MN, USA; cat. no. AC36131) and detected by an imaging densitometer (ImageQuant LAS 500, GE Healthcare Bio\u2010Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The relative density was quantified using FluorChem 8900 software (version 4.0.1, Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro CA, USA). \u03b2\u2010actin was used as the control.2.10. Double immunofluorence labelingIn vivo, the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and transcardially perfused with normal saline and 4% paraformaldehyde at 3\u00a0hours after ventilation. The brains were harvested and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. This tissue was then dehydrated in graded sucrose and cut into sections of 10\u00a0\u03bcm thickness. The sections were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum for 0.5\u00a0hours at room temperature. In vitro, the coverslips with adherent BV\u20102 microglial cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 24\u00a0hours after treatment. The coverslips were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum for 0.5\u00a0hours at room temperature sequentially.After that, the following primary antibodies were added to incubate the sections/coverslips overnight at 4\u00b0C: caspase\u20101 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab1872), IL\u20101\u03b2 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; cat. no. ab9722), IL\u201018 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; Cat.

The sections/coverslips were washed on the following day, and the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor\u00ae 549 Goat antirabbit IgG (H\u00a0+\u00a0L) (1:100; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. ATRJN1301) and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Goat antimouse IgG (1:100; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA; cat. no. ATRMR2301) were added to incubate the sections/coverslips for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, the sections/coverslips were mounted by the fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; cat. no. SLBW4468) and detected using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus DP73 Microscope, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.11. Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS19.0 statistical (IBM, New York, USA). All values are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of mean (SEM). Shapiro\u2010Wilk test was used to assess the data distribution. All data were normally distributed in the present study. Repeated measures one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the repeated measurement data. Factorial ANOVA was for the interaction effects. When an interaction was examined, simple effects analyses were evaluated. Differences were considered statistically significant if the P\u2010value\u00a0<\u00a0.05. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Hypercapnia increased cerebral oxygen extraction rate in hypoxemic ratsSignificant interaction effects were observed between hypercapnia treatment and hypoxia treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) (Figure\u00a01A).

This was evident by the increased CERO2, decreased PbtO2, and increased expression levels of LC3\u2010II, caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia cells. The microglial pyroptosis in the hippocampus induced by hypoxemia/hypercapnia may perpetuate cascade inflammatory response and contribute to the neurological impairments of ARDS patients.The present rat and cell models of hypercapnia/hypoxemia were established as described in our previous study.\n9\n In Sham group, the rats were exposed to air when the ventilator settings were fixed. The PaCO2 levels of the rats were maintained between 35 and 45\u00a0mmHg, and the PaO2 levels were maintained between 90 and 100\u00a0mmHg. The normal range of human PaCO2 and PaO2 is 35\u201045 and 80\u2010100\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are comparable between rats and humans. In the hypercapnia/hypoxemia models, PO2 levels of the arterial blood and culture supernatant were maintained at 55\u201060\u00a0mmHg and pH levels of the arterial blood and culture supernatant at 7.20\u20107.25. These are consistent with the change of hypoxemia and permissive hypercapnia in ARDS.\n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n\nWe reported in our previous study that hypercapnia could induce IL\u20101\u03b2 overproduction in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia. However, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. It has been reported that the expression of caspase\u20101 would be upregulated after NLRP3 inflammasome being activated. Caspase\u20101 could lead to IL\u201018 and IL\u20101\u03b2 maturation and pyroptosis activation. GSDMD\u2010N is the executioner of pyroptosis. GSDMD\u2010N helped to form a pore in the plasma membrane, from that IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 are released.\n19\n, \n20\n Under hypoxic conditions, ROS is known to be critical for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n Furthermore, hippocampus is known to be critical for spatial and contextual memory.\n34\n And the receptor of inflammatory cytokines (ie, IL\u20101\u03b2)\n35\n are comparatively higher in the hippocampus and are tightly linked to the deficits in hippocampus\u2010dependent memory.\n36\n Thus, the expression levels of caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 in the hippocampus microglia in this study were determined, and the production of ROS was also evaluated. Significant interaction effects were observed on ROS production, caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 expression between hypercapnia treatment and hypoxia treatment. More importantly, we have shown that hypercapnia upregulated the expression of caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 in hypoxic microglia via inducing ROS overproduction. Remarkably, caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 expression in hypoxic microglia was downregulated when ROS was scavenged by NAC. These results indicate that hypercapnia promotes microglial pyroptosis via inducing ROS overproduction and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.When the levels of oxygen fall, hypoxia would damage mitochondria and induce ROS production.\n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n Mitophagy can eliminate damaged mitochondria, reduce ROS production, and then alleviate NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n25\n To ascertain whether hypercapnia would activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through inhibiting mitophagy in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia, expression of LC3\u2010II and p62 in the microglia was determined. p62 is a multidomain protein that interacts with phagophores through the LC3\u2010interacting domain and with the ubiquitinated protein aggregates through the ubiquitin\u2010associated domain,\n37\n which promotes degradation of unwanted molecules,\n38\n while p62 is an autophagy substrate and is degraded by autophagy.\n39\n We found that the expression levels of LC3\u2010II were reduced, while p62 expression was increased by hypercapnia in the hypoxic hippocampus and BV\u20102 microglia. These results indicate that hypercapnia might enhance the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hypoxia\u2010activated microglial cells via inhibiting mitophagy and impairing autophagy flux.To determine the effect of hypercapnia on oxidative metabolism of the rat brain, CERO2 and partial pressure of brain tissue oxygen (PbtO2) were examined. Hypoxemia, as a typical symptom of ARDS, decreases the oxidative metabolism rate of the brain to avoid or reduce cerebral damage via preventing the PbtO2 from dropping to a very low level.\n40\n In this study, we showed hypercapnia alone was not enough to increase or decrease the levels of PbtO2 and CERO2. In the first 1.5\u00a0hours, the levels of PbtO2 were elevated by hypercapnia in the hypoxemic rats. This may be the reason why hypercapnia was neuroprotective in rats with transient global cerebral ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury\n41\n and lateral fluid percussion injury.\n42\n However, hypercapnia significantly decreased the levels of PbtO2 in the hypoxemic rats after 2\u00a0hours\u2019 ventilation. It was further evidenced by the increased levels of CERO2 at 3\u00a0hours after ventilation. These results suggest that hypercapnia is neuroprotective within a very short period (1.5\u00a0hours), but hypercapnia could aggravate neuronal functions injury over a protracted period via increasing CERO2 and decreasing PbtO2. This is consistent with the expression of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 in microglia. It was observed that hypercapnia alone may not be sufficient to increase the expression of IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018, but hypercapnia may exert its effects in the presence of hypoxia. It was suggested that hypercapnia can induce ROS overproduction via intensifying hypoxia, may activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and promote IL\u20101\u03b2 release.In vitro, to determine the effect of a high concentration of CO2 on oxidative metabolism in hypoxic BV\u20102 microglial cells, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was evaluated. There was an interaction effect on the levels of OCR between 0.2% O2 treatment and 15% CO2 treatment. The high concentration of CO2 treatment could increase the levels of OCR in hypoxic BV\u20102 microglial cells, which were consistent with that hypercapnia increased levels of CERO2 in hypoxic rats. The results suggest that hypercapnia could intensify microglial hypoxia both in vivo and in vitro.There are four limitations to this study. Firstly, it has been reported that NLRP3 inflammasome is expressed in astrocytes.\n43\n However, the lack of the NLRP3 inflammasome in astrocytes being investigated in the present study is a limitation. Secondly, the present study did not prove the connection between cerebral oxygen metabolism (CERO2 and PbtO2) and mitophagy, which is an area for future research. Thirdly, the models of hypercapnia/hypoxemia were established with certain concentrations of O2 and CO2. The lack of concentration gradient of O2 and CO2 being investigated in the present study is another limitation. Fourthly, the study did not prove the upstream mechanism by which hypercapnia inhibits mitophagy. It is well documented that the PINK1\u2010Parkin axis functions as the core machinery for mitophagy.\n44\n It was surmised that hypercapnia may exert its effect through mediating the PINK1\u2010Parkin signaling axis.In summary, the present results have demonstrated the underlying mechanism whereby hypercapnia can promote pyroptosis in hypoxic microglia. In this connection, hypercapnia was found to intensify the cerebral hypoxia via increasing CERO2 and decreasing PbtO2. ROS was overproduced by hypercapnia in hypoxic microglial cells coupled with mitophagy inhibition and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Remarkedly, caspase\u20101, GSDMD\u2010N, IL\u201018, and IL\u20101\u03b2 expression was downregulated when ROS was scavenged. Thus, hypercapnia\u2010induced mitophagy inhibition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and pyroptosis in microglia may be a potential target to mitigate neuroinflammation. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONSHypercapnia\u2010induced mitophagy inhibition may promote pyroptosis and enhance IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 release in hypoxia\u2010activated microglia.
