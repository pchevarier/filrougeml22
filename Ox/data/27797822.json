J. Thomson (Thomson, 1897). Thomson not only discovered the electron but, together with F. W. Aston, also measured the masses of stable isotopes of elements (Thomson, 1911; Aston, 1920). To this end, Thomson employed electron impact ionization to charge the atoms and molecules. This allowed their mass\u2010to\u2010charge (m/z) ratio to be measured by monitoring their trajectories in an electric or magnetic field\u2014mass spectrometry was born and its inventor's ingenuity is\u00a0nowadays acknowledged by terming the unit for m/z the \u201cThomson\u201d (Th) (Cooks & Rockwood, 1991).MS remained in the realm of isotope physics for about half a century before it entered the domain of chemistry. MS with its potential to identify substances based on accurate mass measurements sparked initially the interest of the oil industry in its attempt to find ways to characterize the low molecular weight compounds present in crude oil. This challenge was addressed by pioneers like F. H. Field, J. L. Franklin, and F. W. McLafferty. They introduced and applied chemical ionization (Munson et\u00a0al, 1964; Munson & Field, 1966; Baldwin & McLafferty, 1973) as a novel technique to bring organic molecules into the gas phase, which had previously only been feasible by electron impact ionization (Smith, 1937). Owing to both ionization techniques, the field of organic MS started to bloom, for it was now possible to determine the masses of semi\u2010volatile molecules up to about 500 Dalton (Da). Soon after, mass determination of not only the intact organic molecule but also its specific fragment ions was enabled by conceiving improved mass spectrometric instrumentation (Beynon et\u00a0al, 1973; Paul, 1990) and new gas\u2010phase fragmentation techniques, such as collision\u2010induced dissociation (Haddon & McLafferty, 1968; Jennings, 1968; Kim et\u00a0al, 1974). The related fragmentation mechanisms were elucidated by studying the unimolecular and bimolecular chemistry of organic molecular ions. These meticulous investigations aided the interpretation of the fragment ion mass spectra, eventually allowing to deduce details about a compound's molecular structure (Levsen & Schwarz, 1976). Over the years, about 250,000 unique organic molecules were characterized and catalogued in a library of reference mass spectra (Stein, 2016). This repository may be queried when seemingly unknown compounds are to be characterized by organic MS, which nowadays has become a core analytical technology in chemical, forensic, environmental, and atmospheric sciences.More recently, MS entered the field of cellular, molecular, and structural biology. The dawn of biomolecular MS can be traced to the introduction of matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) in the 1980s, for which Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn, respectively, received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Tanaka et\u00a0al, 1988; Fenn et\u00a0al, 1989). These ionization technologies, which will be further explained later on, enabled the efficient transfer of large intact biomolecules (e.g. peptides and proteins) into the gas phase as charged ions\u2014an essential prerequisite for MS analysis. Previously developed ionization methods, by contrast, were mostly limited to small, volatile compounds.Only a few years after the MS analysis of peptides and proteins became feasible, first attempts were made to couple it with advanced separation techniques, such as miniaturized nanoflow liquid chromatography and electrophoresis (Henzel et\u00a0al, 1993; Strupat et\u00a0al, 1994; McCormack et\u00a0al, 1997; Washburn et\u00a0al, 2001). This development enhanced the throughput and dynamic range in the analysis of very complex peptide samples like those obtained from a proteolytic digest of a single protein, a protein mixture, or even all proteins within a whole\u2010cell lysate. Nowadays, hundreds of thousands of peptides can be analyzed by combining orthogonal separation methods (e.g., reversed\u2010phase, ion exchange and/or hydrophilic interaction chromatography) with modern mass spectrometers that perform high\u2010speed tandem\u2010MS experiments (see below for more details; Hebert et\u00a0al, 2014). Interpreting these large amounts of data, especially deriving the peptide sequence from the acquired mass spectra and mapping it back onto the original proteins, posed a first major challenge but is meanwhile facilitated by sophisticated bioinformatics and statistics solutions (Cappadona et\u00a0al, 2012; Bruce et\u00a0al, 2013). Collectively, advanced peptide separation, rapid tandem\u2010MS measurements, and elaborate bioinformatics analysis form the current workflow for high\u2010throughput bottom\u2010up proteomics (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2013). This technique has become the standard for the system\u2010wide analysis of all proteins present in a particular cell, body fluid, tissue, or organism (as reviewed by Cox & Mann, 2011; Bensimon et\u00a0al, 2012; Altelaar et\u00a0al, 2013; Richards et\u00a0al, 2015). Recently, the progress of bottom\u2010up proteomics has cumulated in first drafts of the human proteome (Kim et\u00a0al, 2014; Wilhelm et\u00a0al, 2014).Bottom\u2010up proteomics as a key driver for technological development has benefitted the field of biomolecular MS in general. First and foremost, mass analyzers have become immensely more advanced, gaining performance in speed, sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and, equally important, user\u2010friendliness for non\u2010specialists\u00a0(Ens & Standing, 2005; Zubarev & Makarov, 2013). Next, advances in sample preparation and fractionation enabled more comprehensive and reproducible MS experiments (Tabb, 2013). Novel strategies for affinity purification (Li et\u00a0al, 2015), protein digestion (Tsiatsiani & Heck, 2015), and peptide fragmentation (Madsen et\u00a0al, 2010; Frese et\u00a0al, 2012) may serve as illustrative examples here. Finally, more efficient and reliable analysis software (Cox & Mann, 2008; Bruce et\u00a0al, 2013; Lee et\u00a0al, 2015), public data repositories (Perez\u2010Riverol et\u00a0al, 2015), and tools to define and study protein interaction and signaling networks (Gavin et\u00a0al, 2002; Hein et\u00a0al, 2015; Huttlin et\u00a0al, 2015) allow translating MS data into sound and meaningful biological information. These advancements significantly promoted the impact of MS on molecular and structural biology, a development that can be retraced using hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange (HDX)\u2010MS of biomolecules as an example. HDX\u2010MS has been around for about 25\u00a0years (Katta & Chait, 1991; Englander, 2006), arguably predating the advent of proteomics. However, due to limitations in hardware and analysis software, early HDX\u2010MS studies were mostly limited to peptides, small proteins, or protein domains. Owing to the technological progress, HDX\u2010MS can now be applied to study whole protein assemblies up to intact viruses (Wang et\u00a0al, 2001; Lanman et\u00a0al, 2004; Konermann et\u00a0al, 2011; Bereszczak et\u00a0al, 2013; Pirrone et\u00a0al, 2015), making it a valuable tool for protein structure analysis, as we will discuss later on.Today, MS methods are utilized in an increasing number of molecular and structural biology studies that aim for a better understanding of large biomolecular assemblies. A selection of these studies is presented in Fig\u00a01, illustrating that biomolecular complexes from all cellular compartments and different kingdoms of life have been successfully probed by MS. In the course of this review, we will refer to several of the shown examples, as they mark the current frontiers of MS\u2010based structural and molecular biology. Fundamentally, these approaches can be divided into peptide\u2010centric and protein\u2010centric strategies (Fig\u00a02). Peptide\u2010centric strategies comprise surface labeling approaches, such as HDX\u2010MS and covalent labeling\u2010MS, as well as cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and limited proteolysis\u2010MS. All of these methods probe biomolecular structures in solution, utilizing the previously described bottom\u2010up proteomics workflow to detect, at the peptide level, the results of the in\u2010solution experiment (Fig\u00a02, bottom). Protein\u2010centric strategies, on the other hand, enable the mass spectrometric characterization of intact proteins and biomolecular assemblies, which can be additionally manipulated in the gas phase (Fig\u00a02, top). Analytical targets of protein\u2010centric MS range from small intact histones (10\u201320\u00a0kDa) over antibodies (150\u00a0kDa) to complex cellular machineries (500\u201320,000\u00a0kDa) such as proteasomes, ribosomes, or even full virus assemblies (Marcoux & Robinson, 2013; Snijder & Heck, 2014).Open in a separate windowFigure 1\nMS\u2010based molecular and structural biology reaches out over all cellular compartments and kingdoms of lifeShown are exemplary results of studies that employed biomolecular MS techniques.

Typically, the sample is injected into the mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization using a conductive borosilicate capillary, as symbolized in the top panel. After injection, the analyte structure and composition can be further evaluated by several gas\u2010phase manipulation strategies, some of which are schematically depicted. Ion mobility separation prior to mass measurement renders information about the analyte's conformation and shape. Dissociation of a non\u2010denatured biomolecular assembly by collisional activation (symbolized as an explosion cartoon) allows inferring its stoichiometry and topological aspects. Mass selection can be performed for both denatured and non\u2010denatured analytes, enabling the focused analysis of a specific species such as a protein isoform that carries a certain mutation or a defined number of PTMs. After mass selection, proteoform sequencing can be performed by fragmenting the protein isoforms in the gas phase (symbolized as an explosion cartoon), which allows to determine their amino acid sequence and thus locate mutated and/or modified residues. In peptide\u2010centric approaches (bottom), proteins or protein complexes are manipulated in solution by traditional biochemical methods, such as chemical cross\u2010linking, limited proteolysis, or surface labeling. Subsequently, the proteins are digested into peptides and liquid chromatography/tandem\u2010MS is used as a highly accurate method to detect and identify the resulting peptides. A combination of the depicted peptide\u2010 and protein\u2010centric approaches, as shown in the center, gives insights into a multitude of biochemical and structural properties of the studied protein assemblies.The applications of biomolecular MS (summarized in Fig\u00a02) illustrate that a mass spectrometer may nowadays be considered a full\u2010fledged \u201cbiochemical laboratory\u201d, in analogy to a claim made 35\u00a0years ago that MS has become a \u201ccomplete chemical laboratory\u201d (Porter et\u00a0al, 1981). In this review, we aim to familiarize non\u2010mass spectrometrists with the inner workings and analytical opportunities of this MS\u2010based \u201cbiochemical laboratory\u201d. To this end, we will first introduce a few basic principles of biomolecular MS. Next, we will discuss the fundamental utilization of peptide\u2010centric MS approaches as well as protein\u2010centric MS under either denaturing or native\u2010like conditions, highlighting selected applications to examine protein structures, functions, and interactions. Finally, we will exemplify how peptide\u2010 and protein\u2010centric MS strategies have been employed to answer central biological questions, often in hyphenation with more conventional molecular and structural biology methods, notably X\u2010ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and (cryo\u2010)electron microscopy (EM). In particular, recent contributions of MS\u2010based biochemical and structural analysis of the eukaryotic transcription machinery and prokaryotic CRISPR\u2013Cas complexes will be highlighted. How to weigh a protein\u2014basic principles of biomolecular\u00a0MSMS can determine compound masses with an accuracy and precision that is unprecedented by any other analytical technique. Over the last 30\u00a0years, numerous strategies and applications of biomolecular MS have emerged and, concomitantly, many different types of mass spectrometers have been designed. Therefore, a generic instrumental platform for biomolecular MS does not exist. Most modern mass spectrometers, however, comprise a number of basic components (schematically depicted in Fig\u00a03A) that are essential for the majority of biomolecular MS workflows. Initially, the analytes are separated from their carrier medium, usually an aqueous or organic phase, by transforming them into gaseous ions in the ion source. After ionization, the analytes, now carrying a charge, are transmitted into the high vacuum regions of the mass spectrometer, typically including a low\u2010resolution mass analyzer and a collision cell (Fig\u00a03A). On their way to the detector, the analytes pass through several electric and/or magnetic fields, which allow them to be mass\u2010selected, activated, and separated from the remaining neutrals. At the final stage, the analyte mass\u2010to\u2010charge ratios are accurately and precisely measured by monitoring their motion through a high\u2010resolution mass analyzer. In short, the most essential steps of a MS experiment are analyte ionization, mass determination, and selective manipulation. In this section, we provide a concise overview of these steps, focusing on principles and techniques that are commonly used in molecular and structural biology\u2010related MS studies.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Basic principles of biomolecular MS\n(A) Essential components of a mass spectrometer.

The low\u2010resolution mass analyzer enables mass selection of specific analyte ion species and, in case of ion traps, may also be utilized for ion activation/fragmentation. Otherwise, gas\u2010phase fragmentation, for example, using CID, HCD, or ETD, takes place in the collision cell. Finally, a high\u2010resolution FTICR, TOF, or Orbitrap mass analyzer facilitates precise and accurate mass measurements. (B) Schematic\u00a0representation of ESI and MALDI, the most commonly used ionization techniques in biomolecular MS. ESI produces multiply charged analyte ions (shown in yellow, orange, red, and purple) directly from a sample solution. In MALDI, a laser is used to ablate a mixture of matrix (shown in blue) and analyte molecules from a metal plate into the mass spectrometer, yielding predominantly singly charged ions. (C) Nomenclature of peptide fragment ions according to Roepstorff and Fohlman (1984) and Biemann (1990).Ionization principlesThe ionization process must preserve the integrity of the analyte, which was long thought to be impossible for larger biomolecules because of their relatively labile peptide or sugar\u2010phosphate backbone. The ionization methods MALDI and ESI both overcame this obstacle but follow fundamentally different mechanisms (Fig\u00a03B). In MALDI, biomolecules are immersed in a crystalline matrix of dye\u2010like molecules on a metal plate, wherefrom a laser induces the ionization and desorption of the analyte. In ESI, the analyte is dissolved in a volatile aqueous phase and inserted into a small conducting capillary. The analyte ionizes through the ultimate desolvation of miniscule charged droplets, which are created by applying an electrical current. Importantly, biomolecules become multiply charged during the ESI process, whereas mainly singly charged ions are generated during the MALDI process. MALDI has made substantial contributions to the emergence of biomolecular MS and still has its unique application areas, for example, MALDI spatial imaging of biomolecules in tissue and cells (Amstalden van Hove et\u00a0al, 2010; Schwamborn & Caprioli, 2010). However, ESI has become the method of choice for most biomolecular MS applications. This preference likely stems from the use of an aqueous phase for ESI sample preparation, which can be more easily coupled to chromatographic separation techniques. Moreover, advanced ESI technologies require minimal sample consumption (at nl/min rates), surpassing MALDI in terms of sensitivity and efficiency. ESI\u2010based MS approaches are thus the focal point of this review; however, most of the herein discussed principles are also applicable to MALDI\u2010MS.Mass analyzersOne major criterion to distinguish mass analyzers is their mass resolving power. There are various types of quadrupole and ion\u2010trap low\u2010resolution mass analyzers that are mostly used for either targeted MS strategies (which will not be discussed herein, see Picotti & Aebersold, 2012), or for specific ion manipulation in tandem\u2010MS experiments (ion activation and/or mass selection, see next subsection). However, accurate mass analysis of larger proteins and peptides is predominantly achieved using three different types of high\u2010resolution mass analyzers: time\u2010of\u2010flight (TOF) tubes, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) traps, and Orbitraps (Marshall & Hendrickson, 2008). Although the term \u201chigh\u2010resolution\u201d mass analyzer is defined somewhat arbitrarily, the TOF, Orbitrap, and FTICR analyzers share one crucial feature\u2014peptides of a typical protein digest, which usually comprise 5\u201350 amino acids and carry 2\u20137 charges, can be isotopically resolved, that is, mass separated into the different peptide isotopes. The existence of peptide isotopes is attributable to the natural occurrence of stable elemental isotopes, primarily 13C and 15N. Two adjacent peptide isotopes differ by 1\u00a0Da or, translated to the m/z scale, by 1 Th for a singly charged peptide, by 0.5 Th for a doubly charged peptide, etc. The regular isotope spacing, thus, readily allows determination of the peptide charge state, required for the calculation of its molecular weight.The three high\u2010resolution mass analyzers employ quite different principles of mass measurement. In TOF MS (Ens & Standing, 2005; Marshall & Hendrickson, 2008), ions travel a fixed distance within the TOF tube. The \u201cflight time\u201d of the ions can be used as a direct measure to determine their m/z. In FTICR MS (Marshall & Hendrickson, 2008), ions are trapped in a magnetic field and excited by an electric field oscillating at radio frequency. After removal of the excitation field, the ions rotate at an m/z\u2010dependent frequency. The rotational motion is detected by an electrode pair (forming the boundaries of the ICR cell) as an image current. The time\u2010dependent image current can be transformed from the time domain to the m/z domain using Fourier transformation. Finally, Orbitrap MS applies principles that are related to FTICR, but Orbitraps do not require magnetic fields, which greatly simplifies instrument handling and maintenance (Zubarev & Makarov, 2013). Here, ions are trapped in an electric field generated between an outer barrel\u2010like electrode and an inner spindle\u2010like electrode. The ions oscillate along the inner electrode, again generating an image current. The oscillations are recorded and their m/z\u2010dependent frequency is used to retrieve the m/z through Fourier transformation.Gas\u2010phase fragmentation techniquesOften, the m/z is not only determined for the intact analyte ion (MS1 level) but also for its fragment ions (MS2 level), which are generated in so\u2010called tandem\u2010MS experiments. Here, an intact analyte ion species of a specific mass is selected and isolated in the low\u2010resolution mass analyzer and subsequently activated and fragmented. Gas\u2010phase fragmentation (or activation) provides deeper insights into the analyte structure, for example, the amino acid sequence of a peptide. The analyte activation takes place either within the mass analyzer (typical for ion traps and FTICR cells) or in a collision cell situated between the low\u2010resolution mass analyzer and the high\u2010resolution mass analyzer (Fig\u00a03A). Activation of peptides and denatured proteins typically leads to specific peptide backbone cleavage. Depending on which chemical bond within the peptide backbone is cleaved, this process generates a\u2010/x\u2010, b\u2010/y\u2010 or c\u2010/z\u2010fragment ion series (Fig\u00a03C). By definition, a\u2013c describe N\u2010terminal fragment ions and x\u2013z describe C\u2010terminal fragment ions (Roepstorff & Fohlman, 1984; Biemann, 1990; Steen & Mann, 2004). Series of these fragment ions detected at the MS2 level readily reveal the amino acid sequence of the analyzed peptide ion. If not peptides or denatured proteins, but native protein assemblies are subjected to gas\u2010phase activation, efficient backbone fragmentation is generally not observed. Instead, activation may lead to (partial) unfolding and/or dissociation of non\u2010covalently associated interaction partners. The release of these interaction partners and their mass measurement may provide insights into the quaternary structure of biomolecular complexes. Non\u2010proteinogenic biomolecules, such as carbohydrates and nucleic acids, undergo their own characteristic fragmentation reactions, for which specific rules and nomenclatures have been established as well (Domon & Costello, 1988; Flora & Muddiman, 1998).A diverse array of activation/fragmentation techniques is nowadays available. We confine this subsection to collision\u2010induced dissociation (CID), higher\u2010energy collisional dissociation (HCD, sometimes referred to as beam\u2010type CID), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), which represent some of the most popular ion activation strategies in biomolecular MS. For more information on alternative approaches, please refer to Bogdanov and Smith (2005); Brodbelt (2014); Zhou and Wysocki (2014); Zubarev (2004). Both CID and HCD depend on successive collisions between the analyte ions and inert gas molecules, for example, nitrogen, argon, or xenon, as they are accelerated in the collision cell. For peptide ions, CID\u2010 as well as HCD\u2010based activation mainly gives rise to b\u2010 and y\u2010type fragment ions in the MS2 spectra. CID, in particular, forces breakage of the analyte's most labile chemical bond. Applying CID on a peptide bearing a labile post\u2010translational modification (PTM) such as a phosphorylation or glycosylation therefore predominantly causes loss of the PTM rather than peptide backbone cleavage. This phenomenon is less prominent when HCD is used because it applies higher activation energies than CID. In ETD, analyte fragmentation is achieved through an electron transfer reaction from a radical anion toward the positively charged peptide (McLuckey & Stephenson, 1998; Syka et\u00a0al, 2004). Due to this prompt reaction mechanism, ETD\u2010based fragmentation is specifically targeted to the peptide backbone, generating mostly c\u2010 and z\u2010type fragment ions, whereas PTMs remain bound to the peptide. A similar fragmentation pattern is produced by electron capture dissociation (ECD), which is specifically used in FTICR MS. As the ETD/ECD fragmentation pattern is complementary to CID/HCD, hybrid fragmentation approaches, such as ETciD and EThcD, can substantially improve the peptide sequence coverage (Swaney et\u00a0al, 2007; Frese et\u00a0al, 2012). Molecular biology meets mass spectrometry I\u2014peptide\u2010centric MS methodsThe vast capabilities of peptide\u2010centric bottom\u2010up MS in identifying proteins and localizing amino acid modifications make it an ideal readout not only for standard proteomics workflows but also for approaches probing protein structures, conformations, and interactions by chemical or enzymatic in\u2010solution modification. The most prominent examples of such approaches are chemical cross\u2010linking, covalent and/or non\u2010covalent surface labeling, and limited enzymatic proteolysis (Fig\u00a02). All of these methods were introduced several decades ago, but their combination with bottom\u2010up MS has substantially increased their impact on the field of structural biology. In the following subsections, we describe this development in more detail.Chemical cross\u2010linkingChemical cross\u2010linking combined with bottom\u2010up analysis (cross\u2010linking\u2010MS) can be used to study protein conformations as well as protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions. This review will largely focus on protein\u2013protein cross\u2010linking, and a thorough overview of protein\u2013nucleic acid cross\u2010linking\u2010MS applications has been published elsewhere (Schmidt et\u00a0al, 2012).The fact that chemical cross\u2010linking can capture intermolecular interactions of proteins in solution is known for at least 70\u00a0years (Fraenkel\u2010Conrat & Olcott, 1946). The utilization of cross\u2010linking for the structural probing of biomolecular systems was initially facilitated by the emergence of gel electrophoresis in the 1970s, as exemplified by topological studies on ribosomal protein complexes (Clegg & Hayes, 1974; Sun et\u00a0al, 1974). Concomitantly, a wide array of cross\u2010linking reagents has been explored and current cross\u2010linking studies still largely rely on the same chemical principles (Sinz, 2003). In general, cross\u2010linking reagents comprise a spacer arm of varying length connecting two functional groups, which are reactive toward specific amino acid residues. Presently, the most popular class of cross\u2010linking reagents contains two N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide ester functionalities that specifically target primary amino groups, that is, protein N\u2010termini and lysine side chains. Other commercially available cross\u2010linking reagents are reactive toward thiol groups (i.e., Cys side chains) and carboxyl groups (i.e., Asp and Glu side chains) or contain non\u2010specifically reactive photoactivatable moieties (Sinz, 2003; Petrotchenko & Borchers, 2010).Figure\u00a04 illustrates the experimental output produced by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and other biomolecular MS experiments, to which we will recur in the following subsections. The respective data are exemplified using the simple model system human hemoglobin: a tetrameric protein complex consisting of two \u03b1\u2010chains, two \u03b2\u2010chains, and four non\u2010covalently bound heme groups (Fig\u00a04A). Figure\u00a04B shows a MS2 spectrum, acquired after mass selection and gas\u2010phase fragmentation of two cross\u2010linked hemoglobin peptides. The MS2 signals can be clearly annotated to fragment ions representing gas\u2010phase fragmentation events at specific peptide backbone positions. Thus, MS allows sequencing of both peptides and localization of the cross\u2010linker\u2010modified residues. The conception of MS\u2010based cross\u2010link detection (Rappsilber et\u00a0al, 2000; Young et\u00a0al, 2000) has boosted the amount and quality of information that can be gained from a cross\u2010linking experiment. Notably, two residues will only be cross\u2010linked if their mutual distance can be bridged by the applied cross\u2010linking reagent. Cross\u2010links therefore impose distance constraints on the studied system, revealing binding interfaces (by locating inter\u2010protein cross\u2010links) and details about protein conformations (by locating intra\u2010protein cross\u2010links). Moreover, the abundance of cross\u2010links under different experimental conditions can be relatively quantified, enabling comparisons between various biological states in respect of existing protein conformations and interactions (Fischer et\u00a0al, 2013; Schmidt et\u00a0al, 2013; Walzthoeni et\u00a0al, 2015). Cross\u2010linking data can be directly employed to guide computational protein homology modeling and protein\u2013protein docking (Herzog et\u00a0al, 2012; Kalisman et\u00a0al, 2012; L\u00f6ssl et\u00a0al, 2014; Zeng\u2010Elmore et\u00a0al, 2014). Alternatively, they may be used to complement information from other structural biology approaches, most notably cryo\u2010EM, thereby revealing the architecture of multi\u2010protein complexes such as the nuclear pore complex scaffold (Bui et\u00a0al, 2013), the 55S mitochondrial ribosome (Greber et\u00a0al, 2015) or the INO80 chromatin remodeler complex (Tosi et\u00a0al, 2013) (see also Fig\u00a01). Of note, cross\u2010linking data of protein homo\u2010oligomers present a special case since links within and between the subunits cannot be readily distinguished. In most cases, the thorough annotation of homo\u2010oligomeric cross\u2010links critically depends on the availability of high\u2010resolution three\u2010dimensional protein structures (Kosinski et\u00a0al, 2015).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Complementary biomolecular MS data exemplified using the human hemoglobin model system(A) Schematic of native holo\u2010hemoglobin and its constituents: two \u03b1\u2010chains, two \u03b2\u2010chains, and 4 heme groups. (B) Cross\u2010linking\u2010MS. The displayed MS2 spectrum represents two linked peptides derived from cross\u2010linked holo\u2010hemoglobin. The ion signals, shown as blue and red sticks, correspond to specific fragments of the cross\u2010linked peptides. These fragment ions enable the sequencing of both peptides and the localization of their linkage site, as indicated by the fragment ion map in the inset. Since two residues are only cross\u2010linked if they are in close spatial proximity, the identified cross\u2010link gives insights into the in\u2010solution structure of holo\u2010hemoglobin. (C) HDX\u2010MS. Shown are the isotope distributions of the same peptide derived from either holo\u2010hemoglobin (left panel) or the free hemoglobin \u03b1\u2010chain (right panel) after they were separately incubated in D2O\u2010containing buffer. The incubations were quenched at three different time points. The isotope distribution remains at the same m/z position, when the peptide is derived from holo\u2010hemoglobin, whereas it gradually moves to higher m/z, when the peptide is derived from the free \u03b1\u2010chain. This shows that only in the free \u03b1\u2010chain, the peptide is able to take up the heavy deuterium isotope. Consequently, the peptide is solvent accessible in the free \u03b1\u2010chain, whereas it is solvent protected in holo\u2010hemoglobin. (D) Protein\u2010centric MS. Mass spectra of non\u2010digested hemoglobin were acquired under denaturing (upper mass spectrum) and native (lower mass spectrum) conditions. Under denaturing conditions, all signals are concentrated in the low m/z region since the ions of the unfolded proteins are highly charged. The inset illustrates that the heme cofactor is present as a singly charged ion (brown), whereas the hemoglobin \u03b1\u2010chain (red) and \u03b2\u2010chain (blue) are detected in several charge states. From these charge state envelopes, their accurate molecular masses can be derived (\u03b1\u2010chain\u00a0=\u00a015,155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Da, \u03b2\u2010chain\u00a0=\u00a015,895\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Da, heme\u00a0=\u00a0616.5\u00a0Da). In the native mass spectrum, the signals are shifted to higher m/z, indicating that hemoglobin is detected in its folded state (see main text). The molecular weight can be calculated as 64,588\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041\u00a0Da. Together with the constituent masses derived from the denaturing MS experiment, this result unambiguously evidences that holo\u2010hemoglobin is an \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetramer with four bound heme ligands.Cross\u2010linking\u2010MS allows the unbiased structural probing of systems with\u2014in theory\u2014unlimited size and complexity, including cellular protein networks. To live up to this promise, however, cross\u2010linking\u2010MS had (and has) to master several obstacles concerning sample preparation and analysis, cross\u2010link identification, and data interpretation. Here, we will focus on two major advances in these areas that have made cross\u2010linking\u2010MS a more powerful and versatile tool for molecular and structural biology research.First, chemical cross\u2010linking reactions generally proceed with low efficiency, thus generating a low amount of cross\u2010linked protein relative to unreacted protein (Leitner et\u00a0al, 2010). Beneficially, this largely prevents the detection of random protein contacts; however, it may also cause loss of information about specific interactions that are either short\u2010lived or involve less abundant proteins. This especially becomes a limiting factor when cross\u2010links are to be identified in complex mixtures, for example, whole\u2010cell lysates, wherein abundant proteins can \u201cmask\u201d low abundant cross\u2010linked interactors. The key to a more sensitive detection of these less prevalent protein interactions is the enrichment of cross\u2010links at either the protein or peptide level. Cross\u2010link enrichment was first achieved using cross\u2010linking reagents that harbor a biotin tag to facilitate affinity purification (Alley et\u00a0al, 2000; Trester\u2010Zedlitz et\u00a0al, 2003). More recently, biotin\u2010labeled cleavable cross\u2010linkers, so\u2010called protein interaction reporters, have been introduced (the general utility of cleavable cross\u2010linkers is discussed in the next paragraph). These cross\u2010linkers were applied to enrich and identify cross\u2010linked peptides from intact bacterial and human cells (Zheng et\u00a0al, 2011; Chavez et\u00a0al, 2013; Weisbrod et\u00a0al, 2013; Navare et\u00a0al, 2015). Similarly complex samples were probed by using a non\u2010cleavable cross\u2010linker with a removable biotin label (Tan et al, 2016) as well as cleavable cross\u2010linkers that can be biotinylated after the cross\u2010linking reaction (Kaake et\u00a0al, 2014) or enriched by two\u2010dimensional strong cation exchange chromatography (Buncherd et\u00a0al, 2014). Complementary to these cross\u2010linker\u2010based enrichment strategies, several cross\u2010linking\u2010MS studies employed affinity\u2010tagged proteins, enabling structural studies centered on a few proteins of interest. Based on such targeted approaches, detailed in\u00a0vivo protein interaction networks of the 26S proteasome and the protein phosphatase 2A could be derived (Guerrero et\u00a0al, 2006; Herzog et\u00a0al, 2012). Recently, the structural organization of several endogenous protein complexes was examined by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS after affinity purification from transgenic GFP\u2010tagged yeast strains and mice (Shi et\u00a0al, 2015). Owing to the vast repository of these transgenic strains and organisms, this approach potentially opens an avenue to investigate virtually any protein system by in\u00a0vivo cross\u2010linking combined with protein\u2010based affinity purification.Second, cross\u2010linking\u2010MS had to devise efficient search engines for the identification of cross\u2010linked peptides against very large peptide sequence databases. This presents a major challenge because all possible pairwise combinations of peptides need to be considered during the cross\u2010link search. Searching for cross\u2010linked peptides against a database generated from tens of proteins therefore is computationally as demanding as identifying linear peptides against the full human proteome (Liu et\u00a0al, 2014). The identification of cross\u2010links from more complex samples was initially facilitated by the search engine xQuest (Rinner et\u00a0al, 2008), relying on the use of isotope\u2010coded cross\u2010linkers that \u201clabel\u201d the cross\u2010linked peptides in the mass spectra in order to decrease the search space. This, together with dedicated bioinformatics approaches, enabled cross\u2010link identification against the full E.\u00a0coli proteome (Rinner et\u00a0al, 2008), which was later also achieved with the pLink search engine (Yang et\u00a0al, 2012). Nowadays, xQuest and pLink have become the most widely used cross\u2010link search engines to characterize the architecture of large protein complexes (Bui et\u00a0al, 2013; Tosi et\u00a0al, 2013; Cevher et\u00a0al, 2014; Erzberger et\u00a0al, 2014; Greber et\u00a0al, 2014, 2015; Han et\u00a0al, 2014c; Knutson et\u00a0al, 2014; Shi et\u00a0al, 2014).A more fundamental approach to make cross\u2010link identification more efficient focuses on cross\u2010linking reagents, which are cleaved during the MS experiments (Soderblom & Goshe, 2006; M\u00fcller et\u00a0al, 2010). Utilization of such MS\u2010cleavable cross\u2010linkers enables individual MS analysis of linear peptides, theoretically removing all limitations regarding the sample complexity. Consequently, MS\u2010cleavable cross\u2010linkers, which additionally contained an affinity tag, were applied in many of the above\u2010mentioned cross\u2010linking studies on intact cells (Zheng et\u00a0al, 2011; Chavez et\u00a0al, 2013; Weisbrod et\u00a0al, 2013; Kaake et\u00a0al, 2014; Navare et\u00a0al, 2015). These studies employed sophisticated multi\u2010dimensional chromatography and MS setups in combination with software tools tailor\u2010made for the respective cross\u2010linker. To simplify such advanced in\u00a0vivo cross\u2010linking experiments, we recently introduced the search engine XlinkX, the algorithm of which is compatible with any MS\u2010cleavable cross\u2010linker and with standard Orbitrap MS\u2010based data acquisition workflows. In a proof of concept study, XlinkX was able to identify more than 2000 unique cross\u2010links against a full human proteome database providing new insights into the interaction of the 80S ribosome with several associated proteins as they occur in the cellular environment (Liu et\u00a0al, 2015).Surface labelingSurface labeling is based on the principle that chemical probes preferably modify a biomolecule at its solvent\u2010exposed parts, while amino acids that are buried, either in the folded protein core or by an interacting protein, will not be affected. Any modification causes a defined mass shift, which can be detected at the peptide level by bottom\u2010up MS analysis. Evidently, the information obtained from surface labeling is somewhat similar to the insights gained from cross\u2010linking experiments. Cross\u2010linking, however, readily identifies the interacting proteins, whereas surface labeling merely highlights protected regions. Translating surface labeling data into valuable structural information often requires probing of different protein states, for example, unfolded/folded, monomeric/oligomeric, or unbound/ligand\u2010bound, in comparative or time\u2010course labeling experiments. Such an analysis reveals which protein areas become solvent\u2010exposed or buried and which regions remain unaffected, giving insights into biomolecular conformations and binding interfaces. Surface labeling can be performed in two different ways, that is, covalent labeling by amino acid side chain modifications and non\u2010covalent labeling by hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange at the peptide backbone, better known as HDX\u2010MS.Covalent labeling has developed much in parallel with chemical cross\u2010linking because the employed chemical principles partially overlap, as exemplified by the use of lysine\u2010reactive and photoactivatable reagents (Klapper & Klotz, 1972; Bayley & Knowles, 1977). However, basically any covalent labeling strategy is compatible with bottom\u2010up MS. Therefore, covalent labeling\u2010MS can be tailored to target a wide array of amino acids (Mendoza & Vachet, 2009). Alternatively, it may be conducted in a non\u2010specific fashion, for example, by photo\u2010affinity labeling (Robinette et\u00a0al, 2006) or oxidation with hydroxyl radicals (Maleknia & Downard, 2014). Hydroxyl radical probes are, for example, employed in a labeling approach named \u201cfast photochemical oxidation of proteins\u201d (FPOP) (Aye et\u00a0al, 2005; Hambly & Gross, 2005). FPOP has been successfully used to monitor protein folding (Chen et\u00a0al, 2010a), to map binding epitopes (Yan et\u00a0al, 2014), and even to probe solvent\u2010accessible protein regions in\u00a0vivo while preserving the cellular integrity (Espino et\u00a0al, 2015). Beneficially, FPOP seems to work equally efficient on proteins located in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.The non\u2010covalent labeling approach HDX is the best\u2010known and most widely used strategy for biomolecular surface mapping. Hydrogen exchange as a means to probe biomolecular structures was already introduced in the late 1960s (Englander et\u00a0al, 1972). It is based on the observation that hydrogens bound to N, O, or S exchange against solvent hydrogens, whereby peptide backbone hydrogens exchange with specific measurable rates while amino acid side chain hydrogens exchange too fast to be monitored (Englander et\u00a0al, 1972). Soon after the emergence of biomolecular MS, HDX and MS were combined in pioneering studies, showing that this integrated approach gives insights into the solution and gas\u2010phase conformation of proteins (Katta & Chait, 1993; Suckau et\u00a0al, 1993). Most commonly, an HDX\u2010MS analysis consists of three essential steps. First, a biomolecular assembly is transferred from H2O\u2010 to D2O\u2010based buffers so that the solvent\u2010exposed hydrogens will exchange to deuterium (see also Fig\u00a02). Second, this exchange reaction is quenched at different time points by acidification and cooling of the solvent. Third, the reaction mix is subjected to bottom\u2010up MS analysis to determine the deuterium uptake at the peptide level, allowing to derive HDX reaction kinetics that reveal solvent\u2010accessible regions of the analyte. In Fig\u00a04C, this is again illustrated for human hemoglobin. The mass spectra show peptides that have the same amino acid sequence but were derived from either holo\u2010hemoglobin (left panel) or the free hemoglobin \u03b1\u2010chain (right panel). Both samples were incubated in D2O\u2010based buffer and analyzed at three different time points. The isotope envelope of the free \u03b1\u2010chain peptide moves continuously to higher m/z positions (right panel), evidencing that more and more hydrogens are replaced by heavy deuterium isotopes. In contrast, the holo\u2010hemoglobin peptide remains at the same m/z position over time (left panel), showing that no deuterium is taken up. This suggests that the analyzed peptide is solvent accessible in the free \u03b1\u2010chain, but buried in holo\u2010hemoglobin.A main shortcoming of the standard HDX\u2010MS workflow is that the bottom\u2010up analysis is performed in H2O\u2010based solvents, so the deuterium uptake may be partially mitigated by deuterium\u2010to\u2010hydrogen back exchange. In view of this obstacle, it is clear that increasing speed and efficiency of the bottom\u2010up analysis has been a key to make HDX\u2010MS a broadly applicable strategy (Konermann et\u00a0al, 2011; Walters et\u00a0al, 2012). This has been achieved by automating large parts of the HDX\u2010MS analysis workflow. In a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art HDX\u2010MS experiment, the quenched reaction mix is subjected to on\u2010column digestion with an immobilized acid\u2010stable protease (mostly pepsin), peptides are separated using a miniaturized reversed\u2010phase liquid chromatography system, and mass analysis is performed on a tandem\u2010MS platform, all of which are often coupled online. Further advances\u2014like online reduction of protein disulfide bonds prior to digestion (Trabjerg et\u00a0al, 2015), ETD\u2010based peptide fragmentation to monitor residue\u2010specific deuterium uptake (Zehl et\u00a0al, 2008), and sophisticated software tools for peptide mapping, data analysis, and structural interpretation (Slysz et\u00a0al, 2009; Kan et\u00a0al, 2011; Pascal et\u00a0al, 2012; Rey et\u00a0al, 2014)\u2014have additionally streamlined the HDX\u2010MS workflow.Nowadays, HDX\u2010MS is applicable to biomolecular systems that are hardly tractable by other techniques. For example, HDX\u2010MS has become increasingly popular to study the structural biology of membrane proteins, shedding light on interactions of membrane receptors (Chung et\u00a0al, 2011; Shukla et\u00a0al, 2014), conformational dynamics of membrane proteins (Vahidi et\u00a0al, 2016), or protein\u2013membrane interactions (Rostislavleva et\u00a0al, 2015). Moreover, HDX\u2010MS is a particularly powerful approach to study the interactions of chaperones and their folding substrates. Such investigations are complicated by the fact that specific and non\u2010specific chaperone\u2013substrate interactions and intra\u2010substrate interactions, all of which change dynamically during the folding process, have to be discerned. This complex interplay of events is exemplified by the interaction between the histone H2A\u2010H2B heterodimer and its chaperone Nap1, recently studied by HDX\u2010MS (D'Arcy et\u00a0al, 2013). In this study, Nap1 was shown to confine the conformational flexibility of H2A\u2010H2B, transforming their partially disordered histone fold domains into a more folded conformation. At the same time, the Nap1/H2A\u2010H2B binding interface was mapped (shown in Fig\u00a01) and, concomitant with protein complex formation, distinct cooperative unfolding events within both Nap1 and H2A\u2010H2B could be revealed. Another recent HDX\u2010MS investigation focused on chaperone\u2010dependent differences in the folding pathway of the TIM\u2010barrel protein DapA (Georgescauld et\u00a0al, 2014). The authors demonstrated that DapA folds in a slow cooperative manner in the absence of the bacterial chaperone complex GroEL/GroES. When present, GroEL/GroES catalyzes the separate folding of individual DapA segments, thereby accelerating the folding process without specifically interacting with DapA. Intriguingly, a DapA homolog protein from a bacterium that lacks GroEL/GroES folds in a fast, segmental way even without the chaperone complex. These findings led to the hypothesis that segmental folding may be a general pathway for TIM\u2010barrel proteins, providing an evolutionary route toward GroEL/GroES independence.Limited proteolysisLimited proteolysis, introduced more than 60\u00a0years ago (Linderstr\u00f8m\u2010Lang, 1950), is one of the most established biochemical approaches to study the higher order structure of biomolecules (Hubbard, 1998). It is based on the concept that proteolysis of a folded protein is not only dependent on the amino acid sequence but also on the tertiary structure, with surface\u2010exposed and flexible regions being the most proteolytically susceptible sites (Fontana et\u00a0al, 1986). Limited proteolysis is therefore a popular method to separate stably folded protein domains from flexible regions, for example, to generate X\u2010ray crystallography\u2010compatible protein constructs (Hubbard, 1998).The use of limited proteolysis in conjunction with MS was pioneered by Brian Chait and co\u2010workers (Cohen et\u00a0al, 1995). Subsequently, this approach gained increasing popularity, enabling protein\u2013protein binding site mapping (Gervasoni et\u00a0al, 1998) or even monitoring of virus capsid conformational dynamics (Bothner et\u00a0al, 1998). Over the past decade, the application of limited proteolysis\u2010MS has been somewhat overshadowed by HDX\u2010MS and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS, yet it was recently brought back into the spotlight by an elegant proteome\u2010wide study on protein structural transitions using limited proteolysis and targeted MS (Feng et\u00a0al, 2014). The authors performed metabolic shift experiments on yeast cells, changing the carbon source from glucose to ethanol, and globally monitored the condition\u2010dependent abundance of limited proteolysis products. Changes in the limited proteolysis patterns may reveal altered protein conformations, differing protein PTM profiles or protein\u2013ligand binding events. Crucially, limited proteolysis was performed under native conditions using proteinase K and, subsequently, the sample was further proteolyzed under denaturing conditions using trypsin. This step ensured the bottom\u2010up MS compatibility of this highly complex sample while still allowing to distinguish between normal tryptic peptides (cleaved C\u2010terminally of lysines and arginines) and limited proteolysis products (with at least one proteinase K cleavage site). Comparative analysis of the limited proteolysis products and their abundances revealed metabolic shift\u2010induced conformational changes in several enzymes involved in carbon metabolism.Complementary to limited proteolysis, structural aspects of proteins can also be probed by the proteome\u2010wide monitoring of thermal protein denaturation (Savitski et\u00a0al, 2014; Reinhard et\u00a0al, 2015). This approach is based on the rationale that structural changes, in particular ligand association, will affect the protein stability and thus its denaturation temperature. The thermal denaturation and the limited proteolysis approach represent another two examples where the combination of peptide\u2010centric MS with in\u2010solution structural probing enables the system\u2010wide examination of protein structures, conformations, and binding events. Being conducted on intact cells or cell lysates, these experiments are particularly suitable to foster our understanding of in\u00a0vivo biomolecular interactions, thus gradually unraveling the cellular interactome. Molecular biology meets mass spectrometry II\u2014protein\u2010centric MS methodsExperimental approachesAlthough peptide\u2010centric MS is nowadays the most popular variant of biomolecular MS, the initial seminal work introducing ESI and MALDI focused largely on intact proteins with masses up to 130\u00a0kDa (Karas & Hillenkamp, 1988; Tanaka et\u00a0al, 1988; Fenn et\u00a0al, 1989). Shortly afterward, it was demonstrated that, especially by using ESI, also non\u2010covalent assemblies could be preserved in the gas phase and analyzed intact by mass spectrometry (Ganem et\u00a0al, 1991; Katta & Chait, 1991; Light\u2010Wahl et\u00a0al, 1993; Schwartz et\u00a0al, 1994; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al, 1996). This finding gave rise to a new field that was later called \u201cnative mass spectrometry\u201d (van den Heuvel & Heck, 2004). In native MS, named in analogy to native gel electrophoresis, purified proteins or biomolecular assemblies are injected into the mass spectrometer under non\u2010denaturing conditions. While the aforementioned early experiments were mainly performed on protein\u2013ligand complexes and protein homo\u2010oligomers, careful tuning of the mass spectrometer and the ionization conditions lead to successful analysis of more and more non\u2010covalent biomolecular complexes, including impressive examples such as the ribosome (Rostom et\u00a0al, 2000), intact viruses (Fuerstenau et\u00a0al, 2001; Uetrecht et\u00a0al, 2008), the substrate\u2010loaded GroEL/ES chaperone complex (van Duijn et\u00a0al, 2005), and endogenously produced eukaryotic exosome complexes (Hern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al, 2006; Synowsky et\u00a0al, 2006) (see also Fig\u00a01). Most of these studies used ESI, ionizing the proteins from an aqueous ammonium acetate buffer. Beneficially, these solutions are volatile, minimizing the formation of biomolecule\u2013buffer molecule adducts, which would impair accurate mass measurements. Ammonium acetate has only moderate buffer capacity at physiological pH, but can keep biomolecules in a native\u2010like functionally active state. The retention of native\u2010like biomolecular tertiary structures in the gas phase could eventually be evidenced by probing the gas\u2010phase structure of non\u2010denatured proteins and protein complexes using ion mobility spectrometry\u2010MS (IMS\u2010MS) (Ruotolo et\u00a0al, 2005; van Duijn et\u00a0al, 2009).IMS\u2010MS has been a niche technology for several years, mainly applied to study the gas\u2010phase conformations of metal clusters, peptides, and small proteins (Clemmer & Jarrold, 1997). This changed rapidly with the introduction of a commercially available IMS\u2010MS instrument in 2007 (Pringle et\u00a0al, 2007). In the last ten years, IMS\u2010MS has become a popular technique to study the overall structure of biomolecular assemblies, monitor changing protein conformations, or reduce sample complexity by complementing the mass measurement with another gas\u2010phase separation dimension. All of these aspects have been described in several reviews (Clemmer & Jarrold, 1997; Uetrecht et\u00a0al, 2010b; Niu et\u00a0al, 2013; Lanucara et\u00a0al, 2014) and protocols (Ruotolo et\u00a0al, 2008). Therefore, we will provide only a brief explanation of the IMS principle. In essence, IMS separates gaseous ions based on their mobility through a buffer gas. This may allow the detection of different conformers of the same protein (Clemmer et\u00a0al, 1995) or the separation of different oligomeric states of amyloidogenic proteins (Woods et\u00a0al, 2013), which may exhibit the same m/z values but different ion mobilities. The ion mobility depends on a number of aspects including ion charge and size. Most importantly, ion mobility determination allows calculating rotationally averaged collisional cross\u2010sections of the analyte ions, which renders information on their shape. Changes in ion mobility detected by IMS, thus, indicate structural changes. Figure\u00a01 shows two examples where such information was used to monitor ligand\u2010induced conformational changes of an ABC transporter (Marcoux et\u00a0al, 2013) and sequential steps of norovirus capsid assembly (Uetrecht et\u00a0al, 2010a).Currently, the majority of the native (IMS\u2010)MS experiments is performed on soluble proteins and protein complexes, as exemplified by studies on megadalton\u2010sized assemblies like cargo\u2010loaded bacterial nano\u2010containers (Rurup et\u00a0al, 2014) and the dynein cofactor dynactin (Urnavicius et\u00a0al, 2015), the structure of which is shown in Fig\u00a01. However, native MS may also be used to investigate membrane proteins, which can be directly infused after solubilization either in detergent micelles (Barrera et\u00a0al, 2008) or by detergent\u2010free methods (Hopper et\u00a0al, 2013). Besides highly accurate mass measurements of biomolecular assemblies, native MS experiments can provide valuable information on stoichiometries and oligomeric states, especially when combined with gas\u2010phase dissociation in native tandem\u2010MS experiments and/or with complementary MS experiments under denaturing conditions. This is illustrated in Fig\u00a04D wherein mass spectra of denatured and native hemoglobin are depicted. In the upper mass spectrum, hemoglobin was measured by ESI\u2010MS under acidic denaturing conditions, disrupting all non\u2010covalent interactions. Accordingly, the heme cofactor has dissociated from the \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010chain, as evidenced by a signal corresponding to free heme (Fig\u00a04D, inset in upper mass spectrum). Moreover, the \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010protein chains are unfolded, exposing all their chargeable amino acids. This causes the emergence of highly charged \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010chain ions during the ESI process, which are detected at relatively low m/z. Since these protein ions are substantially larger and higher charged than peptide ions, their isotope pattern is not resolved. However, their molecular weights can still be accurately determined based on the m/z differences between the differently charged \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010chain ions (Fig\u00a04D, inset in upper mass spectrum). The masses of the three hemoglobin components\u2014\u03b1\u2010chain (15,155\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Da), \u03b2\u2010chain (15,895\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Da), and heme (616.5\u00a0Da)\u2014are thus readily revealed by the denaturing MS analysis. In contrast, the native mass spectrum (Fig\u00a04D, lower mass spectrum) contains only signals for one species, represented by three charge states in a relatively high m/z region. The shift to higher m/z is mainly due to the fact that the analyte takes up fewer charges than under denaturing conditions. Charging of the analyte is reduced in native MS because some chargeable sites are buried within the folded protein core and the pH of the spraying solution is\u00a0closer to neutral. Based on the three charge states seen in the native mass spectrum, the species mass can be calculated as 64.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0kDa, which unambiguously corresponds to a protein complex consisting of two \u03b1\u2010chains, two \u03b2\u2010chains, and four heme groups. Two mass spectra, each acquired in <\u00a02\u00a0min, can thus correctly identify both the composition and binding stoichiometry of a biomolecular complex.While the hemoglobin example illustrates (albeit for a simple case) the power of protein\u2010centric MS, it also highlights that one level of information is still missing\u2014the amino acid sequence. Sequencing intact proteins directly in a so\u2010called top\u2010down approach (Kelleher et\u00a0al, 1999) rather than inferring their sequence from bottom\u2010up MS data offers several advantages. Most importantly, top\u2010down sequencing may go beyond sheer protein identification, potentially revealing sequence variations, the position of PTMs, and even the interdependence among different mutations and modifications, all of which is barely feasible when using solely peptide\u2010centric MS methods. The success of this strategy, however, heavily depends on a highly efficient fragmentation of the peptide backbone, which is generally more difficult to achieve for intact proteins than for short peptides. It is therefore not surprising that the development of top\u2010down sequencing closely follows advances in peptide fragmentation techniques. While top\u2010down sequencing of native proteins and protein complexes is still in its infancy, first successful top\u2010down experiments on denatured protein samples were performed in the McLafferty laboratory around the turn of the millennium (Kelleher et\u00a0al, 1999). This breakthrough was achieved on FTICR mass spectrometers mainly due to the invention of ECD fragmentation (Horn et\u00a0al, 2000; Sze et\u00a0al, 2002). Over the years, more fragmentation techniques such as ETD and UV photodissociation\u00a0were introduced, allowing top\u2010down sequencing to be performed on several types of instruments, including Orbitrap mass spectrometers (Chi et\u00a0al, 2007; Fornelli et\u00a0al, 2012; Shaw et\u00a0al, 2013). Next to the progress in the field of gas\u2010phase fragmentation, the development of powerful spectrum analysis software and statistical tools (Liu et\u00a0al, 2012; Fellers et\u00a0al, 2015; Cai et\u00a0al, 2016) has greatly increased the scope of top\u2010down protein analysis. Finally, more efficient protein extraction, separation, and fractionation methods were critical prerequisites for an in\u2010depth analysis of complex samples by top\u2010down MS (Sharma et\u00a0al, 2007; Chen et\u00a0al, 2008; Tran & Doucette, 2009; Han et\u00a0al, 2014b).It becomes apparent that, by now, many different variants of protein\u2010centric MS have evolved, ranging from non\u2010denaturing approaches that may be combined with gas\u2010phase dissociation and ion mobility separation to denaturing approaches that even facilitate intact protein sequencing (Fig\u00a02). Combining these approaches is, in our view, the key to a thorough understanding of biomolecular systems. Therefore, the following subsections will showcase examples that illustrate the diverse, often complementary, analytical angles provided by the different protein\u2010centric MS approaches.Comprehensive analysis of post\u2010translational modificationsAs phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent PTMs, the functional and structural characterization of protein phosphorylation is a major theme in molecular biology (Hunter, 1995; Johnson, 2009). Detection and site localization of protein phosphorylation sites using MS works without radioactive labeling and specific antibodies, in\u00a0contrast to more traditional biochemical methods. Protein phosphorylation is typically analyzed with bottom\u2010up proteomics approaches (Riley & Coon, 2016); however, the central role of phosphorylation in modulating protein conformation, activity, localization, and complex formation/dissociation has driven the development of low\u2010throughput protein\u2010centric MS approaches that are better suited to monitor these aspects.Owing to the ability of native MS to capture non\u2010covalent interactions, it appears to be a straightforward choice to monitor the effect of protein phosphorylation on biomolecular interactions. However, differentially phosphorylated protein isoforms were, for a long time, nearly impossible to distinguish due to limitations in mass resolving power. Notably, phosphorylation causes a mass shift of no more than 80\u00a0Da; therefore, phospho\u2010isoforms differ in mass by generally <\u00a00.1%. Resolving these subtle differences became possible with the development of mass spectrometers that combined high resolution with a high mass range. Important early contribution in this area came from orthogonal Q\u2010TOF mass spectrometers, modified to allow the transmission and detection of high mass ions (Sobott et\u00a0al, 2002; van den Heuvel et\u00a0al, 2006). More recently, the now\u2010commercialized\u00a0Orbitrap EMR instrument has really made an impact in this field (Rose et\u00a0al, 2012; Snijder et\u00a0al, 2014). This novel mass spectrometer is able to mass\u2010resolve phospho\u2010isoforms of proteins and protein complexes of several 100\u00a0kDa, as exemplified in a recent investigation of the interplay between protein phosphorylation and protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013ligand interaction dynamics (van de Waterbeemd et\u00a0al, 2014). In this study, the phosphorylation and cyclic nucleotide binding of dimeric 150\u00a0kDa cGMP\u2010dependent protein kinase (PKG) were simultaneously monitored by high\u2010resolution\u00a0native MS, showing that binding of cAMP or cGMP causes different PKG phosphorylation kinetics. In a second example, it was demonstrated that the binding and phosphorylation of the mitotic regulator Bora by the cycle kinase Aurora A proceed independently. Interestingly, all three investigated proteins\u2014Aurora A, Bora, and PKG\u2014existed in different phosphorylation states. The relative abundance of all these phospho\u2010isoforms could be accurately determined by native MS, whereas complementary peptide\u2010centric MS experiments were done to localize the phosphorylated residues (van de Waterbeemd et\u00a0al, 2014). Since the coexisting phospho\u2010isoforms are indistinguishable at the peptide level, the phosphorylated residues could not be allocated to specific phosphorylation states. This level of information was later accessed by combining highly specific ion isolation and complementary gas\u2010phase fragmentation techniques in a top\u2010down protein sequencing approach (Brunner et\u00a0al, 2015). Top\u2010down sequencing allowed to decipher the phospho\u2010proteoforms of Bora resulting from phosphorylation by either Aurora A or Polo\u2010like kinase 1 (Plk1), showing that both kinases target different Bora residues and generate distinct phosphorylation successions. Compared to these binary kinase/Bora systems, the tripartite Aurora A/Bora/Plk1 interplay is analytically even more challenging, as it is characterized by numerous mutual phosphorylation events with various implications on protein structure and function. Simultaneous probing of these often temporarily occurring effects was recently achieved by using an MS\u2010based structural biology strategy, integrating native MS, cross\u2010linking\u2010MS, IMS\u2010MS, top\u2010down sequencing, and bottom\u2010up proteomics (L\u00f6ssl et\u00a0al, 2016). Strikingly, it could be demonstrated that Aurora A and activated Plk1 hyper\u2010phosphorylate Bora according to a defined sequence of residue\u2010specific phosphorylations, thereby priming a substantial structural change of Bora, which eventually allows stable Plk1/Bora complex formation. This multipronged MS analysis, thus, provided mechanistic insights into the sequence of events accompanying the Aurora A/Bora\u2010mediated Plk1 activation, which is essential for recovery from DNA damage\u2010induced cell cycle arrest.Another example that the seemingly small difference of one phosphorylation can have a profound effect on proteins was recently reported for calmodulin after phosphorylation by casein kinase 2 (Pan et\u00a0al, 2016). The kinase was shown to phosphorylate calmodulin between one and four times in a specific order. To see whether any of these phosphorylation events influenced the calmodulin structure, the phosphorylated protein was incubated with deuterated buffer for a set amount of time, denatured and injected into the mass spectrometer. Subsequent selection and ETD fragmentation of the distinct phospho\u2010isoforms allowed the quantification of the deuterium uptake in specific regions. This innovative top\u2010down HDX\u2010MS experiment successfully proved that only a specific pair of phosphorylation events influenced the calmodulin structure substantially.The in\u2010depth characterization of PTMs using protein\u2010centric MS is not limited to phosphorylation. An interesting example exhibiting more complex PTM patterns is presented by histone proteins bearing multiple modifications such as methylation (+14\u00a0Da), acetylation (+42\u00a0Da), and phosphorylation (+80\u00a0Da). Cross talk between these modifications has been examined for histone H3 using state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art top\u2010down MS analysis (Zheng et\u00a0al, 2016). Another protein modification that recently attracted a lot of attention in the biomolecular MS community is glycosylation. Unlike the aforementioned PTMs, glycosylation needs to be studied not only in respect of its location and abundance, but also with regard to the saccharide composition of the often very complex glycan trees. For this reason, glycosylation analysis requires a different set of MS strategies. Bottom\u2010up MS analysis can be conducted to examine glycosylation patterns, whereby complementary fragmentation methods, for example, ETD and HCD, allow to derive both the peptide sequence and the glycan tree composition. While bottom\u2010up MS reveals the specific glycan linkages as well as site\u2010specific glycosylation differences, these data can be effectively complemented by protein\u2010centric MS analysis. Both native MS and denaturing MS have been successfully used to profile complex glycosylation patterns even in the presence of other PTMs, as exemplified by the comprehensive analyses of chicken ovalbumin and interferon\u2010\u03b21, which were shown to consist of 59 and 138 different protein isoforms, respectively (Yang et\u00a0al, 2013; Bush et\u00a0al, 2016). As such, protein\u2010centric MS may become a screening method to compare patient\u2010derived plasma glycoproteins or production batches of protein therapeutics. Most therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies, are well characterized regarding their primary sequence and specific glycosylation sites. However, the glycan tree composition at these sites can still differ substantially, depending on the source material (e.g., CHO cells, yeast or human cell lines) and its growth conditions. A protocol to investigate these glycan trees, in particular on monoclonal antibodies, with native MS has been reported 2\u00a0years ago (Rosati et\u00a0al, 2014). This approach relies on the stepwise application of glycan\u2010specific glycosidases to sequentially truncate the glycan trees. As a result of this procedure, certain proteoforms show glycan\u2010specific mass losses, which can be immediately read out with native MS, allowing the step\u2010by\u2010step reconstruction of the glycosylation profile. As an additional benefit of native MS, this strategy can also be used for glycoprotein complexes. Examples of non\u2010covalently\u00a0associated glycoproteins characterized by native (IMS\u2010)MS include glycosylated antibody\u2013antigen complexes, multimeric glycoproteins (Dyachenko et\u00a0al, 2015), glycosylated antibody\u2013drug conjugates (Rosati et\u00a0al, 2013; Marcoux et\u00a0al, 2015), and glycoprotein complexes involved in complement activation (Diebolder et\u00a0al, 2014; Wang et\u00a0al, 2016).Protein\u2013ligand binding kinetics and stoichiometriesBinding of ligands, such as cofactors, nucleotides, lipids, or drug molecules, is to some extent similar to PTMs, as both result in a characteristic mass shift of proteins and protein complexes. Unlike PTMs, however, ligands are in general non\u2010covalently associated, so their binding needs to be investigated by native MS. Native MS protein\u2013ligand interaction studies are not limited to the mere detection of the binding event, but can also provide information about the binding stoichiometry (McCammon et\u00a0al, 2004; Schuller et\u00a0al, 2016), affinity (Clark & Konermann, 2004; El\u2010Hawiet et\u00a0al, 2012a), and cooperativity (Dyachenko et\u00a0al, 2013; Lin et\u00a0al, 2014). Over the past decade, such approaches have gained importance as small molecule screening studies in the pharmaceutical industry (Hofstadler & Sannes\u2010Lowery, 2006; Vivat Hannah et\u00a0al, 2010; Maple et\u00a0al, 2014).In an elegant example of MS\u2010based ligand binding studies, the interaction between gangliosides (sialic acid glycosphingolipid conjugates) and human norovirus proteins has been investigated using three sophisticated native MS strategies (Han et\u00a0al, 2014a). Initially, the authors used native \u201ccatch\u2010and\u2010release\u201d ESI\u2010MS (El\u2010Hawiet et\u00a0al, 2012b) to screen a carbohydrate mixture, resembling the oligosaccharide moiety of 17 gangliosides, against the 865\u00a0kDa oligomeric norovirus P\u2010particle, a mimic of the capsid's protruding spike structure. The resulting native mass spectra contained ions representing the most prominently formed P\u2010particle\u2013carbohydrate complexes. This convoluted signal was mass\u2010selected and subjected to CID to release the bound carbohydrates, allowing the detection of any dissociated carbohydrate in the low m/z region. Second, a direct ESI\u2010MS assay (Wang et\u00a0al, 2003) was applied to confirm the identified ligands and to quantify their binding affinity toward a smaller dimeric version of the P\u2010particle. Third, to verify the relevance of the P\u2010particle model system, the derived kinetic constants were cross\u2010validated by a \u201cproxy protein\u201d ESI\u2010MS method (El\u2010Hawiet et\u00a0al, 2012a). In this approach, a 10.5 MDa norovirus\u2010like particle and a small (16\u00a0kDa) \u201cproxy protein\u201d with known carbohydrate binding affinity were co\u2010incubated to compete for carbohydrate binding. Since different carbohydrate binding states are much easier to distinguish for small proteins, the carbohydrate occupation of the \u201cproxy protein\u201d was measured at different norovirus\u2010like particle concentrations. This provided an indirect readout to determine the norovirus\u2010like particle\u2013carbohydrate binding affinities, which were in good agreement with the results of the direct ESI\u2010MS approach.As mentioned above, native (IMS\u2010)MS has also become a valuable method to study membrane proteins. The emerging view is that some of these proteins may preferentially interact with specific lipids and, especially in the case of membrane transporters, adopt situation\u2010specific conformations. Intriguingly, both of these aspects can be probed by native IMS\u2010MS, as illustrated in the following examples. First, a recent IMS\u2010MS study elucidated the lipid\u2010binding selectivity of three membrane proteins, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, aquaporin Z, and the ammonia channel (Laganowsky et\u00a0al, 2014). The extent to which these membrane proteins are stabilized by different lipids was measured using IMS\u2010MS, which gives information on both the protein shape and the protein mass. The former provides direct evidence for partial unfolding in the gas phase as a readout for protein stability, whereas the latter readily identifies the specific protein\u2013lipid complex corresponding to the respective unfolding state. Beneficially, this allows separate interrogation of successive lipid\u2010binding events, demonstrating how different synthetic and natural lipids or multiple lipid\u2010binding events modulate the membrane protein stability. In all three cases, the highest stability was rendered by a class of lipids that was shown to be functionally significant for the respective protein. In the second example, factors involved in the conformational transitions of membrane transporters have been investigated for the membrane\u2010embedded mammalian drug efflux pump P\u2010glycoprotein, probing the influence of the specific binding of lipids, nucleotides, and drugs (Marcoux et\u00a0al, 2013). All three classes of small molecules were shown to bind independently as well as concomitantly to the P\u2010glycoprotein; however, only synergistic binding triggered a significant shift in the conformational equilibrium, resembling the structural transition expected for an efflux process. Monitoring cellular machineries\u2014the role of MS in integrated structural and molecular biology studiesSo far, we have described several examples of biomolecular systems that were successfully probed by peptide\u2010 and/or protein\u2010centric MS strategies (see also Fig\u00a01). A few biomolecular assemblies have become recurring subjects of integrated structural and molecular biology studies, often involving biomolecular MS approaches next to more traditional methods such as X\u2010ray crystallography and EM. In the final section of this review, we will focus on two such systems: the eukaryotic transcription machinery and the bacterial CRISPR\u2013Cas immune system. Our understanding of these systems has substantially increased owing to studies that combined biomolecular MS with other structural and molecular biology techniques. Thus, this section aims to illustrate the added value of such integrated approaches highlighting specifically the niche of biomolecular MS therein.Eukaryotic transcription complexesDNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) are responsible for gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. In most eukaryotes, three of these multi\u2010subunit enzymes are present, with Pol I synthesizing ribosomal RNA, Pol II producing messenger RNA, and Pol III making transfer RNA and small RNAs. Pol II, the most widely studied subtype, is a 514\u00a0kDa protein complex consisting of 12 different subunits (Bushnell & Kornberg, 2003). Several assembly states of Pol II have been characterized by X\u2010ray crystallography, culminating in structural models of Pol II in complex with transcription factor (TF) IIB, TATA box binding protein, a DNA template, and an RNA synthesis product (Kostrewa et\u00a0al, 2009; Liu et\u00a0al, 2010; Sainsbury et\u00a0al, 2012). However, Pol II engages in even more complex assemblies in the course of mRNA synthesis, recruiting other transcription factors, mRNA processing enzymes, and even supramolecular co\u2010activators like the Mediator complex. Further complexity arises from the bound RNA transcript but also from heterogeneous PTMs, most notably on the Pol II C\u2010terminal domain (Heidemann et\u00a0al, 2013; Allen & Taatjes, 2015; Sainsbury et\u00a0al, 2015). Similarly, Pol I and Pol III bind several transcription factors and general regulators (Vannini, 2013). Such massive, dynamically interacting ensembles are typically elusive to X\u2010ray crystallography. Therefore, a number of these assemblies have recently been investigated by hybrid structural and molecular biology approaches, the key elements of which are cryo\u2010EM and biomolecular MS. These strategies not only uncovered a wealth of structural information but also gave insights into the relationship between the architecture and biochemical function of RNA polymerase supercomplexes.Pol II from yeast represents the first fully assembled cellular machinery probed by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS (Chen et\u00a0al, 2010b). The architecture of Pol II was accurately reflected by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS, initiating its rise to an established structural biology method. Moreover, the Pol II\u2013TFIIF binding interface could be mapped based on specific inter\u2010protein cross\u2010links. The Pol II\u2013TFIIF complex model was further extended in a more comprehensive cross\u2010linking\u2010MS study, resulting in a structural model of the yeast core initiation complex that could be reconciled with previously obtained biochemical insights into the yeast pre\u2010initiation complex (M\u00fchlbacher et\u00a0al, 2014). To obtain high\u2010resolution structural models of this pre\u2010initiation\u00a0complex, cross\u2010linking\u2010MS was used in combination with cryo\u2010EM in two independent investigations (Murakami et\u00a0al, 2013; Plaschka et\u00a0al, 2015). The more recent study from Plaschka et\u00a0al (2015) even went beyond the pre\u2010initiation complex and provided the structure of the pre\u2010initiation complex bound to the co\u2010activating Mediator core complex. The structure of this 1.2\u00a0MDa supercomplex was solved with subnanometer resolution using cryo\u2010EM; however, this analysis did not reveal the subunit arrangement within the Mediator middle module. Instead, this part of the Mediator core complex could be topologically elucidated based on the cross\u2010linking\u2010MS distance constraints, demonstrating the benefits of integrating complementary structural biology approaches (Plaschka et\u00a0al, 2015).The Mediator complex is exemplary for biomolecular assemblies that are refractory to traditional structural biology methods, as it is conformationally highly flexible and compositionally diverse (Fig\u00a05). The Mediator middle module was investigated early on by native MS, tandem\u2010MS, and IMS\u2010MS, which, in combination with light scattering, small\u2010angle X\u2010ray scattering (SAXS), and pull\u2010down assays, revealed its overall shape and subunit topology (Koschubs et\u00a0al, 2010). This model was later refined using cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and homology modeling (Larivi\u00e8re et\u00a0al, 2013). Furthermore, a structure of the Mediator head module has been determined by X\u2010ray crystallography and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS (Robinson et\u00a0al, 2012). A full Mediator complex model was finally derived based on a comprehensive hybrid structural biology strategy combining X\u2010ray crystallography, cryo\u2010EM, computational modeling, and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS (Robinson et\u00a0al, 2015). Very recently, this model was extended to a full Mediator\u2010Pol II pre\u2010initiation complex structure comprising 52 protein subunits (Robinson et al, 2016).Open in a separate windowFigure 5Hybrid approaches gradually unravel the Mediator complex architectureThe Mediator complex is a challenging target for structural biology because it comprises several subcomplexes and highly flexible regions. First, a topological model of the Mediator middle module was derived with a hybrid approach employing native MS and IMS\u2010MS. This could be extended to a more detailed model by means of cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and homology modeling. In parallel, a Mediator head module structure was derived by combining X\u2010ray crystallography and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS results. Finally, hybrid structural biology approaches led to the characterization of a 15\u2010subunit Mediator core complex and a 21\u2010subunit Mediator complex. Structural images adapted with permission from the publications referenced in the figure.Moving on from transcription initiation to mRNA elongation and processing, native MS, cross\u2010linking\u2010MS, and cryo\u2010EM proved once more to be a fruitful combination, uncovering the structural and biochemical basis for co\u2010transcriptional mRNA capping (Martinez\u2010Rucobo et\u00a0al, 2015). The capping process, which modifies the 5\u2032 end of the newly synthesized mRNA, is performed in yeast by the Cet1 triphosphatase and the Ceg1 guanylyltransferase. Through native MS, a heterotetramer of these enzymes was shown to bind to Pol II. Next, the relevance of the formed capping and transcribing Pol II complex was proven by MS\u2010based monitoring of the stepwise mRNA modification. This paved the road for cryo\u2010EM and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS experiments that revealed the capping enzyme binding site at the Pol II mRNA exit tunnel.In contrast to Pol II, eukaryotic Pol I and Pol III were only recently characterized by high\u2010resolution structures (Engel et\u00a0al, 2013; Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Tornero et\u00a0al, 2013; Hoffmann et\u00a0al, 2015). However, some structural aspects of both complexes have previously been revealed by MS analysis. Native (tandem\u2010)MS together with in\u2010solution dissociation experiments confirmed that 10 of the 17 Pol III subunits form a stable core, whereas the remaining 7 subunits are more peripheral (Lorenzen et\u00a0al, 2007). Three of these peripheral subunits form the C82/34/31 subcomplex, which could be accurately positioned on the Pol III core based on cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and biochemical data (Wu et\u00a0al, 2012). The presence of Pol III subcomplexes was confirmed in another native MS study that also included IMS\u2010MS to obtain topological information (Lane et\u00a0al, 2011). This study additionally probed the assembly of Pol I, finding that Pol I and Pol III exhibit similarities in their disassembly pathways. While these examples show how MS by itself can render structural insights, both native MS and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS were also integrated in hybrid structural biology approaches that revealed structural and functional features of Pol I and Pol III subunits and accessory factors. For instance, key aspects of the Pol III pre\u2010initiation\u00a0complex architecture were unveiled by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS and X\u2010ray crystallography of the TFIIIC complex (Male et\u00a0al, 2015). Regarding the structural organization of Pol I, native MS proved that the Pol I subunits A49 and A34.5\u2014the only ones for which no Pol II homologs exist\u2014form a stable heterodimer that associates with the other 12 Pol I subunits (Geiger et\u00a0al, 2010). Subsequent crystallization of the A49/A34.5 heterodimer enabled structural comparisons to Pol II\u2010associated transcription factors, uncovering key similarities between A49/A34.5 and TFIIF as well as TFIIE. Moreover, a cross\u2010linking\u2010MS\u2010based Pol I model showed A49/A34.5 in positions similar to the TFIIF and TFIIE binding regions on Pol II (Jennebach et\u00a0al, 2012), reinforcing the concept that some Pol I subunits act as stably associated transcription factors. Other factors for transcription initiation, however, are reversibly associated with Pol I. One of them, Rrn3, was studied by SAXS and native MS, which led to the conclusion that it forms dimers in solution but monomerizes during Pol I binding (Blattner et\u00a0al, 2011). The Rrn3/Pol I interaction site could be mapped by cross\u2010linking\u2010MS, resulting in a model of the Pol I\u2013Rrn3 initiation complex (Blattner et\u00a0al, 2011).Protein assemblies involved in the CRISPR\u2013Cas immune systemBacteria and archaea have evolved a variety of defense strategies to withstand viral infection, but most attention was in recent years drawn to the RNA\u2010guided adaptive immune response through clustered interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR\u2010associated (Cas) proteins. The molecular mechanism behind the various CRISPR\u2013Cas systems has been reviewed extensively (van der Oost et\u00a0al, 2014; Wright et\u00a0al, 2016). Briefly, CRISPR gene loci can accommodate short stretches of bacteriophage nucleic acid sequences (\u201cspacer\u201d) that are incorporated during viral infection. These spacers are transcribed into CRISPR RNA, which directs the Cas proteins toward matching viral nucleic acids, enabling their degradation.CRISPR\u2013Cas systems are divided into three main types. Type II systems, which contain CRISPR RNA and only one multifunctional Cas protein, have become highly popular tools for genome engineering (Mali et\u00a0al, 2013; Wright et\u00a0al, 2016). Type I and type III systems, however, comprise CRISPR RNA and multiple Cas proteins, forming ribonucleoprotein complexes of 350\u2013450\u00a0kDa that represent a challenging target for structural characterization.\nEscherichia coli type I Cascade was the first CRISPR\u2013Cas system to be structurally characterized (Jore et\u00a0al, 2011). Cascade is composed of five different Cas proteins and CRISPR RNA, the masses of which sum up to 184\u00a0kDa. When intact Cascade was analyzed by native MS, however, it exhibited a mass of approximately 405\u00a0kDa, showing that one or more components must be present in multiple copies. To decipher the Cascade binding stoichiometry, the authors first added a complementary single\u2010stranded DNA probe and monitored the mass increase by native MS, demonstrating that only one CRISPR RNA is bound. Cascade was next subjected to gas\u2010phase dissociation and tandem\u2010MS analysis, monitoring the sequential loss of several Cas subunits. Since these results were not sufficient to infer the complete binding stoichiometry, additional in\u2010solution dissociation experiments were performed, disrupting Cascade by adding low amounts of organic solvents. The resulting subcomplexes were analyzed by native (tandem\u2010)MS analysis, which finally allowed to derive copy numbers for all Cas proteins in the intact Cascade assembly. By combining these results with two\u2010dimensional EM data, a first topological model of Cascade could be proposed (Jore et\u00a0al, 2011), which soon was confirmed by a more detailed cryo\u2010EM reconstruction (Wiedenheft et\u00a0al, 2011a). A similar approach combining native MS, EM, and SAXS was used to probe the P.\u00a0aeruginosa Csy complex, unveiling remarkable similarities to the Cascade quaternary structure despite the lack of obvious protein sequence homology (Wiedenheft et\u00a0al, 2011b). This structural analogy was further demonstrated in a follow\u2010up study that applied native IMS\u2010MS and molecular modeling (van Duijn et\u00a0al, 2012).More recently, several type III CRISPR\u2013Cas systems were subjected to hybrid structural investigations. First structural information was obtained on the T.\u00a0thermophilus Cmr complex (Staals et\u00a0al, 2013). This assembly was studied by deep sequencing to probe its CRISPR RNA content, native MS in combination with gas\u2010phase and in\u2010solution dissociation to determine its binding stoichiometry, and negative\u2010stain EM to reconstruct a first 3D complex map, in which the subunits could be placed. Similar approaches combining deep sequencing, native MS, and EM resulted in structural models of Csm complexes isolated from bacteria (Staals et\u00a0al, 2014) and archaea (Rouillon et\u00a0al, 2013). Interestingly, all three studies showed that the respective ribonucleoprotein complex architectures resemble the E.\u00a0coli Cascade complex. The same observation was made for the P.\u00a0furiosus Cmr complex, which was modeled by using cross\u2010linking\u2010MS distance constraints to fit individual Cas protein crystal structures into a low\u2010resolution EM map (Benda et\u00a0al, 2014). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that type I and type III CRISPR\u2013Cas systems share some common evolutionary ancestry.An aspect that has long been neglected in structural studies of CRISPR\u2013Cas systems is the precise mapping of the CRISPR RNA\u2013protein binding interfaces. First attempts to pinpoint these interactions were made during characterization of the T.\u00a0thermophilus Csm complex, in which contacts between all Csm subunits and their cognate RNA were revealed using UV\u2010induced RNA\u2013protein cross\u2010linking and MS (Staals et\u00a0al, 2014). This strategy was recently shown to be generally applicable for RNA interaction mapping of CRISPR\u2010associated proteins (Hrle et\u00a0al, 2014; Sharma et\u00a0al, 2015), promising even more comprehensive structural maps of CRISPR\u2013Cas systems in the future. Concluding remarksThe continuous technological progress of MS provides opportunities to probe the structure and function of biomolecular systems with increasing analytical depth. Most importantly, MS experiments typically yield information that is complementary to the aspects monitored by traditional biochemical or structural biology approaches. While individual methods are often insufficient to understand highly complex and dynamically interacting biomolecular machineries, their characterization can be achieved by merging the unique benefits of diverse analytical techniques, as we have exemplified on CRISPR\u2013Cas and transcription\u2010related complexes. Closing in upon the in\u00a0vivo architecture of such cellular key players, the focus of integrated structural studies is moving from recombinantly produced complexes to endogenously existing biomolecular assemblies, which also have become amenable to native MS and cross\u2010linking\u2010MS characterization. Evidently, the ultimate goal is to elucidate even more intricate systems, for example, cellular signaling pathways, organelles, and, eventually, entire cells. Here, in particular cross\u2010linking\u2010MS will likely prove as an ideal complement to emerging in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0situ technologies such as live\u2010cell imaging, in\u2010/on\u2010cell NMR, and cryo\u2010electron tomography. However, also other MS\u2010based approaches (e.g., protein surface labeling and limited proteolysis) are extending their scope toward proteome\u2010wide structural studies, allowing them to pull their weight in integrated analytical strategies. The future of MS\u2010based approaches in structural and molecular biology is bright! Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
