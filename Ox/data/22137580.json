Highlights\u25ba RPAP2 interacts both with Pol II and the snRNA gene-specific Integrator complex \u25ba RPAP2 recognizes the Ser7P mark on the Pol II CTD \u25ba RPAP2 is required for expression of snRNA and protein-coding genes \u25ba RPAP2 is a Ser5P-specific CTD phosphatase IntroductionIn human cells, transcription of protein-coding genes and most small nuclear (sn)RNA genes is carried out by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. The largest subunit of Pol II, Rpb1, contains an unusual carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) consisting of tandem repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. The CTD is an evolutionarily conserved structure that can be extensively and reversibly phosphorylated in\u00a0vivo (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2008; Egloff and Murphy, 2008). CTD phosphorylation has been implicated in key steps of transcription such as preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly, promoter clearance, promoter proximal pausing, transcript elongation, and polymerase recycling (Buratowski, 2009). In addition, cotranscriptional processing of nascent RNAs is affected by the phosphorylation status of the CTD. It is well established that the CTD acts as a molecular platform allowing the transcription/RNA processing factors to be recruited to the transcribing polymerase at the right point of the transcription cycle (Buratowski, 2003; Egloff and Murphy, 2008; Perales and Bentley, 2009). The CTD of Pol II recruited to the PIC at the promoter is hypophosphorylated. Phosphorylation of the CTD on Ser5 accompanies initiation/promoter clearance by Pol\u00a0II, while subsequent phosphorylation on Ser2 occurs later in the transcription cycle, during elongation (Buratowski, 2009). A\u00a0complicated interplay between CTD kinases and CTD phosphatases generates the complex phosphorylation pattern along genes, which underpins the CTD code (Buratowski, 2003; Egloff and Murphy, 2008). The Cdk7 catalytic subunit of the TFIIH complex is the main Ser5 kinase, while the Cdk9 catalytic subunit of the P-TEFb complex is responsible for Ser2 phosphorylation. Dynamic dephosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 is thought to make a significant contribution to the changes in CTD phosphorylation patterns during the transcription cycle and is essential for recycling Pol II (Buratowski, 2009; Egloff and Murphy, 2008). The evolutionarily conserved protein Fcp1, which is essential in yeast, dephosphorylates phospho-Ser2 preferentially (Hausmann and Shuman, 2002), whereas Ssu72 and the more recently described Rtr1 in yeast, and SCP1 in mammals, specifically dephosphorylate Ser5 (Krishnamurthy et\u00a0al., 2004; Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009; Yeo et\u00a0al., 2003).In addition to Ser2 and Ser5, Ser7 of the CTD is phosphorylated during transcription (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2007). Ser7 phosphorylation has been detected on both protein-coding genes and the Pol II-transcribed snRNA genes (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2007; Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007, 2009). The role of this modification on protein-coding genes remains poorly understood, since mutation of Ser7 to alanine does not significantly affect mRNA production from several tested genes (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2007; Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). In contrast, Ser7 is required for efficient transcription of snRNA genes and processing of the transcripts (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). Human snRNA genes transcribed by Pol II are structurally different from protein-coding genes (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2008; Hernandez, 2001). snRNAs are neither spliced nor polyadenylated, and instead of a poly(A) signal, the genes contain\u00a0a conserved 3\u2032 box RNA processing element (Hernandez, 1985) recognized by the snRNA gene-specific Integrator RNA 3\u2032 end processing complex (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005). Importantly, the Integrator complex binds to the Pol II CTD, providing a molecular link between transcription and 3\u2032 end processing. Phosphorylated Ser7 (Ser7P) is a key determinant for the recruitment of the Integrator complex to snRNA genes (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005; Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). In combination with Ser2P, it creates what may be an snRNA gene-specific double mark recognized by the Integrator complex (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2010). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ser7P is found at gene promoters and persists within the encoding region (Mayer et\u00a0al., 2010; Tietjen et\u00a0al., 2010), and appears to be enriched over 5\u2032 ends, introns, and 3\u2032 ends (Kim et\u00a0al., 2010). In mammals, Ser7P is highest at the promoter region of snRNA genes but enriched toward the 3\u2032 end of protein-coding genes (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2007; Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009). Recent studies indicate that Cdk7 is the major Ser7 kinase in\u00a0vivo, while the Ser7 phosphatase remains to be identified (Akhtar et\u00a0al., 2009; Boeing et\u00a0al., 2010; Glover-Cutter et\u00a0al., 2009; Kim et\u00a0al., 2009). In addition to Cdk7, Bur1 kinase appears to act as\u00a0a Ser7 kinase on elongating Pol II in yeast (Tietjen et\u00a0al., 2010), Cdk9 can phosphorylate Ser7 in\u00a0vitro (Glover-Cutter et\u00a0al., 2009; Kim et\u00a0al., 2009), and DNA-PK has been reported to be the major Ser7 kinase in HeLa cell nuclear extract (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2010).A recent systematic analysis determined the composition and organization of the soluble Pol II machinery (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). This map of interactions reveals previously unknown components of Pol II transcription complexes. Newly identified proteins occupying key positions in this network were named RNA Pol II-associated protein (RPAP) (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). Of these, the RPAP2 protein was found to interact also with the Integrator complex, raising the possibility that it may participate in expression of snRNA genes. Interestingly, the yeast homolog of RPAP2 is the Rtr1 Ser5 phosphatase, which also interacts genetically with the Pol II machinery (Gibney et\u00a0al., 2008). Upon deletion of Rtr1, the Ser5P form of Pol II accumulates in whole-cell extracts and throughout mRNA gene-coding regions (Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009).Prompted by these findings, we have investigated the role of\u00a0the human RPAP2 protein in snRNA gene expression. We show that RPAP2 specifically associates with Ser7-phosphorylated Pol II through a direct interaction with the CTD. Functional characterization of the protein demonstrates that, like its homolog in yeast, RPAP2 acts as a Ser5 phosphatase in\u00a0vitro and Ser5P levels increase in\u00a0vivo when RPAP2 is knocked down. In addition, depletion of RPAP2 affects snRNA gene expression in the same way as mutation of Ser7. Interestingly, RPAP2 does not appear to be recruited to protein-coding genes through Ser7 phosphorylation. Our results suggest that Ser7P specifically leads to Integrator recruitment and Ser5 dephosphorylation of the Pol II CTD during transcription of snRNA genes through recruitment of the RPAP2 phosphatase. ResultsHuman RPAP2 Exists in at Least Two Distinct ComplexesIn a recent study of the protein interaction network of the human transcription machinery, newly identified proteins were named RNA Pol II-associated protein (RPAP), based on their physical interaction with Pol II (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). RPAP2 contains 612 amino acids, while the yeast homolog Rtr1 contains only 226 and 197 amino acids in S.\u00a0cerevisiae and S.\u00a0pombe, respectively (Figure\u00a01A). An evolutionary conserved domain of unknown function, called DUF408, is located at the N terminus of the protein. Conservation drops significantly outside of this region, implying that this domain is required for RPAP2 function. To investigate the function of RPAP2, the protein was Flag tagged (F-RPAP2), transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and immunopurified with an anti-Flag antibody. Proteins recovered in the eluate were then visualized by silver staining and analyzed by\u00a0western blotting (Figure\u00a01B). In agreement with data from large-scale proteomics studies in human and yeast (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007; Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009), RPAP2 strongly interacts with Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II. The presence of the IIa and IIo forms, corresponding to hypo- and hyperphosphorylated CTD, respectively, suggests that RPAP2 associates with transcriptionally active Pol II. A recent genome-wide study placed RPAP2 at the interface between Pol II and regulatory complexes such as Integrator (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). Accordingly, the interaction between RPAP2 and the Int1, Int4, Int5, Int6, and Int7 subunits of the Integrator complex was also confirmed (Figure\u00a01B). Integrator is a macromolecular multisubunit complex that binds to the Pol II CTD and directs 3\u2032 end formation of snRNAs (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005; Ezzeddine et\u00a0al., 2011; Tao et\u00a0al., 2009). Interestingly, the catalytic subunit of the Integrator complex, Int11 (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005), does not coprecipitate with RPAP2, demonstrating that all Integrator subunits are not necessarily present in one complex. To begin deciphering the polypeptide composition of RPAP2-containing complexes, the F-RPAP2 eluate was analyzed by glycerol gradient fractionation (Figure\u00a01C). This analysis revealed that RPAP2 and Rpb1 elute together in a large complex (LC) peaking in fractions 11\u201313, while a significant fraction of F-RPAP2 elutes as a smaller complex (SC), peaking at fractions 4\u20136, devoid of Rpb1 but containing Int4, Int5, Int6, and Int7. RPAP2 in nuclear extract also fractionates into two complexes (Figure\u00a01D). In accordance with the absence of Int11 from the F-RPAP2 eluate, Int11 does not cofractionate with the smaller RPAP2 complex (Figure\u00a01D). The composition of the SC and the LC was determined by mass spectrometry (See Figure\u00a0S1 and Tables S1 and S2, available with this article online). While Pol II subunits were found to be major components of the LC, the SC contains a different set of\u00a0proteins, including members of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, XAB1 and GPN3, previously shown to interact with RPAP2 (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). The presence of the Integrator complex in the SC was confirmed through identification of the DDX26/INT6 subunit, which is consistent with the previously described reciprocal interaction (Malovannaya et\u00a0al., 2010). Together, our data suggest that a large fraction of RPAP2 associates with chaperone/scaffolding proteins and regulatory complexes such as Integrator. However, Pol II subunits were found to be the major proteins to interact with both Integrator complex (Malovannaya et\u00a0al., 2010) and RPAP2 (Figure\u00a0S1), suggesting that a complex containing Pol II, Integrator, and RPAP2 would be transient.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01RPAP2 Exists in Two Distinct Complexes(A) Homologs of RPAP2 from the indicated species are shown on the diagram.

SC, small complexes; LC, large complexes.(D) Fractionation of HeLa cell extract on glycerol gradient. Distribution of endogenous RPAP2 and Int11 was monitored by western blot.See also Figure\u00a0S1.The DUF408 Domain of RPAP2 Is Involved in Establishment of Protein-Protein InteractionsTo identify the region(s) of RPAP2 involved in Pol II and Integrator binding, truncated Flag-tagged RPAP2 proteins were expressed in HeLa cells and immunopurified with an anti-Flag antibody. Interaction with Rpb1 and the Int4 subunit of Integrator complex was then monitored by western blot (Figure\u00a02). The N-terminal region of the protein (1\u2013334) interacts with both Rpb1 and Int4 as efficiently as the full-length RPAP2 (WT), demonstrating that it contains all the elements required for binding. Neither the C\u00a0terminus (335\u2013612) of RPAP2 nor the further truncated N\u00a0terminus (1\u2013167) was efficiently expressed. Deletion of the 57 amino acid-long DUF408 domain completely abolishes the binding of both Pol II and Integrator. Analysis of the primary\u00a0amino acid sequence of the DUF408 domain revealed a cysteine-rich motif reminiscent of a zinc finger. This motif is highly conserved with a particular conservation of four cysteine residues (Figure\u00a01A), which are essential for function of the yeast Rtr1 protein (Gibney et\u00a0al., 2008). We therefore constructed two double point mutations in the cysteine residues within the RPAP2 sequence (M1, C100A-C105A; M2, C136A-C140A). Replacement of either cysteine module completely blocks the interaction with Rpb1 and Int4, suggesting that the putative Zn finger structure is directly involved in establishment of protein-protein interactions.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02The DUF408 Domain of RPAP2 Is Involved in Establishment of Protein-Protein InteractionsThe series of Flag-tagged RPAP2 mutants diagrammed on the left were expressed in HeLa cells. Anti-Flag IPs were analyzed by western blot using antibodies to Pol II, Int4, and Flag (right panel).See also Figure\u00a0S2.Using immunofluorescence, it was determined that, under normal conditions, all F-RPAP2 proteins are mainly cytoplasmic (Figure\u00a0S2). The yeast counterpart of RPAP2, Rtr1, has been shown to constitutively shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Gibney et\u00a0al., 2008). Blocking CRM1-dependent nuclear export with LMB induced a partial relocation of RPAP2, \u0394DUF, M1, and M2 mutant proteins to the nucleus (Figure\u00a0S2), demonstrating that these proteins all shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in a CRM1-dependent manner. Thus, lack of interaction with Pol II and Integrator complex cannot be explained by mislocalization of the mutant proteins.RPAP2 Interacts with Transcribing Pol II Phosphorylated on Ser7RPAP2 is associated with the IIa and IIo forms of Pol II, corresponding to hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated CTD, respectively. In an attempt to further characterize this interaction, the CTD phosphorylation status of RPAP2-associated Pol II was investigated by western blot using antibodies specific to unphosphorylated CTD (8WG16), phospho-Ser2, phospho-Ser5, and phospho-Ser7 (Figure\u00a03A). After equalization of the amount of copurified Pol II in the input, RPAP2 was found to weakly interact with unphosphorylated Pol II, whereas Ser2P and Ser5P are readily detected in the IP, suggesting that RPAP2 interacts with transcriptionally engaged Pol II. Unexpectedly, we found that the major CTD modification of RPAP2-associated Pol II is the Ser7P mark. The function of this CTD modification in expression of mammalian genes remains poorly understood, since so far only a role in expression of snRNA genes has been described (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03RPAP2 Interacts with Ser7-Phosphorylated Pol II(A) Western blot analysis of F-RPAP2 eluate using antibodies directed against the different phosphorylated forms of Pol II. The amount of total Rpb1 (H-224) was equalized to the input. Extract from nontransfected cells was used as a control.(B) ChIP assay was performed using anti-Flag antibody against F-RPAP2 (gray bars). The Ser7P/Pol II profile (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009) is shown as a line. The regions amplified are noted on the diagram of U2 snRNA genes above. Error bars indicate the standard deviation obtained from at least three independent experiments.See also Figure\u00a0S3.To test whether RPAP2 is recruited to snRNA genes during the transcription cycle, we analyzed its association with the U2 snRNA genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibodies to either the Flag epitope at the N terminus (Figure\u00a03B) or three tandem Myc epitopes at the C terminus (Figure\u00a0S3). Transcription from U2 snRNA genes has been extensively characterized (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009). These genes have specialized TATA-less promoters and a snRNA gene-specific RNA 3\u2032 processing element, the 3\u2032 box, located immediately downstream of the snRNA-encoding region (Figure\u00a03B, see diagram). Although transcription extends for up to 1 kb downstream of the start site (Cuello et\u00a0al., 1999), ChIP analysis indicates that RPAP2 is preferentially associated with the promoter (Figure\u00a03B) and RNA-encoding region (Figure\u00a0S3) of U2 snRNA genes. Interestingly, we previously showed that Pol II transcribing U2 snRNA genes is most highly phosphorylated on Ser7 of the CTD early in transcription (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009). These results support the notion that RPAP2 preferentially associates with Ser7-phosphorylated Pol II and further suggests that Ser7P may be a critical determinant for its association with the polymerase machinery.Ser7 of the Pol II CTD Is Required for Interaction with RPAP2 In\u00a0Vivo and In\u00a0VitroTo determine whether RPAP2 requires Ser7 of the CTD to associate with Pol II in\u00a0vivo, we used the CTD complementation system in which mutations are introduced into consensus (Con) CTD repeats in an \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Pol II large subunit (Rpb1) (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2005; Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007; Gerber et\u00a0al., 1995). A\u00a0CTD with 48 consensus repeats ([Con]48) was used for complementation because this properly supports viability (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2005, 2007). The large subunit of endogenous Pol II is turned over within 48\u00a0hr of \u03b1-amanitin addition, as confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure\u00a04A, left panel, no Pol). \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Rpb1 containing the WT, [(Con)48] and [(S7A)48] CTD are easily detected after \u03b1-amanitin treatment (Figure\u00a04A, left panel). Forty-eight hours after addition of \u03b1-amanitin, RPAP2 was immunoprecipitated, and its interaction with \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Pol II was tested by western blot. While the WT and the (Con)48 Pol II are efficiently pulled down, the (S7A)48 Pol II fails to efficiently interact with RPAP2 (Figure\u00a04A, right panel). Importantly, the same amount of F-RPAP2 was recovered after IP (bottom panel). Thus, Pol II lacking Ser7 of the CTD is unable to efficiently associate with RPAP2 in\u00a0vivo, demonstrating that Ser7 is required for this interaction.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Ser7 of the Pol II CTD Is Required for Interaction with RPAP2 In\u00a0Vivo and In\u00a0Vitro(A) F-RPAP2 IP after ectopic expression of \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Rpb1.

The bottom panel represents Coomassie blue staining of the input GST-CTD.(D) The structures of the biotinylated peptides used are shown on the left. Binding of recombinant GST-RPAP2 to the peptide noted above the lane, phosphorylated or not, was monitored by western blot. For the control, beads were incubated with RPAP2 in the absence of peptide.See also Figure\u00a0S4.To determine whether RPAP2 can associate with the CTD in\u00a0vitro, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down analysis with GST-CTD carrying 48 consensus heptapeptide repeats and the F-RPAP2 eluate from Figure\u00a01B. Western blot analysis of the pull-down demonstrates that RPAP2 binds strongly to the CTD only after phosphorylation (Figure\u00a04B). Phosphorylation on Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 is detected after in\u00a0vitro phosphorylation of the CTD (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). Mutation of Ser7 to alanine has a drastic effect on RPAP2 binding, demonstrating that this residue is critical for the interaction (Figure\u00a04C). In contrast, mutation of Ser2 or Ser5 does not affect significantly the binding of RPAP2. These results strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Ser7 is the key determinant for RPAP2 binding. Interestingly, Int4 shows a similar specific requirement for CTD phosphorylation and Ser7 (Figure\u00a0S4), supporting the notion that RPAP2 mediates the interaction between the CTD and this Integrator subunit.N-terminally biotinylated CTD peptides consisting of only two heptapeptide repeats were also tested for their ability to interact with bacterially expressed GST-RPAP2 before and after in\u00a0vitro phosphorylation (Figure\u00a04D). In accordance with the previous results, RPAP2 does not interact with nonphosphorylated peptides. In contrast, recombinant RPAP2 efficiently interacts with an in\u00a0vitro phosphorylated CTD peptide comprising two consensus repeats [(Con)\u00d72], demonstrating that the interaction between RPAP2 and the CTD is direct and that two CTD repeats are sufficient for binding. Importantly, an in\u00a0vitro phosphorylated CTD carrying two repeats with alanine instead of serine at positions 7 [(S7A)\u00d72] does not interact with RPAP2. Together, these results indicate that RPAP2 directly interacts with the phospho-CTD through Ser7.RPAP2 Is Required for Proper Expression of Pol II-Transcribed snRNA GenesWe previously showed that Ser7P is critical for transcription and 3\u2032 end processing of snRNA genes (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). Since Ser7P is required for RPAP2 recruitment to the Pol II machinery and RPAP2 is recruited to snRNA genes, we asked whether RPAP2 participates in snRNA gene expression. The level of RPAP2 was knocked down by RNAi and the effect on expression of the U2 snRNA analyzed by RNase protection (Figure\u00a05A). The efficiency of the knockdown was verified by measuring the level of both RPAP2 mRNA (Figure\u00a05B) and the protein (see Figure\u00a06A). Two main RNase protection products, corresponding to the U2 pre-snRNA and the stable mature U2 snRNA (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007), are detected. A third minor RNA species corresponds to the readthrough product (U2RT) that has escaped 3\u2032 box-directed processing (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2005). The ratio of short-lived pre-U2 to the very stable mature U2 (U2) (Fury and Zieve, 1996), is reduced to approximately 50% when RPAP2 is knocked down (Figure\u00a05A). qRT-PCR analysis of the RNA also indicates that the level of pre-U2 decreases to approximately 40% when RPAP2 is knocked down (Figure\u00a05B). In addition, the ratio of RT to pre-U2 products increases more than 3-fold when RPAP2 is knocked down (Figure\u00a05A), indicating that recognition of the 3\u2032 box is affected, as would be expected if Integrator recruitment is impaired. The Int5 subunit of the Integrator complex is readily detectable across the whole transcribed region of U2 snRNA genes and is enriched at the promoter and 3\u2032 box (Figure\u00a05C). RPAP2 knockdown results in a dramatic reduction of the level of Int5 (Figure\u00a05C), with a drop of up to 80% when related to the level of Pol II (Figure\u00a0S5A). Interestingly, RPAP2 knockdown also affects the recruitment of the catalytic Int11 subunit (Figure\u00a05C and Figure\u00a0S5A), suggesting that recruitment of other Integrator subunits, together with RPAP2, is a prerequisite for Int11 association to snRNA genes. In support of this, Int4 knockdown (Figure\u00a0S5B) affects 3\u2032 processing and reduces Int11 association (Figures S5C and S5E). We conclude that RPAP2 plays an important role in recruiting Integrator to snRNA genes, which readily explains the defect in snRNA 3\u2032 end maturation observed after RPAP2 knockdown (Figure\u00a05A). Knockdown of RPAP2 also reduces transcription of U1 snRNA and U2 snRNA genes to less than 50% (Figure\u00a05D), while transcription of the control Pol III-dependent 5S rRNA gene remains unaffected. This suggests that the drop in steady-state RNA levels when RPAP2 is knocked down\u00a0reflects reduced transcription. Accordingly, Pol\u00a0II occupancy on the U2 snRNA transcription unit is significantly reduced after RPAP2 knockdown (Figure\u00a05E). The effect on transcription may in part be due to the lack of recruitment of Integrator subunits. However, Int4 knockdown rather increases transcription, measured by nuclear run-on and Pol II occupancy (Figure\u00a0S5D), indicating that the transcription defect is due to the loss of Integrator subunits other than Int4 and Int11 or the loss of RPAP2.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05RPAP2 Is Required for Proper Expression of Pol II-Transcribed snRNA Genes(A) RNase protection analysis of transcripts from endogenous U2 snRNA genes in control cells or cells transfected with an siRNA specific for RPAP2 (left panel).

Phosphatase activity of full-length, N-terminal region (N-term), and the mutant N-terminal region (N-term-M1) RPAP2 proteins, using phosphorylated CTD as substrate, was visualized using antibodies directed against Ser5P, Ser2P, and Ser7P.See also Figure\u00a0S6.Taken together, these results demonstrate that RPAP2 is required for efficient transcription of snRNA genes by Pol II. Notably, the effect of RPAP2 knockdown on expression of snRNA genes is similar to that caused by mutating Ser7 of the CTD to alanine (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007).RPAP2 Is a CTD PhosphataseMosley and colleagues have identified the yeast homolog of RPAP2, Rtr1, as a CTD phosphatase (Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009). Since human RPAP2 binds the CTD and affects expression of Pol II-transcribed snRNA genes, we sought to determine whether RPAP2 could also function as a phosphatase. We first analyzed the effect of RPAP2 depletion on CTD phosphorylation by measuring Ser2P, Ser5P, and Ser7P in whole-cell extract after RPAP2 knockdown (Figure\u00a06A). Depletion of RPAP2 using siRNA results in a significant increase in the level of Ser5P but does not affect Ser2P and Ser7P. This result demonstrates that RPAP2 regulates the global level of Ser5P in the cell. Next, we asked whether the Ser5P level was affected on actively transcribing Pol II after RPAP2 knockdown. Since Pol II levels are reduced by RPAP2 knockdown (Figure\u00a05E), the level of Ser5P was related to the level of Pol II (Ser5P/Pol II). After knockdown of RPAP2, the level of Ser5P drastically increases on U2 snRNA genes throughout the whole transcribed region (Figure\u00a06B). This result suggests that RPAP2 dephosphorylates phospho-Ser5 on transcribing Pol\u00a0II. In order to determine whether RPAP2 acts as a CTD phosphatase in\u00a0vitro, we performed a phosphatase assay using recombinant RPAP2 purified from bacteria and GST-CTD that has\u00a0been\u00a0phosphorylated in\u00a0vitro by P-TEFb (see the Experimental\u00a0Procedures). As previously shown (Glover-Cutter et\u00a0al., 2009), P-TEFb exhibits robust CTD phosphorylation activity in\u00a0vitro and phosphorylates Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 (Figure\u00a06C and Figure\u00a0S6). Addition of increasing amounts of recombinant RPAP2 results in the selective removal of Ser5 phosphate, without affecting Ser2 and Ser7 phosphorylation. As a control, the phosphatase assay was also carried out in the presence of a recombinant RPAP2 unable to bind Pol II. As shown in Figure\u00a06D, the N terminus of the protein (1\u2013334), which is still able to bind Pol II in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a02A), dephosphorylates Ser5 of the CTD as efficiently as does the WT protein, demonstrating that the phosphatase activity is carried by the N terminus of the protein. The same protein carrying point mutations in the DUF408 domain that abolish its association with Pol II (M1 protein in the N-terminal context) has no effect on CTD phosphorylation, demonstrating the specificity of the phosphatase assay. These results demonstrate that RPAP2 has Ser5-specific phosphatase activity in\u00a0vitro.Recruitment of RPAP2 to Protein-Coding Genes Does Not Require Ser7 of the CTDAs has been shown in yeast (Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009), we find RPAP2 also associated with protein-coding genes, including the \u03b2-actin gene (Figure\u00a07A). In addition, knockdown of RPAP2 causes a reduction in Pol II levels and a marked increase in the relative level of Ser5 phosphorylation (Figure\u00a07B). These results beg the question, why does mutation of Ser7 of the Pol II CTD specifically affect expression of snRNA genes (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007)? ChIP of Myc-RPAP2 on the U2 snRNA and \u03b2-actin genes after complementation of \u03b1-amanitin-treated cells with either (Con)48 or (S7A)48 Pol II indicates that recruitment of RPAP2 to the U2 snRNA gene is drastically affected by mutation of Ser7 (Figure\u00a07C). In contrast, RPAP2 is still recruited to the \u03b2-actin gene when Ser7 is mutated to alanine (Figure\u00a07C). Thus, it appears that recruitment of RPAP2 to protein-coding genes can occur by a mechanism additional or alternative to interaction with phospho-Ser7 of the Pol II CTD.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07Recruitment of RPAP2 to snRNA Genes through Ser7 Phosphorylation Underpins a Cascade of Events Critical for Proper snRNA Gene Expression(A) qPCR quantitation of ChIP analysis of the \u03b2-actin gene using antibodies to Myc-RPAP2.

RPAP2 associates with the Pol II CTD after Ser7 phosphorylation and tethers a subcomplex of Integrator to snRNA genes. RPAP2 dephosphorylates Ser5P of the CTD, facilitating transcription and the subsequent recruitment of the Int11 catalytic subunit of Integrator.Error bars indicate the standard deviation obtained from at least three independent experiments. DiscussionThe CTD of the largest subunit of Pol II serves as a structural binding platform for nuclear factors which, in return, positively or negatively influence the different steps of Pol II transcription and transcription-coupled RNA processing (Buratowski, 2009). The timely recruitment of transcription/RNA processing factors during the transcription cycle is tied to dynamic phosphorylation\u00a0and dephosphorylation of CTD repeats. Among the three main cotranscriptional phosphorylation events (Ser2/Ser5/Ser7), Ser7P is by far the most obscure. While Ser5P and Ser2P have been described to play key roles in promoter clearance/capping and splicing/elongation, respectively, Ser7P has no clear function in expression of protein-coding genes. So far, the only role for this modification is in expression of the subset of Pol II-transcribed genes encoding snRNAs (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). In this study, we have shown that RPAP2 interacts with the CTD phosphorylated at Ser7 alone, in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. RPAP2 belongs to the RPAP family, a set of proteins occupying key positions in the protein interaction network of the human Pol II machinery (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007). Our results indicate that RPAP2 specifically and directly interacts with the Pol II CTD phosphorylated at Ser7.Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RPAP2 drastically affects expression of snRNA genes, reducing the transcription rate by Pol II and the efficiency of the 3\u2032 end processing step. These defects are similar to the ones observed after mutation of Ser7 of the CTD (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007), suggesting that the loss of RPAP2 may account for the defects observed when Ser7 is mutated. Accordingly, depletion of RPAP2 also causes a consequent loss of the Integrator complex from snRNA genes, as previously shown for Ser7 mutation (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). We confirmed the previously described interaction between RPAP2 and the Int4 and Int6 subunits of the Integrator complex (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007; Malovannaya et\u00a0al., 2010). Unexpectedly, the Int11 subunit, thought to carry the endonuclease activity responsible for the cleavage of the 3\u2032 end of pre-snRNAs (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005), does not stably associate with RPAP2. Importantly, Int11 binding requires Ser2P, which occurs later in the transcription cycle (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009), in addition to Ser7P to efficiently interact with Pol II (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2010), whereas Int4 requires only Ser7P (Figures S4A and S4B). Together, our data suggest that a subcomplex of Integrator, containing at least Int1, Int4, Int5, Int6, and Int7, and possibly Int3, since Jeronimo et\u00a0al. identified an interaction between Int3 and RPAP2 (Jeronimo et\u00a0al., 2007), is loaded onto snRNA genes through RPAP2 and that the catalytic subunit is stably recruited later in the transcription cycle (Figure\u00a07D). This possibility is supported by the finding that Int11 is at its highest level nearest to the 3\u2032 box (Figure\u00a05C and Figure\u00a0S5E).The finding that Ser7 is required for the recruitment of a Ser5P phosphatase also has important implications for Ser7 function during snRNA gene transcription, since it suggests that Ser7P tags Pol II for Ser5 dephosphorylation. Accordingly, the Ser5P level drops significantly downstream of the peak of Ser7P on snRNA genes (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2009). In yeast, abrogation of the two Ser5 phosphatase activities, Rtr1 and Ssu72, causes\u00a0a transcription defect (Gibney et\u00a0al., 2008; Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009; Reyes-Reyes and Hampsey, 2007). The defect in transcription of snRNA genes caused by RPAP2 knockdown may therefore be, at least in part, due to the failure to dephosphorylate Ser5. Ser5 hyperphosphorylation induced by the loss of Ser5 phosphatases has been proposed to either reduce the rate of transcription reinitiation by Pol II, or result in persistent association of the capping enzyme (Reyes-Reyes and Hampsey, 2007), which has been reported to repress transcription (Myers et\u00a0al., 2002). In addition, early Ser5 dephosphorylation might be\u00a0a prerequisite for further association of elongation/processing factors, as suggested by our previous observation that Ser5P has a negative impact on Int11 recruitment to the CTD (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2010). Thus, failure to dephosphorylate Ser5 may also contribute to the failure to efficiently 3\u2032 process snRNA gene transcripts.Based on these results, we propose a model in which recruitment of RPAP2 to snRNA genes through CTD Ser7 phosphorylation underpins a cascade of events critical for proper gene expression (Figure\u00a07D). Recruitment of RPAP2 results both in stable association of Integrator with snRNA genes and removal of Ser5P, generating the characteristic pattern of CTD phosphorylation found on actively transcribed snRNA genes.Interestingly, this cascade appears to be specific for snRNA genes, as RPAP2 recruitment to a protein-coding gene is not affected by mutation of Ser7. RPAP2 recruitment to protein-coding genes must therefore involve either additional or entirely\u00a0different interactions, perhaps reflecting the increased complexity of the transcription apparatus involved in expression of these generally more complex genes.Finally, we identified the DUF408 domain of RPAP2 as\u00a0a CTD-interacting domain (CID), raising the possibility that other DUF408-containing proteins may also recognize Ser7P of the Pol II CTD. So far, the DUF408 domain has only been reported to support the phosphatase activity of the yeast Rtr1 protein (Mosley et\u00a0al., 2009). Our results raise the possibility that the lack of phosphatase activity of the resulting protein could be due to its inability to properly associate with its substrate. Additional studies will therefore be required to precisely map the phosphatase domain and the CID of the human RPAP2. Experimental ProceduresExpression ConstructsTo generate pFLAG-RPAP2, RPAP2 cDNA was inserted between HindIII and\u00a0BamHI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). pFLAG(1\u2013334), pFLAG(\u0394DUF), pFLAG(M1), and pFLAG(M2) expression plasmids were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using pFLAG-RPAP2 as template. To make Myc-RPAP2, three tandem Myc epitopes were cloned at the C terminus of the RPAP2-coding region in pCDNA. The level of F-RPAP2 and Myc-RPAP2 relative to endogenous RPAP2 was determined by western blot analysis (Figure\u00a0S3B). To make GST-RPAP2, the coding region of RPAP2 was cloned into pGEX-6P-1. Six histidines were added to the 3\u2032 end of the GST-RPAP2 by PCR. The identity of all plasmid constructs was verified by sequence analysis.ImmunoprecipitationHeLa cells were washed in TBS buffer (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 40\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]), resuspended in 500\u00a0ml of NET-2 buffer (200\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]), and sonicated. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation, and supernatant was incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma). After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed six times with NET-2 buffer. Associated proteins were eluted using Flag Peptide (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or silver staining.Chromatin ImmunoprecipitationHeLa or 293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) before being subjected to ChIP analysis (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2005). ChIP samples were analyzed by qPCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR (QIAGEN). Regions analyzed are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Error bars indicate the standard deviation from at least three independent experiments. Difference in ChIP profile between the profiles obtained using either the Flag or Myc epitopes may be due to differences in detection or cell lines.Nuclear Run-On AnalysisNuclear run-on analysis was carried out as previously described (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2003). For analysis of endogenous U2 snRNA genes, two contiguous 80-mer oligos complementary to the region 208\u2013367 of the U2 snRNA gene sequence (Accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U57614\",\"term_id\":\"1373285\"}}U57614) were used, taking the first base pair of the U2 snRNA coding region as 1. For analysis of the U1 snRNA genes, two 80-mer oligos complementary to the region 5\u2013164 of the U1 snRNA coding region were used, and for 5S RNA gene, one 80-mer oligo complementary to the region 32\u2013112 of the 5S RNA was used. U1prom, which is complementary to nucleotides \u221292 to \u221213 of the U1 snRNA gene sequence, and U2prom, which is complementary to nucleotides \u2212268 to \u2212189, were used as negative controls. Hybridization signals were quantified by phosphorimager, corrected with background level, and related to the level of 5S RNA.siRNA-Mediated KnockdownsiRNAs targeting RPAP2 were purchased from Dharmacon and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot AnalysisWestern blotting was carried out as described previously (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2003) using antibodies against Rpb1 (H-224, Santa Cruz), CTD Ser2P, Ser5P, Ser7P (Chapman et\u00a0al., 2007), Int4 (Bethyl laboratories), Int11 (Dominski et\u00a0al., 2005), Flag (M2, Sigma), RPAP2 (17401-1-AP, Proteintech), Myc epitope (sc-764X, Santa Cruz), and actin (sc-1615, Santa Cruz).CTD Complementation Assay293 cells were transfected with \u03b1-amanitin-resistant Rpb1 constructs (WT, Con48, or Ser7A48), and endogenous Rpb1 was turned over by the addition of \u03b1-amanitin (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2003). ChIP was carried out 48\u00a0hr after the addition of \u03b1-amanitin.RT-PCR AnalysisQuantitative RT-PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from WT or RPAP2-depleted HeLa cells. Total RNA (2\u00a0\u03bcg) was reverse transcribed with random hexamers. U2 pre-snRNA and RPAP2 mRNA were quantitated by real-time PCR analysis using specific primers (primers amplify the region\u00a0+61/+206 of the U2 gene [accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"U57614\",\"term_id\":\"1373285\"}}U57614], and\u00a0+91/+224 of the RPAP2 gene [accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_024813\",\"term_id\":\"1519311419\"}}NM_024813]). The results were corrected to the level of 7SK snRNA (primers amplify\u00a0+11/+190 [accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NR_001445\",\"term_id\":\"221219022\"}}NR_001445]). Error bars indicate the range of values from three independent experiments.RNase ProtectionsRNase protection experiments and the U2 riboprobe used in this study have been described previously (Medlin et\u00a0al., 2003).Glycerol Gradient FractionationEluate from Flag-IP or HeLa cell extract (in 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 200\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 1\u00a0mM PMSF) were loaded onto a 5%\u201345% glycerol gradient, ultracentrifuged for 14\u00a0hr at 41000\u00a0rpm in a SW41 rotor, and fractionated into 0.5\u00a0ml fractions.CTD Binding AnalysisIn\u00a0vitro phosphorylation of the GST-CTDs and GST-CTD pull-downs were performed as described previously (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007). For the CTD peptide binding assay, CTD peptides were synthesized (Cambridge Peptides) with two repeats of YSPTSPS or YSPTSPA and amino-terminal biotinylation. Streptavidin-coated Sepharose beads (20\u00a0\u03bcl) were resuspended in 0.1\u00a0M KCl HEGN, mixed with 10\u00a0\u03bcg of biotinylated peptides, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr. After washing four times with 0.1\u00a0M KCl HEGN, 1\u00a0\u03bcg of recombinant RPAP2 protein was added and the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 3\u00a0hr. After washing the beads five times with 1\u00a0ml of 0.3\u00a0M KCl HEGN, protein-bound beads were boiled and loaded directly on SDS-PAGE gels.Phosphatase AssayEndogenous P-TEFb was purified from G3H cells stably expressing HA-CyclinT1 (Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2001) and was subsequently used for kinase reactions. Briefly, GST-CTD (Egloff et\u00a0al., 2007) was incubated with purified P-TEFb for 1\u00a0hr at 30\u00b0C in kinase buffer (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 40\u00a0mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.6], 10\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM DTT, and 500\u00a0\u03bcM ATP). Kinase reactions were stopped by removal of the unincorporated ATP through a Bio-Spin 6 Tris column (Biorad). Phosphorylated CTD was then incubated with recombinant RPAP2 protein in phosphatase buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.5], 10\u00a0mM MgCl2, 20mM KCl, and 5\u00a0mM dithiothreitol) for 1\u00a0hr. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer.
