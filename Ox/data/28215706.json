Factors that affect transcription and mRNA splicing, including DNA damaging agents, can thus have a dramatic effect on gene expression and cell viability. Indeed, bulky DNA lesions such as those generated by UV irradiation trigger rapid shutdown of RNA synthesis (Mayne and Lehmann, 1982, Rockx et\u00a0al., 2000). They also elicit transcription-coupled repair (Gaillard and Aguilera, 2013), and, as a last resort, ubiquitylation and degradation of damage-stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2013).Although both transcriptional initiation and elongation are affected by UV irradiation (Rockx et\u00a0al., 2000, Proietti-De-Santis et\u00a0al., 2006, Andrade-Lima et\u00a0al., 2015), the extent, mechanism and functional consequence of the changes occurring in these processes remain poorly understood. UV irradiation induces global changes to RNAPII phosphorylation (Rockx et\u00a0al., 2000), altered binding of TATA-binding protein to DNA (Vichi et\u00a0al., 1997), and modifications to chromatin (Adam et\u00a0al., 2013, Dinant et\u00a0al., 2013), underscoring the complexity of the transcription-related DNA damage response. Moreover, transcription-repair coupling factor Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) is required not only for DNA repair, but also for transcription restart after DNA damage (Proietti-De-Santis et\u00a0al., 2006).The vast majority of RNAPII genes have the potential to be expressed as multiple mRNA isoforms, creating vast regulatory potential (Pan et\u00a0al., 2008, Wang et\u00a0al., 2008). Indeed, changes in alternative isoform expression can regulate the physiological response of cells to stress or other signals. Importantly, processing of nascent pre-mRNA occurs co-transcriptionally, so that mRNA capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 end formation are greatly influenced by the dynamics of elongation (de la Mata et\u00a0al., 2003, Ip et\u00a0al., 2011, Pinto et\u00a0al., 2011, Fong et\u00a0al., 2014). A general kinetic model has hence emerged wherein the rate of elongation governs RNA processing (de la Mata et\u00a0al., 2003, Mu\u00f1oz et\u00a0al., 2009, Pinto et\u00a0al., 2011).To better understand the effect of UV irradiation on gene expression, we examined nascent transcription and transcript isoform expression on a genome-wide level. We hereby uncovered evidence that UV-induced alternative last exon (ALE) splicing is important for the DNA damage response, with long and short ASCC3 ALE isoforms having opposite effects on transcription recovery after DNA damage. We also show that the short ASCC3 isoform regulates transcription recovery in a manner that is dependent on the non-coding RNA rather than the encoded protein. ResultsTranscript Elongation Rates Are Reduced Immediately after UV IrradiationTo investigate the effect of UV irradiation on transcription genome-wide, we employed 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole/global run-on sequencing (DRB/GRO-seq), which allows measurement of nascent RNA synthesis at a high temporal and spatial resolution (Saponaro et\u00a0al., 2014). Cells were first treated with the transcription elongation inhibitor DRB to restrict RNAPII to the promoter-proximal areas (first \u223c600\u00a0bp of genes). Cells were then UV-irradiated, followed by inhibitor removal to allow synchronized transcription and its genome-wide measurement by GRO-seq (Figure\u00a01A). Results from the PPP1R12A gene are shown as an example (Figure\u00a01B). In untreated cells, RNAPII progressed \u223c12 kb into the gene 10\u00a0min after DRB removal and to \u223c38 kb and \u223c74 kb after 25 and 40\u00a0min, respectively. These results mirror previously published data (Saponaro et\u00a0al., 2014), but were in striking contrast to those obtained when cells were UV-irradiated before DRB removal. Here, the position of the RNAPII \u201cwave-front\u201d was similar to that of untreated cells after 10\u00a0min. However, a dramatic reduction in RNAPII progress was observed 25 and 40\u00a0min after UV exposure, with the wave-fronts in the PPP1R12A gene moving only very slightly further forward, reaching \u223c15 and \u223c20 kb at these time points (Figure\u00a01B). We note that little change was observed at the promoter at these times. DRB/GRO-seq only captures the activity of RNAPII molecules that incorporate 5-bromouridine-5\u2032-triphosphate (Br-UTP) during the short run-on pulse (5\u00a0min). This suggests that initiation and transcript elongation in the promoter-proximal areas still occurred, while progress further into genes was very slow or prohibited.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01UV Irradiation Triggers Transcript Elongation Slow-Down(A) Schematic of UV/DRB/GRO-seq.(B) Profile of nascent PPP1R12A RNA reads after DRB-release \u00b1 UV irradiation (15 J/m2 used throughout this study).

In untreated conditions, the wave-front progressed to a median distance of 12.5 kb after 10\u00a0min and to 39 kb and 64.8 kb after 25\u00a0min and 40\u00a0min, respectively (Figure\u00a01D, upper; indicated by dashed lines). This corresponds to average elongation rates of 1.77 kb/min (10\u201325\u00a0min) and 1.72 kb/min (25\u201340\u00a0min). In contrast, in UV-treated cells (Figure\u00a01D, lower), the wave-fronts were at 10.3 kb (10\u00a0min), 17.3 kb (25\u00a0min), and 21.0 kb (40\u00a0min), respectively (Figure\u00a01D, lower), giving rise to average elongation rates of only 0.47 kb/min (10\u201325\u00a0min) and 0.25 kb/min (25\u201340\u00a0min) (see also Figures S1A and S1B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a0S1Transcription Wave-Front and Elongation Rates, Related to Figure\u00a01(A) Elongation rate (kb/min) calculated for 333 long genes for the indicated time intervals in untreated and UV-treated cells.

To analyze transcription restart genome-wide, we therefore performed GRO-seq experiments with cells that were again UV-irradiated at 15 J/m2, followed by recovery (Figures 1E and \u200bandS1C).S1C). This dose of UV did not lead to significant cell death over the 24-hr time course (data not shown). As expected, the distribution of active RNAPII in untreated cells was characterized by a large peak in the promoter-proximal region, followed by a marked reduction in signal further downstream (black graph). Transcription was not synchronized with DRB, so this density pattern represents the distribution of RNAPII expected for actively transcribed genes at steady state. In response to UV irradiation (2\u00a0hr time point), there was a clear reduction in the promoter-proximal peak (see arrowheads in Figure\u00a01E), suggesting either a reduction in transcription initiation or increased promoter clearance (Ehrensberger et\u00a0al., 2013). Interestingly, the GRO-seq signal increased in the region up to \u223c20 kb from the transcription start site (TSS) (Figure\u00a01E, yellow shaded region), concomitant with depletion further downstream (Figures 1E, gray shaded region, and \u200band1F).1F). This suggests that while transcription initiation may be inhibited, considerable elongation activity is observed in the beginning of genes (possibly reflecting increased promoter release), and activity is dramatically reduced in regions further downstream.As expected, RNA synthesis gradually normalized to that observed in untreated cells over the 24-hr period, with eventual restoration of activity at the 3\u2032 end of genes (Figures 1E and 1F). Interestingly, wave-front calling of a subset of very long genes indicated a rate of transcript elongation of only \u223c40 bases/min on average from 2 to 12\u00a0hr following UV irradiation, more than 40-fold slower than in untreated cells (Figures S1D and S1E). Mathematically determined, median transcription \u201cwave-fronts\u201d independently confirmed these results (Figure\u00a0S1F).Taken together, these data suggest that UV irradiation causes a rapid and dramatic reduction in transcript elongation, and even upon recovery of nascent RNA synthesis several hours after UV exposure, elongation continues to be much slower than in untreated cells. Most importantly, transcription is spatially restricted for long periods, with the promoter-proximal 20\u201325\u00a0kb showing much more activity than the areas further downstream.UV-Induced Alternative Isoform ExpressionConsidering the dramatic change in transcript elongation and knowing that mRNA processing is tightly coupled to elongation, we now investigated the effect of UV irradiation on mRNA splicing by next generation sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from mRNA. The relative expression of transcript isoforms was quantitatively measured using the mixture of isoform (MISO) model (Katz et\u00a0al., 2010). In total, we identified 435 splicing events in 298 genes that were affected either 8 or 24\u00a0hr after UV irradiation in both biological replicates (Figure\u00a02A; Table S1).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Splicing Analysis Reveals Frequent UV-Induced Alternative Last Exon Splicing(A) UV-induced splicing events.(B) Relative expression of terminal exons associated with UV-induced ALE splicing events.

Data for (D) and others like it in the following figures are mean \u00b1 SEM, t test, \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001 and \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.See also Figures S2 and \u200bandS3S3 and Tables S1, S2, and S3.Previous reports uncovered examples of increased inclusion of cassette exons under conditions of attenuated elongation (de la Mata et\u00a0al., 2003, Mu\u00f1oz et\u00a0al., 2009, Fong et\u00a0al., 2014). Our analysis of 131\u00a0UV-induced exon skipping/inclusion events shows only a slight bias (63% of events) for increased exon inclusion after UV irradiation (data not shown).Interestingly, alternative last exon (ALE) splicing was the most frequent UV-induced event (Figure\u00a02A; Table S2), accounting for more than a third of all those recorded: 156 ALE splicing events in 105 genes. ALE transcript isoforms are characterized by different 3\u2032 terminal exons and therefore inherently have different poly-A sites. Importantly, a marked bias for expression of shorter transcript isoforms (induced ALE transcript isoforms that have terminal exons more proximal to the TSS) was observed following UV irradiation (Figure\u00a02B), with 78% of ALE events (121 of 156) resulting in increased expression of such shorter isoforms (hereafter referred to as \u201cALE short\u201d events). The majority of these (71/121) involved alternative splicing of unique terminal exons, indicating they were not solely a result of premature termination (Figure\u00a0S2A). Only 35 events were characterized by increased expression of alternative longer isoforms, from 22 genes (Figure\u00a02B, \u201cALE long\u201d events).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a0S2UV-Induced ALE Short Events Reduce Transcript Length and Correlate with Nascent RNA Synthesis Compared to Background Events, Related to Figure\u00a02(A) Diagram showing UV-induced alternative last exon splicing and premature termination. Normal, fast elongation favors the skipping of the red exon along with its associated poly-A signal, leading to preferential production of the long isoform. Slower elongation favors splicing of the red exon leading to utilization of the associated poly-A signal and expression of the short isoform. (B) Illustration depicts the variables used for the equation for relative change in isoform length ((b-a)/b). Plot of relative change in isoform length for ALE short events (blue line) (n\u00a0= 121) compared to non-UV regulated background events (n\u00a0= 7736) (red line) shows UV-regulated events are characterized by a statistically significant greater difference in short and long isoform length compared to events that were not effected by UV.

Data are box and whisker (min to max), with median indicated. (F) No increase of short over long isoforms was observed for \u2018background\u2019 ALE events that were unaffected by UV treatment. The ratio of short isoform (TSS proximal) to long isoform (TSS distal) terminal exon expression at the indicated times following UV treatment normalized to untreated is shown for background events not regulated by UV (n\u00a0= 7736) (non-hits, gray boxes) and for UV-induced ALE short events (n\u00a0= 121) (hits, black boxes). Data are box and whisker (min to max) with median indicated. Mann Whitney test, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.The relative exon expression of the isoforms for two genes, HERC4 and INTS6, is described in Figure\u00a02C. The long HERC4 pre-mRNA isoform contains 25 exons and is 153 kb, while the short HERC4 pre-mRNA is 6.3 kb, shares the first three exons with the long isoform, but contains a fourth, unique terminal exon (Figure\u00a02C, left, lower). Eight hours after UV irradiation, exons 1\u20134 (indicated by the red dashed boxes) were induced (Figure\u00a02C, left). In contrast, expression of exons 5\u201326 (specific for the long isoform) was reduced, but recovered to near-normal levels after 24\u00a0hr. A similar pattern of alternative exon expression was seen at the INTS6 gene and a large number of other genes (Figure\u00a02C, right, and data not shown). qRT-PCR confirmed the increased expression of the short isoforms and concomitant lower expression of the long isoforms 8\u00a0hr after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a02D).The short RNA isoforms of HERC4 and INTS6 were much shorter than their long isoforms. More generally, the median length of the UV-suppressed long pre-mRNA isoforms was \u223c109 kb, considerably longer than that of all human genes (23\u00a0kb), whereas that of the UV-induced short isoforms was only \u223c32 kb. This reduction in pre-mRNA length for UV-induced ALE short events was significantly greater than expected by chance (Figure\u00a0S2B), indicating a general trend for switching from particularly long isoforms to much shorter isoforms upon UV exposure. In contrast, the median length of the less common UV-induced long ALE isoforms was \u223c30 kb, only 9 kb longer than the median length of their corresponding, UV-suppressed short isoform (Figure\u00a02E).ALE Events Are Associated with Changes in RNAPII Elongation and Nascent RNA SynthesisBecause transcript elongation was attenuated after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a01), we hypothesized that the UV-induced ALE short events resulted from preferential synthesis of the pre-mRNA producing them. Indeed, after UV-irradiation, GRO-seq read depth at HERC4 increased over the region coding for the short isoform (Figure\u00a02F, inset), whereas synthesis in the rest of the gene was markedly suppressed. Nascent RNA synthesis across the entire gene recovered to untreated levels 24\u00a0hr after UV exposure, correlating with the kinetics of the HERC4 ALE splicing event. Consistent with a causative effect, the GRO-seq signal corresponding to the long isoform also remained suppressed at 24\u00a0hr for a gene in which preferential expression of the short isoform was detected not only at 8 but also 24\u00a0hr after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a0S2C).By comparing GRO-seq signals across proximal and distal terminal exons, a general, transient increase in the ratio of short to long transcript isoform expression was observed, peaking 8\u201312\u00a0hr after UV (Figure\u00a02G). This increase correlated with a greater reduction in the synthesis of distal than of proximal exons and was specific for UV-induced ALE events (Figures S2D\u2013S2F).Together, the results presented so far indicate that UV irradiation results in a dramatic change in transcription, with elongation slowing down and RNAPII-mediated RNA synthesis being \u201crestricted\u201d to the 5\u2032 end of genes. This gene-spatial restriction of transcription is associated with, or indeed causes, the preferential expression of short transcript isoforms incorporating alternative last exons.ASCC3 Short Isoform Is Preferentially Synthesized in Response to UVWe now investigated whether the preferential expression of short ALE isoforms in response to UV irradiation is physiologically important. Gene ontology analysis of the 84 genes that undergo UV-induced ALE short isoform switching revealed that many of them are involved in transcription (Figure\u00a0S3). We also cross-referenced the genes with a recently compiled database of factors that function in\u00a0the transcription-related DNA damage response (Boeing et\u00a0al., 2016). Interestingly, genes with short ALE events were enriched among the highest scoring genes in this database (p\u00a0= 0.0077; Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test), with 28 of the 84 genes being among the 15% highest scorers (Table S3). Among these factors, ASCC3 stood out: it had the highest score in the multi-omic screening approach (Boeing et\u00a0al., 2016).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a0S3Gene Ontology Analysis of ALE Short Genes, Related to Figure\u00a02Gene ontology of ALE short genes reveals a significant enrichment in genes involved in transcription and transcription regulation.The pre-mRNA giving rise to the long ASCC3 isoform is 373.5\u00a0kb and composed of 42 exons (Figure\u00a03A). The short ASCC3 isoform is 25 kb in length and shares the first three exons with the long isoform, followed by a unique terminal exon (Figure\u00a03A, last exon indicated by the red arrows). Exon expression for both isoforms was reduced 8\u00a0hr after UV treatment. However, 24\u00a0hr after UV treatment, expression of the exons of the short isoform increased while those specific for the long isoform remained repressed (Figure\u00a03A). This result was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure\u00a03B). Expression of the long isoform recovered by 48\u00a0hr after UV treatment. Exposure of cells to cisplatin and camptothecin, but not MMS or ionizing radiation, also resulted in preferential expression of the short ASCC3 isoform, indicating that this is a general response to agents inducing bulky DNA lesions (Figure\u00a03C).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Bulky DNA Lesions Induce ASCC3 Alternative Last Exon Switching(A) ASCC3 exon expression profiles, as in Figure\u00a02C.(B) qRT-PCR validation of the isoform switch 24\u00a0hr after UV irradiation.

Indeed, recovery of nascent RNA synthesis was only observed over the first half of ASCC3 24\u00a0hr after UV treatment. More importantly, however, RNA synthesis across the relevant first 25\u00a0kb of the ASCC3 gene was induced at\u00a024\u00a0hr (Figure\u00a03D, inset; see also \u200balso3E).\u00a0The3E).\u00a0The transcription characteristics at ASCC3 thus again correlated with ALE switching and preferential production of\u00a0the short ASCC3 isoform after UV irradiation.ASCC3 Protein Affects Transcription after UV IrradiationAs expected from the results above, nascent RNA synthesis rapidly decreased after UV exposure as indicated by significantly reduced incorporation of ethynyluridine (EU) into nascent RNA, followed by a slow recovery (Figure\u00a0S4A). In the multi-omic screening approach, we screened for nascent transcription using the EU incorporation assay to identify genes whose small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown affect transcription 20\u00a0hr after UV irradiation (Boeing et\u00a0al., 2016). Intriguingly, two distinct siRNA pools targeting ASCC3 scored in this screen; one resulted in high transcription while the other resulted in low transcription levels after UV irradiation. Gratifyingly, the distinct siRNA pools targeted different ASCC3 ALE isoforms (Figures 4A and 4B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04ASCC3 Long Isoform Knockdown Increases Global Transcription after UV Irradiation(A) ASCC3 isoforms and siRNA-targeting regions.

Knockdown with this pool resulted in high transcription levels after UV irradiation, as indicated by a reduced percentage of lowly transcribing cells and an overall increase in EU incorporation signified by a shift of the histogram to the right (Figures 4C and 4D, left histogram). ASCC3 is a component of the poorly studied activating signal co-integrator 1 complex (Jung et\u00a0al., 2002). ASCC3 was also identified in a screen for genes affecting infection of West Nile virus in interferon (IFN)-\u03b2-treated human cells, with silencing of ASCC3 resulting in upregulation of certain interferon-stimulated genes (Li et\u00a0al., 2013). However, a role for ASCC3 as a global suppressor of transcription is both unexpected and exciting. Tellingly, siRNAs targeting two other members of the ASCC complex, ASCC1 and ASCC2, also resulted in increased nascent transcription after UV irradiation (Figures 4B and 4D, center and right histogram), suggesting that the ASCC complex functions as an entity to keep transcription repressed after DNA damage. Moreover, two individual ASCC3 siRNAs, as well as stable shRNA expression targeting the long isoform increased transcription 20\u00a0hr after DNA damage, but did not affect transcription in untreated cells, or the immediate transcription shutdown observed 2\u00a0hr after UV irradiation (Figures 4E, \u200bE,S4B,S4B, top panel, and \u200bandS4C).S4C). The differential effect at 2 and 20\u00a0hr is important, as it shows that transcription is suppressed in two distinct ways during UV-induced DNA damage, namely rapid ASCC3-independent transcriptional repression, followed by continued ASCC3-dependent suppression in the later stages of the DNA damage response. To measure the effect of ASCC3 knockdown at 20\u00a0hr quantitatively, we calculated the proportion of cells that fail to recover transcription relative to the proportion of cells that have high levels of transcription after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a04E, lower panel, populations to the left of the stippled black line and right of the gray line, respectively). In response to UV exposure, knockdown of the long isoform of ASCC3 significantly reduced this low/high transcription ratio (Figure\u00a04F). We conclude that the ASCC3 protein, in the context of the ASCC complex, suppresses transcription specifically in the late stages of the cellular response to UV irradiation.The Short ASCC3 RNA Isoform Is Required to Recover Transcription after UV IrradiationIn marked contrast to siRNA pool-1, ASCC3 siRNA pool-2 dramatically reduced transcription after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a04B). Two of the four siRNAs in pool-2 specifically target sequences unique to the terminal exon of the short alternative transcript isoform (Figure\u00a04A, dark blue box), reducing short isoform transcript levels 79% and 82%, respectively (Figure\u00a0S4B, lower panel). Knockdown with these siRNAs neither affected transcription in untreated cells, nor did it affect global transcription shutdown immediately after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a05A, top and middle panels). However, in a manner similar to knockdown of Cockayne syndrome B (Figures S4D and S4E), knockdown of ASCC3 short isoform inhibited transcription recovery, as indicated by a marked general change in the characteristics of nascent transcription across the cell population (Figure\u00a05A, 20\u00a0hr panel), and consequently an increase in the ratio of lowly to highly transcribing cells after UV irradiation (Figure\u00a05B). Furthermore, knockdown of ASCC3 resulted in increased sensitivity to UV-irradiation (Figure\u00a05C). This indicates that UV-induced expression of the short ASCC3 ALE isoform is indeed physiologically important, in all likelihood because this isoform is required for transcription to recover after UV irradiation.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05Cells Deficient for the Short ASCC3 Isoform Cannot Recover Transcription after UV Irradiation(A) As in Figure\u00a04E, but after knockdown of the short ASCC3 isoform with individual siRNAs (light and dark blue).(B) As in Figure\u00a04F, but after knockdown of short isoform.

As expected, these knockout cells, hereafter abbreviated \u201cshort knockout cells,\u201d also showed a defect in transcription recovery in response to UV (Figures 5F and 5G).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a0S5Deficiency in ASCC3 Short Isoform Does Not Affect ASCC3 Long Isoform Expression and Vice Versa, Related to Figure\u00a05(A) ASCC3 short isoform knockout cells that were left untreated or UV treated (15 J/m2) followed by 20\u00a0hr recovery were analyzed for long isoform expression by RT-qPCR.

Expression of ASCC3 protein is unaffected by short isoform knockout.Antagonistic Regulation by the Short and Long ASCC3 IsoformsIn the analysis above, we focused entirely on nascent RNAPII transcription. To further characterize the role of the ASCC3 isoforms in transcription after UV irradiation, we now used Illumina BeadArrays to compare their effect on stable mRNA expression 20\u00a0hr after UV irradiation. Compared to UV-treated control cells, 108 genes were differentially expressed in short knockout cells at this time-point, the majority of which (73%, 79/108) were downregulated (Figure\u00a06A; Table S4). In contrast, 170 genes were differentially regulated in cells deficient for ASCC3 long isoform (long knockdown cell), of which 64% (107 genes) were upregulated. Interestingly, many of the genes that were downregulated in short knockout cells were upregulated in long knockdown cells (Figure\u00a06A; p value\u00a0< 10\u22125, hypergeometric test on differentially regulated probes). qRT-PCR analysis of two such genes, IL7R and VEGFC, is shown in Figure\u00a06B.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06Numerous UV-Regulated Genes Are Antagonistically Regulated by the Long and Short ASCC3 Isoforms(A) Hierarchical clustering of genes downregulated in UV-treated ASCC3 short knockout cells, shown alongside expression of the same genes in UV-treated ASCC3 Long knockdown cells, relative to expression in control cells.

C, siNT control; P, parental control.See also Figure\u00a0S6 and Table S4.We also noticed that a subset of the genes that were most markedly affected by ASCC3 were in fact greatly induced 20\u00a0hr after UV irradiation in control cells. Indeed, the increased expression of five such genes was largely eliminated in short knockout cells (Figure\u00a06C, upper panels). Strikingly, all of these genes were \u201cover-induced\u201d in long knockdown cells (Figure\u00a06C lower panels), again pointing to opposite regulatory effects of the long and short ASCC3 RNA isoforms.The results presented so far suggest that the long and short ASCC3 isoform are functionally antagonistic: the ASCC complex (of which ASCC3 is a component) maintains transcriptional repression after DNA damage, while the short ASCC3 isoform seems to de-repress it. This raised the intriguing possibility that transcription defect observed in ASCC3 short knockout cells might be rescued by depleting the long isoform. Strikingly, knockdown of the long ASCC3 isoform (Figure\u00a06D), or ASCC2 (Figure\u00a0S6), did indeed rescue the expression of several genes in short knockout cells following UV irradiation. Moreover, it also rescued the defect in global, nascent transcription recovery after UV irradiation, with the high proportion of lowly transcribing cells observed upon short ASCC3 knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) returning to more normal levels when the long isoform was also depleted (Figure\u00a06E). Importantly, knockdown of the long isoform did not affect expression of the short RNA isoform and vice versa (Figures S5A and S5B), showing that simple regulation of each other\u2019s expression cannot underlie the antagonistic effects observed.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a0S6Rescue of Transcription in UV-Treated ASCC3 Short Isoform Knockout Cells by Knockdown of ASCC2, Related to Figure\u00a06ASCC3 short isoform knockout cells (clone 2) and parental cells (WT) were transfected with NT or ASCC2-targeting siRNA and incubated for 48\u00a0hr prior to exposure with UV (15 J/m2). Expression of IFIT2, IFI44 and IL7R was analyzed by RT-qPCR 20\u00a0hr after UV treatment. Data are GAPDH normalized and relative to UV-treated NT siRNA transfected parental cells, mean -/+ SEM. Note that the NT siRNA transfected samples are the same as those shown in Figure\u00a06E. t test, \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.Together, these results support the idea that the long and short ASCC3 isoforms have opposing regulatory roles in transcription, affecting both global nascent transcription and stable mRNA expression of several individual genes in opposite directions.ASCC3 Short Isoform Functions as a Non-coding RNAThe UV-induced short mRNA isoform contains a 333 nt coding sequence (CDS), the protein product of which is only 13\u00a0kDa and lacks known functional domains (see Figure\u00a04A). Frustratingly, ectopic expression of this CDS failed to suppress the low transcription phenotype of short knockdown cells (Figures S7A and S7B). Repeated, unsuccessful attempts prompted us to consider the possibility that it might not be the protein-coding function of the short isoform that is important. Interestingly, in addition to the 333 nt CDS, the endogenous ASCC3 short isoform transcript also contains a 2.8 kb 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR), which is unique to this isoform (Figure\u00a04A). To test the hypothesis that the function of the ASCC3 short mRNA isoform required the non-coding 3\u2032 RNA sequence, we again expressed ASCC3 short isoform, this time including the 3\u2032 sequence, which does not itself contain open reading frames (ORFs) of significant length. Importantly, the 13\u00a0kDa encoded protein was expressed to similar levels irrespective of inclusion of the 3\u2032-UTR in the transcript (Figure\u00a0S7B). Remarkably, however, in contrast to the CDS alone, the transcript containing the 3\u2032-UTR suppressed the low transcription phenotype (Figures 7A and 7B).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07The Short ASCC3 Isoform Is a Chromatin-Associated lncRNA(A and B) Histogram (A) and low/high transcription ratio plot (B), showing the effect on transcription of expressing different siRNA-resistant RNAs in ASCC3 short isoform knockdown cells.

Ectopically expressed short isoform was pulled down by both Flag and ASCC3 N-terminal antibodies (lanes 5 and 6) however short isoform protein was not detected in ASCC3 N-terminal antibody pull downs from untransfected cells under both untreated and UV-treated conditions (lanes 7 and 8). IP of ASCC3 long isoform is shown as a positive control for efficient N-terminal antibody pull down. ASCC3 short isoform was not detected in input samples. (D) RNA scope In situ hybridization followed by Fast Red staining using probes targeting the ASCC3 short isoform, in untreated cells and UV-treated cells after 18\u00a0hr recovery. The nucleus was counterstained with DAPI. The primarily punctate nuclear localization of ASCC3 was not significantly affected by UV treatment over several independent experiments. (E) RNA scope In situ hybridization in short isoform knockout cells with short and long isoform-targeting probes shows specific loss of short isoform signal but not long isoform signal confirming the short isoform probe signal was indeed specific for the short isoform of ASCC3. (F) LncRNA Malat-1 is enriched in the chromatin-associated P2 fractions as determined by RT-qPCR. The P2 fraction was also analyzed in the absence of reverse transcriptase (-RT) as a control. Data are relative to untreated S1 fraction, mean -/+ SEM.These results suggest that the short ASCC3 isoform promotes transcription restart via a mechanism that is mediated by RNA, not protein. To further investigate this possibility, we assessed cells for expression of the protein encoded by the short ASCC3 isoform. Although the 13\u00a0kDa protein product of this isoform could be detected following ectopic expression using an antibody targeted toward its unique C terminus (Figure\u00a0S7B), the protein could not be detected in untransfected cells. We therefore generated an antibody against an N-terminal epitope of ASCC3, which is shared between the long and short protein isoforms. Immunoprecipitation using this antibody pulled down the large (251\u00a0kDa) ASCC3 protein as well as the ectopically expressed 13\u00a0kDa isoform, but the endogenous short protein\u00a0isoform could not be detected, neither by immunoblotting\u00a0nor\u00a0targeted mass spectroscopy (Figure\u00a0S7C, and data not shown).To more conclusively test whether ASCC3 short isoform was indeed functioning as a non-coding RNA, we now used the construct expressing the CDS with its 3\u2032UTR, but this time inserting a premature stop mutation at the beginning of the CDS. As expected, this construct failed to produce protein (Figure\u00a0S7B). Nevertheless, it rescued the low transcription phenotype in cells deficient for the short isoform (Figures 7A\u20137D), showing that the short ASCC3 isoform must function as a non-coding RNA.RNA in\u00a0situ hybridization experiments revealed that the short ASCC3 isoform transcript is overwhelmingly nuclear with some enrichment in discrete spots within the nucleus (Figure\u00a07E). Localization was not significantly affected by UV irradiation, and the knockout cells lost the signal, confirming that the probes for in\u00a0situ hybridization were specific (Figures S7D and S7E). In contrast, probes targeting the protein-coding long ASCC3 isoform produced a signal in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure\u00a07E). Biochemical cell fractionation producing cytoplasmic (S1), nucleoplasmic (S2), and chromatin-enriched (P2) fractions (Figure\u00a07F) further revealed that the short ASCC3 isoform is primarily chromatin-associated (Figure\u00a07G), similar to other long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT-1 (Figure\u00a0S7F).Together, these data show that the short ASCC3 isoform functions as a non-coding RNA in the nucleus of human cells. DiscussionIn this report, we provide evidence for a dramatic and global effect of UV irradiation on transcript elongation, which impacts RNA processing and provides significant potential for cellular regulation. UV exposure results in spatial restriction of transcription and slower elongation, with the result that only the promoter-proximal 20\u201325 kb are efficiently transcribed. Together, these events underlie a switch to expression of short mRNA isoforms and preferential use of alternative last exons in a number of\u00a0genes, including ASCC3. Intriguingly, the switch between ASCC3 isoforms occurs on more than one level, in that the long mRNA isoform encodes a protein, functioning in the context of the ASCC complex and required for maintaining transcriptional suppression in the late stages of the DNA damage response, whereas the short isoform functions as a nuclear non-coding RNA that is required for transcription to recover. Intriguingly, the short and long isoforms constitute an autonomous regulatory module and functionally interrelate, so that the effect of deleting one can be at least partially compensated for by deleting the other (Figure\u00a07H).Preferential Short ALE Isoform Expression in Response to Elongation ShutdownThe spatial restriction of transcription is surprising, but might allow some short genes to remain expressed after UV irradiation. Indeed, this phenomenon may finally explain the puzzling observation that human genes that remain expressed or are induced upon UV irradiation are invariably very short (McKay et\u00a0al., 2004).The significant spatial restriction of transcription activity and attenuation of elongation also explains the reduction in expression of long transcript isoforms, while the relative persistence of promoter-proximal RNA synthesis allows expression of short mRNA isoforms. Indeed, it seems obvious that region-restricted transcription, combined with slow transcript elongation, must underlie the increased expression of ALEs associated with these short RNA isoforms. Interestingly, data from others support the idea that recognition and inclusion of an ALE might slow transcription down even further (Kwak et\u00a0al., 2013, Nojima et\u00a0al., 2015) and thus promote the usage of otherwise dormant poly-A sites (Pinto et\u00a0al., 2011). In this sense, ALE isoform expression might arguably also be classified as alternative termination/poly-adenylation (poly-A) events, due to the inherently different poly-A sites associated with these transcript isoforms.The Transcriptional Response to UV Irradiation Is Multi-layered and ComplexThe analysis presented here uncovers an unexpectedly complex transcriptional response to UV exposure, as well as novel proteins and a non-coding RNA involved in regulating it. The transcription response can be sub-divided into several distinct phases. First, the immediate response to UV irradiation is a rapid and dramatic decrease in transcript elongation rates, within minutes of exposure. Second, this is followed by a decrease in transcriptional initiation within 2\u00a0hr of exposure. Together, these events constitute the molecular manifestation of the long established \u201cglobal transcription shutdown\u201d first observed decades ago (Mayne and Lehmann, 1982).Third, a state of slow elongation is sustained for at least 12\u00a0hr following UV irradiation, despite the fact that lesion density is greatest immediately after UV irradiation and lesion removal in genes occurs at an exponential rate with a half-life of 8\u00a0hr after 15 J/m2 irradiation (Venema et\u00a0al., 1990). This strongly suggests that the transcriptional response to UV irradiation is not caused solely by RNAPII stalling at DNA damage, but that UV irradiation also results in the activation of protein factors and pathways in trans. In support of this idea, our ongoing experiments with mutants from the screen for genes affecting transcription after DNA damage that also uncovered ASCC3 (Boeing et\u00a0al., 2016), as well as recent data on PRC1 and UBR5 (Sanchez et\u00a0al., 2016), strongly indicate that certain protein factors are indeed required for UV-induced transcription shutdown to take place. Without these factors, transcription continues even in the presence of DNA damage.Fourth, as outlined in detail here, the widespread repression of transcription is maintained in the late phases of the UV-induced DNA damage response by a novel, separate mechanism, namely via ASCC complex-mediated transcriptional suppression. Interestingly, ASCC3 is not required for the establishment of transcriptional repression, only for maintaining it. Remarkably, this intriguing suppression mechanism is negated by the action of the short ASCC3 RNA isoform, which ultimately allows transcription to recover.ALE Isoform Expression of ASCC3 Regulates the Transcription Response to UV IrradiationOur data on ASCC3 comprise evidence that the UV-induced shift to expression of short ALE transcript isoforms represents physiologically important regulation. Intriguingly, knockdown of the long ASCC3 isoform rescues the transcription defect in cells lacking the short isoform, highlighting that the long and short isoforms regulate one another to control transcription after UV irradiation. This indicates that the balance between long and short isoform expression, which is temporarily altered as a consequence of UV irradiation, is critical for regulating transcription shutdown and recovery.Despite being annotated as protein-coding, the short ASCC3 transcript isoform is nuclear and may in fact not be translated to a significant extent. Indeed, its function in transcriptional restart after UV irradiation is dependent on the non-coding 3\u2032 UTR and is retained after its coding ability is disrupted. The short ASCC3 RNA isoform likely functions as a non-coding RNA. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are generally bioinformatically characterized by being relatively stable, RNAPII-generated RNAs lacking ORFs of 300 nts or more (Derrien et\u00a0al., 2012). However, the distinction between mRNAs and lncRNAs is often somewhat blurred (Sampath and Ephrussi, 2016), and our data show that even though the short ASCC3 isoform does contain an ORF of 333 nts, it is functionally a lncRNA (of \u223c3,500 bases). This points to a previously uninvestigated source of lncRNAs, namely alternative last exon (ALE)-derived, non-coding transcript isoforms produced from well-known protein-coding genes. To our knowledge, the only other example of a gene with alternative protein coding and functional lncRNA transcript isoforms is steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (SRA). Ironically, in contrast to ASCC3, SRA was long thought to encode a lncRNA, which regulates steroid hormone receptor driven transcription, but it may also produce ORF-containing alternative transcript variants that can be translated into protein. Unlike ASCC3, however, SRA produces alternative protein-coding splicing isoforms through mechanisms that introduce AUG codons not present in the lncRNA isoform (reviewed by Leygue, 2007).The short ASCC3 RNA isoform appears to function, at least in part, by repressing the function of the ASCC complex, of which ASCC3 protein is a DEAD/DEAH box DNA helicase component (Jung et\u00a0al., 2002, Dango et\u00a0al., 2011). ASCC3/ASCC complex was identified through its role in transcriptional regulation (Jung et\u00a0al., 2002, Li et\u00a0al., 2013), but its biochemical mechanism of action remains unknown. We found that ASCC3 interacts with both RNAPII and CSB and it becomes highly ubiquitylated and phosphorylated upon UV irradiation (Boeing et\u00a0al., 2016), suggesting a direct effect on transcription and regulation via post-translational modification. Understanding the biochemical function of ASCC complex is an important future goal, not least because it is a prerequisite for understanding the function of the ASCC3 lncRNA. Although we have so far failed to uncover convincing evidence for it, one possibility is that the chromatin-associated ASCC3 lncRNA regulates transcription through binding and regulating the ASCC complex. However, it might also function through recruitment of other factors. For example, lncRNAs such as HOTAIR and XIST both regulate transcription through recruitment of histone modification complexes and in the case of HOTAIR, even ubiquitin ligases (Bhan and Mandal, 2015, Rutenberg-Schoenberg et\u00a0al., 2016). Two DNA damage-induced lncRNAs, lincRNA-p21 and PANDA, regulate p53-mediated gene expression by interacting with DNA/RNA binding proteins, resulting in gene-specific repression (Huarte et\u00a0al., 2010, Hung et\u00a0al., 2011). Post-transcriptional mechanisms for lncRNA function have also been described, including miRNA sequestering and regulating mRNA decay and translation (Abdelmohsen et\u00a0al., 2013).Other UV-Induced ALE GenesIntriguingly, our analysis uncovered a number of other genes with characteristics similar to those of ASCC3. For example, INTS6 encodes an 887 amino acid (aa) protein, which is a subunit of the Integrator complex (Baillat et\u00a0al., 2005). Upon UV irradiation, however, a much shorter RNA isoform is expressed, with the capacity to encode a 115 aa protein, which lacks the C-terminal region required for association with INTS3 and presumably the rest of the Integrator complex (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2013). Likewise, HERC4 encodes a putative ubiquitin ligase (1,057 aa), but also a short UV-induced isoform potentially encoding a 110 aa protein, which lacks the catalytic domain. Other interesting examples, such as SUPT16H (encoding the large subunit of the histone chaperone FACT) and RAD51C (involved in homologous DNA recombination) were also detected. Again, both encode very short, UV-induced isoforms, which might not result in functional proteins. Some of these short protein isoforms have been detected in a deep proteome sequencing project (Kim et\u00a0al., 2014), but it is unclear whether they are functionally relevant, or whether, like for ASCC3, the short, stable, poly-adenylated transcript isoforms encoding them act in the form of lncRNAs. Addressing the precise function of these transcripts in the DNA damage response represents an important future goal.

Cell lines were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination and human species authenticated by STR profiling and PCR based analysis, performed by the Francis Crick Institute Cell Services.Method DetailsCell line manipulation and generation Cells were transfected with siRNAs using Interferin transfection reagent followed by a minimum of 48\u00a0hr incubation prior to UV irradiation. Lipofectamine 2000 was used for plasmid DNA transfection. For generation of stable ASCC3 knockdown cells, MRC5VA cells were infected with lentiviral particles carrying ASCC3 long isoform-targeting shRNA or non-targeting shRNA followed by selection with puromycin (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). For generation of ASCC3 short isoform knockout cells, cells were transfected with a Cas9- and guide RNA-containing vector (PX458) that targeted the introns up- and downstream of the terminal exon of the short isoform of ASCC3. Individual GFP-positive cells were selected by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting and clones were screened for deletion of the desired fragment by genomic PCR and RT-qPCR.UVC-irradiation was performed using either a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene), or a purpose-built UVC box that was used to irradiate 384-well plates. Unless otherwise stated, 15 J/m2 was used.GRO-Seq UV/DRB/GRO-Seq (Figures 1A\u20131D, S1A, and S1B) was done essentially as described in Saponaro et\u00a0al. (2014): approximately 6 X 106 MRC5VA cells were cultured in DMEM media containing 10% FBS, 5% penicillin/streptinomycin and 100\u00a0\u03bcM 5,6-Dichlorobenzimidazole 1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) for 3.5\u00a0hr. DRB-containing media was removed and cells were either left untreated or exposed to 15 J/m2 UVC irradiation. Cells were then washed with PBS and placed in fresh media without DRB. Cells were then incubated for 10, 25 or 40\u00a0min. Transcription-competent nuclei were prepared using the Nuclei Isolation Kit by scraping cells in 10\u00a0mL of cold lysis buffer followed by a spin at 500 x g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C then resuspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcL cold storage buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and Superase. Nuclear Run-On reactions were carried out by addition of 400\u00a0\u03bcL Run-On Buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-Cl\u00a0pH 8.0, 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 300\u00a0mM KCL, 20 units of SUPERase, 1% Sarkosyl, 500\u00a0\u03bcM ATP, GTP, CTP and Br-UTP) and incubation at 30\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Run-On reactions were stopped by addition of 10 X DNaseI buffer (93\u00a0\u03bcL) and RNase Free DNase (40\u00a0\u03bcL) and incubation for 1.5\u00a0hr 30\u00b0C shaking. Br-UTP run-on labeled RNA was isolated using anti-Br-UTP coupled agarose beads at room temperature for 1\u00a0hr. Beads were washed once with low salt buffer (0.2X SSPE, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween), twice with high salt buffer (0.5X SSPE, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween, 150\u00a0mM NaCl) and twice with TE pH 8.0\u00a0+ 0.05% Tween. RNA was eluted from beads (20\u00a0mM DTT, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM Tris pH7.5, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL glycogen and 0.1% SDS) at room temperature. Eluates were acid phenol-chloroform extracted and precipitated.The purified RNA was used for the preparation of strand-specific RNA libraries using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep kit, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequence analyzer as single-ended 51\u00a0bp reads.For the 0-24\u00a0hr GRO-Seq experiment (Figures 1E, 1F, and \u200bandS1C\u2013S1F),S1C\u2013S1F), approximately 6 X 106 of MRC5VA cells were either left untreated or UVC-irradiated with 15 J/m2 and allowed to recover for 2, 5, 8, 10, 12 or 24\u00a0hr. Nuclei were isolated and run-on and RNA isolation was performed as above.The purified RNA was used for the preparation of strand-specific RNA libraries using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep kit, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequence analyzer as 101\u00a0bp reads.RNA-Seq MRC5VA cells were either left untreated or treated with 15J/m2 of UVC irradiation followed by recovery for 8 or 24\u00a0hr. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit and analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All samples had an RIN value of greater than 8. The purified RNA was used for the preparation of poly A selected mRNA libraries using the TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit and sequenced on an Illumina GA IIX sequence analyzer as paired-end 72\u00a0bp reads.Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR RNeasy Mini Kit purified RNA was used to generate random hexamer primed cDNA libraries using Taqman Reverse Transcriptase Reagents. Quantitative PCR were performed using iQ SYBR green Mastermix, 0.3\u00a0\u03bcM primer concentration and equal 1\u00a0\u03bcL of cDNA library per reaction. Reference gene normalized RNA expression was compared between variable (ex. UV-treated) and control samples using the Livak equation (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). For example, to measure the expression of the short isoform of ASCC3 under UV-treated compared to untreated conditions, the following equation was used (2\u2227-((CTASCC3short-CTGAPDH)UV-(CTASCC3short-CTGAPDH)UN)).For experiments where RNA levels were compared between subcellular fractions (Figures 7G and \u200bandS7F),S7F), ASCC3 short isoform and Malat-1 CT values were not normalized to a reference gene. Here, relative RNA levels in the nucleoplasmic enriched S2 fraction compared to cytoplasmic S1 fraction was calculated using the following Equation (2\u2227-(CTS2fraction-CTS1fraction). RNA levels in the chromatin fraction were similarly determined using (2\u2227-(CTP3fraction-CTS1fraction). Column graphs represent the average relative RNA expression across at least 3 biological replicate experiments. Primer sequences are found in Table S5.5\u2032 Ethynyl Uridine transcription assay SiRNA was diluted in HBSS (500\u00a0nM) and 5\u00a0\u03bcL of diluted siRNA was deposited in 384 well plates. Interferin transfection reagent was\u00a0diluted 1/100 in OPTI-MEM and 5\u00a0\u03bcL of transfection reagent was deposited on top of diluted siRNA. SiRNA/Interferin mix was incubated at room temperature for 15\u00a0min. MRC5VA cells were diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5% penicillin/streptinomycin to a density of 2.25 X 104 cells/mL and 40\u00a0\u03bcL was deposited on top of the transfection mix (900 cells/well). Cells were incubated for 48\u00a0hr. Media was aspirated from the 384-well plates and cells were either exposed to 15 J/m2 using a custom built UVC box or left untreated. Media was replaced and cells were incubated for the indicated amount of time. Media was replaced with fresh media containing 0.75\u00a0mM 5 Ethynyl uridine (EU) and cells were incubated for 2\u00a0hr. EU-containing media was removed and cells were fixed in PBS buffered formaldehyde (3.7%) for 45\u00a0min at room temperature, washed once with PBS using a plate washer followed by permeabilization with 0.5% TX-100 diluted in PBS for 30\u00a0min. Plates were washed once with PBS then Alexa Fluor 488 Azide fluorophores were covalently attached to EU-containing RNA by click reaction (100\u00a0mM Tris pH 8.5, 4\u00a0mM Cu2SO4, 10\u00a0\u03bcM Alexa azide 488, 100mM Ascorbic Acid) for 1\u00a0hr at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times in 100\u00a0mM Tris, pH 7.5 and stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) at a final concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Plates were washed once with PBS. Automated image acquisition of 6 fields per well was performed (Cellomics Array Scan VTI, ThermoFisher Scientific) using a 10\u00a0\u00d7 objective.Clonogenic Survival Assay 1.5 X 105 MRC5VA cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and incubated overnight. SiRNA targeting ASCC3 or non-targeting control was diluted in 150\u00a0\u03bcL HBSS (500\u00a0nM) and mixed with Interferin diluted in 150\u00a0\u03bcL OPTI-MEM (5\u00a0\u03bcL interferin per well). The siRNA/Interferin mix was incubated at room temperature for 15\u00a0min then added to wells containing 2.7\u00a0mL of fresh media (final siRNA concentration 50\u00a0nM). Plates were incubated for 30\u00a0hr then cells were treated with Trypsin/EDTA, counted and seeded in 6-cm dishes at a low density for colony formation. Cells were incubated overnight followed by UVC irradiation with 2, 5, 10 and 15 J/m2 (48\u00a0hr after siRNA transfection). Colonies were allowed to form over a 10-14\u00a0day period and were stained with crystal violet and counted.Gene expression array RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini Kit from ASCC3 short isoform knockout (clone 2) cells and MRC5VA parental control cells, ASCC3 long isoform knockdown cells and scrambled shRNA control cells either in untreated conditions or 20\u00a0hr following UV irradiation. Each condition was represented by 3 biological replicates. RNA samples were processed by services provided at the Oxford Genomic Centre using the Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification Kit followed by the Illumina Whole-Genome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay. The labeled cRNA was then hybridized to Human HT-12_V4_BeadChip for gene expression.Subcellular fractionation Protocol was adapted from Mayer et\u00a0al. (2015). MRC5VA cells were left untreated or UV-irradiated followed by 4\u00a0hr or 20\u00a0hr recovery. \u223c4 x106 cells/ condition were harvested by trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS, resuspended in Cytoplasmic lysis buffer (0.15% NP-40, 10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 50\u00a0U SUPERase, 1 X protease inhibitor mix) and incubated on ice 5\u00a0min. Lysates were layered on top of Sucrose buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 25% sucrose, 50\u00a0U SUPERase, 1 X protease inhibitor mix) and centrifuged 16000\u00a0g 10\u00a0min 4\u00b0C. The supernatent was collected for the cytoplasmic fraction and pelleted nuclei were washed in Nuclei wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, in 1x PBS, 50\u00a0U SUPERase and 1x protease inhibitor mix) spun at 1150\u00a0g for 1\u00a0min then resuspended in Glycerol buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.85\u00a0mM DTT, 50\u00a0U SUPERase and 1x protease inhibitor mix). Equal volume of Nuclei lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 20\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300\u00a0mM NaCl, 1M Urea, 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 50\u00a0U SUPERase and 1x protease inhibitor mix) was added followed by vortex and 2\u00a0min incubation on ice. Chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation at 18500\u00a0g for 2\u00a0min 4\u00b0C and supernatent collected as the Nuclear fraction. Chromatin pellets were resuspended in DNaseI buffer (40\u00a0mM Tris pH8.0, 10\u00a0mM MgSO4, 1\u00a0mM CaCl2, 50\u00a0U Superase In, 10\u00a0U RNase Free DNase) followed by 30\u00a0min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Digestions were centrifuged 18500\u00a0g 10\u00a0min and chromatin supernatents were collected. An aliquot of Cytoplasmic, Nuclear and Chromatin fractions were reserved for immunoblot analysis and RNA was purified from the remaining sample using miRNeasy Mini Kit. CDNA libraries generated from purified RNA were subjected to qPCR using primers specific for the short isoform of ASCC3 and Malat-1.Ectopic expression of ASCC3 short isoform constructs MRC5VA cells stably expressing the CMV-Tet3G transactivator protein were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 with pTre3G vector constructs containing siRNA resistant N-terminally Flag-tagged ASCC3 short isoform coding sequence (CDS), CDS with 3\u2032 UTR or CDS containing an in-frame stop mutation with 3\u2032UTR. In experiments where endogenous ASCC3 short isoform was knocked down, 24-32\u00a0hr after transfection with ASCC3 transgene expression constructs, cells were subsequently transfected with ASCC3 short isoform targeting or NT siRNA followed by addition of doxycycline (100\u00a0ng/mL) for 24\u00a0hr to support transgene expression. For experiments involving knockout cell lines, transgene transfected cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline (100\u00a0ng/mL) for at least 24\u00a0hr. Cells were subsequently exposed to UV irradiation or left untreated and incubated for 20\u00a0hr followed by EU incorporation assay.Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblotting Expression of the corresponding short isoform protein in Figures S7B and S7C was determined by immunoprecipitation after transient transfection with the indicated constructs in the presence of doxycycline (100\u00a0ng/mL) followed by immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates were prepared 24\u00a0hr after transfection by lysis in cell lysis buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.9, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 3\u00a0mM MgCl2, 10\u00a0mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40) followed by immunoprecipitation using M2 Flag agarose or ASCC3 N-terminal-targeting antibody for 4\u00a0hr. ASCC3 N-terminal antibody was immobilized on protein A Dynabeads. Bead bound immunoprecipitations were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in 2 X laemmli sample buffer.For immunoblotting, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4%\u201312% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed using the indicated antibodies.RNA in\u00a0situ hybridization RNASCOPE 2.5 HD Assay Red Kit and probes targeting the long and short isoform of ASCC3 were designed and supplied by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Cells were grown on slides and either left untreated or UV-irradiated with 15 J/m2 followed by 20\u00a0hr incubation. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin for 30\u00a0min. Fixed cells were then washed with PBS followed by dehydration in ethanol according to manufacturers protocol. Following dehydration, slides were stored in 100% ethanol at \u221220 C. Probe hybridization was performed strictly according to manufacturers protocol and counterstained with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisGRO-Seq analysis 51\u00a0bp single-end reads (DRB/GRO-Seq) and 101\u00a0bp single-end reads (24\u00a0hr GRO-Seq) were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly using BWA v0.5.9 and v0.7.10 (Li and Durbin, 2009) respectively with default settings. BAM files were sorted and indexed using SAMtools (Li et\u00a0al., 2009). Further analysis was conducted using Bioconductor and its GenomicRanges package (Lawrence et\u00a0al., 2013). Reads were extended to 250\u00a0bp and each sample was normalized to a read depth of 20 million.A subset of the protein coding human Ensembl transcriptome was created by filtering for transcripts \u2265 30 kb. The largest transcript per gene was selected, resulting in a list of 8,148 transcribed genes. Base pair level coverage of the region 2 kb upstream, to 120 kb downstream, of each transcript\u2019s TSS was calculated for each sample. Average transcript profiles were generated by taking a trimmed mean (0.05) of read depth over each base pair.Gene specific wave-fronts and elongation rate for DRB/GRO-Seq Islands of normalized read depth \u2265 3\u00a0bp were identified for each gene from the TSS to 120 kb downstream. These islands were assumed to be evidence of elongation. When read-depth first dropped below 3 for 5,000 consecutive base pairs, elongation was assumed to have halted, and a wave front was called at the transition point. The 5 kb distance filter was necessary to filter out background noise and downstream transcripts. Short exonic regions were also excluded in the wave front calling analyses. The subsequent list of wave fronts was filtered to remove genes that did not have an increase in wave front progression over time and that had a wave front called downstream of the transcription termination site. The resulting filtered list was manually curated further to remove genes with interfering antisense and convergent transcription resulting in a list of 333 genes with wave fronts calculated for all untreated and UV-treated time points. These were plotted and the median wave front was determined for each sample. To calculate elongation rates, the difference in wave front position between the 10, 25 and 40\u00a0min time points was calculated for each gene then divided by the 15\u00a0min time interval.Gene specific wave-fronts for GRO-Seq Single gene GRO-Seq wave fronts were determined for UV-treated 2-24\u00a0hr GRO-Seq experiment (Figures S1D and S1E). Wave fronts were computationally determined as above. The resulting list of wave fronts were filtered to include expressed genes (RPKM >\u00a0= 0.3 0 to\u00a0+250\u00a0bp relative to TSS) that displayed sustained GRO-Seq signal between\u00a0+30 kb (relative to the TSS) and 1 kb downstream of the TTS. We focused on genes that displayed a reduction in wave front position in response to UV. This resulted in a list of 141 genes with wave fronts calculated for all samples in the UV time course. These were plotted and the median wave front was determined for each sample. The elongation rate 2-12\u00a0hr post-UV was determined by plotting the median wave front over time and including a line of best fit. The slope of the line indicates the elongation rate.Mathematically determined wave-fronts for GRO-Seq The average gene profile for each of the UV-treated samples was normalized by subtracting from the untreated average gene profile. The resulting normalized UV-treated profile was smoothed using a loess line. The position along the x axis at which the loess line crosses y\u00a0= 0 was used as an estimate of wave-front position. This estimate was further refined by taking the first instance after the initial wave-front estimate where the derivative of the fitted line was half that at the position of the initial estimate. The elongation rate 2-12\u00a0hr post-UV was determined by plotting the median wave front over time and including a line of best fit (Figure\u00a0S1F). The slope of the line indicates the transcription elongation rate.Single-gene GRO-Seq profiling A bp resolution profile of log2 (1+ normalized read depth) was created for a single gene\u2019s genomic range \u00b1 2kb. The range was divided into consecutive 500\u00a0bp bins and a mean coverage depth across each bin was calculated. A smoothing spline was then applied.Terminal exon synthesis analysis The RPKM of GRO-Seq signal corresponding to the TSS distal and proximal terminal exons of long and short alternative transcript isoforms was calculated respectively. The UV-treated RPKM for terminal exons corresponding to short and long transcript isoforms was normalized to untreated conditions and log2 transformed. The ratio of normalized TSS proximal terminal exon log2(RPKM) to TSS distal log2(RPKM) was calculated for UV regulated ALE events as well as and background events that were not regulated by UV irradiation and plotted to determine the ratio of short to long isoform expression (Figures 2G and \u200bandS2D\u2013S2F).S2D\u2013S2F). Statistical analysis in S5D is Mann Whitney test, \u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217 p\u00a0< 0.0001.RNA-Seq alternative isoform analysis RNASeq reads were aligned to UCSC genome hg19 using Tophat2 (Kim et\u00a0al., 2013). Transcript information was obtained from the UCSC known Gene table. Ambiguously mapped reads were removed from the alignments prior to subsequent analysis (mapped read-pair range 17111950 - 27119645).We identified differential spicing events using MISO (Katz et\u00a0al., 2010) along with MISO\u2019s published splicing event annotation. MISO was run against pairwise combinations of UV-treated and untreated samples for two biological replicates. We filtered results using MISO\u2019s post filtering script to generate final events (The number of both inclusion and exclusion reads > 10, delta-psi > 0 and bayes-factor > 10). Statistically significant events called for the same UV time point in both biological replicates were filtered further for splicing effect size. To determine an effect size for the different splicing events we quantified each event at the exon level (Splicing Index (SI)). For events affecting a single exon or intron (Skipped Exon (SE), Retained Intron (RI)), we quantified the spicing event as a ratio of exon/intron mapped reads over gene mapped reads (For example, for the skipped exon category log2((ExonUV/GeneUV)/(ExonUN/GeneUN)). In the cases of alternative exon usage where splicing is indicated by a shift from one exon to another (Alternative first/last exon usage (AFE, ALE)), we quantified the events as a ratio of reads mapping to one over the other (log2((Exon2UV/Exon2UN)/(Exon1UV/Exon1UN)). For alternative splice site events (A5SS, A3SS) where a proportion of the alternative exon is shared between the two events we used only reads unique to each event. These counts were treated as in the AFE/ALE cases above. Only splicing events that had a log2(SI) of \u2265 0.25 or \u2264 \u22120.25 in both biological replicates were included in our final list of UV-induced splicing events (Table S1). Table S2 shows additional MISO output parameters PSI, deltaPSI and Bayes factor for UV-regulated ALE events.Non-UV regulated ALE background events (Figure\u00a0S2) are defined as all potential ALE events in the MISO database of splicing event annotation that were not significantly affected by UV treatment (n\u00a0= 7736).DEXSeq (Anders et\u00a0al., 2012) was used to produce the exon level expression plots. Plots were manually edited to restrict the analysis to exons present in the isoforms of interest.Gene ontology analysis Gene ontology analysis was performed by uploading gene symbols for UV-regulated ALE events to DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (Huang et\u00a0al., 2009).Gene expression array Background subtracted probe signals were averaged across the 3 biological replicates and processed using Limma Bioconductor package. Genes that were downregulated with a fold change \u2264 \u22121.5 fold in UV-treated ASCC3 short isoform knockout cells compared to UV-treated parental cells were subjected to hierarchical clustering and log2 fold change values for both short isoform knockout and shASCC3 long isoform cells were displayed in a heatmap. Results for all genes are shown in Table S4.EU Assay Image analysis was performed using HCS Studio 2.0. Cell nuclei were masked using the DAPI staining. The average intensity of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated EU-labeled RNA was measured for each nucleus in at least 3 separate wells and plotted in a histogram. The threshold identifying low transcription was set for each experiment manually based on the histogram profiles and the percentage of cells below the threshold was calculated. Histograms represent one biological replicate consisting of 3 technical replicates (2500 - 20000 cells per condition) and column graphs with statistics represent the average of \u2265 3 biological replicates.Data and Software AvailabilitySoftware Data Resources The accession number for the DRB/GRO-Seq, 24\u00a0hr GRO-Seq, RNA Seq and illumina Bead Array data reported in this paper is GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE91012\",\"term_id\":\"91012\"}}GSE91012\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc={\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE91012\",\"term_id\":\"91012\"}}GSE91012.
