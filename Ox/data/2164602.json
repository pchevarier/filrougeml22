{"title": "Herpesvirus saimiri U RNAs are expressed and assembled into ribonucleoprotein particles in the absence of other viral genes", "pubDate": "1990", "PMCID": "PMC249686", "DOI": "10.1128/JVI.64.8.3905-3915.1990", "PMID": "2164602", "abstract": "Marmoset T lymphocytes transformed by herpesvirus saimiri contain a set of five virally encoded U RNAs called HSUR1 through HSUR5. HSUR genes have been individually transfected into a nonlymphoid, nonsimian cell line (HeLa cells) in the absence of any other coding regions of the herpesvirus saimiri genome. The levels of HSUR1 through HSUR4 in HeLa transient-expression systems are comparable to those found in virally transformed T cells (23 to 91%). In contrast, HSUR5 is expressed at ninefold-higher levels in transfected HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that HSURs expressed in transfected cells bind proteins with Sm determinants and acquire a 5' trimethylguanosine cap structure, as they do in transformed T cells. HSUR1 or HSUR4 particles from transfected HeLa cells migrate between 10S and 15S in velocity gradients, identical to the sedimentation of \"monoparticles\" produced in virally transformed lymphocytes. We conclude from these transfection experiments that no other herpesvirus saimiri or host-cell-specific gene products appear to be required for efficient expression of the HSUR genes or for subsequent assembly of the viral U RNAs into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. In lymphocytes transformed by herpesvirus saimiri, HSUR small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles are involved in higher-order complexes that sediment between 20S and 25S. HSUR1, HSUR2, and HSUR5 dissociate from such complexes upon incubation at 30 degrees C, whereas the complex containing HSUR4 is stable to incubation.", "author": [{"author": "S I Lee", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510."], "href": "/?term=Lee+SI&cauthor_id=2164602"}, {"author": "J A Steitz", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Steitz+JA&cauthor_id=2164602"}], "refPMID": ["210957", "2524422", "6162199", "6164096", "6262773", "6789322", "6292492", "6184716", "6828386", "2908086", "2545905", "2552294", "2294407", "2612904", "2558966", "2612905", "6091052", "2578319", "2989814", "2409601", "2411548", "3943131", "3003401", "2419912", "3698097", "3488815", "2427336", "3757028", "3022153", "3024161", "2953438", "3582371", "2960976", "3691481", "6319734", "6323032", "6235919", "3428599", "2835770", "2842058", "2842067", "2972850", "3141901", "2973606", "2974799", "2850259", "2537954", "2538660", "7350545"], "citedInPMID": ["2164602", "30352676", "27335146", "23579284", "21925386", "21430050", "20719877", "16314521", "15632062", "15121869", "10559377", "9628880", "9334320", "8995643", "8209420", "1311093"], "body": ""}
