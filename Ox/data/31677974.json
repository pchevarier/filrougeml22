Cortazar et al show that pol II speed is limited by the PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates the elongation factor Spt5 and that this mechanism decelerates transcription in termination zones downstream of poly(A) sites. They propose that termination of transcription requires poly(A) site-dependent deceleration of transcription that converts the RNA polymerase into a \u201csitting duck\u201d for the Xrn2 \u201ctorpedo\u201d to track down and dislodge from the DNA template. IntroductionThe speed of RNA pol II transcription or elongation rate is an important determinant of co-transcriptional processes like chromatin modification and pre-mRNA processing, that profoundly affect gene expression (Bentley, 2014; Dujardin et al., 2013). Kinetic competition between alternative events acting on the nascent RNA as it grows, and on the pol II elongation complex (EC) as it translocates, can make co-transcriptional processes dependent on polymerase speed. One example is poly(A) site dependent transcription termination. According to the \u201ctorpedo\u201d model of termination, cleavage of the nascent transcript at the poly(A) site provides a 5\u2019 PO4 access point for the 5\u2019-3\u2019 RNA exonuclease Xrn2/Rat1 (human/yeast) (Connelly and Manley, 1988; Kim et al., 2004; West et al., 2004) which tracks along the nascent transcript chasing down the RNA polymerase, and eventually displacing it from the DNA template. Rapid transcription prolongs the race between Xrn2 and pol II causing more distal termination while slow transcription causes more proximal termination (Fong et al., 2015). An alternative model that is not mutually exclusive with the \u201ctorpedo\u201d mechanism proposes a poly(A) site dependent \u201callosteric\u201d change in the EC that promotes its release from the template (Logan et al., 1987), but the nature of such a conformational change has never been established.Pol II transcription in mammalian cells proceeds at between ~0.5kb/min and >5kb/min and this variation in speed occurs both between genes and within genes where pol II accelerates 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 (Danko et al., 2013; Fuchs et al., 2014; Jonkers et al., 2014). How pol II speed is controlled remains poorly understood however potential mechanisms include modulation of the chromatin structure, the kinetic properties of the polymerase, and the factors that associate with the EC. One such factor that may control pol II speed is DSIF (Spt4/5), a homologue of the bacterial NusG family of elongation factors (Artsimovitch and Knauer, 2019; Hartzog et al., 1998; Wada et al., 1998), and the only transcription factor conserved in all three kingdoms of life. DSIF makes multiple contacts with pol II and the nascent transcript in the EC (Ehara et al., 2017; Vos et al., 2018a; Vos et al., 2018b) and is found throughout actively transcribed genes (Glover-Cutter et al., 2008; Rahl et al., 2010). DSIF can positively or negatively affect transcriptional processivity (the fraction of ECs that complete full-length transcripts), (Hartzog et al., 1998; Henriques et al., 2018; Shetty et al., 2017; Wada et al., 1998) and it was recently also implicated in control of transcriptional speed. MYC-dependent recruitment of Spt5 correlates with increased rates of transcription elongation (Baluapuri et al., 2019), but whether Spt5 binding is sufficient to accelerate elongation remains unknown.In addition to regulated binding of Spt5 to the EC, phosphorylation of the Spt5 C-terminal repeat region 1 (CTR1) is also probably important for elongation regulation. In vitro studies suggest that CTR1 phosphorylation by Cdk9/PTEFb can switch Spt5 from a repressor to an activator of transcription (Bourgeois et al., 2002; Yamada et al., 2006) when polymerase releases from the promoter-proximal pause at the beginning of most metazoan genes. It is not known whether Spt5 phosphorylation influences transcription speed or whether its phosphorylation state changes after pol II release from promoter-proximal pause sites in metazoans, however in fission yeast, early elongation is associated with elevated Spt5 phosphorylation (Parua et al., 2018).The C-terminal region of Spt5 is not only involved in control of elongation, but also RNA 3\u2019-end processing and transcription termination. In budding yeast this domain participates in recruitment of cleavage/polyadenylation (CPA) factor CF1 (Mayer et al., 2012) and the elongation factor PAF1 that functions in termination of snoRNA transcripts (Sheldon et al., 2005). In addition, Spt5 cross-linking to the nascent transcript increases downstream of poly(A) sites (Baejen et al., 2017), suggesting that its conformation might respond to recognition of the processing site. At the 3\u2019 ends of genes in fission yeast, Spt5 is dephosphorylated by the Dis2 phosphatase and then dissociates from the EC (Kecman et al., 2018). However, this Spt5 dephosphorylation at 3\u2019 ends is independent of cleavage/polyadenylation, so its relevance to poly(A) site-dependent termination is unclear (Parua et al., 2018). On the other hand, the budding and fission yeast phosphatases Glc7 and Dis2, homologues of mammalian PP1, both function in some contexts to promote transcription termination (Kecman et al., 2018; Nedea et al., 2008; Parua et al., 2018; Schreieck et al., 2014). In addition, mammalian PP1 bound to the PP1 nuclear targeting subunit, PNUTS (Kim et al., 2003; Kreivi et al., 1997) co-purifies with CPA complexes (Shi et al., 2009), and PNUTS knock-down causes transcription termination defects (Austenaa et al., 2015). The PNUTS polypeptide contains TFIIS homology, Zn finger, and RGG RNA-binding domains (Kim et al., 2003; Kreivi et al., 1997) as well as a conserved RKSVTW PP1 binding motif (Kim et al., 2003; Kreivi et al., 1997). Whether PNUTS and its binding partners (Lee et al., 2010) promote termination through regulation of PP1 phosphatase activity or by other means remains unclear. It is also unknown whether PNUTS-PP1 affects termination indirectly via CPA or directly by acting on the pol II EC.We investigated pol II elongation rates and their relation to PNUTS-PP1 activity and Spt5 phosphorylation in human cells. We report that pol II slows substantially in 3\u2019 flanking regions and this transition, which requires the poly(A) site, is associated with dephosphorylation of Spt5. Disruption of the PNUTS-PP1complex accelerated elongation in both gene bodies and 3\u2019 flanking regions and prevented efficient transcription termination. These results suggest a \u201csitting duck-torpedo\u201d model of termination in which an \u201callosteric\u201d switch mediated by poly(A) site-dependent Spt5 dephosphorylation slows elongation allowing the Xrn2 torpedo to catch up with pol II and dislodge it. ResultsRNA pol II transitions into slow elongation near the poly(A) siteA conserved feature of metazoan genes is that apparent pol II occupancy measured by ChIP or nuclear runon peaks in a broad region downstream of poly(A) sites, the termination zone, prior to release of polymerases from the template (Anamika et al., 2012; Core et al., 2008; Davidson et al., 2014; Glover-Cutter et al., 2008; Lian et al., 2008). High pol II signals in termination zones could reflect a slowdown in elongation resulting in a pile up (Ehrensberger et al., 2013) or alternatively, a conformational change in the EC or the chromatin template (Spies et al., 2009). We set out to investigate this question by monitoring the kinetics of transcription through 3\u2019 flanking regions. In metazoans, unlike yeast, global measurement of transcription speed is possible in 3\u2019 flanking regions because intergenic distances are large and pol II can be \u201csynchronized\u201d at start sites by imposing a reversible block with the inhibitor, DRB (Singh and Padgett, 2009). We performed anti-pol II ChIP-seq at intervals after release from a DRB block, which establishes a wave of pol II that transits through the gene and into the termination zone. To minimize loss of the polymerases we are tracking through the termination zone, they were spared from eviction by inhibiting termination with a dominant active site mutant of Xrn2, D235A (Fong et al., 2015). As expected, following DRB washout, the front of the pol II wave quickly progressed through gene bodies, but when it encountered the poly(A) site a transition occurred, marked by a build-up of pol II density over time that was enhanced by Xrn2 D235A (Fig. 1A, S1A-C). Even many minutes after the pol II wave reached the termination zone it did not extend more than a few kb past the poly(A) site (Fig. 1A, S1A-B). To quantify elongation rates in the gene bodies and termination zones we employed a two-state Hidden Markov Model to identify pol II wave fronts. The median elongation rates of pol II within gene bodies were 2.4 kb/min and 3.0 kb/min in Xrn2WT and Xrn2D235A cells respectively (Fig. 1B). Importantly, downstream of poly(A) sites elongation rates fell to just 0.9 kb/min in both Xrn2WT and Xrn2D235A expressing cells (Fig. 1B).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.RNA pol II decelerates immediately downstream of poly(A) sites(A) Pol II ChIP-seq at intervals after washing out DRB in HEK293 cells expressing WT and D235A (MT) Xrn2. Note pol II piles up downstream of the poly(A) site (dashed red line) especially in Xrn2 MT cells (red arrow). See Fig. S1.(B) Metaplots of pol II ChIP-seq in gene bodies (1 kb bins) and termination zones (500 bp bins) after DRB washout as in A. (see Experimental Procedures). Elongation rates in gene bodies were calculated based on the 10 and 15 minute time points in genes >60 kb long and in termination zones based on the 10 and 15 minute time points for genes <20 kb long. Median elongation rates are shown above each boxplot. p-values were calculated using the Welch two sample t-test. Note that elongation decelerates by 2-3X close to the cleavage polyadenylation site (CPS).Elongation rates determined by DRB release could be overestimates because the position of the front edge of the pol II wave is determined by the fastest members of the population. We therefore also employed a complementary approach that follows the back edge of a receding wave of EC\u2019s at intervals after inhibiting transcription initiation with triptolide (Titov et al., 2011). As expected, elongation rates within gene bodies estimated from the position of the back edge of pol II wave (1.5-1.6 kb/min, Fig. S1F) are slightly slower than those based on the front edge after DRB release (Fig. 1). Most importantly, we observed a discrete transition at the poly(A) site where the progress of the wave of receding ECs almost totally stalled and pol II density accumulated to high levels in both Xrn2WT and Xrn2 D235A cells (Fig. 2A, \u200b,BB red arrows, S1D). Tracking of the peak of pol II density downstream of poly(A) sites over time after adding triptolide revealed elongation rates of only ~0.1 kb/min in the Xrn2 mutant (Fig. 2C, \u200b,D).D). Notably the 5\u2019 boundary of the pol II pile up in both Xrn2 WT and Xrn2D235A cells that marks where deceleration occurs is positioned within 100 bases downstream of the poly(A) site (Fig. 2C, \u200b,D,D, S1E). Together the results in Figures 1 and \u200band22 show that elongation rate is severely reduced in the termination zone, and that this slowdown starts close to the poly(A) cleavage site leading to accumulation of high polymerase density (Ehrensberger et al., 2013), especially if termination is prevented.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Elongation speed slows down at poly(A) sites.(A, B) Pol II ChIP-seq in two independent experiments after adding triptolide (Trip. 10 \u03bcM) to inhibit initiation in cells expressing WT and D235A mutant (MT) Xrn2 which prolongs pol II accumulation in termination zones (red arrows). Blue arrows mark a receding wave of pol II.(C, D). Metaplots of pol II ChIP-seq in termination zones for genes (>12kb apart) (200 bp bins) of different lengths after adding triptolide. Elongation rates were calculated based on the distance between the peaks (green arrows) of pol II density within 4kb downstream of the poly(A) signal at 10 and 20 minutes after adding triptolide (see Fig. S1).poly(A) signal recognition is required to slow down elongationA hallmark of pol II termination is that it is a poly(A) site-dependent phenomenon (Logan et al., 1987; Whitelaw and Proudfoot, 1986). If the pol II slowdown we observed in 3\u2019 flanking regions is relevant to normal termination, then it should require a functional poly(A) site. To test this prediction, we inhibited poly(A) site recognition in HEK293 cells by inducing expression of the influenza NS1A protein (Fig. S2A). NS1A interferes with 3\u2019 end processing by binding to CPSF30, which recognizes the AAUAAA motif in the pre-mRNA (Chan et al., 2014; Nemeroff et al., 1998; Sch\u00f6nemann et al., 2014). We investigated pol II occupancy at 3\u2019 ends of genes 24 hours after NS1A induction, when there was no detectable effect on cell viability. As expected, NS1A caused widespread inhibition of transcription termination manifested by readthrough transcription far downstream of poly(A) sites (Fig. 3A-\u200b-C,C, S2B, E) (Eaton et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2018). This readthrough transcription was specific to genes with poly(A) sites and was not observed downstream of NEAT1 (Fig. S2C) which encodes poly(A)- transcripts cleaved by RNAseP (Sunwoo et al., 2008). NS1A reduced the pile up of pol II immediately downstream of poly(A) sites at individual genes and metagene analysis showed that this behavior typified a majority of genes throughout the genome (Fig. 3A-\u200b-C,C, S2B, E). This effect of NS1A was specific to the peak of pol II at 3\u2019 ends while the promoter-proximal peak of pol II density was relatively unaffected (Fig. S2D). Elongation rate measurements in the presence of NS1A were not possible as DRB appears to interfere with NS1A function. Nevertheless, these experiments demonstrate a genome-wide suppression of pol II accumulation in termination zones by NS1A that is consistent with the model that poly(A) site recognition by CPSF is required for pol II to slowdown.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Poly(A) site recognition is required to slow RNA pol II elongation.(A-B) Pol II ChIP-seq in HEK293 before and after induction of influenza NS1A. Note that NS1A suppresses the pile-up of pol II density (red arrows) and extends transcription downstream of poly(A) sites.(C) Metaplot of pol II ChIP-seq (100 bp bins) before and after NS1A induction as in A, B. NS1A expression increased the ratio of pol II signal in the region (+4kb-+12kb relative to the poly(A) site)/ (0 kb- +4kb) by >2 fold at 77% of genes (15193/19515).

Note the pol II pile up (red arrows) is shifted downstream in the pA-MT cells to the site of presumptive cryptic poly(A) signals.To test further whether poly(A) site recognition is required for pol II deceleration, we asked whether this phenomenon requires the AAUAAA consensus sequence. We replaced the AAUAAA element in the poly(A) site of the chromosomal PSMG1 gene with a BamHI site (DpA) in HAP1 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (Fig. 3D). PSMG1 was selected because it is not essential and has only one annotated poly(A) site. Replacement of the wild type sequence was confirmed by showing that a genomic PCR amplicon flanking the PSMG1 gene 3\u2019 end is completely digested by BamHI (Fig. 3E). Anti pol II ChIP-seq revealed the characteristic pile-up of pol II density just downstream of the poly(A) site in the wild type PSMG1 gene, but in the \u0394pA mutant it was shifted approximately 5 kb further downstream to a new location that coincides with the presence of multiple potential cryptic poly(A) sites with AAUAAA sequences (Fig. 3F). We conclude that a poly(A) consensus sequence is required to induce the pol II pile up immediately downstream of PSMG1 and, by extension, that poly(A) site recognition is required for pol II deceleration consistent with a previous in vitro transcription experiment (Nag et al., 2006).Poly(A) site dependent loss of Spt5 phosphorylationOur results raise a critical question: how does poly(A) site recognition lead to pol II deceleration? Based on previous work in yeast (Baejen et al., 2017; Parua et al., 2018), we enquired whether Spt5 could be involved in an \u201callosteric\u201d change in the EC at poly(A) sites. Anti-Spt5 ChIP-seq showed that, like pol II, Spt5 accumulated in 3\u2019 flanking regions when termination was inhibited by Xrn2 D235A. This accumulation is evident on individual genes and metaplots of several thousand genes show it is a general phenomenon (Fig. 4A, \u200b,B,B, S3B). We conclude that the pol II-Spt5 interaction persists within slow ECs in the termination zone.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.Poly(A) site-dependent loss of Spt5 phosphorylation in termination zones.(A-B) Slow elongating pol II complexes are bound by hypo-phosphorylated Spt5 downstream of the poly(A) site.(A) ChIP-seq of Pol II, total Spt5 and phospho-Spt5 (Spt5-PO4) in cells expressing WT D235A (MT) Xrn2 after adding triptolide (10 \u03bcM 20min).

Note NS1A reduces pol II and Spt5, but not Spt5-PO4 in the termination zone (red arrows). The reduced Spt5 signal at 5\u2019 pause site NS1A expressing cells was not reproduced in replicates and its significance is unclear. See Fig. S3C-E.(F-H) Signals from two independent experiments were merged.We next assayed phosphorylation of Spt5 by ChIP-seq with antibodies that detect total Spt5 or its phosphorylated isoform specifically (Fig. S3A). Inspection of individual genes (Fig. 4C-\u200b-E)E) and metaplots of phospho-Spt5 normalized to total Spt5 ChIP-signals revealed two notable features that applied globally. First, Spt5 phosphorylation increased progressively over the first 2-3kb downstream of promoter-proximal pause sites (Fig. 4F, S4G). Second, Spt5 phosphorylation declined sharply within 100 bp downstream of poly(A) sites (Fig. 4G, S4F). Consistent with a functional connection between Spt5 phosphorylation and elongation rate, we note that the transition to a Spt5 hyperphosphorylated state near the 5\u2019 end of the gene body roughly coincides with where pol II accelerates (Danko et al., 2013; Jonkers et al., 2014), and the return to a hypo-phosphorylated state downstream of the poly(A) site coincides with where it decelerates (Fig. 1, \u200b,22).To ask whether loss of Spt5 phosphorylation downstream of poly(A) sites is dependent on termination, we compared phospho-Spt5 levels in this region in control and Xrn2 D235A expressing cells where termination is inhibited. Although total Spt5 accumulates to high levels in 3\u2019 flanking regions in Xrn2 D235A cells, it is not detectably phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, \u200b,B,B, S3B). This experiment therefore strongly suggests that loss of Spt5 phosphorylation downstream of poly(A) sites is not dependent on termination.To determine whether the switch from high to low Spt5 phosphorylation at 3\u2019 ends requires poly(A) site recognition, we again made use of NS1A induction to inhibit CPSF, and monitored phospho-Spt5 and total Spt5 by ChIP. Notably, disruption of CPA by NS1A also impaired the apparent Spt5 dephosphorylation that occurs downstream of genes (Fig. 4G, \u200b,H,H, S3C-E). In summary, the transcriptional slowdown in termination zones (Fig. 1 and \u200band2)2) correlates with reduced phosphorylation of the Spt5 associated with ECs in this region, and this switch is dependent on poly(A) site recognition, but not termination.PNUTS binding to PP1 is required for Spt5 de-phosphorylation at 3\u2019 endsThe loss of Spt5 phosphorylation at 3\u2019 ends of genes could be caused by exchange of phospho-Spt5 for a hypo-phosphorylated isoform or by phosphatase activity. Because the protein phosphatase PP1 and its binding partner PNUTS co-purify with 3\u2019 processing complexes (Shi et al., 2009; Vanoosthuyse et al., 2014), we investigated a possible role of PNUTS-PP1 in loss of Spt5 phosphorylation at 3\u2019 ends. To disrupt PNUTS-PP1 we induced expression of the PNUTS W401A protein, which is mutated in the PP1 interaction motif (Kim et al., 2003), and as a control, wild-type PNUTS was also over-expressed (Fig. S4A). The W401A dominant-negative mutant has the advantage that it distinguishes the phosphatase co-factor function of PNUTS from its other functions including RNA binding. We monitored Spt5 phosphorylation by normalizing phospho-Spt5 ChIP signals to total Spt5 after inducing expression of PNUTS W401A or the wild-type control. PNUTS W401A expression markedly increased Spt5 phosphorylation within gene bodies and 3\u2019 flanking regions (Fig. 5A-\u200b-D,D, S4F, G). Importantly, in PNUTS W401A cells, the profile of normalized phospho-Spt5 levels around poly(A) sites differed substantially from the wild type control. Instead of a precipitous fall immediately downstream of the poly(A) site, a smaller and more gradual loss of Spt5 phosphorylation occurred in the PNUTS mutant cells (Fig. 5C, S4F). Elevated Spt5 phosphorylation in PNUTS W401A expressing was not associated with a marked change in the amount of total Spt5 relative to pol II within gene bodies or 3\u2019 flanking regions (Fig. 5A, \u200b,B,B, S4D, E). Moreover, the effect of PNUTS W401A on Spt5 phosphorylation is not a secondary effect of cell cycle arrest as shown by flow cytometry of cells before and after doxycycline induction (Fig. S5A).Open in a separate windowFigure 5.The PNUTS-Phosphatase PP1 complex is required for termination and loss of Spt5 phosphorylation in 3\u2019 flanking regions(A, B) Pol II, total Spt5 and Spt5-PO4 ChIP-seq in cells expressing WT PNUTS or PNUTS W401A mutant that disrupts PP1 binding.

EGFP-PP1b(D63A)-PNUTS (PP-PNUTS) or EGFP alone was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, pulled down from whole cell lysates on GFP-Trap beads and immunoblotted with anti-Spt5 (top) and anti-GFP (bottom). Input lysate represents 3% of the pull down. PP-PNUTS* corresponds to a N-terminal degradation product.(F) Avitag-PNUTS WT and -PNUTS W401A ChIP-seq. Note the discrete peak of WT PNUTS at the 3\u2019 end (red arrow) and redistribution away from the 3\u2019 end in the W401A mutant (see Fig. S5B, C, S6E).(G) ChIP-seq metaplots show reduced 3\u2019 pile-up of pol II (red arrow) and strong termination defect (green arrow) in PNUTS W401A cells. See Fig. S4.(A-D, G) Signals are merged from two independent experiments shown in Fig. S4D-G.(H) PNUTS W401A does not reduce poly(A) site cleavage. Cleavage efficiency was calculated from RNA-seq reads of Bromouridine pulse-labeled nascent RNA before and after doxycycline induction. For each gene the number of uncleaved reads that covered the region from \u22125 to +5bp relative to the cleavage site were normalized to the reads in the region from \u2212500 to \u22121bp relative the cleavage site excluding those that overlap it (see Star Methods). A small increase (P< 2.2 e-16 ) in cleavage efficiency occurred with PNUTS W401A expression.To investigate whether PNUTS-PP1 could directly dephosphorylate Spt5 at poly(A) sites, we used a substrate-trapping strategy (Wu et al., 2018). A fusion of PNUTS with catalytically dead PP1\u03b2 (D63A) was expressed in HEK293 cells with an EGFP tag. The fusion protein was pulled down on GFP-trap beads and probed for Spt5. This experiment showed that Spt5 does indeed bind to EGFP-PP1(D63A)-PNUTS but not to EGFP alone (Fig. 5E) consistent with direct dephosphorylation of Spt5 by PNUTS-PP1. Also consistent with this conclusion, is the fact that in vivo bulk Spt5 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to high concentrations of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid as evidenced by conversion to a slower migrating species (Fig. S4C).To ask whether PNUTS-PP1 is present at 3\u2019 ends where Spt5 phosphorylation is lost from EC\u2019s, we mapped wild type and mutant PNUTS proteins globally by ChIP. Epitope tagged wild-type PNUTS strongly localized in discrete peaks just downstream of poly(A) sites, close to where Spt5 dephosphorylation occurs (Fig. 5F, S5B-D). A substantial amount of PNUTS was also present at 5\u2019 ends of many genes. Notably, the peak of PNUTS density downstream of poly(A) sites is distinct from that of pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation which is broader and shifted further downstream (Fig. S5D). By contrast, the PNUTS W401A protein was more diffusely localized than the wild type with a stronger preference for 5\u2019 ends (Fig. 5F, S5B, C). The delocalization of PNUTS from 3\u2019 ends as a result of disrupting PP1 binding, suggests that the phosphatase activity is also probably no longer concentrated at 3\u2019 ends. In summary, the PNUTS protein closely co-localizes with the site of dephosphorylation, and its mis-localization in the W401A mutant is associated with poor Spt5 dephosphorylation (Fig. 5F). Together these experiments suggest a direct role of PNUTS-PP1 in limiting Spt5 phosphorylation within gene bodies and in the sharp transition to a Spt5 hypo-phosphorylated state downstream of poly(A) sites.PNUTS binding to PP1 is globally required for transcription terminationPreviously PNUTS was found to be necessary for efficient transcriptional termination at a subset of genes using a knockdown approach (Austenaa et al., 2015), but it remained unclear if this function involved regulation of PP1 activity. We therefore examined whether specific disruption of the PNUTS-PP1 interaction by the W401A mutant has a termination phenotype. Consistent with a vital role for PNUTS-regulated PP1 activity in termination, we observed that the W401A mutant suppressed termination globally as demonstrated by elevated levels of total pol II extending several kilobases downstream of genes (Fig. 5A, \u200b,B,B, \u200b,G).G). PNUTS W401A not only inhibited termination and Spt5 dephosphorylation at genes encoding poly(A)+ mRNAs, but also at replication-dependent histone genes that make poly(A)\u2212 mRNAs (Fig. S6A-D). A role for PNUTS in termination at histone genes is also consistent with its strong localization at the 3\u2019 ends of these genes (Fig. S6E).The transcription termination defect caused by PNUTS-PP1 disruption is not associated with defective CTD Ser2 hyperphosphorylation that normally occurs when pol II reaches the poly(A) site (Fig. S4B) (Buratowski, 2009). This result suggests that PNUTS W401A does not interfere with pre-mRNA 3\u2019 end formation coupled to Ser2 phosphorylation (Davidson et al., 2014). To test this idea, we measured the effect of PNUTS W401A on cleavage at poly(A) sites. Bromouridine pulse-labeled nascent RNA-seq libraries were prepared before and after PNUTS W401A induction and uncleaved reads that overlapped poly(A) cleavage sites were quantified relative to those immediately upstream (see Star Methods). This analysis showed no detectable inhibition of poly(A) site cleavage by PNUTS W401A (Fig. 5H). In fact, a small increase in cleavage efficiency was observed, whose significance is unclear. We also asked whether PNUTS W401A affects recruitment of the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease. Anti-Xrn2 ChIP-seq showed that the exonuclease associated with ECs that failed to terminate in the presence of PNUTS W401A (Fig. S6F, G). Nor is disruption of PNUTS-PP1 likely to inhibit the Xrn2 exonuclease activity since its phosphorylated isoform is actually more active (Sanso et al., 2016). In summary, these results argue that the termination defect caused by PNUTS W401A is not an indirect consequence of impaired 3\u2019 end processing or Xrn2 activity. Instead, disruption of the PNUTS-PP1 complex effectively uncouples termination from poly(A) site cleavage and torpedo loading.PNUTS-PP1 functions as a brake on pol II elongation throughout the genomeHow does disruption of PNUTS-PP1 inhibit termination independently of cleavage/polyadenylation? We hypothesized that PP1 phosphatase activity is required to decelerate the EC downstream of poly(A) sites, which would promote termination by allowing the Xrn2 torpedo to easily catch up with the polymerase and dislodge it from the DNA template. To test this model, we measured elongation rates by the DRB-release method in cells overexpressing PNUTS W401A or wild type PNUTS as a control. Strikingly, the PNUTS W401A mutant caused a genome-wide acceleration of pol II transcription elongation that was evident both in gene bodies and 3\u2019 flanking sequences (Fig. 6, S7). Median elongation rates within gene bodies increased from 2.2 kb/min in PNUTS wild type cells to 3.6 kb/min in the W401A mutant (Fig. 6D). In 3\u2019 flanking regions PNUTS W401A expression increased pol II speeds more than three-fold, from a median rate of 0.7 kb/min to 2.4 kb/min (Fig. 6D). Note that in PNUTS W401A cells, after the pol II wave front reaches the poly(A) site (5 min. time point Fig. 6D), it continues farther downstream at later time points, whereas in control cells it persists close to the poly(A) in a stable peak of pol II density (Fig. 6D, S7, red arrows). Suppression of the 3\u2019 peak of pol II by PNUTS W401A is also evident in snapshots of pol II density (Fig. 5A, \u200b,B,B, \u200b,G).G). PNUTS W401A also suppressed pol II accumulation at apparent pause sites within genes (Fig. 6A, S7A, black arrows) suggesting that it may accelerate overall elongation rates by suppressing pausing. Importantly, the strong acceleration of transcription in 3\u2019 flanking regions elicited by PNUTS W401A suggests that this phosphatase complex is normally responsible for triggering the transition to slow elongation at the poly(A) site (Fig. 1, \u200b,2),2), and that specific DNA sequences within termination zones are not generally sufficient to slow down transcription. The ability to experimentally accelerate transcription with the PNUTS W401A dominant mutant provides an opportunity to test the model that slow elongation will cause pol II to pile up, creating regions of high occupancy (Ehrensberger et al., 2013). Consistent with this model, we found that reversing pol II deceleration at 3\u2019 ends by expressing PNUTS W401A strongly depressed the peak of pol II density that occurs downstream of most poly(A) sites (Fig. 6B-\u200b-D,D, S7B). PNUTS W401A did not strongly affect apparent promoter-proximal pol II pausing as measured by pol II density at the TSS versus the gene body (Fig. S5E, F). Note however, that if release from the 5\u2019 pause were stimulated by Spt5 hyperphosphorylation under PNUTS W401A conditions, it may not be detected as a net increase in pol II density in the gene body because those polymerases travel at an accelerated rate (Ehrensberger et al., 2013). In summary these experiments show that the PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase exerts a global brake that limits pol II speed within genes; and downstream of genes, it imposes a strong deceleration that is necessary for efficient termination.Open in a separate windowFigure 6.The PNUTS-Phosphatase PP1 complex slows down pol II within gene bodies and downstream of poly(A) sites.(A-C) Pol II ChIP-seq at intervals after washing out DRB as in Fig. 1 in cells expressing WT or W401A mutant PNUTS. Note in PNUTS W401A cells pol II moves faster through gene bodies and termination zones (blue arrows). PNUTS W401A also suppresses pol II pile ups downstream of poly(A) sites (red arrows) and at an apparent pause site within YTHDF2 (black arrow). See Fig. S7.(D) Pol II ChIP-seq metaplots within gene bodies (1 kb bins) and termination zones (500 bp bins). Elongation rates were calculated as in Fig. 1B. Median rates are shown above each boxplot. Note faster elongation within gene bodies and impaired deceleration downstream of the poly(A) sites in cells expressing PNUTS W401A. See Fig. S7. DiscussionControl of elongation speed by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 phosphorylationWe investigated the regulation of RNA pol II speed along human transcription units. Using two experimental approaches, we found that pol II sharply decelerates downstream of poly(A) sites. Median elongation rates decreased from 2-3 kb/min within gene bodies to only 0.1-0.9 kb/min downstream of poly(A) sites (Fig. 1, \u200b,2).2). This slow down accounts for much of the pile up of pol II in 3\u2019 flanking regions, which is a ubiquitous characteristic feature of metazoan genes (Anamika et al., 2012; Core et al., 2008; Davidson et al., 2014; Glover-Cutter et al., 2008; Gromak et al., 2006; Lian et al., 2008) because when transcription was experimentally accelerated, the pile up was suppressed (Fig. 6, S7B). The 3\u2019 pol II pile up was also suppressed by blocking poly(A) site recognition, either by the influenza NS1A protein or by mutating the AATAAA consensus sequence (Fig. 3). These results therefore suggest that the association of CPA factors with the nascent transcript, or RNA cleavage itself, is required to switch the EC into a slowly elongating conformation. Such an allosteric switch that changes the elongation properties of pol II complexes was predicted over thirty years ago as a mechanism for poly(A) site dependent termination (Logan et al., 1987).Three lines of evidence suggest that the switch to slow transcription is mediated at least in part by a poly(A) site-dependent dephosphorylation of the universal elongation factor Spt5 by PP1 phosphatase targeted by its binding partner PNUTS: First, changes in Spt5 phosphorylation at 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 positions coincide with changes in elongation rate. Thus Spt5 phosphorylation in EC\u2019s increased after pol II release from the promoter-proximal pause site (Fig. 4F, \u200b,5D,5D, S4G) when elongation accelerates (Danko et al., 2013; Jonkers et al., 2014), and then decreased within 100 bases downstream of the poly(A) site when elongation decelerates (Fig. 4C-\u200b-EE,\u200b,GG,\u200b,H,H, \u200b,5C,5C, S4F). Second, loss of phospho-Spt5 at 3\u2019 ends requires poly(A) site recognition (Fig. 4G). Third, disruption of the PNUTS-PP1 complex by the PNUTS-W401A mutation increases Spt5 phosphorylation and globally accelerates transcription within genes and 3\u2019 flanking regions (Fig. 6, S7). Thus PNUTS-PP1 negatively regulates transcription elongation rate at early and late stages of the transcription cycle. It will be interesting in future to examine how global acceleration of transcription by PNUTS-PP1 disruption affects co-transcriptional mRNA processing and chromatin modification. Our results do not exclude the possibility that PNUTS-PP1 regulates Spt5 phosphorylation indirectly, however its in vivo binding to Spt5 (Fig. 5E), the concentration of PNUTS polypeptide in a discrete peak immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, and the re-distribution of the PNUTS-W401A protein away from 3\u2019 ends (Fig. 5F, S5B-D, S6E) all suggest a direct role at poly(A) sites. Of course, dephosphorylation of other potential PNUTS-PP1 substrates including the pol II CTD (Ciurciu et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010) might also modulate elongation, but no CTD dephosphorylation has yet been identified specifically in the vicinity of poly(A) sites.Control of elongation rate and the mechanism of transcription terminationThe deceleration by at least 2-3 fold that occurs within ~100 bp downstream of poly(A) sites (Fig. 1, \u200b,2)2) is predicted to facilitate termination by converting the pol II EC into an easy target or \u201csitting duck\u201d that can be quickly tracked down by the Xrn2 torpedo. In other words, pol II deceleration biases the kinetic competition between pol II and the Xrn2 torpedo that pursues it (Fong et al., 2015). The \u201csitting duck torpedo\u201d mechanism of poly(A) site dependent termination comprises essential elements of both the torpedo and allosteric models that have been debated for over 30 years (Libri, 2015) (Fig. 7). We propose that termination requires both transcript cleavage that provides access to the Xrn2 exonuclease \u201ctorpedo\u201d and poly(A) site-dependent deceleration of transcription that converts the polymerase into a viable target for the \u201ctorpedo\u201d to track down and dislodge from the DNA template.Open in a separate windowFigure 7.The sitting duck torpedo model of pol II transcription terminationModel for the control of pol II elongation rate by PNUTS-PP1 dephosphorylation of Spt5. PNUTS-PP1 is recruited to 5\u2019 ends and slows transcription elongation by dephosphorylation of Spt5 and potentially other substrates. Phosphorylation of Spt5 by PTEFb and/or Cdk7 releases the brake on pol II to accelerate elongation but PNUTS-PP1 continues to limit elongation rate within gene bodies. Recognition of the poly(A) site (PAS) by a complex that includes PNUTS-PP1 is proposed to activate/de-repress the phosphatase resulting in Spt5 de-phosphorylation. Spt5 dephosphorylation restores its negative elongation activity that causes pol II to decelerate. Slow elongating pol II is an easy target or \u201csitting duck\u201d for the torpedo exonuclease Xrn2 that chases down and helps dissociate pol II from the DNA template.This hybrid model can account for the finding that poly(A) site cleavage is not always sufficient to induce termination (Osheim et al., 1999). It also explains the puzzling observation that there are distinct outcomes for pol II when termination is inhibited in different ways (Eaton et al., 2018). When the Xrn2 exonuclease is inactivated, polymerases still undergo poly(A) site-dependent deceleration so they do not travel far into the 3\u2019 flanking region (Figs. 1, \u200b,2).2). In contrast, when 3\u2019 processing is prevented by CPSF73 depletion (Eaton et al., 2018), NS1A expression, or elimination of the AAUAAA element (Fig. 3), then rapid elongation persists, the pol II pile up is circumvented, and ECs travel much further into the 3\u2019 flanking region. Poly(A) site dependent termination can thus be disrupted in two distinct ways: 1. By impeding torpedo function either by restricting Xrn2 activity or its access to the transcript by preventing poly(A) site cleavage, and 2. By preventing pol II deceleration, for example through inhibition of Spt5 dephosphorylation at 3\u2019 ends, so the torpedo cannot catch up with its target. It is possible that the strong termination defect caused by mutation of Tyr residues in the pol II CTD heptad repeats works by the latter mechanism (Shah et al., 2018).Poly(A) site-dependent deceleration of pol II has potential implications for co-transcriptional alternative poly(A) site selection where upstream and downstream processing sites compete with one another (Mayr, 2016; Tian and Manley, 2017). If recognition of the poly(A) site converts pol II into its slow conformation, then this would extend the window of opportunity for completion of 3\u2019 end formation at that site before competing downstream poly(A) sites are transcribed. One mystery that remains however is whether pol II deceleration requires cleavage of the nascent RNA or just assembly of a 3\u2019 processing complex on the poly(A) site.At poly(A) sites we propose that PP1 activity is up-regulated to dephosphorylate Spt5. PNUTS-PP1 forms part of the CPA apparatus (Shi et al., 2009; Vanoosthuyse et al., 2014) and its phosphatase activity could be activated or de-repressed by conformational changes associated with poly(A) site recognition or RNA cleavage. In fission yeast, Dis2 dephosphorylates Spt5 at the ends of genes but this transition was unaffected by mutation of the cleavage polyadenylation factor Pfs2, so its relationship to poly(A) site dependent termination is unclear (Kecman et al., 2018; Parua et al., 2018). This apparent discrepancy between human and fission yeast systems could reflect a mechanistic difference, or alternatively the pfs2 mutant may not block assembly of CPA complexes sufficiently to affect Spt5 dephosphorylation. Another difference between species is that in S. pombe Spt5 dephosphorylation is thought to cause its displacement from pol II by the termination factor Seb1 (Kecman et al., 2018) whereas in human cells dephosphorylated Spt5 persists in association with pol II throughout the termination zone (Fig. 4A-\u200b-E,E, S3B). Furthermore, the association of Spt5 with slow pol II elongation complexes downstream of poly(A) sites shows that binding of this factor is not always sufficient to promote rapid elongation (Baluapuri et al., 2019).Similar roles for Spt5 and NusG in control of transcriptional speed and terminationHow might the phosphorylation status of Spt5 flip a switch between slow and fast modes of elongation? Spt5 dephosphorylation could alter the conformation of the EC directly or alternatively it could work indirectly through recruitment or release of an associated factor. Phosphorylation of Spt5 could relieve a brake exerted by binding of the unphosphorylated protein to pol II. One possibility is that dephosphorylation enhances Spt5 binding to the nascent transcript, which might in turn slow down transcription. In this context it is interesting to note that a sharp increase in RNA binding was detected by Spt5 PAR-CLIP immediately downstream of poly(A) sites in budding yeast (Baejen et al., 2017). CTR1 phosphorylation might also influence elongation rate by regulating interaction with other elongation/termination factors like the Rtf1 subunit of the Paf1 complex (Wier et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2009) that synergizes with TFIIS (Kim et al., 2010) to stimulate elongation by permitting backtracked complexes to resume transcription. Pol II backtracking is a major limiting factor for transcription elongation in human cells, and the frequency of backtracking is elevated downstream of poly(A) sites, but the basis for this phenomenon is unknown (Sheridan et al 2019). It seems likely that the switch to slow elongation at poly(A) sites might involve an increased propensity to backtrack. Interestingly the NusG homologue of Spt5 controls backtracking of E. coli RNA polymerase by altering the conformation of the transcription bubble (Turtola and Belogurov, 2016). It is also possible that Spt5 dephosphorylation alters the pol II active site conformation (Vos et al., 2018b) and induces slow elongation independently of backtracking. It will be of interest in future to investigate how the PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase affects pol II elongation at high resolution. The poly(A) site activated brake on transcription mediated through Spt5 likely reflects an ancient dual role of this protein family in coupling control of elongation rate with termination. In bacteria NusG family members regulate termination by the Rho helicase (Artsimovitch and Knauer, 2019; Ray-Soni et al., 2016), which chases RNA polymerase in an analogous fashion to the Xrn2 exonuclease. We speculate that hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated isoforms of Spt5 in eukaryotes enhance or suppress termination like NusG in bacteria by biasing the kinetic competition between polymerases and the factors that pursue them, Xrn2/Rat1 and Rho respectively. In addition to control of termination, it is also possible that PNUTS-PP1 regulation of elongation rate could occur within gene bodies in response to intrinsic or environmental stimuli.

The cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 200 \u03bcg/mL hygromycin B, 6.5 \u03bcg/mL blasticidin, and penicillin/streptomycin. All experiments were performed after induction with 2\u03bcg/mL doxycycline for 24 hr.HEK293 cells expressing doxycycline inducible human Avitag-PNUTS and Avitag-PNUTS(W401A) were made by infection with lentiviruses made with the vector pCW57 Avitag (bla), a derivative of pCW57-MCS1-P2A-MCS2 (neo) Addgene 89180 (a gift from Adam Karpf) with blasticidin selection (6.5 \u03bcg/ml). Codon optimized PNUTS ORF\u2019s were synthesized by Genewiz.Hap1 haploid cells (Carette et al., 2012) with mutant PSMG1 poly(A) signal (Hap1 PSMG1 \u0394pA) were made by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. Cells were transfected with the gRNA expression vector in pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 (Feng Zhang, Addgene plasmid #42230), a single-stranded DNA donor oligonucleotide with a BamHI site replacing the AATAAA motif (see Table S2) and a pEGFP expression plasmid. GFP-positive cells were isolated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and seeded at low density for colony formation. Individual CRISPR-modified cell colonies were identified by PCR amplification of the PSMG1 target region and screening of PCR amplicons sensitive to BamHI digestion.

Rabbit anti-Avitag was purchased from GenScript (A00674) and rabbit anti-GFP was from abcam (ab290). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA was 12CA5. Rat anti-CTD Ser2-P (3E10) was purchased from Chromotek. Rabbit anti-Spt5-PO4 was raised against recombinant His-tagged human Spt5 C-terminus (aa 703-1087) that was phosphorylated in Hela nuclear extract (McCracken et al., 1997). Antiserum was depleted 5 times on a column of unphosphorylated Spt5 C-terminus.PP1 Substrate Trapping HEK293 cells (10 cm plate) were transfected with EGFP-PP1\u03b2D63A-PNUTS, lacking the C terminal 8 residues of PNUTS, (Wu et al., 2018) or EGFP expression plasmid (5 mg) using Lipofectamine 2000 and cells were harvested after 30 hr. Extracts in 200 \u03bcl lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mM potassium acetate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP40) were digested with 20 units Benzonase (Novagen) for 40 min. at 4\u00b0 then sonicated in a Picoruptor for 5 min. and insoluble material removed by centrifugation (15 min. in a microfuge). Extract was nutated with GFP-Trap agarose (Chromotek) at 4\u00b0 for 1 hr. and beads were washed 5X with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40 at 4\u00b0 and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer.Immunoblotting Immunoblots were developed with HRP conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody (DAKO, P0217) and ECL Plus (Perkin Elmer, NEL103E001EA).Flow cytometry HEK293 pCW57 PNUTS W401A cells were collected + and \u2212 26 hr. induction with doxycycline (2 \u03bcg/ml) and were incubated in Krishan stain for 72 hours before performing flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter Gallios 561. ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) was used for cell cycle analysis.ChIP-seq ChIP of human extracts has been described previously (Glover-Cutter et al., 2008). Extracts were sonicated using a Covaris ultrasonicator. 1 mg of each sonicated lysate was pre-cleared with 30 \u03bcl protein A sepharose beads (Life technologies, 101042) for 1 hr. at 4\u00b0C. Pre-cleared lysates were mixed with 30 \u03bcl protein A sepharose beads (blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA and 0.5 mg/ml E. coli tRNA) and 15\u03bcl of rabbit anti-total pol II CTD serum, rabbit anti-Spt5, rabbit anti-Spt5-PO4 or 5 \u03bcg anti-Avitag antibody, or 25 \u03bcl rat anti-Ser2-PO4-CTD antibody. For Ser2-PO4 IPs, used 4.5 \u03bcl rabbit anti-rat IgG secondary (Jackson labs, 312-005-003).Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq 4000 (1\u00d750) or NovaSeq 6000 (2\u00d7150). Adapters were trimmed using cutadapt version 1.16 and reads were mapped to the hg19 UCSC human genome (Feb. 2009) with Bowtie2 version 2.3.2. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard Tools version 2.18.7. Read coordinates were collapsed to a single base pair and centered assuming a fragment size of 180 bp.ChIP-seq Metaplots ChIP-seq reads mapped to the hg19 human genome were normalized to the total number of mapped reads and mean values for each bin were plotted. 100 bp bins were used unless indicated. The 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 metaplots included genes containing at least one mapped read in the region, and were in common between all ChIP-seq datasets. The 3\u2019 metaplots included genes separated by >12 kb from other transcription units, containing at least one mapped read in the region, and were in common between all ChIP-seq datasets.Mean Spt5-PO4 ChIP-seq signal was divided by the mean Spt5 ChIP-seq signal for each bin after normalization to the total number of mapped reads. Similar results were obtained if the ratio of Spt5-PO4 / Spt5 ChIP-seq signal was calculated for each bin of each gene. In the latter case for bins that lacked Spt5 ChIP-seq signal, a pseudo count (smallest Spt5 ChIP-seq value for the gene / 2) was used. Relative frequency was calculated as total read counts for each bin within a gene divided by the sum total of read counts in all bins for that gene. Means of relatively frequencies for gene groups were plotted.Correlations between replicates are shown in in Table S1.Bru-seq Nascent RNA sequencing by Bru-seq was performed as described (Paulsen et al., 2014; Sheridan et al., 2019) (Sheridan et al., 2019) with minor modifications. HEK293 PNUTS W401A cells + and \u2212 doxycycline induction (2 \u03bcg/ml, 24hrs) were incubated with 2 mM Bromouridine in fresh medium + or \u2212 doxycycline for 30 min. Labeled RNA was immunopurified with B44 monoclonal anti-BrdU (Gratzner, 1982) immobilized on protein A Dynabeads with rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Immunoprecipitation of fragmented RNA (30-50 \u03bcg fragmented with Ambion AM8740) was in 10mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1% NP40, 0.3% Empigen, 20\u03bcg/ml heparin, 0.5mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. Beads were washed 4X in the same buffer and RNA was eluted in 5mM DTT at 95\u00b0 for 3 min. RNA-seq libraries were made with the KAPA biosciences stranded RNA-seq kit (KK8401) and sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 4000 (1\u00d750 or 1\u00d7150). After filtering out rRNA, reads were mapped to the hg19 UCSC human genome (Feb. 2009) with Bowtie2 version 2.3.2.Calculation of poly(A) site cleavage efficiency Co-transcriptional poly(A) site cleavage efficiency was estimated by quantifying the number of uncleaved Bruseq reads that completely overlap a 10 base region spanning cleavage sites annotated in Refseq. This value was normalized by dividing into the number of reads in the region from \u2212500 to \u22121bp upstream of the poly(A) site. Genes selected for analysis had a minimum read depth/bp of 10 and 5 respectively in the 500bp regions upstream and downstream of the poly(A) site, excluding reads that overlap the cleavage site, with a ratio of downstream/upstream read depth > 0.2 in both the uninduced and doxycycline induced samples. Similarly, no inhibition of cleavage by PNUTS W401A was observed when uncleaved reads were normalized by the read number in region from \u22121000 to \u2212500 bp relative to the cleavage site.Calculation of elongation rates Cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM DRB for 2.5 hrs. For DRB pol II ChIP-seq experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in -DRB media for 0, 5, 10, or 15 min before crosslinking. To calculate elongation rates for the gene body region, pol II ChIP-seq reads were divided into 1 kb bins for the region from +1 kb to +60 kb downstream of the TSS. The signal from the 0 min time point was subtracted from the other time points. A two-state hidden Markov model implemented using the depmixS4 R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/depmixS4/index.html was used to assign a state to each bin. State 1 included regions containing high signal that should correspond to the pol II wave and state 2 corresponded to regions of low signal. The front edge of the pol II wave was determined by identifying the most downstream position where there were five consecutive bins assigned to state 1. Elongation rates were calculated using the distances pol II traveled at the 10 and 15 min time points. This analysis only included non-overlapping genes >60 kb in length that had a 15 min wave that was detected downstream of a 10 min wave.To calculate elongation rates for the termination zone, pol II ChIP-seq reads were divided into 500 bp bins for the region from the poly(A) site to +50 kb downstream. Pol II waves were identified and elongation rates were calculated as described above. This analysis only included genes that were <20 kb in length and that had no overlapping genes within 50 kb downstream of the poly(A) site.To calculate gene body elongation rates from receding pol II waves, transcription initiation was inhibited by treating cells with 10 \u03bcM triptolide for 5, 10, 20, or 30 min before crosslinking. Pol II ChIP-seq reads were divided into 1 kb bins for the region from +1 kb to +60 kb downstream of the TSS. A two-state hidden Markov model was used to assign a state to each bin as described above. State 1 included regions of low signal and state 2 included regions of high signal, which should correspond to the receding pol II wave. The upstream edge of the receding pol II wave was determined by identifying the most upstream position where there were five consecutive bins assigned to state 2. Elongation rates were calculated using the distances pol II traveled at the 10 and 20 min time points. This analysis only included non-overlapping genes >60 kb in length that had a 20 min wave that was detected downstream of a 10 min wave.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisStatistical details are provided in figure legends. The number of replicates and the correlations between them are provided in Table S1. Significance was defined by p-values determined by using the Welch t-test. When appropriate, p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni-Holm method.Data and Code AvailabilitySequencing Data are available at {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE134198\",\"term_id\":\"134198\"}}GSE134198. \u200b\n                    HighlightsPNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a global decelerator of pol II transcriptionPNUTS-PP1 promotes Spt5 dephosphorylation and pol II braking at poly(A) sitesTermination requires poly(A)-dependent Spt5 dephosphorylation and pol II brakingAllosteric switch converts pol II to a \u201csitting duck\u201d terminated by a Xrn2 torpedo Supplementary Material1Click here to view.(9.3M, pdf)2Supplemental Table S1.
