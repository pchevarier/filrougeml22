Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) that suppresses HIV-1 replication to below the detection limit, these latent proviruses can reinitiate viral production upon cell stimulation or treatment interruption (2,\u20134). The total elimination of this latent reservoir has become a major goal of HIV-1 eradication strategies, and interventions involving latency modifying agents, immune therapies, or gene and cell-based therapies are being investigated (5,\u20137). More recently though, HIV-1 remission or a functional cure have been explored (8, 9). A functional cure entails either null or sufficiently low viral replication that is controlled by the immune system in the absence of ART, while proviral DNA remains detectable. This would allow the prospect of functionally cured individuals maintaining undetectable viral loads in the absence of ART without risk of onward transmission and no ongoing immunological damage that is associated with HIV infection (10,\u201312). One such functional cure approach has been branded the block-and-lock approach, which aims at the transcriptional silencing of the viral reservoir (5). There are unfortunately no clinically available HIV-1-specific transcriptional inhibitors.Transcription at the HIV-1 promoter begins with the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC). The 5\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR), which serves as the viral promoter, contains binding sites for multiple transcription factors (TFs), which bind sequentially to form the PIC. These include NF-\u03baB, Sp1, TATA-binding protein (TBP) (as part of the general transcription factor TFIID), TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIIF, which together direct RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding to form a stable promoter complex (13,\u201315). The PIC is completed by the addition of the TFIIE heterodimer and TFIIH (15). TFIIH is a 10-protein complex consisting of a core (XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) subcomplex (CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1) (16). TFIIH plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription but also in nucleotide excision repair, where bulky adducts are removed from damaged DNA (17). In transcription, once the PIC has assembled, the XPB subunit functions as a DNA translocase, feeding the DNA into the RNAPII cleft, introducing negative supercoiling, and initiating the formation of the transcription bubble (16, 18, 19). The CDK7 subunit is responsible for the initial activating phosphorylation of serine 5 in the heptapeptide repeats on the RNAPII (C-terminal domain [CTD]) tail (pSer5) (20,\u201322). Activated RNAPII clears the promoter but rapidly stalls after transcribing the first \u223c59 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), which comprises a secondary structure termed the transactivation response element (TAR) (23). RNAPII stalls for a few reasons, namely, its association with negative elongation factors, NELF and DSIF, as well as the presence of nucleosome 1 (Nuc-1) downstream from the TSS that occlude efficient elongation (24,\u201326). The high-affinity interaction of the viral protein Tat, which is produced from rare full-length transcripts, with the TAR RNA allows recruitment of the positive elongation factor, P-TEFb, consisting of cyclin T1 and CDK9 (24, 25, 27,\u201333). CDK9 phosphorylation of NELF (leading to detachment from RNAPII), DSIF (converts to an elongation factor), as well as Ser2 on the RNAPII CTD allows transcription to proceed (34, 35). Tat plays a fundamental role in HIV transcription and is key for the rapid and robust increase in full-length viral transcripts from the HIV genome upon reactivation from latency (28, 36,\u201339). The proof-of-concept for the block-and-lock approach was shown with the small-molecule inhibitor of Tat, didehydro-cortistatin A (dCA) in CD4+ T cells isolated from infected individuals and in the humanized mouse model of HIV latency (40,\u201342). dCA directly interacts with the basic domain of Tat, blocking the interaction of Tat with TAR and preventing transcriptional elongation (40). As such, the long-term treatment of cells with dCA restricts RNAPII recruitment to the promoter, and over time epigenetic marks are deposited at the HIV-1 promoter, promoting silencing and blocking reactivation from latency (41, 43, 44).In search for novel molecules that regulate HIV transcription to increase our portfolio of block-and-lock agents, we studied the action of spironolactone (SP). SP is a potassium-sparing diuretic, an aldosterone antagonist that blocks binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and has been approved since 1959 for the treatment of a range of conditions, including hypertension and heart failure (45). An off-target effect of SP is the proteasomal degradation of the ATP-dependent helicase, XPB subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH complex (46,\u201349). XPB degradation is dependent on the 26S proteasome and ubiquitinating enzymes (46). SP triggers XPB Ser90 phosphorylation by the CDK7 subunit of TFIIH leading to SCFFBXL18 E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (50). Despite XPB\u2019s critical role in transcription initiation (14, 16), its degradation was reported not to affect global transcription (51, 52). However, subsequent studies showed transcriptional inhibition of genes highly dependent on NF-\u03baB (47, 51). The two binding sites for NF-\u03baB at the HIV-1 LTR allow NF-\u03baB control of HIV-1 reemergence from latency (53). Lacombe et al. previously demonstrated that XPB degradation, by short-term treatment of cells with SP, inhibits acute HIV-1 and HIV-2 transcription (48).Here, we explored the potential of SP as a block-and-lock agent through long-term treatment of latently infected cells and resting CD4+ T cells explanted from infected individuals. We demonstrated the ability of SP to inhibit HIV-1 transcription in latently infected cells and suppress reactivation from latency by potent latency reversing agents (LRAs), which correlated with loss of RNAPII recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter and genome, without damaging cellular effects. We confirmed that the activity of SP was mediated by XPB via knockdown studies and is independent of the Tat-TAR interaction. Altogether, our results suggest that XPB plays a key role in HIV-1 transcriptional activation, and its inhibition by SP blocks HIV-1 expression. RESULTSTreatment of latently infected cell lines with SP inhibits transcription of HIV-1. SP has been previously shown to block acute HIV infection of CD4+ T cells (48). Here, to explore whether SP could be used in block-and-lock approaches to an HIV cure, we investigated its ability to inhibit HIV-1 transcription in cell line models of latency. We studied SP activity in two established cell line models of latency, OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells, in the presence of ART. OM-10.1 cells are a promyelocytic line derived from HL-60 cells that survived an acute HIV-1 infection. Each cell contains a single integrated, full-length provirus (54). SP treatment of these cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of HIV-1 capsid p24 in the supernatant, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.77\u2009\u03bcM (Fig. 1A). This inhibition correlated with a dose-dependent degradation of the cellular protein XPB (Fig. 1B). Eplerenone (EPL), a more selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist analog of SP, does not lead to XPB degradation (46, 47, 51, 55). As previously reported (48), no inhibition of HIV-1 was observed with increasing concentrations of EPL (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition is independent of MR antagonism. No cytotoxicity was observed with up to 50\u2009\u03bcM SP or EPL following a 72-h incubation (Fig. 1D).Open in a separate windowFIG 1SP treatment inhibits latent HIV-1 transcription in the OM-10.1 cell line model of latency. (A) OM-10.1 cells were treated with ART and the indicated concentrations of SP for 72 h, after which the amount of HIV capsid was measured in the supernatant by p24 ELISA. The IC50 value was calculated using GraphPad Prism. The line represents the mean of three independent experiments, each with three technical replicates. Error bars represent SD. (B) Cells treated in panel A were collected for Western blotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. Protein abundance was calculated by normalization to GAPDH levels and plotted relative to the DMSO control. A representative blot is shown above the quantification of three independent experiments. Error bars represent SD. (C) OM-10.1 cells were treated with ART and the indicated concentrations of EPL for 72 h, and the IC50 values were calculated as in panel A. (D) Cytotoxicity of SP- (red) and EPL-treated (blue) cells in OM-10.1 cells treated for 72 h with increasing concentrations of SP was measured using an MTT assay and plotted as a percentage of the DMSO control. Error bars represent SD from three independent experiments. (E) OM-10.1 cells were split and treated every 72 h in the presence of ART with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP (red), EPL (light blue), or vehicle only (DMSO, dark blue). HIV capsid production was quantified by p24 ELISA. The dotted black line at 3\u2009pg/ml represents the limit of detection (LOD). This plot is representative of three independent experiments. (F) Cell-associated HIV mRNA levels (red) and ERCC3 (XPB) mRNA levels (brown) were measured at multiple time points during the long-term treatments of OM-10.1 with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP in panel E. cDNA was prepared from RNA extracted from cells pellets and qPCR performed with primers in the Nef region. The results were normalized as the number of viral mRNA copies per RPL13A mRNA and plotted relative to those of the DMSO-treated control (blue, set to 100% for each time point). Error bars represent SD from the qPCR. (G) The number of viable cells per milliliter of culture (left) and percentage viable cells (right), respectively, were measured by trypan blue staining and an automated cell counter every 72 h during the long-term treatments of OM-10.1 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL, or DMSO only.Next, we evaluated the long-term effects of SP treatment. OM-10.1 cells were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP and 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 190\u2009days (Fig. 1E), and capsid p24 released into the supernatant was quantified by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In OM-10.1 cells, SP rapidly inhibits viral production by approximately 2.5 logs, with capsid p24 levels stabilizing around the limit of detection (3\u2009pg/ml). As expected, a reduction in the HIV-1 mRNA expression was observed in parallel (Fig. 1F, red line). The mRNA levels of the XPB gene, ERCC3, were either unaffected or slightly elevated by SP treatment (Fig. 1F, brown line). This confirms previous reports that degradation of XPB by SP is mediated by the 26S proteasome and not by reduced XPB mRNA expression (46). Of note, the half-life of SP in long-term culture of OM-10.1 cells with ART was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to be 2.3 (\u00b10.2) days, and cells were split and treated every 3 days. All experiments were performed in the presence of ART unless otherwise stated. Of note, without ART the half-life is 2.9 (\u00b11.7) days. Altogether, these results suggest that, in OM-10.1 cells, SP treatment combined with ART over time inhibits HIV-1 transcription to very low, frequently undetectable levels without obvious cytotoxic effects in the cells.We next assessed the activity of SP in the ACH-2 cell line, a T cell clone containing a single integrated provirus (56, 57), which harbors a C37T mutation TAR such that the Tat-TAR feedback loop is defective, resulting in low transcription rates (58, 59). SP treatment of these cells resulted in a similar dose-dependent reduction of HIV-1 capsid p24 in the supernatant, with an IC50 of 1.95\u2009\u03bcM (Fig. 2A), which correlated with a dose-dependent degradation of XPB (Fig. 2B). Again, EPL was inactive against HIV (Fig. 2C). Cytotoxicity was not observed for up to 20 \u03bcM SP for a 72-h period or up to 50\u2009\u03bcM with EPL (Fig. 2D). The long-term treatment of ACH-2 cells inhibited viral production by 1 to 1.5 logs, with capsid production stabilizing around 20 to 100\u2009pg/ml (Fig. 2E). As expected, a reduction in cell-associated HIV RNA was also observed (Fig. 2E), while levels of XPB mRNA were either unaffected or slightly elevated (Fig. 2F). No difference in cell viability or cell number was observed over time (Fig. 2G). Differences in the magnitude of SP activity on HIV-1 p24 production between OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells may be related to the level of XPB degradation in these cell lines, 95% in OM-10.1 cells compared to 81% in ACH-2 cells (Fig. 1B and \u200band2B).2B). Given that SP inhibits the transcription from proviruses with an incompetent Tat-TAR feedback loop, as is the case for ACH-2 cells, the mechanism of action of SP is likely independent of the Tat-TAR interaction.Open in a separate windowFIG 2Tat-TAR-independent inhibition of the ACH-2 T cell model of HIV latency and suppression of SIV infection with SP treatment. (A) ACH-2 cells were treated with ART and the indicated concentrations of SP for 72 h, after which the amount of HIV capsid was measured in the supernatant by p24 ELISA. The IC50 value was calculated using GraphPad Prism. The line represents the mean of three independent experiments, each with three technical replicates. Error bars represent SD. (B) Cells treated in panel A were collected for Western blotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. Protein abundance was calculated by normalization to GAPDH levels and plotted relative to that of the DMSO control. A representative blot is shown above the quantification of three independent experiments. Error bars represent SD. (C) ACH-2 cells were treated with ART and the indicated concentrations of EPL for 72 h, and the IC50 values were calculated as in panel A. (D) Cytotoxicity of SP- (red) and EPL-treated (blue) cells in ACH-2 cells treated for 72 h with increasing concentrations of SP was measured using an MTT assay and plotted as a percentage of the DMSO control. Error bars represent SD from three independent experiments. (E) ACH-2 cells were split and treated every 72 h in the presence of ART with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP (red), EPL (light blue), or vehicle only (DMSO, dark blue). HIV capsid production was quantified by p24 ELISA. The dotted black line at 3\u2009pg/ml represents the limit of detection (LOD). This plot is representative of three independent experiments. (F) Cell-associated HIV mRNA levels (red) and ERCC3 (XPB) mRNA levels (dark red) were measured at multiple time points during the long-term treatments of ACH-2 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP in panel E. cDNA was prepared from RNA extracted from cells pellets and qPCR performed with primers in the Nef region. The results were normalized as the number of viral mRNA copies per RPL13A mRNA and plotted relative to the DMSO-treated control (blue, set to 100% for each time point). Error bars represent SD from the qPCR. (G) The number of viable cells per milliliter of culture (left) and percentage viable cells (right), respectively, were measured by trypan blue staining and an automated cell counter every 72 h during the long-term treatments of ACH-2 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL, or DMSO only. (H) HUT-78 cells were infected with SIV239 in the presence of 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL (or vehicle only, DMSO). Capsid production was monitored over time by p27 ELISA. Inset is a representative Western blot of XPB protein expression 12\u2009days postinfection; the housekeeping gene GAPDH is included as a loading control. (I) Viability of the HUT-78 cells in panel H was measured by trypan blue staining using an automated cell counter. Error bars represent SD of two independent experiments.We also investigated the potential of SP to inhibit SIVmac239 in HUT-78 cells. Potent suppression of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication with SP but not EPL or DMSO was observed over a period of 12\u2009days (Fig. 2G). This was accompanied by degradation of XPB by SP treatment as measured by Western blotting on day 12 (Fig. 2H, inset panel). A rapid decline in cellular viability, due to cytotoxic effects of virus replication, was observed in DMSO- and EPL-treated cells where virus replication was allowed to proceed, while the viability of cells treated with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP was not adversely affected (Fig. 2I). These results suggest that SP may be used in latency studies in nonhuman primates infected with SIV.In sum, these results suggest that SP inhibits HIV-1 transcription in established cell line models of latency.RNA silencing of the XPB gene inhibits HIV-1 transcription. To confirm that HIV-1 inhibition by SP was truly dependent on XPB degradation, and not the result of an off-target effect, we knocked down the XPB gene, ERCC3, by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and assessed viral replication. OM-10.1 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector carrying either an ERCC3-specific shRNA or an shRNA targeting the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (shGFP) as the control (since these cells do not contain GFP). In parallel, cells transduced with shGFP were treated with an IC50 of 1.8\u2009\u03bcM and a 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) of 6.3\u2009\u03bcM of SP, as well as 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, to compare XPB levels and HIV replication. After 48 h of culture, cells were placed back on ART and selected with puromycin to enrich for cells containing the shRNA. After 10\u2009days of puromycin selection, HIV-1 capsid production in the supernatant was measured by p24 ELISA, and cells were collected for RNA and Western blotting analysis.Knockdown efficiencies of 60% and 80% at the protein and mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 3A and \u200bandB),B), were achieved with the shRNA targeting ERCC3 while well tolerated by cells (Fig. 3C). Notably, SP treatment resulted in a slight upregulation of ERCC3 mRNA (Fig. 3B) as previously observed (Fig. 1F), which we suspect is a cellular compensatory mechanism for the loss of XPB protein. When compared to cells transduced with the shGFP control, the ERCC3 knockdown resulted in suppression of HIV gag mRNA and p24 production to levels between the IC50 and IC90 concentrations of SP (Fig. 3D and \u200bandEE).Open in a separate windowFIG 3shRNA knockdown of the XPB gene, ERCC3, results in similar levels of HIV-1 inhibition in OM-10.1 cells. OM-10.1 cells were transduced with pLKO.1 puro lentiviral vector expressing either a control shRNA targeting GFP mRNA or an ERCC3 (XPB) shRNA. shGFP-transduced cells were also treated with 1.8\u2009\u03bcM (IC50), 6.3\u2009\u03bcM (IC90), and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP. After 10\u2009days of puromycin selection in the presence of ART and DMSO or indicated concentrations of SP, cells were harvested for Western blotting, p24 ELISA, and RT-qPCR analysis. (A) Quantification of the XPB Western blots from three independent experiments. XPB expression was normalized to \u03b2-tubulin expression and plotted as a percentage of the shGFP control. (B) ERCC3 (XPB) mRNA levels were measured by synthesizing cDNA from cell-associated RNA from transduced cells followed by RT-qPCR. Expression was normalized to RPL13A levels and plotted relative to the shGFP control. (C) The number of viable cells (left) and percentage of viable cells (right) were determined using trypan blue staining and an automated hemocytometer. (D) Cell-associated HIV mRNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to RPL13A expression. Levels were plotted relative to the shGFP control. (E) The amount of HIV p24 capsid protein released into the supernatant of transduced OM-10.1 cells were measured by p24 ELISA. (F) In the left panel, a representative Western blot of indicated proteins from 3 independent experiments. The housekeeping gene \u03b2-tubulin was included as a loading control. In the right panel, quantification of the XPD, CDK7, and cyclin H Western blots, respectively, from three independent experiments. Protein expression was normalized to the respective housekeeping gene expression and plotted as a percentage relative to the shGFP control.

One-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett multiple-comparison test.Importantly, when we compared expression of additional TFIIH components, we observed substantial downregulation of XPD, CDK7, and cyclin H with SP treatment (Fig. 3F). With ERCC3 knockdown, despite XPB downregulation similar to the IC50 and IC90 concentrations of SP, XPD was not downregulated (Fig. 3F). However, although not to the same degree as SP, loss of CDK7 and cyclin H was still detected (Fig. 3F).Altogether, our results strongly support that the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription observed with SP treatment is the result of XPB degradation.Treatment of latently infected cells with SP reduces HIV-1 reactivation from latency. We next investigated whether SP treatment could block the reactivation of latent HIV-1 proviruses when cells were exposed to LRAs. The specific LRAs and doses chosen to reactivate each cell model were selected based on the ability to potently stimulate HIV-1 replication with minimal toxicity. Prostratin, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) activate transcription by induction of NF-\u03baB, while the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) promotes chromatin acetylation, namely, at Nuc-1 on the HIV-1 LTR (60,\u201363).OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells were treated for 90 and 15\u2009days, respectively, with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO, and the levels of HIV-1 capsid production were monitored over time by p24 ELISA (Fig. 4A and \u200bandB).B). Cell number and viability remained stable over time (as in Fig. 1 and \u200band2).2). Once HIV levels had stabilized at maximal inhibition, the cells were treated with a panel of LRAs in the presence of ART and either 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO. After an 8-h incubation period, cells were collected and viral transcription was assessed by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to HIV nef mRNA. Robust reactivation was observed in DMSO+ART-treated OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells (Fig. 4C and \u200bandD,D, blue bars) with all LRAs tested. While some reactivation of HIV in SP-treated OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells was observed in the presence of LRAs, these were non-statistically significant (Fig. 4C and \u200bandD,D, red bars). Similar results were observed in the Jurkat latency models (J-Lat A1 and A2) (data not shown).Open in a separate windowFIG 4SP treatment blocks HIV reactivation. (A) OM-10.1 cells were treated for 93\u2009days with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO. Every 3 days, the cells were split, treated, and the amount of p24 capsid released into the supernatant of each culture was measured by p24 ELISA. (B) ACH-2 cells were treated for 15\u2009days with ART plus 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO and treated as for OM-10.1 cells above panel A. (C) After 45\u2009days of treatment, OM-10.1 cells from panel A were set aside from each long-term treatment with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP (red) or DMSO (blue) and were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of LRAs for 8 h. The amount of cell-associated HIV mRNA was determined by RT-qPCR, normalized to RPL13A levels, and plotted relative to the unstimulated DMSO control. (D) The same was done on day 15 of long-term ACH-2 treatments with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO (shown in panel B). (E) Resting CD4+ T cells from 18 ART-treated, virally suppressed individuals living with HIV were isolated from whole PBMCs. Individuals had to have been on ART for\u2009>1\u2009year with no \u201cblips\u201d in viral load in the past 6\u2009months. Cells were treated with SP for 24 h in the presence of the fusion inhibitor, T20, to prevent new rounds of infection. In the final 6 h of treatment, cells were subjected to stimulation with PMA + ionomycin. The amount of HIV-1 RNA was measured per million cells. (F) The amount of POLR2A mRNA was measured as in panel E. The limit of detection (LOD) is shown by the dotted line at 3.0\u2009pg/ml. Error bars represent the SD from three independent experiments. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05; **, P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***, P\u2009<\u20090.001; ****, P\u2009<\u20090.0001. NS unless indicated. A paired t test was used to compare stimulated to unstimulated for each respective treatment. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to calculate the P values for panels E and F.Next, we assessed the activity of SP in primary cells from ART-adherent individuals living with HIV. Resting CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven individuals with undetectable HIV viral loads, adherent to ART for at least 1 year with no viral load \u201cblips\u201d in the last 6 months. These cells were treated for 24 h with either 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or vehicle only in the presence of the entry inhibitor T20, to prevent novel infections. In the final 6 h of treatment, cells were challenged with PMA/ionomycin for T cell activation. SP treatment reduced HIV-1 reactivation an average of 1.4 log (27.6-fold) measured by RT-qPCR per million cells (Fig. 4E). The expression of a housekeeping gene POLR2A was also measured and showed modest yet significantly increased levels (an average of 0.4 log; 2.5-fold) (Fig. 4F) (64). These results demonstrate that SP inhibits reactivation from latency in primary CD4+ T cells explanted from virally suppressed individuals.In sum, these results show that treatment of latently infected cell lines, and ex vivo stimulated primary CD4+ T cells, with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP dramatically reduces reactivation of HIV-1 from latency when exposed to potent LRAs.SP treatment alone blocks viral reactivation; however, long-term SP treatment does not prevent viral rebound upon treatment interruption. The long-term treatment of HIV-1-infected cells with the Tat inhibitor dCA results in the accumulation of epigenetic marks at the HIV-1 promoter that render reactivation from latency very difficult to occur upon treatment interruption or stimulation with LRAs (41, 43, 44). Thus, we investigated whether SP treatment over time would lead to similar effects. First, we tested whether 10\u2009\u03bcM SP alone was sufficient to maintain HIV transcription suppression in the absence of ART. As such, we washed off ART on day 69 from the OM-10.1 cell culture (three independent experiments) and measured viral p24 production in the supernatant (Fig. 5A, black arrows). A nonsignificant increase in HIV-1 p24 production was observed in DMSO-treated cells in the absence of ART (Fig. 5A, light blue line), while no such increase was observed in SP-treated cells (Fig. 5A, orange line), suggesting that SP treatment alone is able to block HIV replication in the absence of ART. Next, we assessed whether pretreatment with SP would delay HIV rebound upon all treatment interruption; as such, on day 78, DMSO and SP were washed off and cells maintained on ART alone (Fig. 5B, black arrow). As expected, HIV p24 levels remained stable in cells pretreated with DMSO; however, within 12\u2009days, a rapid increase in virus replication back to DMSO levels was observed in cells pretreated with SP (Fig. 5B, orange line). Concomitantly, within 3\u2009days of treatment interruption, we observed a rapid rebound in XPB protein levels as well as other TFIIH components (XPD, CDK7, and cyclin H) (Fig. 5C). In fact, XPB levels rebounded above the level of the DMSO control and remained elevated for at least 9\u2009days post treatment interruption (Fig. 5C, orange lanes versus light blue lanes).Open in a separate windowFIG 5SP treatment of OM-10.1 cells suppresses HIV in the absence of ART, but pretreatment does not delay rebound upon treatment interruption. (A) On day 69 of the long-term treatment of OM-10.1 cells with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO, some cells were set aside and washed to remove ART (indicated by the black arrows) and maintained alongside the treatments with ART. Cells were then treated every 3 days with DMSO+ART (dark blue), 10\u2009\u03bcM SP+ART (red), DMSO with no ART (light blue), or 10\u2009\u03bcM SP with no ART (orange). The amount of HIV capsid released into the supernatant was monitored over time by p24 ELISA. (B) On day 78 of the long-term treatment of OM-10.1 cells with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO, some cells were set aside and washed to remove treatments with DMSO or SP (indicated by the black arrow). Cells were then treated every 3 days with DMSO+ART (dark blue), 10\u2009\u03bcM SP+ART (red), ART with no DMSO (light blue), or ART with no SP (orange). The amount of HIV capsid released into the supernatant was monitored over time by p24 ELISA. (C) Cells were collected every 3 days from when DMSO or SP treatments were stopped (light blue and orange lines) for protein expression analysis by Western blotting. A representative blot of the indicated proteins is shown. The limit of detection (LOD) is shown by the dotted line at 3.0\u2009pg/ml. Error bars represent the SD from three independent experiments.While pretreatment with SP did not result in long-lasting epigenetic control of viral transcription upon treatment interruption, SP treatment alone seems sufficient to maintain HIV transcriptional inhibition in the absence of ART. These important results suggest that SP blocks HIV transcription as a single therapy and holds great potential to be used in combination with other latency-promoting agents (LPAs), with the goal of establishing an epigenetic lock on the HIV genome.SP treatment reduces RNAPII recruitment to the HIV-1 genome. To confirm that transcriptional inhibition is the mechanism of action of SP against HIV, we investigated RNAPII recruitment to the HIV-1 genome. As such, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to RNAPII followed by qPCR using primers recognizing the HIV-1 genome. We sought to identify differences in occupancy of total as well as phosphorylated Ser5 or Ser2 RNAPII (pSer5, pSer2 RNAPII).Three independent long-term treatments (\u223c70\u2009days) of OM-10.1 cells with DMSO+ART or SP+ART (Fig. 4A) were treated or not with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin for 8 h, resulting in a mean 4.3-fold increase in p24 production and a mean 147-fold increase in HIV mRNA (data not shown) in DMSO+ART-treated cells, with no detectable changes in p24 production in SP-treated cells observed (but a mean 5.3-fold increase in HIV mRNA) (data not shown). These cells were cross-linked and prepared for RNAPII ChIP. Without prostratin, with or without SP, a small peak of RNAPII was observed at the HIV promoter (position of \u223c450 nt) with very little occupancy throughout the genome (Fig. 6A). Modest reductions in occupancy of total pSer5 and pSer2 RNAPII in unstimulated SP+ART-treated cells were observed compared to those of the DMSO+ART control (Fig. 6B and \u200bandC,C, red versus dark blue lines). Stimulation with prostratin led to a significant increase of total RNAPII occupancy in DMSO+ART-treated cells, with a peak at the promoter and substantial occupancy throughout the genome (Fig. 6A, light blue line). As expected, a strong peak of pSer5 RNAPII was observed at the HIV promoter in DMSO+ART-treated cells stimulated with prostratin, with a slight reduction in the gene body (Fig. 6B, light blue line). A peak of pSer2 RNAPII was observed at the HIV promoter of DMSO+ART-treated cells stimulated with prostratin, drastically decreasing between nucleotide (nt) positions 1000 and 3500 but increasing again toward the 3\u2032 end between positions 6000 and 9000 (Fig. 6C, light blue line). This is consistent with the role of pSer2 in relief of promoter-proximal pausing (mediated by P-TEFb [65, 66]) and recruitment of splicing and RNA processing machinery (mediated by CDK13/12 [66,\u201369]). A significant reduction of RNAPII occupancy (total, pSer5 and pSer2) was observed on the HIV genome when prostratin reactivation was performed in the presence of SP (Fig. 6A to \u200btoC,C, orange lines). This is apparent at the HIV promoter but most noticeable along the gene body. Almost no pSer5 RNAPII is observed along the HIV genome beyond the promoter in SP-treated cells, while total and pSer2 RNAPII is still detected at both the promoter and toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Importantly, no significant differences were observed in the occupancy of RNAPII (total, pSer5, pSer2) on the promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or in the gene body of RPL13A (Fig. 6D to \u200btoFF).Open in a separate windowFIG 6Treatment of OM-10.1 cells leads to a reduction of RNA polymerase II occupancy along the HIV genome. OM-10.1 cells on approximately day 70 from long-term treatments with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO (Fig. 4A) were set aside and stimulated for 8 h with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin. Cells were then cross-linked prepared for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). (A) ChIP to total RNAPII was followed by qPCR with primers specific to the indicated regions on the HIV genome (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). The dark blue and red lines represent the distribution of RNAPII on the HIV genome in unstimulated cells. The light blue and orange lines represent the distribution of RNAPII on the HIV genome when cells were stimulated with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin for 8 h prior to cross-linking. Data for each point is plotted as a fold enrichment relative to the percentage of input for the unstimulated DMSO control with the first primer set.

Data for each point are plotted as fold enrichment relative to the percentage of input for the unstimulated DMSO control with the first primer set. (E) As above but using an antibody specific to RNAPII CTD phosphorylated on Ser5.

A two-tailed t test was performed for the comparison of the different treatment groups in panels A to C. One-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett multiple-comparison test was used for panels D and E. Error bars represent SD from three independent experiments.In sum, these results indicate that long-term treatment of cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP significantly reduces RNAPII occupancy on the HIV genome and potently suppresses RNAPII recruitment upon prostratin stimulation. These effects are not observed on the promoter or open reading frame (ORF) of housekeeping genes.Long-term effects of SP treatment on the cellular transcription apparatus and cell cycle progression. Previous reports have suggested that short-term treatment of cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP selectively degrades the XPB subunit of TFIIH, leaving other components mostly unaffected (46, 48). Additionally, in short-term studies using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and uridine analog 5-ethynyluridine (EU) incorporation assays, Alekseev et al. did not observe global transcriptional defects in SP-treated cells (51). We thus investigated the long-term effects of SP treatment on components of the TFIIH complex as well as on a few important CDKs and respective cyclins. No significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression of any of the TFIIH components in OM-10.1 cells treated with SP for over 100\u2009days (Fig. 7A, cells from Fig. 1E). However, at the protein level, although XPB was by far the most downregulated protein (over 95%), a clear downregulation of other components of TFIIH (namely, XPD, p62, CDK7, and cyclin H) was observed at all time points compared to that for DMSO and EPL (Fig. 7B). In addition, in ACH-2 cells treated for 15\u2009days with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, a similar but more modest reduction in XPD, cyclin H, and CDK7 subunits of TFIIH was also observed (Fig. 7C). This downregulation of TFIIH components was detected as early as 72 h after treatment of OM-10.1 cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP and did not appear to magnify over time (Fig. 7D).Open in a separate windowFIG 7Effects of SP treatment on transcriptional machinery and cell cycle progression. (A) OM-10.1 cells treated for 108, 114, and 123\u2009days with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP (red bars) or DMSO (blue bar) (Fig. 1E) were collected for analysis of mRNA expression of the indicated components of TFIIH. cDNA was prepared from cell-associated RNA and qPCR was performed. The results were normalized per RPL13A and plotted relative to the DMSO-treated control (set to 100%, dotted line). Error bars represent the SD from three independent time points. (B) In the left panel, a representative of three independent Western blots of the indicated proteins from OM-10.1 cells treated for 108, 114, and 123\u2009days with ART and DMSO, 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, or 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL. In the right panel, quantification of the Western blots on the left, protein expression of the indicated genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, or \u03b2-tubulin, and expressed relative to the corresponding DMSO-treated control (set to 100%, dotted line).

The protein expression levels were determined by quantification of the blots, normalized to the housekeeping gene \u03b2-tubulin, and expressed relative to the DMSO-treated control (set to 100%, dotted line). (D) In the left panel, a representative Western blot of three independent experiments measuring the protein expression of the indicated genes over time (day 0, day 3, day 6, and day 21). OM-10.1 cells were treated with ART\u2009plus\u200910\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO for the indicated number of days before harvesting cells for Western blotting. In the right panel, quantification of the Western blots on the left for the indicated proteins, levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, or \u03b2-tubulin, and expressed relative to the corresponding DMSO-treated control (set to 100%).

Cell cycle stage analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry 72 h posttreatment.

In the right panel, a summary of the percentage of cells in the indicated stage of the cell cycle. Error bars represent the SD from three independent experiments. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05; **, P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***, P\u2009<\u20090.001; ****, P\u2009<\u20090.0001. NS unless indicated. One-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett multiple-comparison test.We also investigated whether long-term SP treatment affected the expression and function of other critical CDKs and their cyclin partners, such as P-TEFb (CDK9 and cyclin T1) and cell cycle proteins CDK2, cyclin E1, and cyclin A. No significant differences were observed between SP-, vehicle-, or EPL-treated OM-10.1 cells (Fig. 7B). Recently, CDK7 was shown to be the primary kinase responsible for CDK9 Ser175 phosphorylation thought to bias CDK9\u2019s binding from BRD4 to Tat (30). Additionally, it was proposed that CDK7 phosphorylates CDK9 at Thr186, which is required for CDK9 activity, though CDK9 also autophosphorylates at this residue (30, 70). Given SP reduction of CDK7 protein expression (Fig. 7B and \u200bandD),D), we compared the levels of pThr186 and pSer175 CDK9 by Western blotting in SP- and vehicle-treated OM-10.1 cells treated for 24\u2009days (Fig. 7E). While potent depletion of XPB and approximately 60% reduction in CDK7 was observed, the levels of total, pThr186, and pSer175 CDK9 remained unchanged. Furthermore, by propidium iodide (PI) staining, no differences in cell cycle progression between treatment groups were observed (Fig. 7F).In sum, although long-term treatment of cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP results in a reduction in protein levels of additional components of the TFIIH complex besides XPB, we did not observe differences in the expression of other important kinases, cyclins, housekeeping genes, phosphorylation of CDK9, or in cell cycle progression.Treatment of latently infected cells with SP reduces HIV-1 transcription without global dysregulation of cellular mRNA expression. Due to the critical nature of TFIIH for RNAPII-mediated transcription and the significant loss of some of the components of TFIIH in addition to XPB (Fig. 3F, \u200b,5C,5C, and \u200band7),7), we investigated global cellular mRNA synthesis defects that may occur with SP treatment. As such, we treated OM-10.1 cells for 15\u2009days with either SP+ART or DMSO+ART (once maximal HIV inhibition had been achieved in the SP-treated cells), followed by RNA extraction and mRNA-seq analysis. For this study, we included cells stimulated or not with the protein kinase C (PKC) agonist prostratin to assess effects on activation-dependent genes. HIV encoding genes were among the most significantly downregulated genes in cells treated with SP compared to those of the DMSO control, particularly upon stimulation with prostratin (Fig. 8A, left and right, red points). Some of the most significantly affected cellular genes are highlighted and labeled in blue [pAdj\u2009<\u20091e\u221210 and abs(log2-fold change) > 1 for SP versus DMSO comparisons (Fig. 8A, left and right; see also Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material) and pAdj\u2009<\u20091e\u221230 with an abs(log2- fold change) > 2.5 for stim versus no stim comparisons (Fig. 8A, middle two panels; see also Tables S3 and S4 in the supplemental material)]. In unstimulated cells, treatment with SP resulted in the upregulation of 49 genes and downregulation of 25 compared to those of the DMSO control [Fig. 8A left panel; pAdj \u2264 0.05, log2 FC \u2265 abs(1)]. Prostratin stimulation led to the differential expression of 758 genes in DMSO-treated cells and 823 genes in SP-treated cells (546 of which were differentially expressed between conditions) (Fig. 8A, middle panels). SP treatment, while specifically affecting the expression of some genes, does not appear to affect all RNAPII-mediated transcription, which is in support of previous studies suggesting XPB depletion by SP does not affect global cellular transcription (51). To determine more rigorously what patterns of gene signaling pathways were affected by SP treatment, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (71). A bubble-lattice plot was constructed to highlight gene sets affected by SP treatment, where the color of the bubble represents the normalized enrichment score (NES) (indicating the number and differential intensity of the assessed genes in each indicated pathway), and statistical significance is indicated by the size of the bubble (Fig. 8B). HIV-encoded genes were significantly downregulated compared to DMSO control, particularly under conditions of prostratin stimulation, indicating the strong specific effect of SP treatment on HIV transcription (Fig. 8B). Of note, with this type of bubble representation of the data, it is important to keep in mind the size of the gene set; for instance, the MYC targets have modest downregulation with SP treatment, but since there are 200 genes in this set, the NES score is of greater magnitude. Conversely, downregulation of HIV genes is greater, but because there are a lot fewer genes in this set, the NES is of lower magnitude. Genes related to DNA packaging (histone- and chromatin-related genes) were significantly upregulated in both unstimulated and prostratin stimulated SP-treated cells (Fig. 8B). Conversely, MYC targets, E2F targets, RNAPII transcription termination, and type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor binding genes were downregulated with SP treatment, which increased in significance upon prostratin stimulation (Fig. 8B). Furthermore, cellular (endogenous) genes involved in the late phases of the HIV life cycle (reactome gene sets [72]) were modestly downregulated upon stimulation, which include genes involved in transcription, RNA processing, and export from the nucleus (Fig. 8B). IFN-\u03b3 response genes were slightly upregulated in unstimulated SP-treated cells, gaining significance upon stimulation (Fig. 8B). Other gene sets related to transcription of the HIV genome, RNAPII elongation, IFN-\u03b1 response, housekeeping, and apoptosis were not substantially affected (Fig. 8B). Heatmaps were constructed from transcripts per million (TPM) data to facilitate direct comparison of gene expression with different lengths (Fig. 8C; see also Table S5 in the supplemental material). All HIV genes were clearly downregulated upon SP treatment and, although prostratin stimulation increased HIV expression, this was substantially reduced compared to that of DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 8C, left). Because of the modest downregulation in genes involved in the late phase of the HIV life cycle observed in the GSEA (Fig. 8B), we examined the expression of individual genes within this set. Expression of transcription-related genes, such as TFIIH, P-TEFb, the SEC, NELF, DSIF, and RNAPII genes do not appear to be substantially affected by SP treatment (Fig. 8D, left). Furthermore, there were no obvious differences in expression of RNA splicing, export, capping, or cleavage genes between SP- and DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 8C, middle). These results are consistent with previous results, in which SP did not affect the transcriptional machinery and cell cycle progression (Fig. 7) but blocked HIV reactivation (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, SP treatment does curiously seem to upregulate a large subset of DNA packaging complex genes (Fig. 8C, right panel), which is often associated with defects in cell cycle progression (73). However, this upregulation might not be biologically significant since, as mentioned above, no obvious differences in cell division were observed in SP-treated cells (Fig. 7).Open in a separate windowFIG 8Potent inhibition of HIV mRNA expression with limited effects on cellular transcription. OM-10.1 cells were treated with ART+DMSO or ART\u2009plus\u200910\u2009\u03bcM SP for 15\u2009days (until HIV capsid production in supernatant in SP-treated cells stabilized to below the limit of detection by p24 ELISA) followed by an 8-h stimulation (or not) with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin. mRNA-seq and differential expression analysis were performed on these cells. Data are from two biological replicates. (A) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes under the indicated conditions. HIV encoding genes are colored red and the most significantly differentially expressed genes are colored blue [pAdj\u2009<\u20091e-10 & abs(log2 fold change) > 1 for SP versus DMSO comparisons (left and right) and padj\u2009<\u20091e-30 with an abs(log2 fold change) > 2.5 for stim versus no stim comparisons (middle two panels)].

The color represents the normalized enrichment score (NES) indicating the number and differential intensity of the assessed genes in each indicated pathway. NES\u2009>\u20090, the gene set is enriched in the SP-treated sample (red). NES\u2009<\u20090, the gene set is enriched in the DMSO-treated sample (blue). NS, unstimulated; Stim, prostratin stimulated. The size of the dots indicates the statistical significance of the enrichment found (log transformed familywise error rate, \u2212log10 FWER P value). GSEAs were computed from the GSEA app version 4.1.0 using TPMs as counts and publicly available gene sets current as of October 2020 (71). (C) Heat map of expression levels (transcript per kilobase million [TPM] values) for selected genes with DMSO or SP treatment, with and without stimulation with prostratin.In sum, SP treatment results in robust suppression of HIV transcripts both in unstimulated or prostratin stimulated cells, consistent with the observations in Fig. 1 and \u200band4.4. While the expression of a few specific gene sets was significantly impacted by SP treatment, we hypothesize that their fold change may not be biologically significant since no major defects were observed in cell growth and viability. Nevertheless, the effects of SP treatment at concentrations sufficient to potently degrade XPB will need to be assessed in vivo. DISCUSSIONInhibiting transcription from latent proviruses is an increasingly attractive approach for a functional cure for HIV-1. The long-term transcriptional inhibition of HIV-1 may lead to a sustained epigenetic repression with the potential to contain viral transcription even in the absence of ART (43, 44). In addition, such transcriptional inhibition may reduce \u201cblips\u201d or moments of detectable viremia observed in some virally suppressed patients as well as chronic immune activation that stems from the continuing trickling of HIV transcription and viral protein production observed under suppressive ART. To date, there are unfortunately no FDA-approved HIV-1 transcriptional inhibitors available. In this study, we investigated the potential of the clinically approved drug SP, which targets the host transcription factor XPB for proteasomal degradation, for the inhibition of latent HIV-1 in various cell line models and primary CD4+ T cells from virally suppressed individuals.In agreement with previous studies, we observed a dose-dependent reduction of XPB protein levels with SP treatment (Fig. 1B and \u200band2B)2B) (46,\u201348, 51), which parallels a dose-dependent reduction in HIV-1 replication (Fig. 1A and \u200band2A).2A). Here, we showed that specific shRNA knockdown of XPB resulted in similar HIV inhibition, suggesting that HIV inhibition by SP treatment is specifically mediated by XPB protein levels (Fig. 3). Importantly, EPL, a more specific MR antagonist, does not inhibit HIV or degrade XPB (Fig. 1C and \u200band2C).2C). Thus, HIV inhibition by SP is independent of MR antagonism and dependent on the degradation of the host helicase XPB. Contrary to previous reports that showed short-term SP treatments selectively degrade XPB, leaving other subunits of TFIIH relatively intact (47, 48, 51), we show that even after a short 72-h period, the levels of XPD, p62, CDK7, and cyclin H but not other cellular proteins were significantly reduced (Fig. 3F, \u200b,5C,5C, and \u200band7).7). These effects seem to be somewhat cell type specific since they were more pronounced in OM-10.1 than in ACH-2 cells (Fig. 7B versus Fig. 7C). This could be explained either by more modest XPB degradation in ACH-2 cells (Fig. 1B versus Fig. 2B), or it could be related to the absence of a functional Tat-TAR feedback loop in ACH-2 cells. This warrants further investigation. It remains to be determined whether loss of other TFIIH subunits is due to destabilization of the complex or to off-target proteasomal degradation. Of note, shRNA knockdown of the XPB gene, ERCC3, does not result in the same degree of TFIIH components loss (Fig. 3F). While reduction of XPB with ERCC3 shRNA knockdown was around that observed with 1.8\u2009\u03bcM SP treatment, we do not observe any loss of XPD and a more modest loss of CDK7 and cyclin H. Importantly, ERCC3 knockdown showed no cytotoxic or cytostatic effects (Fig. 3C). Although shRNA knockdown of XPB resulted in an \u223c80% reduction of XPB protein (similar to treatment with 1.8\u2009\u03bcM SP) (Fig. 3A) with less effects on other TFIIH components, it reduced HIV mRNA levels to a greater degree than 1.8\u2009\u03bcM SP treatment, further suggesting that development of more specific XPB degraders may improve on SP potency and could potentially avoid unwanted off-target transcriptional activity as well as the other known effects of SP on the MR.Treatment of latently infected cells with SP results in a rapid, robust suppression of HIV transcription, and reactivation using LRAs is significantly inhibited (Fig. 4). Importantly, SP treatment blocks the strong HIV-1 reactivation by PMA/ionomycin in CD4+ T cells explanted from ART-suppressed individuals living with HIV (Fig. 4E). While levels of HIV reactivation were substantially reduced with SP treatment (average of 27.6-fold), the levels of the housekeeping gene POLR2A (encoding a subunit of RNAPII) were modestly elevated (average of 2.5-fold) (Fig. 4F). The slight increase in POLR2A observed in primary cells upon SP treatment requires further investigation to determine whether this is a direct consequence of SP activity or is related to inhibition of HIV transcription. Of note, even if not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.78), the mRNA-seq analysis in OM-10.1 cells showed a slight increase in POLR2A expression in cells treated with SP stimulated with prostratin compared to that of DMSO (log2 FC of 0.5). Furthermore, there were no obvious changes in expression of other RNAPII subunits (Fig. 8D, middle).Importantly, SP treatment was shown to be sufficient to maintain HIV p24 production below the limit of detection in the absence of ART (Fig. 5A). These results highlight the potential of using SP as a single drug to maintain HIV-1 suppression, once deep latency has been established, in the absence of ART. However, regardless of treatment duration in the latent models tested, transcription remains detectable, and once SP treatment is interrupted, there is rapid transcriptional rebound to control levels (Fig. 5B). This was not observed with treatment with dCA, where longer treatment periods led to undetectable levels of viral RNA and sustained viral inhibition when treatment was interrupted (41, 43). The reasons for this difference may be 2-fold. On one hand, since a host component of a transcription factor complex is involved, as soon as XPB is produced again above a certain threshold, it can participate and jumpstart transcription from the viral promoter. In fact, the levels of XPB protein become elevated, and remain so for at least 9\u2009days, upon removal of SP (Fig. 5C), possibly due to elevated XPB mRNA levels with SP treatment (Fig. 1F). On the other hand, since transcriptional inhibition is not fully complete, the residual level of transcription may preclude epigenetic repressive mark deposition for complete silencing of the promoter locus. Future studies will address the benefits of combining SP treatment with other transcriptional inhibitors, such as dCA.The RNAPII CTD tail contains 52 repeats of the heptad Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 that serves as a hot spot for posttranslational modification to fine-tune transcription (66, 74,\u201376). Hypophosphorylated RNAPII is recruited to the promoter and is primed for activation by phosphorylation of Ser7 by the CDK7 subunit of TFIIH. Additional phosphorylation of Ser5 by CDK7 activates RNAPII to initiate transcription and escape the promoter; as such, pSer5 levels are highest at the TSS but decrease toward the end of genes. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII occurs due to repressive factors (DSIF and NELF) and occlusion by Nuc-1. RNAPII pausing is relieved through CDK9 phosphorylation of DSIF, NELF, and Ser2 of RNAPII CTD, resulting in a pSer2 peak just downstream of the TSS. Further phosphorylation of Ser2 occurs as RNAPII moves along the gene body, mediated by CDK12/13, resulting in increasing pSer2 levels toward the 3\u2032 end of genes in the gene body and is associated with recruitment of RNA processing and splicing factors (67, 68, 77, 78). Spironolactone treatment results in a loss of RNAPII (total, pSer5, and pSer2) occupancy throughout the HIV genome, particularly noticeable upon LRA stimulation (Fig. 6A to \u200btoC).C). In unstimulated cells, little RNAPII is recruited to the promoter of either SP- or DMSO-treated cells, given the low basal HIV expression in these cells. Upon reactivation with prostratin, some RNAPII was still detected at the TSS in SP-treated cells, even with the robust loss of XPB. This is not unexpected since RNAPII is brought to the promoter during PIC formation prior to TFIIH recruitment (14, 15, 17). However, since HIV transcription depends on the positive feedback loop driven by Tat, a reduction in elongation would result in a loss in recycling of RNAPII and reduced overall RNAPII occupancy at the promoter. RNAPII was barely observed in SP+ART-treated cells downstream from the promoter compared to robust recruitment in DMSO+ART-treated cells upon transcriptional reactivation. This is consistent with the role of TFIIH in initiation and promoter clearance (16, 18, 19). Significantly, changes in RNAPII occupancy (total, pSer5, and pSer2 CTD) were not observed at either the promoter of GAPDH or the ORF of RPL13A (Fig. 6D to \u200btoF),F), suggesting that the HIV-1 genome is especially sensitive to perturbation of TFIIH and the reduction in RNAPII recruitment is specific to the HIV-1 genome. This is consistent with our own results (Fig. 8) and previous work, which revealed that genes highly dependent on NF-\u03baB experience reduced RNAPII recruitment with SP treatment while other more constitutively expressed genes were not affected (47). NF-\u03baB has been shown to recruit TFIIH to the inactive RNAPII poised at the HIV TSS to allow CDK7 phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD (53).TFIIH is a critical general transcription factor involved in the initiation of transcription of most RNAPII-dependent genes, including HIV (14, 15, 19, 53, 79). However, XPB has been proposed to be dispensable for RNAPII-mediated transcription (51). Despite SP treatment mediating substantial XPB degradation and moderate loss of other TFIIH components, SP seems well tolerated by cells treated long-term (Fig. 1G, \u200b,2G,2G, and \u200band3C).3C). In addition, SP does not appear to interfere with cell cycle progression, it does not cause significant losses of P-TEFb or cell cycle proteins, and it has no effect on phosphorylation of CDK9 (Fig. 7). In agreement, our mRNA-seq analysis suggests that SP treatment specifically and potently inhibits HIV expression, while more modestly affecting a subset of cellular genes (Fig. 8). We cannot exclude the possibility that HIV transcription is inhibited indirectly through SP-mediated effects on cellular proteins, since GSEA revealed modest reduction in genes involved in the late phase of the HIV life cycle (Fig. 8B). However, SP did not cause obvious changes in mRNA expression (TPM count data) of RNA processing genes (capping, cleavage, splicing, or export) or RNAPII-related transcription factors (TFIIH, P-TEFb, super-elongation complex, NELF, or DSIF) that could have potentially explained the potent downregulation of HIV mRNA expression (Fig. 8C). Intriguingly, histone- and chromatin-related genes (DNA packaging) were among the most upregulated genes upon SP treatment (Fig. 8B and \u200bandC).C). However, these changes are probably not significant, since no changes in cell cycle progression were observed (Fig. 7).Despite an \u223c95% reduction in XPB levels and between 20 and 60% reduction in some other components of TFIIH with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP treatment (Fig. 7), we hypothesize that there are sufficient amounts of this complex to support basal transcription. Activation-dependent genes, such as cytokines and HIV, which require recruitment of large amounts of TFIIH may be more susceptible to XPB loss (47). These results are not unexpected and are consistent with previous reports showing SP treatment does not globally reduce transcription but rather more selectively inhibits HIV and NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription (47, 48, 51). Interestingly, mRNA-seq differential expression analysis revealed significant downregulation of MYC and MYC-target genes (Fig. 8B). This is consistent with the known role of XPB regulating c-MYC expression through far upstream sequence element (FUSE) binding protein (FBP) and the FBP-interacting repressor (FIR), which bind to the FUSE (80, 81). FBP/FIR act in response to cellular signals to control RNAPII pausing and release through interactions with the XPB subunit of TFIIH to regulate MYC expression (82, 83). It is proposed that FBP and FIR binding to TFIIH regulates activation-dependent but not basal MYC expression (82). The level of TFIIH in cells is tightly regulated and correlates with transcriptional activity (84). Thus, we expect that inducible genes that become transcriptionally very active upon stimulation may be more susceptible to XPB degradation than those transcribed at a far lower rate.Further studies are needed to determine the full extent by which SP treatment inhibits HIV transcription, directly via XPB degradation or indirectly via other altered cellular genes, and the mechanisms behind the increased susceptibility of HIV to SP treatment compared to the majority of cellular genes (51).Although SP has been a very useful tool to tease out the role of XPB in transcription, it will take some additional monitoring for it to be explored for block-and-lock approaches in the clinic. The concentrations of SP needed for maximal XPB degradation and HIV-1 inhibition (10\u2009\u03bcM) is well above the peak serum concentrations reached in healthy volunteers administered 100\u2009mg SP daily for 15\u2009days of around 0.19\u2009\u03bcM. The area under the curve (AUC) at day 15, reflecting the actual body exposure to the drug was 0.55\u2009\u03bcM, which would result in suboptimal XPB degradation (Fig. 1B and \u200band2B)2B) (85). However, SP is used to treat women experiencing hair loss at 200\u2009mg daily without negative effects, and transgender women take up to 400\u2009mg daily presurgery (86, 87). Additionally, the FDA has approved a 4-week treatment of 400\u2009mg daily SP to diagnose hyperaldosteronism (88). The most common side effects reported at high doses of SP are gynecomastia and the more serious hyperkalemia, which requires monitoring (89). XPB is also involved in nucleotide excision repair and has been proposed as a means to sensitize cells to platinum-based cancer therapies (46). The FDA noted that rats treated with 500\u2009mg/kg/day (about 25 times the human recommended daily dose of 200\u2009mg per day) had an increase in occurrence of benign tumors. The risk of treating individuals with a dose of SP high enough to degrade XPB would need to be assessed, and whether or not these side effects will be a major drawback for clinical testing remains to be seen. SP has, however, great potential to be used in combination with other therapies given its very quick effects on HIV. One could foresee the initial use of high doses of SP to reduce HIV-1 transcription to or below the level of detection, at which point SP doses could be reduced and another inhibitor, such as a Tat inhibitor, could be introduced to bring about a state of \u201cdeep latency\u201d from which rebound would be very difficult to occur. Future studies will investigate this combination therapy. Furthermore, combination treatments may allow the use of reduced dosages.Altogether, we showed here that targeting a host component of a transcription factor complex, XPB, reduces HIV-1 transcription and reactivation from latency without obvious adverse effects on cellular transcription. We show that SP acts additively with ART to reduce HIV-1 transcription and block reactivation from latency upon stimulation with LRAs. Even given some concerns with the high doses of SP required for XPB degradation in vivo, our results warrant the exploration of SP as a therapeutic in \u201cblock-and-block\u201d approaches for a functional cure. MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cell culture. OM-10.1 and ACH-2 cells were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (from S. Butera, no. 1319, and T. Folks, no. 349, respectively).

Hut78 cells were infected as previously described (90). Briefly, cells were infected overnight with SIVmac239. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, split into 3 flasks, and treated with DMSO, EPL, or SP (10\u2009\u03bcM) for 12\u2009days. SIV replication was assessed every 3\u2009days postinfection by measuring the viral capsid in the supernatant with p27 ELISA (Advances Bioscience Laboratories; no. 5436).Determination of SP half-life in cell culture. Stability of SP was evaluated in cell culture using an AB Sciex 5500 mass spectrometer run in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Cells were treated with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP (with or without ART), and the concentration of SP was evaluated before and after 72 h of incubation at multiple time points. Cells were resuspended and treated with 2\u00d7 vol/vol acetonitrile to lyse the cells, precipitate cellular protein, and inactivate the virus. Samples were filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm filter plate prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS. LC conditions used a Thermo BetaSil C18 5-\u03bcm, 50-\u2009by\u20092.1-mm column with a linear gradient of water\u2009+\u20090.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B) (10% B from 0 to 0.5\u2009min, 90% B at 2 to 3\u2009min, 10% B at 4 to 6\u2009min). Detection of SP used the mass transition of 417.3\u2192341. Half-life was calculated by plotting the natural log of the percent remaining compound verses time where t1/2\u2009=\u2009ln(2)/slope of the linear regression.p24 ELISA.

OM-10.1 cells were treated long-term (80 to 100\u2009days) with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, 10\u2009\u03bcM EPL, or DMSO, and they were split and treated every 72 h. After 72 h of incubation, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells was collected per condition (in triplicate) for cell cycle analysis. All centrifugation steps were performed at 500\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min. For fixation, cells were washed in 1\u00d7 Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Gibco; no. 14190-250) and then fixed in 66% ice-cold ethanol, on ice, for at least 2 h or stored at 4\u00b0C until the next day. For staining, fixed cells were equilibrated to room temperature, resuspended, and pelleted. Fixing solution was aspirated and cells were washed with 1\u00d7 DPBS. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5\u2009ml of FxCycle PI/RNase staining solution (Invitrogen; no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"F10797\",\"term_id\":\"683455\",\"term_text\":\"F10797\"}}F10797) and stained for 15 to 30\u2009min at room temperature (RT) and protected from light. Cells were acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer using the 561-nm laser with the 617/25 band-pass filter.Transduction of OM-10.1 cells. The Mission shRNAs targeting ERCC3 and GFP in the pLKO.1-puro plasmid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (SHCLNG TRCN0000359264 and SHC204, respectively). First, lentiviral vectors were prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells, with the shRNA vector and packaging plasmids pMD2.g and psPAX2 (gifts from Didier Trono; Addgene plasmid no. 12259 and no. 12260) at a molar ratio of 2:1:1, respectively. Transfections were performed using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC; no. MIR 2305) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Lentiviral virus-like particles (VLPs) were collected and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter, to remove cellular debris, at 48 and 72 h posttransfection. Filtered VLPs were combined, quantified, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Three days prior to transduction, medium was changed on OM-10.1 cells to remove ART to allow successful transduction with the VLPs. OM-10.1 cells were transduced with equal multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of lentiviral vectors in T25 flasks as follows: pLKO.1-shGFP, pLKO.1-ERCC3, pLKO.1-shGFP\u2009+\u20091.8\u2009\u03bcM SP, and pLKO.1-shGFP\u2009+\u20096.3\u2009\u03bcM SP in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SP. VLPs were added to cells and a nontransduced control was included. Cells were washed after an overnight incubation, and ART (\u00b1 the indicated SP concentrations) was added back to the medium. Two days later, cells were selected with 1.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml puromycin (Gemini Bio-Products; no. 400-128P). Cells were maintained in puromycin-supplemented medium treated with the indicated concentrations of SP every 3\u2009days. Ten days post-puromycin selection, cells were harvested for XPB protein analysis by Western blotting and RNA expression analysis of ERCC3 and HIV by RT-qPCR. Additionally, supernatant was collected from each transduction for quantification of HIV capsid protein by p24 ELISA. Cells were counted, and viability was determined by trypan blue staining using the TC20 automated cell counter.Latent HIV-1 reactivation. OM-10.1 cells (after 45\u2009days of treatment with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO) and ACH-2 cells (after 15\u2009days of treatment with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO) were stimulated (or not) with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin (LC Laboratories; no. P-4462-1MG), 10\u2009ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 (BioLegend; no. 570104), 1\u2009\u03bcM SAHA (LC Laboratories; no. V-8477_1g), or 20\u2009nM PMA (Sigma-Aldrich; no. P1585-1MG). This was done in the presence of ART and either 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO. After 8 h, p24 production was measured in the supernatant by ELISA, and cells were collected for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis.J-Lat A1 cells were treated with 160\u2009nM PMA or 1\u2009ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 2 h and then treated overnight with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, EPL, or DMSO, after which the mean fluorescence intensity of GFP was measured by flow cytometry. J-Lat 11.1 cells were treated with 8\u2009nM PMA for 2\u2009h following overnight treatment with 10\u2009\u03bcM SP, EPL, or DMSO.Isolation, expansion, and reactivation of primary CD4+ T cells. Resting CD4+ T cells were isolated from 7 ART-treated, virally suppressed, HIV-1-infected individuals through magnetic negative depletion as previously described (91) and treated with SP (10\u2009\u03bcM) or mock (DMSO) for 24\u2009h. The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20) was supplemented to the cell culture to prevent new rounds of infection. In the final 6\u2009h of culture, the cells were treated with PMA (50\u2009ng/ml) and ionomycin (1\u2009\u03bcM) to induce maximum ex vivo latency reversal as previously described (64). Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA was extracted using TRIzol phase separation and DNase treatment. HIV-1 RNA expression was measured by RT-qPCR as cell-associated polyadenylated HIV-1 levels per million CD4+ T cells (92, 93). Cellular gene expression (POLR2A; Thermo Fisher; no. 4331182) was measured as cell-associated polyadenylated POLR2A levels per million CD4+ T cells.RNA polymerase II ChIP. Three independent treatments of OM-10.1 cells with ART and 10\u2009\u03bcM SP or DMSO for \u223c70\u2009days were stimulated (or not) with 1\u2009\u03bcM prostratin for 8 h. Supernatant and cells were collected for p24 ELISA and RT-qPCR analysis, respectively, and remaining cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched by 0.125 M glycine for 5\u2009min at room temperature. Cells were lysed using an SDS lysis buffer, and lysates were sonicated 16 times for 10-s bursts on ice to generate sheared chromatin of 200 to 400 nucleotides in the presence of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche; no. 4693132001) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich; no. P0044-1ML). The protein concentration of the precleared sonicated lysate was determined using the Bradford protein assay. A 4% fraction of each sonicated lysate was reserved for the input control. Four\u2009micrograms (per condition) of each of the antibodies total RNAP II (Millipore; no. 05-623), pSer5 RNAPII CTD (Active Motif; no. 61986), and pSer2 RNAPII CTD (Active Motif; no. 61984) or isotype controls mouse IgG (Invitrogen; no. 31903) or rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific; no. 029602) were conjugated to protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific; no. 10003D) for 20\u2009min, rotating at RT. A total of 500\u2009\u03bcg precleared protein lysate was added to the conjugated beads for immunoprecipitation (IP) overnight with rotation at 4\u00b0C. Dynabeads were washed using magnetic separation. Samples were then treated (including input samples) with freshly prepared digestion buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml RNase A [Thermo Scientific; no. EN0531]) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Cross-links were reversed for at least 4 h shaking (1,000\u2009rpm) at 65\u00b0C with 200\u2009nM NaCl. DNA samples were then treated with proteinase K (Fisher Scientific; no. BP1700100) shaking (1,000\u2009rpm) at 60\u00b0C for 1 h. Dynabeads were removed, and DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen; no. 28106). qPCR was performed in 384-well format using SensiFast SYBR No-ROX kit (Bioline; no. BIO-98020). The average threshold cycle (CT) value of the IgG-only background for each primer was subtracted from the CT value using the HIV-1 primer. The data were then normalized to input values using the following formula: % of input = [2-\u2202CT(IP) \u2013 2-\u2202CT(IgG)] \u00d7 4.mRNA-seq library preparation. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen; no. 74106). RNA was DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen; no. AM1907). Total RNA was quantified on the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and run on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA pico chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for quality assessment. mRNA was selectively isolated from total RNA (500\u2009ng) using poly-T oligonucleotides attached to magnetic beads according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines in the NEBNext poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module (catalog no. E7490; NEB, Ipswich, MA). The library preparation from the enriched mRNA was conducted according to NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA kit (catalog no. E7760; NEB, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, the enriched mRNA samples were chemically fragmented at 94\u00b0C for 15 min. The fragmented RNA was random hexamer primed and reverse transcribed to generate the first-strand cDNA. The second strand was synthesized after removing the RNA template and incorporating dUTP in place of dTTP. The incorporation of dUTP quenches the second strand during the PCR amplification step later, and therefore the strand information was preserved. The purified double-stranded (ds) cDNA was end repaired and adenylated at their 3\u2032 ends. A corresponding \u201cT\u201d nucleotide on the adaptors was utilized for ligating the adaptor sequences to the ds cDNA. The adaptor ligated DNA was purified and PCR amplified to incorporate unique barcodes to generate the final libraries. The final libraries were validated on the bioanalyzer DNA chips, pooled equally, and loaded onto the NextSeq 500 for sequencing with 2\u2009\u00d7\u200980-bp paired-end chemistry.Read mapping and differential expression analysis. Raw FASTQC files were filtered for read quality using trim-galore version 0.6.1 with the following options: \u2013clip_R1 5 \u2013clip_R2 5 \u2013trim-n \u2013paired (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). Trimmed reads were aligned to the human transcriptome (GRCh38v100) with the HIV-1 genome added as an additional chromosome (REFSEQ release 202). To align transcripts, salmon version 0.14.1 was used with the validateMappings option (94). Aligned transcriptomes were mapped to genes, and differential gene expression was called using tximport version 1.16.1 and DESeq2 version 1.28.1, respectively (95, 96). TPMs were determined using the countsFromAbundance = \u201clengthScaledTPM\u201d option in tximport. All plots were generated in R. GSEAs were computed from the GSEA app version 4.1.0 using TPMs as counts and publicly available gene sets current as of October 2020 (71). DESeq2 and TPM data can be found in Tables S1 to S5 in the supplemental material.Statistical analysis. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism, and a P value of <0.05 was considered significant for all comparisons. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05; **, P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***, P\u2009<\u20090.001; ****, P\u2009<\u20090.0001. Not significant (NS) unless indicated. Data are presented as the mean of the indicated replicates with error bars indicating the standard deviation (SD). The two-tailed t test was used where applicable, and a paired t test was used for reactivation studies to compare stimulated conditions to unstimulated conditions. Comparisons of multiple conditions were performed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated-measures test (Dunnett or Holm-Sidak).
