In myelopoiesis, C/EBP\u03b1 cooperates with other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes to regulate hematopoietic stem cell biology, lineage choice and expression of myeloid genes (Avellino and Delwel, 2017; Zaret and Carroll, 2011). Knockout experiments in mice show that C/EBP\u03b1 regulates hematopoietic stem cell functions and that its removal blocks progenitor differentiation at the myeloid commitment stage (Bereshchenko et\u00a0al., 2009; Kirstetter et\u00a0al., 2008a; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2004). The intronless CEBPA gene is mutated in approximately 10-15% of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. Mutations located within the N-terminal part of the gene obstruct expression of the full-length isoform p42 C/EBP\u03b1 and favor expression of the N-terminally truncated isoform p30 C/EBP\u03b1 (Fasan et\u00a0al., 2014; Lin et\u00a0al., 2005; Pabst et\u00a0al., 2001). Experimental hematology and targeted mouse genetics have demonstrated that p30 C/EBP\u03b1 represents a highly penetrant AML driver oncoprotein (Bereshchenko et\u00a0al., 2009; Kirstetter et\u00a0al., 2008b).Unraveling the protein interaction network of C/EBP\u03b1 in hematopoietic cells is a prerequisite for the understanding of diverse gene regulatory and epigenetic functions of C/EBP\u03b1 in normal hematopoiesis and AML. Previous research has shown that the N-terminus of vertebrate C/EBP\u03b1 harbors short, conserved regions (CRs) that function in a modular and combinatorial fashion to regulate gene expression (Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011; Tsukada et\u00a0al., 2011). The N-terminally truncated, leukemogenic p30 C/EBP\u03b1 isoform contains only one of the transactivation modules (CR1L, TEIII). P30 C/EBP\u03b1 retains residual gene regulatory and epigenetic capacity to direct myeloid lineage commitment but lacks the cell maturation inducing and proliferation restricting functions of the long C/EBP\u03b1 isoform p42 (Bereshchenko et\u00a0al., 2009; Pedersen et\u00a0al., 2001). Only the C-terminal part of C/EBP\u03b1, comprising approximately one-quarter of the protein, may adopt a structured basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain upon binding to DNA target sites (Seldeen et\u00a0al., 2008). Otherwise, C/EBP\u03b1 and family members, but also many other transcription factors contain several intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), short linear motifs (SLiM) and molecular recognition features (MoRF). These are typical hallmarks of gene regulatory proteins that integrate signal transmission, gene regulation, and epigenetic regulation through promiscuous interactomes (Dunker et\u00a0al., 2002; Dyson and Wright, 2005; Tompa, 2012; Uversky et\u00a0al., 2005; van der Lee et\u00a0al., 2014; Ward et\u00a0al., 2004; Wright and Dyson, 1999). PTMs, downstream of signaling cascades, frequently alter dynamic protein interaction interfaces of IDR/SLiM/MoRF modules and are of high biological relevance but remain difficult to capture with traditional immune affinity-based methods because of their transient nature, weak affinity, and/or sub-stoichiometric participation in biomolecular condensates (Perkins et\u00a0al., 2010; Sabari et\u00a0al., 2020).Within the C/EBP family, mutation of PTM sites, including phosphorylation (S, T, Y residues), methylation (K, R residues), and acetylation sites (K residues) or deletion of CRs in their N-termini may radically alter their biological functions (Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). Assessment of the known C/EBP\u03b1 interactome data showed a surprisingly low overlap (less than 5%) between various published immuno-affinity-mass spectrometry (MS) datasets, hampering the deduction of C/EBP\u03b1 functions and adjunct molecular mechanisms (Cirilli et\u00a0al., 2017; Giambruno et\u00a0al., 2013; Grebien et\u00a0al., 2016). Here, we combined the protein interaction screen using a peptide matrix (PRISMA) method (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019) with biotin proximity labeling identification (BioID) (Roux et\u00a0al., 2012) to match high confidence interactomes across the amino acid sequence and PTM sites with the p42/p30 C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms in living myeloblastic cells. This experimental strategy may be adapted to explore other multi-valent intrinsically disordered transcriptional regulators, many of which are involved in development and disease. ResultsMapping the C/EBP\u03b1 interactome with PRISMAWe have previously established the PRISMA method to explore the linear interactomes of intrinsically disordered proteins and applied it to C/EBP\u03b2 and its PTMs (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019). Here, we slightly modified the PRISMA protocol to explore the linear and PTM-dependent C/EBP\u03b1 interactome. Briefly, 15 amino acid long peptides covering the amino acid sequence of C/EBP\u03b1 in a tiling fashion were spot-synthesized on a membrane support. The peptide membrane was incubated with nuclear extracts derived from the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, NB4, and bound proteins of each spot were subsequently analyzed using quantitative mass spectrometry (Figure\u00a01A). The C/EBP\u03b1 peptide array included 114 peptides with and without PTMs that were designed with a sequence overlap of seven amino acids (Tables S1 and S2). The overall technical reproducibility of the PRISMA screen replicates showed a median Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 and discrete patterns of correlation between different C/EBP\u03b1 regions (Figure\u00a0S1). PRISMA detected a total of 2,274 proteins, of which 785 proteins passed the significance threshold (FDR <0.1) in at least one peptide spot (Figure\u00a02B, Table S3). The majority of significant protein interactions were observed with peptides spanning AA 1-15 (CR2), AA 50-85 (part of CR3 and CR4) and AA 134-148 (part of CR1L) (Table S2). Together, C/EBP\u03b1 regions CR2, CR3, CR4 and CR1L correspond to subdivisions of previously identified trans-regulatory regions with high sequence conservation between species and C/EBP factors (Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). Extracted binding profiles, as shown in Figure\u00a02C, highlight distinct interaction profiles of selected protein complexes such as Mediator, or BAF/SWI-SNF components, previously shown to interact with C/EBP\u03b1.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01PRISMA delineates the linear interactome of CEBPA across conserved regions and PTM sites(A) Schematic scaled depiction of CEBPA conserved regions (CRs) and post-translational modification (PTM) sites.

Interactors not connected by any edges were removed from the plot (12 proteins).See also Figures S3 and S4, Table S4.The mediator of transcription complex (MED) is an essential transcriptional coactivator in eukaryotes that interacts with RNA Pol II and many transcription factors and co-factors. PRISMA revealed 17 MED proteins with similar binding patterns with dominant peaks in C/EBP\u03b1 peptides corresponding to CR2,3,4 and CR1L. This finding suggests that the MED-complex interacts with multiple CRs in the N-terminus of p42 C/EBP\u03b1 and with CR1L/TEIII, which corresponds to the N-terminus of p30 C/EBP\u03b1. The acetyltransferases, CBP/p300 (KAT3A/KAT3B), most strongly bound to peptides spanning regions CR3,4 with residual binding in CR2 and CR1L. Interaction with the chromatin remodeling BAF/SWI-SNF complex is essential for the anti-proliferative and differentiation functions of C/EBP\u03b1 and has been previously found to require CR1L/TEIII in addition to the N-terminus of p42 C/EBP\u03b1 (Muller et\u00a0al., 2004; Pedersen et\u00a0al., 2001). In PRISMA, BAF/SWI-SNF subunits bound to peptides corresponding to CR1L and CR3,4.C/EBP proteins are extensively decorated with PTMs that may alter their interactome to direct their function (Kowenz-Leutz et\u00a0al., 2010; Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). Of particular interest are a number of C/EBP-family member specific arginine residues, several of which have been shown in C/EBP\u03b2 to be targets of mono- and di-methylation, with their mutation profoundly changing C/EBP\u03b2 biology (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019; Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). We examined C/EBP\u03b1 for PTMs by mass spectrometry and discovered several known and novel methylation sites, including methylation of R12, R35 and R156 and further identified R142 (CR1L) by a targeted MS-parallel reaction monitoring approach as a novel methylation site (Figure\u00a0S2). The PRISMA data suggested increased binding of the BAF/SWI-SNF subunit SMARCE1 to R142 methylated peptides, as compared to the unmodified counterpart. Other subunits of BAF/SWI-SNF (SMARCA4, SMARCC2) followed a similar trend but their differential binding to the methylated peptide spanning R142 scored somewhat below the threshold set of statistical significance.Given the sequence conservation between C/EBP proteins, we compared the PRISMA derived interactome of C/EBP\u03b1 with the previously published C/EBP\u03b2 PRISMA interactome (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019). Despite some sequence differences in homologous regions and peptides, several shared interactors were identified. For example, the mediator complex was found to bind to the same homologue CRs in both proteins (Figure\u00a0S3), confirming the functional similarity of these regions within the C/EBP family (Jones et\u00a0al., 2002).Cross-validation of PRISMA and BioID-C/EBP\u03b1 interactomesNext, we compared the interactomes derived from PRISMA and BioID proximity labeling data to generate a myeloid live cell validated linear C/EBP\u03b1 interactome (Figure\u00a02A). Briefly, NB4 cells were transduced with a Tet-On inducible lentiviral construct encoding a promiscuous biotin ligase (BirA\u2217) fused to the C-terminus of C/EBP\u03b1. As controls, we used non-induced NB4 C/EBP\u03b1-BirA\u2217 cells or cells expressing only the ligase moiety (NB4 BirA\u2217). Proximity labeling identified 397 C/EBP\u03b1 proximal interactors (FDR <0.05). Among the most enriched proteins were several transcription factors of the C/EBP and ATF families, representing known heterodimerization partners of C/EBP\u03b1(Tsukada et\u00a0al., 2011) and thus confirming successful BioID labeling (Figure\u00a02B,Table S4).In total, 88 proteins overlapped between the PRISMA and BioID derived C/EBP\u03b1 interactomes of which 21 were previously identified interactors, including members of chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation/deacetylation complexes. In addition, 49 proteins significant in PRISMA and 26 proteins significant in BioID have been previously described to interact with C/EBP\u03b1 (Chatr-Aryamontri et\u00a0al., 2017; Grebien et\u00a0al., 2016; Szklarczyk et\u00a0al., 2015). Taken together, 137 proteins represent the subset of myeloid C/EBP\u03b1 interactors with the highest confidence that can be depicted across the linear C/EBP\u03b1 sequence\u00a0+/\u2212 PTM sites. These interactors show high connectivity according to experimentally validated interactions listed in the STRING database (Figure\u00a02C). Using the spatial information provided by PRISMA, we could also reveal distinct functional roles of individual CRs including chromatin remodeling (CR3,4; CR1L; bZIP), transcriptional regulation (CR2; CR3,4; CR1L; CR6; bZIP), and hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation (CR3,4) (Figure\u00a0S4, Table S5). CR3,4 is of particular interest since it contains most of the significantly enriched GO terms, confirming the importance of the core transactivating region of p42 C/EBP\u03b1. Although several proteins interacted with CR7, no GO terms were enriched with this region, pointing toward functional heterogeneity.Arginine methylation-dependent interaction of BAF/SWI-SNF complex subunitsDifferential interactions with post-translationally modified peptides in the primary C/EBP\u03b1 sequence were also detected by PRISMA. Among them was the BAF/SWI-SNF complex that has been previously described to interact with C/EBP\u03b1 (Pedersen et\u00a0al., 2001). PRISMA revealed that the interaction with the SMARCE1 component is modulated by the newly discovered arginine methylation site R142 within CR1L/TEIII (Figure\u00a03A). Accordingly, we performed BioID with an R142/149/156 to L142/149/156 mutant (triple R to L mutation; tR>L) of C/EBP\u03b1 to examine the PTM-dependent BAF/SWI-SNF interaction in more detail. In accordance with the PRISMA results, SMARCE1 and three additional BAF/SWI-SNF subunits (ARID1A, ARID1B, ARID2) were significantly enriched in the p30 C/EBP\u03b1-tR>L mutant, as compared to the WT p30 C/EBP\u03b1-BioID (Figure\u00a03B). BioID with p30 C/EBP\u03b1-tR>L also verified the methylation-dependent interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM33 and the NuRD complex component GATAD2A, as also detected by PRISMA. In addition, several Myb-Muvb/DREAM complex members (LIN9, LIN37, MYBL2) were identified as p30 C/EBP\u03b1-tR>L-specific interactors, but were not detected in PRISMA.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03BAF/SWI-SNF complex subunit SMARCE1 preferentially interacts with R142 methylated CEBPA(A) PRISMA interaction profile of proteins differentially binding to CEBPA peptides centered at R142.

Significant BAF/SWI-SNF subunits are indicated by bold letters.See also Figure\u00a0S2, Tables S3 and S4.C/EBP\u03b1 isoform specific interactions detected with BioIDThe PRISMA data predicted that p30 C/EBP\u03b1 can still function to recruit major components of the transcriptional and epigenetic machinery, albeit with lower efficiency compared to p42 C/EBP\u03b1. To further examine the differences between the two C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms, we expressed p42 and p30 C/EBP\u03b1 as BioID fusions in NB4 cells to compare their BioID interactomes. The isoform-specific interactomes (Figure\u00a04A, Table S4) confirmed the binding profiles observed in PRISMA: p42 specific interactors bound more strongly to PRISMA peptides corresponding to the N-terminal, p42 unique part of C/EBP\u03b1, while p30 specific interactors predominantly bound to PRISMA peptides corresponding to C-terminal C/EBP\u03b1 regions (Figure\u00a04B). In accordance with the PRISMA interactions, most interactors identified by in\u00a0vivo proximity labeling were found to interact with both C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms (Figure\u00a04C). These data suggest that multi-valent interactions with different affinities may occur with distinct C/EBP\u03b1 CRs, including CR1L as part of p30 C/EBP\u03b1. Overall, p42 C/EBP\u03b1-BioID and p30 C/EBP\u03b1-BioID pulldowns revealed 71 and 9 interactors that preferentially interacted with p42 and p30 C/EBP\u03b1, respectively.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04BioID with CEBPA p42/p30 isoforms disclose isoform-specific interactors in conjunction with PRISMA profiles(A) BioID interaction proteomics (n\u00a0= 4) and microarray RNA expression (n\u00a0= 3) were performed with CEBPA isoform (p42 or p30) expressing cells.(B) PRISMA profiles of interactors showing preference for p42 (log2(p42/p30) > 1) or p30 (log2(p42/p30)\u00a0< - 1) in BioID.

The running score was calculated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) running sum statistics.See also Figure\u00a0S5, Table S4.Proteins differentially interacting with the p30 C/EBP\u03b1 isoform and its PTMs may pose a selective vulnerability for AML cells expressing p30 C/EBP\u03b1. We therefore extracted CRISPR Cas9 knockout study derived dependency scores of the nine p30 C/EBP\u03b1 specific interactors in 18 different AML cell lines using the DepMap Portal (Figure\u00a0S5) (Tsherniak et\u00a0al., 2017). Among the AML cell lines inspected, 9 out of 18 scored as sensitive to TFAP4 knockout (threshold <\u2013 0.5). Two and one cell line tested were sensitive to GATA1 and BCL11A or BLM knockout, respectively. The p30 C/EBP\u03b1 specific binding of the BAF/SWI-SNF complex member BCL11A further highlights context-specific regulation of BAF/SWI-SNF complex interaction to C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms.To analyze connections between the C/EBP\u03b1 isoform specific interactome with the transcriptome, we also performed RNA expression analysis of NB4 cell lines ectopically expressing p42 or p30 C/EBP\u03b1. We found that despite the largely overlapping interactome, the two isoforms induced differential gene expression changes (Figure\u00a04D) that could be attributed to differential interactions with other transcription factors. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) employing immunologic and transcription factor target databases from the molecular signature database (Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2005) (Figure\u00a04E). The erythroid transcription factor GATA1 was found to interact differentially with p30 C/EBP\u03b1; GSEA analysis detected enrichment of a GATA1 signature specifically in p30 C/EBP\u03b1 expressing cells. Likewise, PPARG specifically interacts with p42 C/EBP\u03b1 and p42 expressing cells also displayed significant enrichment of a previously published macrophage PPARG gene signature (Roszer et\u00a0al., 2011). Data from BioID experiments indicated that EGR1 specifically interacted with p42 C/EBP\u03b1. Interestingly, we found that a gene signature based on the presence of EGR1 motifs was enriched in p30 but not p42 C/EBP\u03b1 expressing cells. RNA expression levels of EGR1 were upregulated by both p42 and p30 expression. Indirect interaction of EGR1 with DNA not at EGR1 motifs, but through other CEBPs, has been described previously (Jakobsen et\u00a0al., 2013) and may contribute to the differential EGR1 signature observed. Taken together, our data suggest that the specific interactions of C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms with lineage defining transcription factors are implicated in co-regulation of target genes in the hematopoietic system. DiscussionIn the present study, we combined peptide array screening and BioID to overcome limitations of classical immuno-affinity based interactomes of intrinsically disordered transcription factors, such as C/EBP\u03b1. PRISMA reveals both SLiM- and PTM-dependent interactions (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019; Meyer et\u00a0al., 2018; Meyer and Selbach, 2020) while BioID covalently biotinylates proteins that engage with C/EBP\u03b1 in the living cell and is thus well suited for the detection of dynamic interactions (Roux et\u00a0al., 2012). The integration of both methods fine mapped a high confidence C/EBP\u03b1 interaction landscape across the C/EBP\u03b1 sequence and PTM sites.The core interactome of 137 proteins is highly interconnected and, in addition to known C/EBP\u03b1 interactors that operationally represent positive controls, we also discovered novel associations of C/EBP\u03b1 with proteins involved in gene expression and epigenetic regulation, chromosome organization, RNA processing, and DNA replication. The majority of C/EBP\u03b1 interactions were nevertheless detected in only one of the two datasets. Some of the unique C/EBP\u03b1 interactors detected by BioID may require more complex, simultaneously occurring, multi-site interactions or multiple induced fit processes and were missed in PRISMA. Discrepancies may also relate to restriction of BioID to proximal interactions, the absence of suitable biotinylation sites, or stability during the labeling period. PRISMA, on the other hand, may readily detect distal, secondary interactors, such as in large protein complexes.PRISMA revealed major hotspots of protein interactions in C/EBP\u03b1 that strongly correlated with data derived from the related transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019; Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). The interactors shared between C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b2 may help to explain the partially redundant functions of both proteins (Chen et\u00a0al., 2000; Hirai et\u00a0al., 2006; Jones et\u00a0al., 2002). Many of the co-regulators identified also displayed multiple interactions with several conserved regions that represent subdivisions of previously defined trans-regulatory regions found within the C/EBP family (Leutz et\u00a0al., 2011). The same conserved regions scored highly as molecular recognition features (MoRF; Figure\u00a01B) that may undergo induced folding and transient disorder-to-order transition during contact with partner proteins (Oldfield et\u00a0al., 2005). For example, the region CR3,4 of C/EBP\u03b5 was previously shown to fold into two short orthogonal amphipathic helical regions on interaction with the TAZ2 domain of CBP (Bhaumik et\u00a0al., 2014). Likewise, CBP/p300 was found to interact with PRISMA peptides covering CR3,4 of C/EBP\u03b1, in concordance with homologous regions in C/EBP\u03b2 (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019). Interestingly, CR3,4 in C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b5 are separated by only few amino acids, whereas species-specific IDRs separate both CRs in C/EBP\u03b2, suggesting structural spatial flexibility and independent, yet combinatorial functions of CR3,4.Many regulatory proteins involved in signaling, gene expression, and epigenetics harbor IDRs and PTMs that determine their function and connectivity (Dyson and Wright, 2005, 2016). Multivalent, promiscuous interactions of transcription factors with co-regulatory proteins have been observed before and may relate to context dependent contacts during dynamic gene regulatory processes (Brzovic et\u00a0al., 2011;Clark et\u00a0al., 2018; Vojnic et\u00a0al., 2011). This concept is in accordance with the dynamic nature of SLiMs and may reflect multi-modal regulation with a rapid exchange of alternative interaction partners (Dyson and Wright, 2016; Ivarsson and Jemth, 2019). Modular transactivation domains in conjunction with multi-valency are thought to participate in or to initiate biomolecular condensates that involve dynamic, \u201cfuzzy\u201d interactions with multiple co-regulators in interaction hubs (Boija et\u00a0al., 2018; Brzovic et\u00a0al., 2011; Chong et\u00a0al., 2018; Hahn, 2018; Martin and Holehouse, 2020; Tuttle et\u00a0al., 2018). Remarkably, the C/EBP\u03b1 primary structure shows a very high degree of \u201cfuzziness\u201d with strong predictions as initiator regions of liquid-liquid phase separation in the N-terminus (Figure\u00a01B, red line), while the PRISMA interaction hotspots largely coincide within regions that show maxima of MoRF predictions (Figure\u00a01B, blue line) (Horvath et\u00a0al., 2020; Malhis et\u00a0al., 2016).Our data show that PTMs in C/EBP\u03b1 may orchestrate multi-modal functions of C/EBP\u03b1 by modulating interactions with the components of transcriptional and epigenetic machinery. The comparison of C/EBP\u03b1 WT and the R142L methylation mimicry mutant by proximity labeling confirmed the differential interaction with BAF/SWI-SNF components, as detected by PRISMA. These data are consistent with previous findings showing that BAF/SWI-SNF interacts with CR1L (Muller et\u00a0al., 2004; Pedersen et\u00a0al., 2001). The newly discovered R142 methylation-dependent differential interaction of BAF/SWI-SNF will help to conceive hypothesis driven approaches to explore arginine methyltransferase-dependent epigenetic downstream events.Data presented here further demonstrate that most of the C/EBP\u03b1 interactors bind to both C/EBP\u03b1 isoforms, whereas a subset of 71 and 9 proteins preferentially interacted with the p42 and p30 C/EBP\u03b1 isoform, respectively. Many of the shared C/EBP\u03b1 interactors showed diminished signal strength in p30 C/EBP\u03b1 BioID, supporting the concept of p30 as a \u201cweak\u201d C/EBP\u03b1 variant with relatively few exclusive binding partners. This view is supported by the fact that defective myelopoiesis in the absence of C/EBP\u03b1 was largely rescued by p30 C/EBP\u03b1, although p30, in the absence of p42 C/EBP\u03b1, eventually elicits AML (Bereshchenko et\u00a0al., 2009; Kirstetter et\u00a0al., 2008a, 2008b). Interestingly, several of the p30 C/EBP\u03b1-specific binders (TFAP4, GATA1, BCL11A) affect the survival of AML cell lines. The p30 C/EBP\u03b1 specific interaction with GATA1 may further hint at a role at the branchpoint of erythroid/myeloid commitment in replicative multi-potential progenitors (Drissen et\u00a0al., 2019), whereas p42 C/EBP\u03b1 specific interactors, such as EGR1 or PPAR\u03b3, are important regulators of myeloid differentiation (Chinetti et\u00a0al., 1998; Krishnaraju et\u00a0al., 2001; Lefterova et\u00a0al., 2008, 2010; Mildner et\u00a0al., 2017; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 1993; Roszer et\u00a0al., 2011; Tontonoz et\u00a0al., 1994).In summary, the cross-validated myeloid C/EBP\u03b1 interaction map presented in this study may serve as a resource for further exploration of the biological importance of individual and combinatorial SLiM and PTM functions of C/EBP\u03b1. Beyond the C/EBP\u03b1,\u03b2 interactomes, the integration of PRISMA and BioID approaches may help to explore the linear and PTM-dependent interactomes of many other important intrinsically disordered proteins involved in cell signaling and cell fate determination.Limitations of the studyBoth, the PRISMA and BioID C/EBP\u03b1 interactomes were generated with the human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4. The BioID labeling required a 24\u00a0hr period and interactions with short-lived proteins may be under-represented. Changing cell lines and/or biotin ligases with higher turnover rates may help to identify additional interaction partners.

Microarray data generated during this study have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession number E-MTAB-9947.Experimental model and subject detailsCell lines NB4 cells (RRID:CVCL_0005) were acquired from Leibniz Institute DSMZ- German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Culture, Germany (DSMZ no.: ACC 207). Cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in RPMI1640. For metabolic labeling, NB4 cells were grown in SILAC RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, 100\u00a0mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 25mM HEPES, 28\u00a0\u03bcg/ml L-arginine and 48.67\u00a0\u03bcg/ml L-lysine (light) 13C615N2 (heavy lysine) or L-lysine D4 (medium heavy lysine).CEBPA BioID NB4 cell lines The rat C/EBP\u03b1 p30 3L mutant (R140; 147; 154 mutated to leucine) was generated using the QuickChange Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Agilent #200519). The BirA Ligase containing plasmid was purchased (Addgene #64395). The BirA Ligase was cloned in frame to the C/EBP\u03b1 C-terminus using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. PCR primer: 5\u2019-CGCGGATCCAGCGGTGGAAGTGGTGGCCTGAAGGACAACACCGTG and 3\u2019- TGCTCTAGACTCGAGTTATTTATCGTC. The C/EBP\u03b1 p42, p30 or p30 R3L-BirA Ligase fragments were cloned into the pENTRY2B vector (Clontech #3064) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites and subsequently introduced into the pInducer21 GFP lentiviral vector (Clontech #3044) using the Gateway LR Clonase TM II cloning kit (ThermoFisher Scientific #11791-020). Viral supernatants were obtained from Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech #632180) transfected with either pInducer21 GFP lentiviral vector or pInducer21 GFP constructs containing either p42, p30 WT-BirA Ligase, p30 R3L-BirA Ligase, or pInducer21 GFP-BirA ligase only using Lenti-X Packing Single Shots (Clontech #631275) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. NB4 cells were centrifuged (1 h, 900g) with infectious supernatant collected 72\u00a0h after transfection and 8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL hexadimethrine bromide and left for recovery overnight. GFP positive NB4 cells were sorted twice using an Aria II sorter (Becton Dickinson) three days after infection.Method detailsNB4 induction NB4 cells were briefly treated with differentiation inducing agents prior to harvesting. SILAC labeled NB4 cells were seeded during exponential growth in SILAC media supplemented with 2\u03bcM all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA; heavy), 50nM Tetradecanoylphorbol-acetat (TPA; medium heavy) or solvent only (light). Cells were harvested after 12h (ATRA and solvent only treated cells) or 6h (TPA treated cells) and nuclear extracts were prepared as described.Nuclear extract preparation Nuclear extracts from NB4 cells were prepared as described previously (Dignam et\u00a0al., 1983) with slight modifications. NB4 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000g, 4\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and washed twice with icecold PBS. Packed cell volume (pcv) was estimated and cells were resuspended in 5xpcv of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were incubated on ice for 5\u00a0min, followed by addition of dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltosid (DDM) to a final concentration of 0.05%. The sample was vortexed briefly and immediately centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 600g, 4\u00b0C. The cytosolic fraction was removed and the nuclei were washed with 20xpcv hypotonic buffer (5\u00a0min, 600g, 4\u00b0C). The supernatant was removed and the nuclei were washed with 20xpcv PBS (5\u00a0min, 600g, 4\u00b0C). The nuclei were extracted with 2/3xpcv of high salt buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA ph 8, 1mM EGTA pH 8, 20% glycerol, 1mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors while shaking on a tubeshaker at 4\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min at 750\u00a0rpm. Nuclear extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 18000g for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and the buffer was exchanged to membrane binding buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA ph 8, 1mM EGTA pH 8, 25% glycerol, 1mM DTT) by gel filtration with PD MidiTrap G10 columns (GE healthcare) according to instructions of manufacturers.Protein interaction screen on a peptide matrix Custom PepSpot cellulose membranes were ordered from JPT Peptide Technologies (Germany) and PRISMA was performed as described before (Dittmar et\u00a0al., 2019) with slight adaptations. All washing and incubation steps were performed at 4\u00b0C on a rocking platform set to 700\u00a0rpm. Membranes were wetted in membrane binding buffer for 15\u00a0min, followed by a blocking step with 1\u00a0mg/ml yeast tRNA in membrane binding buffer for 10\u00a0min. Membranes were washed 5 x for 5\u00a0min with membrane binding buffer and incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 30\u00a0min. The protein extract was removed and the membranes were washed 3 x 5\u00a0min with membrane binding buffer. The individual peptide spots were punched out with a 2mm biopsy puncher and placed into single wells of a 96-well plate containing 20\u03bcl denaturation buffer (6M urea, 2M thiourea, 10mM HEPES pH 8). The samples were digested in solution on a PAL robot system. In brief, proteins were reduced with 1mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for 30\u00a0min followed by alkylation with 5mM 2-chloroacetamide for 20\u00a0min. To each sample 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of sequencing grade lysyl endopeptidase (LysC, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) was added. Samples were digested for 2 h before being diluted with four volumes of 50mM ammonium-bi-carbonate and continuation of the digestion overnight at room temperature. Digested samples were acidified with formic acid and desalted with C18 stage tips as described before (Rappsilber et\u00a0al., 2003). Briefly, 3 disks of 3MTM EmporeTM C18 material were placed into 200\u00a0\u03bcl pipet tips and resulting stage tips were conditioned with 50\u00a0\u03bcl methanol, followed by 100\u00a0\u03bcl elution buffer (50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) and 100\u00a0\u03bcl 0.1% formic acid. Acidified samples were loaded, washed three times with 100\u00a0\u03bcl 0.1% formic acid and eluted with 50\u00a0\u03bcl elution buffer. All steps were performed in a tabletop centrifuge (2\u00a0min, 2000g). Samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator prior to LC MS/MS analysis.LC MS/MS Desalted and dried peptides were resuspended in MS sample buffer (3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) and separated online with an Easy-nLCTM1200 coupled to a Q exactive+ or a Q exactive HF-X mass spectrometer equipped with an orbitrap electrospray ion source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were separated on line on a 20\u00a0cm reverse-phase column (inner diameter 75\u03bcm) packed in house with 3\u00a0\u03bcm C18-Reprosil beads with a linear gradient ramping from 3% to 76% acetonitrile. PRISMA samples were separated with a 1h gradient and MS data was acquired on a Q exactive+ in data dependent acquisition mode with a top10 method. Full scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 70000 in the scan range from 300 to 1700 m/z, automated gain control (AGC) target value of 1e6 and maximum injection time of 120ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17500, AGC target of 1e5 and maximum IT of 60\u00a0ms. Ions were isolated with a 2 m/z isolation window and normalized collision energy was set to 26. Unassigned charge states and single charged precursors were excluded from fragmentation and dynamic exclusion was set to 20s. BioID pulldowns were separated on with a 2 h gradient and MS data was acquired on a Q exactive HF-X in data dependent acquisition mode with a top20 method. Full scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60000 in the scan range from 350 to 1700 m/z, automated gain control (AGC) target value was set to 3e6 and maximum injection time to 10ms. MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30000, AGC target of 1e5 and maximum IT of 86\u00a0ms. Ions were isolated with a 1.6 m/z isolation window and normalized collision energy was set to 26. Unassigned charge states and ions with a chare state of one, seven or higher were excluded from fragmentation and dynamic exclusion was set to 30s.BioID experiments NB4 stable cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented with tetracycline free FCS. Cells were seeded in exponential growth phase in media supplemented with 1mM biotin and 1\u03bcg/ml doxycycline in quadruplicates. Cells were harvested after 24h by centrifugation and washed twice with cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50\u00a0mM tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150\u00a0mM, NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with cOmplete\u2122 Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and incubated on ice for 20\u00a0min. Samples were sonicated with a probe sonicator for 5 pulses and centrifuged for 20\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, 20 000g. For each pulldown (1x 15\u00a0cm dish), 80\u03bcl neutravidin-agarose bead slurry (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and added to the protein extracts. The samples incubated rotating at 4\u00b0C for 2.5 h. Beads were washed 3x with lysis buffer, 1x with 1M KCl, 1x 2M Urea in 50mM Tris pH8 and 3x with 50mM Tris pH8. Washing buffers were kept on ice and each washing step was performed with 1ml, inverting the tube 5 times and then centrifuging for 1\u00a0min at 2000g to pellet the beads. Washed beads were resuspended in 80\u03bcl ureabuffer (2M urea, 50mM Tris pH7.5, 1mM DTT) supplemented with 5\u03bcg/ml trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) and incubated 1 h at RT on a tubeshaker at 1000rpm. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube, the beads washed twice with 60\u03bcl 2M urea/50mM Tris pH7.5 and the supernatant combined with the supernatant from the previous step. Residual beads were removed by an additional centrifugation (1\u00a0min, 5000g) and sample transfer step. Eluted proteins were reduced with 4mM DTT for 30\u00a0min on a tubeshaker (RT, 1000\u00a0rpm). Proteins were alkylated with 10mM 2-Iodoacetamide in the dark for 45\u00a0min (RT, 1000\u00a0rpm) and digested over night with 0.5\u03bcg trypsin at RT on a thermoshaker at 700\u00a0rpm. For an AspN\u00a0digest, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg of trypsin and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg sequencing grade endoproteinase AspN (Promega) were added to the sample. Following overnight digestion, samples were acidified by adding TFA and desalted with stage tips.Targeted MS analysis of R142 methylation Synthetic heavy peptide standards with the sequence DGRLEPLEYER and DGR[me]LEPLEYER labeled at the C-terminus with heavy arginine [Arg10] were custom synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies(Germany). CEBPA BioID pulldowns were digested with AspN and trypsin and desalted as described. Samples were resuspended in MS sample buffer containing 100 fmol/\u03bcl of synthetic heavy peptides. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) measurements were acquired on a Q exactive HF-X mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy-nLCTM 1200 HPLC system. Peptides were separated on a 60\u00a0min gradient ramping from 2% to 76% acetonitrile. Data acquisition mode cycled between a Top1 MS/data dependent MS2 and data independent measurement of an inclusion list that included the m/z of the synthetic heavy peptides as well as their light counterparts coming from the sample. Resolution of MS2 for data independent acquisition was 60000 with an AGC target of 1e6, 200\u00a0ms maximum IT, 0.7 m/z isolation window and NCE of 27. PRM data was analyzed with Skyline (Pino et\u00a0al., 2020). Identity of peptides was verified by comparison with the elution profile and fragmentation spectrum of heavy peptide standards.Raw data processing with MaxQuant Mass spectrometry raw files were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) (Cox and Mann, 2008) searching against a human protein database containing isoforms downloaded from UniProt (June 2017) and a database including common contaminants. Fixed modifications were set to carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modifications were set to methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation. For BioID experiments, lysine biotinylation was added as an additional variable modification. Depending on digestion mode (trypsin or LysC only), enzyme specificity was selected with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages per peptide. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was up to 6 ppm and 20 ppm for fragments. False-discovery rate was set to 1% on protein and peptide level. For SILAC measurements, the requantify option was enabled and minimum ratio count was set to 2. For LFQ analysis, the match between run and fast LFQ options was used with default settings.Data analysis of mass spec data Statistical analysis of the dataset was performed using R-statistical software package (version 3.4.1). The protein group\u2019s output file from MaxQuant was filtered for contaminants, reverse hits and proteins only identified by site. Minimum peptide count for SILAC and LFQ data was at least 2 peptides per protein group. For LFQ datasets, proteins were filtered by detection in at least 3 replicates of the same sample and missing values were imputed from a distribution at the detection limit of the mass spectrometer. For this purpose, a normal distribution was created for each run, with a mean 1.8 standard deviations away from the observed mean and a standard deviation of 0.3 x the observed standard deviation. LFQ data was analysed with a two-sample moderated t-test (Limma package) and p-values were corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The significance cutoff of CEBPA interactors was enrichment against both controls (BirA\u2217 only and cells not treated with doxycycline) with an FDR <0.05. For isoform and tR>L mutant specific interactors, threshold was enrichment against both controls with an FDR <0.05 and FDR <0.1 in the pairwise comparison of isoforms and mutants. Interactors overlapping between PRISMA and BioID or BioID and literature (STRING and BioGrid database, Grebien et\u00a0al., Giambruno et\u00a0al.) were visualized with the STRING app built into cytoscape (v3.71) (Shannon et\u00a0al., 2003). Known interaction (experimentally validated or deposited in databases with a score >0.5) were visualized as edges. Interactors not connected by any edges were removed from Figure\u00a02C (12 proteins). GO term analysis of interactors was performed with DAVID functional annotation tool (version 6.8) (Huang et\u00a0al., 2009). PRISMA data was analysed with a two-sample moderated t-test (Limma package), creating a specific control group for each peptide that contained all other peptides excluding peptides with a sequence overlap \u226550%. P-values were corrected for multiple testing with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, significance cut off was <0.1 FDR. To obtain binding profiles of interactors, LFQ intensities of significant proteins were normalized between 0 and 1 across all PRISMA peptides.Microarray Cells were harvested at exponential growth phase and seeded at 0.5 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with or without 1\u03bcg/\u03bcl doxycycline as independent biological triplicates. After 24\u00a0hr, cells were harvested via centrifugation (1200 g, 5\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) and washed once with 1x icecold PBS. Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA was removed with the DNase Max Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA integrity was assessed using a Fragment Analyzer system and a standard sensitivity RNA kit. All RQN scores were above 9.1. RNA expression analysis was performed with Affymetrix Human ClariomS\u00ae microarray using the WT Plus Reagent kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). As starting material, 100ng of total RNA was used and RNA was prepared for hybridization with the GeneChip\u00ae Whole Transcript (WT) PLUS Reagent Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufactures instructions. CEL files were processed using the standard Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC 4.0) software. Expression values were automatically normalized and summarized using SST-RMA method. Only mRNAs with log2 expression above 6 in at least one sample were considered for further analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using LIMMA package of R/Bioconductor and p-values were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg\u2019s FDR.GSEA of microarray data Gene expression changes induced by CEBPA isoforms were calculated by comparing microarray data from NB4 cells expressing CEBPA (P42 or P30) against BirA\u2217 expressing cells. Averaged log2 fold changes were used as input for the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) analysis tool (Barbie et\u00a0al., 2009) implemented in R (https://github.com/broadinstitute/ssGSEA2.0) using standard parameters. Data was analyzed employing immunologic and transcription factor target gene sets from the molecular signature database (Subramanian et\u00a0al., 2005). The running score displayed in Figure\u00a04 was calculated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov running sum statistics.Quantification and statistical analysisStatistical analyses of the data were performed using the R-statistical software package (version 3.4.1). The type of statistical tests used is annotated in figure legends and described in detail in the method details sections. Statistical parameters (n, mean, significance level) are reported in the figures and legends or in corresponding supplemental tables.
