In the blood vessel wall, endothelial cells are particularly adept at changing their properties in response to mechanical forces 1. One of these forces is unidirectional, laminar shear stress (LSS), the dragging frictional force created by blood flow that acts parallel to the luminal surface of the vessel. Endothelial cells respond to LSS by modulating gene expression, cell metabolism, cell morphology, and the release of vasoactive substances2, including nitric oxide (NO\u00b7). NO\u00b7 is produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and LSS has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies to increase the activity and expression of eNOS3-5.LSS-induced up regulation of eNOS occurs by two mechanisms: a transient increase in eNOS transcription followed by a prolonged stabilization of eNOS mRNA6. Although both mechanisms are dependent on the activity of c-Src, downstream signaling events for transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of eNOS differ 6. Previously, we described a posttranscriptional mechanism by which LSS induces enhanced eNOS mRNA stability and translation that involves enhanced 3\u2032 polyadenylation. Under static conditions, eNOS transcripts have short 3\u2032 poly(A) tails, but these tails dramatically lengthen in response to LSS7.In eukaryotic cells, mRNA synthesis is performed by a transcription elongation complex whose main component is RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). This enzyme plays a critical role in coordinating chromatin remodeling and posttranscriptional mRNA processing, including 5\u2032 capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 polyadenylation. The processing functions of Pol II are mediated primarily by its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD)8, 9, which serves as a platform for factors required for mRNA processing. Pol II CTD contains repeats of a highly conserved seven-amino-acid consensus sequence, YSPTSPS10, and serines at positions 2 and 5 are targets for phosphorylation11. Transcription initiation is preferentially associated with binding of unphosphorylated Pol II to promoter sequences, while Pol II phospho-serine 5 is associated with release of the transcription complex from the promoter, 5\u2032 capping and splicing12. Pol II phospho-serine 2 is responsible for transcript elongation, termination and 3\u2032polyadenylation13.Transcript elongation and posttranscriptional mRNA processing are highly regulated14, and distinct signal transduction pathways have been shown to modulate Pol II activity through CTD phosphorylation15, 16. We hypothesized that mechanotransduction of LSS in endothelial cells leads to changes in Pol II phosphorylation, which in turn enhances eNOS mRNA 3\u2032 polyadenylation. In this study, we focused on changes in Pol II phosphorylation and localization on the eNOS gene in endothelial cells exposed to LSS. We found that LSS enhanced expression of Pol II phospho-serine 2 and its localization to sequences encoding the eNOS 3\u2032UTR, adjacent to the transcription termination site. These findings provide further insight into mechanisms by which transduction of mechanical forces can modulate endothelial gene expression. MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureBovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs; Cell Systems) were cultured in Media 199 (Mediatech) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin-streptomycin, glutamine and non-essential amino acids. Postconfluent BAECs between passages 4 to 8 were used for all experiments. A cone-in-plate viscometer with a 1 \u00b0 angle was used to create unidirectional laminar shear stress of 15 dynes/cm2 for 6 hours17. The magnitude and 6-hour period of shear stress was selected based on previous experiments, in which eNOS polyadenylation was found to be maximally increased after 6 hours of LSS7.Western analysisWestern analysis was performed as previously described 18. Antibodies against the different Pol II phosphoisoforms were obtained from Covance. These include H5 (Pol II phospho-serine 2, 1:500), H14 (phospho-serine 5, 1:500), and 8WG16 (unphosphorylated Pol II CTD, 1:000). Antibodies against total Pol II (targeting N-terminal, 1:10000) and eNOS (1:2500) were from BD Pharmingen. The antibody against cyclin-dependent kinase 9 was purchased from Santa Cruz (1:500). Anti-\u03b1-Actin antibody (Sigma, 1:1000) was used as a loading control. All antibodies were prepared in 3% blocking milk.RNA isolation and real time PCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol-Reagent (Invitrogen). Light Cycler (Roche) was used for real time PCR, as described earlier19. Prior to PCR, DNA was purified with Micro Bio-Spin 30 Chromatography Columns (Bio Rad). PCR was performed on 2 \u03bcl of cDNA using Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) and buffer provided with the enzyme. For continuous fluorescence monitoring of DNA specific binding, 0.5% SYBR Green Dye (Roche) was used.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)BAECs were sheared for 6 hrs (15 dynes/cm2), with or without DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u00df-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, 60 \u03bcmol/L, Sigma) pretreatment (1 hour), or treated with cytochalasin D (5 \u03bcmol/L, Sigma) for 6 hrs. Control cells were kept under static conditions or treated with DMSO. Protein was crosslinked to DNA with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The ChIP assay was performed following the Upstate ChIP Assay protocol with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with 1 x PBS and lysed for 10 min on ice in SDS Lysis-Buffer (Upstate). Cells were sonicated using a Sonic Dismembrator 60 (Fisher Scientific). The DNA was sheared 3 times (4 watts, 10 pulses at 1 second each), into approximately 200 bp long fragments (online supplemental Figure 1A). Protein was immunoprecipitated overnight using, Pol II phospho-serine 2 antibody (H5) or IgG as control, then pulled down with Salmon Sperm DNA/ Protein G/A- Agarose (Upstate). Crosslinking was reversed overnight and protein digested with proteinase K (Invitrogen) for one hour. DNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. Primers for PCR are listed in the Online Data Supplement. Primers were subjected to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and none had 100% homology with any other bovine genomic sequence besides eNOS. In fact, exon 26 primers did not have homology with any other sequence in the bovine genome. Primer efficiency was determined using 0-0.6 ng/ul genomic DNA standard curves, analyzed by linear regression. Sample values were calculated by subtracting the y-intercept and then dividing by the slope. Each sample was normalized to the individual amount of input DNA.RNase Protection AssayRNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). To detect the length of Polyadenylated eNOS mRNA, we used a special riboprobe generated from a 3\u2032 RACE-PAT of eNOS as described previously 7. RESULTSLSS preferentially increases expression of Pol II phospho-serine 2BAECs subjected to LSS (6 hours, 15 dynes/cm2) had a 65% increase in total Pol II protein expression compared to static control cells (Figure 1A). The antibody used to assess total Pol II expression targets the N-terminal domain of the enzyme and therefore detected both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Pol II. Because the mRNA processing activities of Pol II are linked to phosphorylation of its CTD, further Western analysis was performed to assess expression of the three specific Pol II phosphoisoforms in response to LSS. Endothelial cells exposed to LSS had a 40 to 50% increase in expression of Pol II phospho-serine 2 (Figure 1B) compared to control cells. In contrast, there was no significant effect of LSS on expression of unphosphorylated Pol II (Figure 1C) or Pol II phospho-serine 5 (Figure 1D). Thus, the LSS-induced upregulation of total Pol II appeared to be largely associated with enhanced expression of the Pol II phospho-serine 2 isoform.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Pol II levels in BAECs exposed to LSS or nonsheared conditions. Western blot and densitometric analysis for A, total Pol II; B, Pol II phospho-serine 2; C, Pol II phospho-serine 5; and D, unphosphorylated Pol II, n = 4-6, * p = 0.01, unpaired t-test.The 6-hour time point was used for these studies because, after 6 hours of LSS, maximum 3\u2032 polyadenylation of eNOS mRNA was observed7. A shear time course (1-6 hours) showed that expression of Pol II phospho-serine 2 is increased over baseline levels as early as 1 hour after the cells are subjected to LSS and remains increased for the duration of LSS (Online Supplemental Figure 2A). In comparison, eNOS protein is increased after 4-6 hours of LSS.Localization and quantitative assessment of Pol II phospho-serine 2ChIP analysis was performed to determine the effect of LSS on Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to different regions of the eNOS gene. Chromatin from sheared and static control cells was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against Pol II phospho-serine 2 and quantitative PCR was performed with primers targeting sequences in the promoter area, exons 19-26, and sequences downstream of the transcription termination site (Figure 2A). The different efficiencies of the primer pairs were determined and subsequently used to quantify binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to the eNOS gene (supplemental Figure 1B). The DNA sequences that were studied were chosen because of the importance of their interaction with Pol II in demonstrating the different activities of Pol II during the transcription cycle. These activities include transcription initiation, demonstrated by Pol II binding to promoter sequences, and transcript elongation, termination and 3\u2032 processing, demonstrated by Pol II binding to exonic sequences at the 3\u2032 end of the gene as well as sequences downstream of the polyadenylation site.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Pol II localization on the eNOS gene. A, Location of ChIP PCR primer pairs. B, quantitative ChIP analysis of Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to promoter area and later exons (n=3-8), S=static, L=LSS, *p=0.038.The Pol II CTD is phosphorylated at serine 2 during elongation of the primary RNA transcript, and Pol II phospho-serine 2 is responsible for coordinating 3\u2032 polyadenylation by recruiting factors necessary for 3\u2032 processing. High amounts of DNA (~6 ng) were found to bind Pol II phospho-serine 2 on exon 26 (eNOS 3\u2032UTR) in cells exposed to LSS. Compared to control cells, LSS induced a significant 11.4 fold increase in Pol II binding to exon 26. We did not observe a lot of binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 in the promoter area; this region of the gene should be associated with unphosphorylated Pol II or Pol II phospho-serine 5, respectively. We detected binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to exons 19, 21 and 22, but the values for binding to these sequences were still much lower compared to binding of Pol II phospho serine 2 to exon 26 (less than 1 ng DNA). Together, these data indicate that LSS modulates Pol II by increasing phosphorylation of CTD serine 2 and enhancing localization of the serine 2 phosphoisoform to eNOS sequences encoding the 3\u2032 UTR. Further, quantitative ChIP analysis of the actin 3\u2032UTR did not show increased Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding in response to LSS, (supplemental Figure 2B), suggesting that enhanced binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to eNOS 3\u2032UTR in response to LSS is specific.DRB attenuates LSS-induced Pol II phosphorylation and eNOS 3\u2032 PolyadenylationPositive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is responsible for the transition of Pol II from the initial phases of transcription into the productive elongation phase 20. P-TEFb is a heterodimer composed of CDK9 and a regulatory cyclin (T1, T2, or K), and Pol II serine 2 is a specific substrate for phosphorylation by CDK920. We have observed that DRB, an agent that blocks transcription by inhibiting CDK9 21, 22, attenuated LSS-induced changes in eNOS 3\u2032polyadenylation7. Figure 3A shows a ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) of RNA from control and sheared cells, using a riboprobe that targets the 3\u2032 end of eNOS mRNA. The RPA of control cells shows one protected fragment of 250 nt, which correlates with a short eNOS 3\u2032 poly(A) tail of 25 nucleotides in length. Additional protected fragments were detected for RNA from sheared cells; these fragments correlate with poly(A) tails of 75 to 160 nucleotides in length. Pretreatment of cells with DRB (60 \u03bcmol/L) for 1 hour prior to LSS dramatically reduced eNOS polyadenylation (Figure 3A, right panel). Subsequently, we examined the effect of DRB pretreatment on LSS-induced changes in Pol II phosphorylation. DRB pretreatment attenuated the observed LSS-induced increase in total Pol II (Figure 3B), Pol II phospho-serine 2 expression (Figure 3C), and eNOS expression (Figure 4B). Together, these data suggest that the LSS-induced increase in Pol II serine 2 phosphorylation and eNOS 3\u2032polyadenylation is mediated by CDK9.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Effect of DRB on LSS-induced changes in expression of Pol II.

Quantitative assessment of Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to exon 26 showed that DRB prevented LSS-induced binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 (Figure 4A). We hypothesized that a consequence of this effect would be less 3\u2032 processing and therefore less eNOS mRNA stability and translation. Western analysis of eNOS protein in static and LSS treated cells with and without DRB pretreatment demonstrated the well known increase of eNOS protein in response to LSS (Figure 4 B) and it revealed that this response is prevented in the presence of DRB, most likely because of the lack of Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to eNOS 3\u2032 UTR.Cytochalasin D treatment does not alter expression or localization of Pol II on eNOSCytochalasin D is an agent that directly alters actin cytoskeleton organization, and, like LSS, increases eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation23 and expression24. The effect of cytochalasin D on Pol II phosphorylation and localization in BAECs was studied using Western analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis (Figure 4C). We did not observe any change in expression of total Pol II levels or any of the Pol II phosphoisoforms. Quantitative ChIP analysis of Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to eNOS exon 26 did not reveal any significant differences between cytochalasin D-treated and control endothelial cells (Figure 4D). Since this finding differs from the response to LSS, we conclude that not all stimuli that increase eNOS polyadenylation will necessarily have enhanced Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to the 3\u2032 UTR. Interestingly, stimulus-dependent changes in Pol II serine 2 phosphorylation and localization are not unique to our model system; this phenomenon has been noted in other mammalian model systems16. DISCUSSIONShear stress forces generated by blood flow are important modulators of signaling and gene expression in the vessel wall25. In the current study, we sought to extend our previous work on LSS-induced changes in eNOS expression by examining how LSS increases 3\u2032 polyadenylation of eNOS mRNA. Previous studies of eNOS expression have focused on the early phases of the transcription cycle, such as transcription initiation. However, the cell\u2019s transcription machinery is not solely associated with promoter activity, and other aspects of mRNA synthesis, such as capping, splicing, and 3\u2032 polyadenylation, are dynamic and highly regulated14. These posttranscriptional processing reactions are influenced by changes in phosphorylation of Pol II, whose CTD coordinates mRNA processing reactions by providing key molecular contacts throughout transcriptional elongation and termination (Figure 5)26. The central finding of this study is that LSS alters expression, phosphorylation and localization of Pol II on the eNOS gene. Thus LSS, besides stimulating recruitment of Pol II to the eNOS promoter for transcription initiation6, also enhances recruitment of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to the 3\u2032 region of the eNOS gene important for transcription termination and polyadenylation.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Schema of LSS and Pol II activity. LSS increases transcription initiation of eNOS. LSS also increases phosphorylation of Pol II CTD serine 2 and enhanced localization to the sequences encoding the 3\u2032UTR. This mechanism appears to be mediated by CDK9 and leads to enhanced eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation and expression. As depicted, the bovine eNOS polyadenylation hexamer is AATAAT.In quiescent endothelial cells, the expression of eNOS is constitutive and restricted to the endothelial cell layer of medium- to large-caliber vessels. Basal eNOS transcription is controlled by two positive regulatory domains (PRD I and II) in the proximal promoter27, and the endothelial cell-specific nature of eNOS transcription has recently been linked to the chromatin structure in this region28, 29. It has been shown that active elongation and 3\u2032 processing of eNOS transcripts by phosphorylated Pol II in quiescent endothelial cells is relatively hindered, analogous to the elongation block observed in immediate early gene (IEG) transcription30. Interestingly, both eNOS mRNA from human and bovine quiescent endothelial cells7 have short 3\u2032 poly(A) tails, suggesting that 3\u2032 mRNA processing is impeded in nonstimulated cells.Consistent with this concept, we found very little Pol II phospho-serine 2 binding to eNOS DNA in nonsheared control cells, but, in response to LSS, there was increased binding of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to DNA on exon 26. This observation supports our hypothesis that mechanotransduction of LSS in endothelial cells leads to upregulation of eNOS expression in part by altering phosphorylation of Pol II, thus relieving the baseline impediment to active elongation and 3\u2032 polyadenylation. Indeed, we found that LSS specifically enhanced expression of the Pol II phospho-serine 2, the phosphoisoform associated with transcript elongation and 3\u2032 polyadenylation (Figure 5). In contrast, we also found that cytochalasin D, which, like LSS, is known to increase eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation and expression23, 24, had no effect on Pol II expression, phosphorylation, or localization to the eNOS 3\u2032UTR. This result indicates that LSS and cytochalasin D increase eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation by different mechanisms, which may not be unexpected given that LSS also increases transcription initiation whereas cytochalasin D does not.The recruitment of P-TEFb (consisting of CDK9 and a cyclin subunit) to the transcription unit is important for stimulus-driven synthesis of mRNA 15, 30, 31. Fujita et al. demonstrated that DRB, an adenosine analogue DRB that specifically blocks Pol II elongation by inhibiting P-TEFb 22, 32, inhibited phosphorylation of Pol II and subsequent progression of Pol II to downstream regions of the MKP-1 gene in neuroendocrine cells15. Similarly, we observed that, in endothelial cells, DRB inhibited LSS-induced changes in Pol II phosphorylation and localization, as well as eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation and protein expression. The relationship between shear stress and P-TEFb has not been studied previously, although CDK9 has been shown to be responsive to stress signals associated with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, such as aortic banding31. These signals did not change expression CDK9 or cyclin T, but did alter their association with an inhibitory small nuclear RNA, 7SK; stress-induced disinhibition of CDK9 was mediated by calcineurin and Gq. Whether this regulatory pathway is responsible for LSS-induced changes in endothelial Pol II phosphorylation is unknown. Figure 5 depicts a schema of how LSS-induced changes in Pol II phosphorylation correlate with its location and synthesis of eNOS mRNA; a question mark has been inserted between LSS and P-TEFb because we are not certain whether LSS directly or indirectly modulates CDK9.Steady state levels of eNOS mRNA are subject to modest, but likely important degrees of regulation by different stimuli that have been implicated in vascular pathophysiology. Recent work has demonstrated that expression of this gene is complex and involves multiple different cis and trans-acting factors, as well as changes in promoter activity, chromatin remodeling, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, and translational activity. In addition, in humans and mice, an antisense mRNA that is complementary to the 3\u2032end of eNOS has been shown to posttranscriptionally downregulate eNOS in nonendothelial cells33. This antisense mRNA, known as sONE, is derived from a transcription unit on the DNA strand opposite eNOS, oriented in a tail-to-tail configuration with eNOS. However, we do not think our ChIP analysis of the bovine 3\u2032UTR is confounded by Pol II binding to the 3\u2032UTR of bovine sONE. First, we have not been able to detect sONE mRNA in bovine endothelial cells. Second, the predicted bovine sONE does not overlap to the extent that the human sONE does, so the sequences encoding bovine eNOS and sONE 3\u2032UTRs appear to be different.In this study, we have used a well-established in vitro model of unidirectional shear stress forces, the cone-in-plate viscometer1, to show that transduction of prolonged shear stress (6 hours) in endothelial cells leads to changes in Pol II phosphorylation and localization, which then has an impact on eNOS 3\u2032 polyadenylation and expression. The detailed mechanism of how LSS-induced modulation of the general transcription machinery leads to changes in 3\u2032 processing of specific mRNAs is not completely clear, but we believe that this issue is related to cis-acting elements recognized by Pol II, including the polyadenylation signal. Both bovine and human eNOS 3\u2032UTRs contain relatively inefficient polyadenylation signals and hexamers (AAUAAU \u2013 bovine, ACUAAA-humans), which are associated with short poly(A) tails under non- or low shear conditions7. The bovine polyadenylation hexamer/signal is depicted in Figure 5. We hypothesize that phosphorylation of Pol II serine 2 facilitates 3\u2032 polyadenylation of genes, like eNOS, that have inefficient polyadenylation signals. Interestingly, LSS did not induce enhanced localization of Pol II phospho-serine 2 to the beta-actin gene, which contains an efficient (AAUAAA, canonical) polyadenylation signal. Importantly, we have observed increased Pol II phospho-serine 2 levels relative to the other Pol II phosphoisoforms in human endothelial cells (HUVECs) subjected to LSS for 6 hours, suggesting that the effect of LSS is not species specific (online Supplemental Figure 2C). Current efforts are focused on identifying other endothelial genes that demonstrate similar LSS-induced changes in 3\u2032polyadenylation and localization of Pol II phospho-serine 2.Condensed AbstractWe examined the effect of shear stress on RNA Polymerase II in endothelial cells. Compared to unsheared cells, sheared cells had altered Pol II phosphorylation and localization on the eNOS gene. Our data indicate that mechanotransduction induces changes in Pol II that are important for eNOS mRNA expression.
