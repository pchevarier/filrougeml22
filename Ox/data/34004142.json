{"title": "Differential usage of transcriptional repressor Zeb2 enhancers distinguishes adult and embryonic hematopoiesis", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.immuni.2021.04.015", "PMID": "34004142", "abstract": "The transcriptional repressor ZEB2 regulates development of many cell fates among somatic, neural, and hematopoietic lineages, but the basis for its requirement in these diverse lineages is unclear. Here, we identified a 400-basepair (bp) region located 165 kilobases (kb) upstream of the Zeb2 transcriptional start site (TSS) that binds the E proteins at several E-box motifs and was active in hematopoietic lineages. Germline deletion of this 400-bp region (Zeb2\u0394-165mice) specifically prevented Zeb2 expression in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived lineages. Zeb2\u0394-165 mice lacked development of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), monocytes, and B cells. All macrophages in Zeb2\u0394-165 mice were exclusively of embryonic origin. Using single-cell chromatin profiling, we identified a second Zeb2 enhancer located at +164-kb that was selectively active in embryonically derived lineages, but not HSC-derived ones. Thus, Zeb2 expression in adult, but not embryonic, hematopoiesis is selectively controlled by the -165-kb Zeb2 enhancer.", "author": [{"author": "Xiao Huang", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Huang+X&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Stephen T Ferris", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ferris+ST&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Sunkyung Kim", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Kim+S&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Mayank N K Choudhary", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; The Edison Family Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Choudhary+MNK&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Julia A Belk", "affiliation": ["Department of Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Belk+JA&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Changxu Fan", "affiliation": ["Department of Genetics, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; The Edison Family Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Fan+C&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Yanyan Qi", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Qi+Y&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Raki Sudan", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Sudan+R&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Yu Xia", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Xia+Y&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Pritesh Desai", "affiliation": ["Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Desai+P&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Jing Chen", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Chen+J&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Nghi Ly", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ly+N&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Quanming Shi", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Shi+Q&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Prachi Bagadia", "affiliation": ["Department of Oncology, Amgen, 1120 Veterans Boulevard, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."], "href": "/?term=Bagadia+P&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Tiantian Liu", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Liu+T&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Martin Guilliams", "affiliation": ["Unit of Immunoregulation and Mucosal Immunology, VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent 9052, Belgium; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent 9000, Belgium."], "href": "/?term=Guilliams+M&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Takeshi Egawa", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Egawa+T&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Marco Colonna", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Colonna+M&cauthor_id=34004142"}, {"author": "Michael S Diamond", "affiliation": ["Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; Department of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis, School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA; The Andrew M. and Jane M.
