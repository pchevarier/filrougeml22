{"title": "Impact of the driving pressure on mortality in obese and non-obese ARDS patients: a retrospective study of 362 cases", "pubDate": "2018", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s00134-018-5241-6", "PMID": "29947888", "abstract": "Purpose:                       The relation between driving pressure (plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure) and mortality has never been studied in obese ARDS patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 90-day mortality and driving pressure in an ARDS population ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) according to obesity status.                  Methods:                       We conducted a retrospective single-center study of prospectively collected data of all ARDS patients admitted consecutively to a mixed medical-surgical adult ICU from January 2009 to May 2017. Plateau pressure, compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) and driving pressure of the respiratory system within 24 h of ARDS diagnosis were compared between survivors and non-survivors at day 90 and between obese (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2) and non-obese patients. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for mortality at day 90.                  Results:                       Three hundred sixty-two ARDS patients were included, 262 (72%) non-obese and 100 (28%) obese patients. Mortality rate at day 90 was respectively 47% (95% CI, 40-53) in the non-obese and 46% (95% CI, 36-56) in the obese patients. Driving pressure at day 1 in the non-obese patients was significantly lower in survivors at day 90 (11.9 \u00b1 4.2 cmH2O) than in non-survivors (15.2 \u00b1 5.2 cmH2O, p < 0.001). Contrarily, in obese patients, driving pressure at day 1 was not significantly different between survivors (13.7 \u00b1 4.5 cmH2O) and non-survivors (13.2 \u00b1 5.1 cmH2O, p = 0.41) at day 90. After three multivariate Cox analyses, plateau pressure [HR = 1.04 (95% CI 1.01-1.07) for each point of increase], Crs [HR = 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) for each point of increase] and driving pressure [HR = 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.10) for each point of increase], respectively, were independently associated with 90-day mortality in non-obese patients, but not in obese patients.                  Conclusions:                       Contrary to non-obese ARDS patients, driving pressure was not associated with mortality in obese ARDS patients.", "author": [{"author": "Audrey De Jong", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, INSERM U1046, CNRS, UMR 9214, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34295, Montpellier Cedex 5, France."], "href": "/?term=De+Jong+A&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Jeanne Cossic", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Cossic+J&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Daniel Verzilli", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Verzilli+D&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Cl\u00e9ment Monet", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Monet+C&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Julie Carr", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Carr+J&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Mathieu Conseil", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Conseil+M&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Marion Monnin", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Monnin+M&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Moussa Cisse", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Cisse+M&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Fouad Belafia", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, Montpellier Cedex 5, 34295, France."], "href": "/?term=Belafia+F&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Nicolas Molinari", "affiliation": ["Department of Statistics, University of Montpellier Lapeyronie Hospital, UMR 729, MISTEA, Montpellier, France."], "href": "/?term=Molinari+N&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "G\u00e9rald Chanques", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, INSERM U1046, CNRS, UMR 9214, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34295, Montpellier Cedex 5, France."], "href": "/?term=Chanques+G&cauthor_id=29947888"}, {"author": "Samir Jaber", "affiliation": ["Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B, Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier, INSERM U1046, CNRS, UMR 9214, 80 Avenue Augustin Fliche, 34295, Montpellier Cedex 5, France. s-jaber@chu-montpellier.fr."], "href": "/?term=Jaber+S&cauthor_id=29947888"}], "refPMID": ["28707173", "22867911", "27304558", "26584196", "20980246", "27010445", "22797452", "25693014", "23688302", "28328996", "18931236", "9759681", "19770169", "27784322", "28323236", "27318943", "28252536", "28708679", "27408717", "26903337", "27450066", "29135500", "29037528", "21478734", "22430246", "27894328", "25431308", "28604169", "27620287", "25168301", "25672280", "23450309", "29293153", "28320439", "27334266"], "citedInPMID": ["29947888", "35095561", "34880958", "34806050", "34208699", "33643222", "33262172", "33117037", "33095284", "33035129", "32795240", "32751791", "31774323", "31701204", "31620833", "31595350", "31287803", "31197492", "31097006", "31025221", "30888440", "30850002", "30631526", "30460263", "30291378", "29959454"], "body": ""}
