INTS13 is a modular component of Integrator recruited to poised enhancers via the EGR1 transcription factor and its co-factor NAB2. The INTS13/EGR1/NAB2 axis is essential to elicit enhancer-mediated gene activation.\n IntroductionCis-regulatory elements orchestrate spatial and temporal gene expression in metazoans. Enhancers are essential during tissue development and cell differentiation, such as in the hematopoietic compartment (Alvarez-Errico et al., 2015; Heinz et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016). Precisely, recognition of DNA motifs by a select combination of transcription factors (TFs) activates enhancers that were otherwise repressed or in a poised/inactive conformation (Heinz et al., 2010; Heinz et al., 2015). While repressed enhancers lack DNA accessibility and are embedded in a repressive chromatin conformation, poised enhancers are generally nucleosome-free to facilitate binding of lineage-determining TFs to their respective DNA motifs. Poised enhancers are devoid of H3K27ac mark (enriched at enhancers that are active or recently dismissed) but carry sustained levels of H3K4me1 (Creyghton et al., 2010; Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011). It is believed that recruitment of TFs first leads to hyper-acetylation of nucleosomes surrounding the enhancer core (Whyte et al., 2013). Next, TFs pair with the Mediator complex to recruit the RNAPII holoenzyme and initiate bi-directional transcription of enhancer-associated noncoding RNAs (eRNAs) (Li et al., 2013). The Integrator, a large co-activator complex endowed with RNA endonucleolytic activity, is required to terminate eRNA transcripts, and consequently allow their accumulation at chromatin. eRNAs are implicated in enhancer activation, perhaps by enforcing chromosomal looping between enhancers and their target promoters (Hsieh et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2015). In addition, eRNAs may function in maintenance of H3K27ac levels (Bose et al., 2017), and in release of the paused RNAPII at target promoters (Schaukowitch et al., 2014). The overall mechanistic process of enhancer activation is not clear. For instance, the series of events that bring inactive or poised enhancers to full activation is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel function for a component of the Integrator complex in activating lineage-specific enhancers.Integrator is conserved across metazoans, and is composed of 14 subunits (INTS1 to INTS14) (Baillat et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012). This protein complex associates with the C-terminal domain of RNAPII and is implicated in the biogenesis of spliceosomal U snRNAs (Baillat et al., 2005). In fact, the endonucleolytic heterodimer INTS9/INTS11 cleaves nascent U snRNA transcripts to initiate their maturation (Baillat et al., 2005). Integrator\u2019s activity at enhancers is also critical to establish chromosomal looping with target promoters to drive gene activation (Lai et al., 2015). Furthermore, Integrator is loaded at the proximal promoter of protein-coding genes, where it controls the release of paused RNAPII by recruiting the SEC/pTEFb complex and modulating the activity of Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) (Gardini et al., 2014; Stadelmayer et al., 2014). While the catalytic function and genomic distribution of the INTS9/INTS11 heterodimer has been established, the remaining 12 subunits of the complex are largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe that the INTS13 subunit has a lineage-specific role in regulating enhancer activity. Our data indicate that INTS13 regulates enhancer regions bound by the EGR1/2 transcription factors, in association with the co-factor NAB2, during differentiation of progenitor cells into monocytes and macrophages.In the myeloid branch of hematopoiesis, monocytes and macrophages (the tissue-resident counterpart of monocytes) are specialized phagocytic cells that rely on transcription factors such as SPI1, CEBP\u03b1, and CEBP\u03b2 as master determinants of commitment and differentiation (Alvarez-Errico et al., 2015; Friedman, 2007; Scott et al., 1994). Some of these TFs, such as SPI1, are also critical in regulating the activity of terminally differentiated macrophages (Barozzi et al., 2014; Heinz et al., 2010; Ostuni et al., 2013). While the Early Growth Response (EGR) TFs have largely been studied during neural development (Giudicelli et al., 2001; Poirier et al., 2008; Thierion et al., 2017), EGR1/2 are also active during myelopoiesis, promoting monocytic/macrophagic differentiation in a variety of human cell lines as well as primary myeloid precursors (Krishnaraju et al., 2001; Laslo et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 1993; Pham et al., 2012). Our data support a fundamental role for EGR1/2 in monocytic commitment and defines their activity at critical lineage-determining enhancers, such as the enhancer of CSF1R. Furthermore, we identify NAB2, previously suggested to be a repressor of EGR1 activity (Kumbrink et al., 2010), as the fundamental co-activator of monocytic enhancers in association with EGR1 and the Integrator complex. In summary, we describe a network of enhancers driving differentiation via the Integrator/EGR/NAB2 axis, and provide the first evidence that Integrator has modular components, conferring lineage-specific activity to this evolutionarily conserved complex. ResultsFunctional dissection of the INTS11 and INTS13 subunits of IntegratorIntegrator targets active protein-coding genes and regulates the release of paused RNAPII from proximal promoters (Gardini et al., 2014; Stadelmayer et al., 2014; van den Berg et al., 2017), and modulates the biogenesis of noncoding eRNAs at enhancers through the endonucleolytic activity of the INTS11 subunit (Lai et al., 2015). Unlike Mediator, Integrator is specific to metazoans, suggesting that it may play a role in tissue and cell fate specification. To dissect the role of Integrator in gene regulation, we examined the poorly characterized INTS13 subunit, along with the core catalytic subunit INTS11, in the myeloid HL-60 cell line.First, we immunoprecipitated INTS13 from the nuclear extract of HL-60 cells and found strong association with INTS11 and INTS1, indicating that INTS13 is a bona fide component of Integrator in myeloid cells (Figure 1A\u2013B). Second, to begin characterizing the role of INTS13 within the Integrator complex, we assayed RNA endonucleolytic activity by qRT-PCR. We depleted INTS13 and INTS11 in HL-60 cells and measured accumulation of primary, unprocessed U1 snRNA transcript. In the absence of INTS13, the basal catalytic activity of the Integrator complex was not affected (Figure 1C and Figure S1A\u2013B). Additionally, we found that INTS13 is dispensable for proliferation of HL-60 myeloid progenitor cells, whereas depletion of INTS11, predictably, suppresses cell growth (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that INTS13 is not essential for the fitness of HL-60 cells and may have a very limited function within the Integrator complex in this cell model.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Functional dissection of the INTS11 and INTS13 subunits of Integrator(A) Immunoprecipitation of INTS13 in HL-60 cells Immunoblots of antibodies against the Integrator subunits INTS1 and INTS11 show that the complex co-precipitates with INTS13. (B) Model representation of the Integrator protein complex, including the subunits INTS11 and INTS13. (C) qRT-PCR of U1 snRNA in untreated HL-60 transduced with two different shRNAs against INTS11 and INTS13 shows that INTS11 depletion abrogates the catalytic activity of the complex while it is maintained upon INTS13 knockdown. Primers were designed downstream to the core snRNA sequence, after the region recognized and cleaved by Integrator. shRNAs against luciferase (shLUC) were used as a control, and ribosomal 18S as housekeeping gene. (D) Five-days growth curve (MTT assay based) of unstimulated HL-60 cells transduced with shRNAs against INST11 and INTS13. Depletion of INTS13 does not impair proliferation of HL-60, whereas depletion of INTS11 results in strong growth suppression. Two shRNAs per subunit were employed. (E) qRT-PCR of the monocytic gene CSF1R in PMA-treated HL-60 following depletion of either INTS11 or INTS13. Depletion of both INTS13 and INTS11 negatively affects CSF1R activation by PMA. (F) HL-60 cells treated with PMA differentiate into a macrophagic-like stage and expression of the surface integrin CD11b is a measure of differentiation. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD11b decreases in differentiated cells after depletion of INTS13 with two different shRNAs (48h post-PMA induction). (G) Metabolic activity assay (MTT) was performed on CD34+ cells transduced with shRNAs for INTS11 and INTS13, data were collected at day 1 and day 4 after selection with puromycin, and plotted as fold change (FC; day 4 versus day 1). The MTT shows that also in primary cells the depletion of INTS13 does not impair proliferation, whereas depletion of INTS11 results in strong growth suppression. (H) Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay of cord blood derived CD34+ cells infected with two different shRNAs for INTS13 and induced by M-CSF in methylcellulose medium. The number of monocytic/macrophagic CFUs is significantly reduced in INTS13-depleted cells compared to control (shLUC).Next, we assessed whether the Integrator subunits were required for gene activation associated to monocytic differentiation of HL-60. HL-60 are progenitor-like cells of myeloid origin (established from a patient with promyelocytic leukemia) (Gallagher et al., 1979) that can be differentiated into functional monocytes/macrophages upon stimulation with PMA (phorbol myristate acetate), providing a convenient model of differentiation. We examined the induction of the prototypical monocytic gene CSF1R, which encodes the membrane receptor for the monocytic cytokine M-CSF and is specifically induced during differentiation, and found that INTS11 is necessary for induction of CSF1R (Fig. 1E), similar to its requirement for activation of Immediate Early Genes by the Epidermal Growth Factor (Gardini et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2015). Surprisingly, we also found INTS13 to be required for induction of CSF1R (40\u201370% reduction of expression with shRNAs for INTS13, Fig. 1E and Fig. S1A for knock-down efficiency) suggesting that this subunit, while dispensable in progenitor cells, may be necessary for differentiation. We treated HL-60 cells with PMA for 48h and measured expression of the surface marker CD11b by FACS analysis (Bender and Beavo, 2006). Depletion of INTS13 with two different shRNAs resulted in significant decrease of CD11b (Figure 1F, Figure S1A). To ensure that the effect of INTS13 on monocytic differentiation is physiologically relevant and not dependent on HL-60 cells and PMA stimulation, we purified CD34+ stem and progenitor cells from cord blood. First, we assessed proliferation of primary cells after depletion of INTS11 and INTS13 by measuring their metabolic activity (MTT assay at day 4 post puromycin selection). Similar to HL-60, only INTS11 depletion affected the growth of primary progenitor cells (Fig. 1G, Figure S1B). Next, we leveraged INTS13-depleted CD34+ cells in a colony forming unit (CFU) assay to assess their potential to form monocytic/macrophagic colonies in semi-solid medium upon stimulation with M-CSF and GM-CSF for 2 weeks. Our data indicated that INTS13 is required, in primary human cells, to form monocytic colonies (Fig. 1H, Figure S1B\u2013C) and suggest that INTS13 has a specific role in determining the monocytic fate of progenitor cells.The INTS13 subunit of Integrator is required for activation of the monocytic transcriptomeWe analyzed the transcriptome of HL-60 cells before and after 16h of PMA induction using RNA-seq. PMA stimulation resulted in differential expression of 842 genes (DESeq2, FDR < 5%). Notably, the majority (75%) of genes were upregulated (Figure 2A) and highly enriched in gene ontology categories related to immune cell differentiation and cellular movement, the latter being a feature of differentiated macrophages (Supplemental Figure S2A). In sum, a short treatment of PMA triggered robust induction of genes that confer monocytic/macrophagic identity in HL-60 cells (similar to primary cells after a short treatment with M-CSF in liquid culture, see Figure S2B\u2013C). Next, we depleted INTS13 in HL-60 cells using lentiviral-transduced shRNAs. We found 974 genes differentially expressed (2 independent replicates, fold change > +/\u2212 2, FDR < 5%) with respect to control (shLUC). The genes differentially expressed (DE) were enriched for hematopoiesis and immune cell development, as revealed by pathway analysis (Figure 2C). Notably, we observed that monocytic/macrophagic genes were not properly activated in the absence of INTS13 (Figure 2B, Supplemental Figure S2D\u2013E). Among DE genes were CSF1R (surface receptor for M-CSF) and ITGAM (part of the monocytic adhesion molecule CD11b) (Figure 2D). Taken together, our data suggest that INTS13 is critical for the timely activation of monocytic genes, and is essential to coordinate transcriptome changes that define the monocytic/macrophagic lineage.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Depletion of INTS13 affects the expression of monocyte-specific genes(A) 842 genes are differentially expressed between differentiated (PMA) and undifferentiated (CTRL) HL-60 cells (FDR <5%): 653 upregulated, 189 downregulated.

Our ChIP-seq analysis retrieved comparable numbers of binding sites for the two subunits: 11,418 replicated peaks for INTS11-CTRL; 14,337 for INTS11-PMA; 14,408 for INTS13-CTRL; and 15,966 for INTS13-PMA (Supplemental Table S4).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Modular properties of the Integrator complex during myeloid differentiation(A) Schematic panel describing the experimental pipeline. The catalytic activity of Integrator is impaired by INTS11 depletion, while it is not affected upon INTS13 depletion. The chromatin occupancy of the two subunits was profiled in undifferentiated (CTRL) and differentiated (PMA) cells by ChIP-seq with specific polyclonal antibodies. (B) Schematic panel describing the analytical pipeline. A differential binding analysis between CTRL and PMA conditions for INTS11 and INTS13 (edgeR, FDR < 10%) detected 2,438 INTS11-gained and 5,728 INTS13-gained regions, respectively. The majority of the INTS11-gained regions are proximal to protein coding genes (distance < 1 Kb from nearest TSS), while the large majority of INTS13-gained regions are distal (distance > 1 Kb from TSS). INTS13 is bound to all of the INTS11-gained regions. Conversely, a fraction of INTS13-gained regions is devoid of INTS11. (C) An intronic region within the CD84 gene on Chr16 and the JUNB locus both display robust recruitment of INTS11 and INTS13 upon PMA induction. (D) An intergenic region on Chr22 shows significant recruitment of INTS13, but not INTS11. (E) Average profile of INTS11 and INTS13 at all active U snRNAs (Gencode annotation) displays stronger enrichment of INTS11 compared to INTS13, suggesting that the INTS11 antibody performs well in ChIP-seq. (F) ChIP-qPCR on the TSS of FOS shows comparable enrichment for multiple INTS subunits, while the qPCR performed on a distal INTS13-gained regions suggests that INTS13 is the sole INTS subunit recruited. (G) Nuclear extract of HL-60 cells was fractionated on a Superose 6 chromatography column in the presence of 0.5M KCl. All Integrator subunits eluted with the high molecular weight fractions, corresponding to the intact complex. Additionally, INTS11 elutes in a known lower molecular weight interaction with the other catalytic subunit, INTS9. INTS13 is detected eluting with lower molecular weight fractions that differ from INTS11 and other Integrator subunits, suggesting that INTS13 can associate separately from the full complex in the nucleoplasm. Molecular weight standards are labeled above. Lanes are as follows: input, even fractions 20\u201346.To focus on the changes in Integrator binding upon differentiation, we independently performed differential binding analysis (CTRL vs PMA) using EdgeR for each of the two subunits (Robinson et al., 2010; FDR < 10%, Supplemental Table S1). With this analysis, we detected 5,728 regions that significantly gained INTS13 binding upon differentiation (hereafter INTS13-gained regions; Fig. 3B), and 2,438 regions with significant increase in INTS11 (hereafter INTS11-gained regions; Fig. 3B). Notably, INTS11-gained regions were largely enriched for proximal promoters (62.2%), mirroring the known RNAPII-associated activity of the complex, and displayed robust binding of INTS13 as well (Figs. 3B\u2013C). Conversely, INTS13-gained regions were largely found distal from the TSS of protein-coding genes (82.5%) and only partially overlapped with INTS11 (Figs 3B, D).We further investigated whether isolated INTS13-gained regions could simply be the result of differences in pull-down efficiency. First, we profiled INTS11 and INTS13 at all active U snRNA genes (due to their high rate of transcription, U snRNA loci bear the highest amount of the Integrator complex) and found INTS11 to be more abundant than INTS13, suggesting that the INTS11 antibody performs well in ChIP-seq (Fig. 3E). Next, we validated our findings by quantitative ChIP at select loci. While INTS13 and INTS11 were recovered at similar levels at the transcription start site of genes such as FOS and JUN (Fig. 3F and Supplemental Fig. S3), only INTS13 was significantly detected at intergenic loci for which ChIP-seq revealed isolated binding (Fig. 3F and Supplemental Fig. S3). INTS1 and INTS6, additional subunits of the full Integrator complex, were also absent from INTS13-specific sites (Fig. 3F and Supplemental Fig. S3). To investigate the modularity of the Integrator complex in vivo, we subjected nuclear extract of HL-60 cells to fractionation on a size-exclusion column (Superose 6). Notably, INTS13 \u2013 along with other Integrator subunits (INTS1, INTS6, INTS11) \u2013 elutes at a large molecular weight (>2MDa), comprising the full Integrator complex and associated RNAPII, as previously described (Baillat et al., 2005). However, we observed a second elution peak of INTS13, centered around fraction 38 (~200 KDa), which suggests the existence of INTS13 as a sub-module (Fig. 3G). To ensure that the smaller INTS13 module is biochemically distinct from the previously described INTS9/INTS11 heterodimer (Baillat et al., 2005; Albrecht et al., 2012) we performed immunoprecipitation of INTS13 from fraction 38 and subjected the eluate to LC-MS/MS. Besides INTS13, we retrieved peptides of INTS14 and INTS10 and no peptides of INTS11 (Supplemental Fig. S3). Together, our data demonstrate that INTS13 may also exist as a separate module in the nucleoplasm, perhaps associated with additional Integrator subunits, and may be selectively recruited to genomic sites during monocytic differentiation, even in the absence of the full Integrator complex.INTS13 binds to monocytic enhancers during differentiationTo understand the lineage-specific role of INTS13, we examined the regions where it was recruited to chromatin upon differentiation (5,728 INTS13-gained regions, Fig. 3B). Topological analysis suggested that the large majority of INTS13-gained sites (82.5% = 4,274 sites) were distal from the TSS of protein-coding genes (Fig. 3B). We identified the nearest genes for all the distal regions, based on distance from TSS, and examined gene ontology categories. We found that, collectively, INTS13-gained distal regions were significantly associated with genes implicated in immune cell development, trafficking, and hematopoiesis (Supplemental File S1). We hypothesized that these distal regions could be enhancers, and we characterized them by performing H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and total RNAPII ChIP-seq in HL-60 cells, both untreated and upon 16h of PMA stimulation. We specifically examined the status of acetylation and methylation at INTS13-gained distal regions and found that ~90% of these regions overlap a peak of H3K4me1, but only ~50% also overlap a peak of H3K27ac, supporting two distinct categories of INTS13-bound enhancers (Figure 4A). The first category (representing ~50% of all enhancers) comprised active enhancers with high H3K27ac, RNAPII, and INTS11 (Figure 4A\u2013B). In particular, the intronic enhancer of CSF1R, also known as the FIRE element (Himes et al., 2001; Krysinska et al., 2007), was active and significantly enriched for INTS13 (Figure 4B). Notably, these enhancers boast transcription of eRNAs, underscoring their active status (Supplemental Fig. S4). The second category of INTS13-bound enhancers was enriched in H3K4me1, but lacked RNAPII and INTS11, and displayed low or undetectable H3K27ac (Figure 4A\u2013B). These data suggested that INTS13 can also be recruited to enhancers that are poised (Figure 4B). Therefore, we speculated that INTS13 might be recruited to the active monocytic enhancers at earlier time points of PMA induction, when the enhancers are still in a poised/inactive state. Consistently, time course analysis of PMA induction suggested that binding of INTS13 precedes activation of the enhancer as measured by increase in acetylation of H3K27 (Fig. 4C). In particular, the enhancer of CSF1R displays a ~25-fold increase of INTS13 at 4h post-induction, whereas the surge of H3K27ac (~18 fold) was detected at 6h. On the other hand, poised enhancers bound by INTS13 at 16h of PMA treatment may be activated at later time points, as suggested by our ChIP-seq analysis of an extended time-course of H3K27ac (Figure 4D).Open in a separate windowFigure 4INTS13 at active and poised enhancers during monocytic differentiation(A) 4,274 of the 5,728 INTS13-gained regions are distal elements. The heatmap shows (K-means clustering) that nearly half of these distal elements are active enhancers (enriched for INTS13, INTS11, RNAPII and the chromatin marks H3K27ac, H3K4me1), while the other half likely represent poised/inactive enhancers, enriched for INTS13 and the chromatin mark H3K4me1. (B) Average profiles of H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and INTS13 at active and poised enhancers, with representative examples. (C) ChIP-qPCR of INTS13 and H3K27ac during a time course of early PMA induction (0h, 2h, 4h, 6h) for the CSF1R enhancer supports a model in which INTS13 binding precedes the activation of the enhancer. (D) Screenshots for two INTS13-gained enhancers classified as poised at 16h of PMA induction. These enhancers show increase of H3K27ac levels suggesting their activation at a later time point following INTS13 binding.In summary, we demonstrated that the INTS13 subunit of Integrator selectively binds monocytic enhancers during lineage-specific differentiation. INTS13 is recruited to enhancers before acetylation of H3K27 and is likely to play a role in the enhancer activation process.INTS13 targets Early Growth Response (EGR) responsive sites genome-wideThe Integrator complex is believed to be recruited at chromatin through its well-established interaction with the CTD of RNAPII (Baillat et al., 2005; Egloff et al., 2010). Our data suggested, for the first time, that a component of Integrator is recruited at chromatin independently of the rest of the complex and in the absence of RNAPII. Specifically, we have established that INTS13 targets poised enhancer sites, which are deprived of RNAPII and INTS11. We surmised that a transcription factor may be implicated in the recruitment of INTS13, whose protein sequence lacks any recognizable DNA/chromatin binding domain. Therefore, we performed de novo motif analysis on the 4,274 INTS13-gained enhancers enriched during differentiation (see Figure 4A). We identified a matrix for the EGR1/EGR2 transcription factors as the most significant hit of the motif analysis (Figure 5A). While other myeloid TF motifs were also retrieved (i.e. SPI1, ERG/Ets, AP-1), their relative abundance and their significance lag well behind that of EGR1/2 (see Supplemental File S2). Importantly, the EGR1/2 motif was centrally enriched, further underscoring its association with INTS13. We tested the possibility that association with INTS13 and EGR1 sites may be a conserved feature in different model systems. We treated Jurkat lymphoblastic T cells with PMA to mimic T-cell activation, and assessed the distribution of INTS13. Notably activation of Jurkat cells resulted in de novo binding of INTS13 to 1,026 EGR1 sites, distinct from the monocytic ones, which appeared to be enhancers associated with T cell activity (Supplemental Fig. S5A\u2013F; motif and IPA pathways analyses in Supplemental Files S3, S4).Open in a separate windowFigure 5INTS13 targets Early Growth Response (EGR) responsive sites genome-wide(A)\nDe novo motif analysis of 4,274 INTS13-gained enhancers (summits +/\u2212 100bp).

(C) Screenshot of the CSF1R intronic enhancer shows a significant recruitment of INTS13 and EGR1. (D) Depletion of EGR1 significantly reduces the binding of INTS13 at all of the 4,274 INTS13-gained enhancers in PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216). (E) Two intragenic enhancers of the CD84 locus are shown to exemplify loss of INTS13 upon EGR1 depletion. (F) The overlap between INTS13 and EGR1 peaks significantly increases (5% to 40%) upon PMA induction in HL-60 cells (Wilcoxon rank sum test p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216).The Early Growth Factor 1 and 2 are paralog genes that encode zinc finger transcription factors widely implicated in cell growth and differentiation. Importantly, EGR1 determines monocytic/macrophagic differentiation when expressed in primary and stable cell lines, similar to EGR2 (Laslo et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 1993). We performed ChIP-seq for EGR1 in HL-60 cells and observed co-localization of EGR1 and INTS13 genome-wide (Figure 5B\u2013C). Motif analysis of EGR1 also retrieved an EGR1/2 matrix nearly identical to that of INTS13 (Supplemental Figure S5G). ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed that EGR1 and EGR2 as both present at select monocytic enhancers, suggesting their functional redundancy in our system (Supplemental Figure S5H). We reasoned that binding of EGR1/2 may be a prerequisite for INTS13 binding to enhancers. To assess the importance of EGR1/2 in recruiting Integrator, we performed ChIP-seq of INTS13 after depletion of EGR1 in HL-60 (Figure 5D\u2013E, Supplemental Figure S5). INTS13 recruitment at enhancers was significantly impaired by EGR1 knock-down (Wilcoxon\u2019s rank sum test, p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216, Figure 5D\u2013E). While some INTS13 binding persisted, it must be noted that EGR2 is still expressed in these cells, even if a much lower level compared to EGR1, and that double depletion bears acute effects on survival and cell cycle (Laslo et al., 2006). Furthermore, we tested the overlap of INTS13 and EGR1 peaks pre- and post-stimulation of PMA. In undifferentiated cells, EGR1 colocalized with ~5% of INTS13 sites. Conversely, monocytic differentiation boosted the share of overlapping peaks to ~40% (Figure 5F). Collectively, we demonstrated that EGR1 is a determinant of INTS13 binding at enhancers during monocytic differentiation, while progenitor cells maintain distinct binding profiles for both. These data suggest that additional factors may be required to draw INTS13 to EGR1 responsive elements.NAB2 is an essential co-factor for enhancer activation mediated by INTS13 and EGR1/2We surmised that INTS13 binding to EGR1/2 at enhancers may be overall mediated by protein-protein interactions, therefore we performed proteomic analysis of untreated and differentiating HL-60 cells in two independent replicates. We used rabbit antibodies to immunoprecipitate endogenous INTS13 and subjected the eluate to LC-MS/MS analysis. As expected, INTS13 co-precipitated the full Integrator complex and subunits of RNAPII (Figure 6A and Supplemental Table S2). Next, we looked for non-Integrator components in our proteomic analysis. We previously described that widespread recruitment of INTS13 to EGR1/2 monocytic enhancers (Figure 3 and \u200band5)5) is specific to differentiating monocytes. In fact, INTS13 is largely dispensable for undifferentiated progenitor cells, but is required for maturation into functional monocytes/macrophages (Figure 2, Supplemental Fig. S2). We reasoned that additional protein partners of INTS13 may be specific to differentiating cells, therefore we calculated the ratio of peptides retrieved in differentiating (PMA) over undifferentiated (CTRL) HL-60 cells. Notably, we identified the NGFI-A-binding protein 2 (NAB2) as the most significantly enriched protein. NGFI-A is an alias for EGR1, since NAB2 and its functional homologue, NAB1, were originally identified as partners of EGR1 and EGR2 (Russo et al, 1995, Svaren et al., 1996). We confirmed the association of NAB2 with INTS13 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments from the nuclear extract of HL-60 cells, and observed that NAB2 was lowly abundant in untreated cells but accumulated upon differentiation (Figure 6B). Importantly, we observed a similar regulation in primary cells: NAB2 was barely detectable in primary human stem and progenitor cells (CD34+) and increased dramatically during monocytic differentiation stimulated by M-CSF (Supplemental Fig. S6). To further validate the interaction of NAB2 with INTS13/Integrator, we generated stable cell clones expressing FLAG-tagged NAB2 and performed a reverse LC-MS/MS experiment. FLAG affinity purification of NAB2 complexes co-purified the EGR proteins and INTS13, along with several other subunits of Integrator (Figure 6C). Our data imply that NAB2 bridges the interaction of INTS13 with EGR1/EGR2 and suggest that a ternary complex composed of INTS13/NAB2/EGR may form at monocytic enhancers. We performed ChIP-seq of endogenous NAB2 in HL-60 cells and found a distinct distribution of NAB2 peaks during differentiation. Consistent with INTS13, NAB2 showed a significant recruitment at the 4,274 monocytic enhancers (Figure 6D), colocalizing with EGR1 and INTS13 at most of these sites (Figure 6D\u2013E and Supplemental Figure S6). Interestingly, best correlation between INTS13 and EGR1 happens on NAB2 peaks (Supplemental Figure S6C). Notably, NAB2 binding dynamics resembled those of INTS13, preceding acetylation of the enhancer, such as in CSF1R (Supplemental Fig. S6). Further, ChIP-seq on PMA-induced HL-60 showed that INTS13 binding at the 4,274 monocytic enhancers was severely impaired by NAB2 depletion (two independent shRNAs; p<0.0001; Fig. 6F\u2013G, Supplemental Fig. S6). This suggested NAB2 as the molecular bridge that recruits INTS13 to EGR1/2 responsive elements. Moreover, 679 genes were differentially expressed in PMA-treated HL-60 upon NAB2-KD (517 downregulated, FDR < 5%, Fig. 6H\u2013I). IPA analysis confirmed enrichment in hematopoiesis pathways (Fig. 6H\u2013I, Supplemental Figure S6), thus recapitulating the results obtained upon depletion of INTS13 (Fig. 2B\u2013D).Open in a separate windowFigure 6NAB2 is an essential co-factor of monocytic differentiation and mediates INTS13 binding at EGR1 sites(A) Endogenous INTS13 was affinity-purified from undifferentiated and differentiating HL-60 cells. The interactome of INTS13 was detected by LC-MS/MS. The plot shows adjusted protein enrichment values (iBAQ, y-axis) and the ratio of peptides in differentiated (PMA) vs. undifferentiated (CTRL) cells. INTS13 interacts with nearly all Integrator subunits and RNAPII, interaction with the EGR1 co-factor NAB2 is specific to monocytic differentiation. (B) Immunoprecipitation of INTS13 in undifferentiated (CTRL) and differentiated (PMA) HL-60 cells confirms the interaction between INTS13 and NAB2 after PMA treatment. (C) LC-MS/MS analysis of stable HL-60 clones expressing exogenous FLAG-NAB2. NAB2 was affinity purified by anti-FLAG conjugated beads. NAB2 interacts with NAB1, EGR-family members (EGR1, EGR2, EGR3), INTS13, and other Integrator subunits. (D) Heatmaps of NAB2, INTS13 and EGR1 ChIP-seq in undifferentiated (CTRL) and/or differentiated (PMA) HL-60. Upon PMA treatment, NAB2, INTS13 and EGR1 co-localize at INTS13-gained enhancers. (E) Screenshot of the intragenic CSF1R enhancer shows recruitment of NAB2 and INTS13 during differentiation. (F) Screenshot of the CSF1R intragenic enhancer shows reduction of INTS13 recruitment upon NAB2 depletion. (G) Average profiles and box-plot display a significant decrease of INTS13 at the 4,274 INTS13-gained enhancers upon NAB2-KD (two different shRNAs). (H) RNA-seq analysis identified 517 genes downregulated upon NAB2-KD (two different shRNAs) during PMA-induced differentiation. IPA analysis for these genes revealed enrichment for pathways associated to hematopoiesis and differentiation, recapitulating the results previously obtained with INTS13 depletion (Fig. 2). (I) Prototypical monocytic genes such as CSF1R and CD84 are severely downregulated by NAB2 depletion in RNA-seq experiments. (J) Mean fluorescence intensity of CD11b is impaired in differentiated HL-60 cells after depletion of NAB2 with two different shRNAs (16h post-PMA induction). (K) Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay of cord blood derived CD34+ cells infected with shRNAs against NAB2 and EGR1 shows that the number of monocytic/macrophagic colonies is significantly reduced in both NAB2- and EGR1-depleted cells when compared to control.If NAB2 is an essential co-factor that elicits enhancer activation via recruitment of INTS13, depletion of NAB2 should also impair development of monocytic/macrophagic cells and phenocopy the effect of either INTS13 depletion (Fig. 1F, H) or EGR1 depletion (Laslo et al., 2006). Coherently, both NAB2 and EGR1 were indeed required for differentiation of HL-60 cells (mean fluorescence intensity \u2013 MFI - of CD11b, Fig. 6J) and were essential to form M-CSF-derived monocytic colonies from CD34+ stem and progenitor cells (Fig. 6K, Supplemental Fig. S6).To further validate the INTS13/NAB2 functional association in physiological conditions, we performed additional ChIP-seq experiments using circulating monocytes obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Terminal differentiation of monocytes into adherent macrophages reignites the enhancer-promoter network that is responsible for the earlier differentiation stages (CD34+ to monocytes) and provides a physiological model for enhancer regulation (Heinz et al., 2010; Pham et al., 2012). Consistent with our findings from HL-60, the ChIP-seq data from the differentiating macrophages supported a significant recruitment of both INTS13 and NAB2 at the previously identified 4,274 monocytic enhancers, including CSF1R (Supplemental Fig. S7). Furthermore, we independently depleted EGR1 and NAB2 from a pool of mobilized CD34+ cells, performed INTS13 ChIP-seq at day 5 of monocytic differentiation, and observed, in both cases, a sharp and significant decrease of INTS13 across all genome (Supplemental Fig. S7). Together, the data obtained in primary cells fully support our previous findings in HL-60 cells, and in particular the role of NAB2 and EGR1 in the recruitment of INTS13 at thousands of lineage specific enhancers.The INTS13/EGR/NAB2 axis brings about activation of poised enhancersWe performed Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) on the enhancer of CSF1R to infer the consequences of INTS13 depletion on genome architecture. During differentiation of HL-60 cells, we detected a robust interaction between the intronic enhancer of CSF1R and the proximal promoter, as compared to other regions within the CSF1R gene or with the promoter of neighboring genes (Fig. 7A). Specifically, we observed a ~5 fold decrease in the frequency of enhancer-promoter interactions following depletion of INTS13, while all non-specific contact pairs used as controls (NEG1 to NEG5) were not affected (Fig. 7A). This assay demonstrated the functional requirement of INTS13 for enhancer-promoter looping of a monocytic enhancer engaged during differentiation.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Targeted enhancer activation by INTS13(A) Chromosome conformation capture (3C) reveals that depletion of INTS13 elicits a significant reduction of the interaction frequency between the intragenic enhancer of CSF1R (FIRE element) and the promoter of the same gene, suggesting that INTS13 mediates loop formation, enhancer/promoter interaction, and ultimately the expression of the CSF1R (see also Fig. 2D). As control, we gauged the interaction frequency between the enhancer (anchor) and 5 additional surrounding sites (NEG1 to NEG5), including the TSS of 3 additional genes, the 3\u2032 end of one gene and a non-enhancer intronic region of CSF1R. (B) We propose a model for the role of Integrator in targeted enhancer activation during cell differentiation. In undifferentiated cells, lineage-specific genes are not expressed, and their corresponding enhancers are inactive or poised. (I). Upon lineage commitment, EGR1 recognizes and binds to its motifs across monocytic enhancers, together with NAB2 (II). INTS13 is recruited by the NAB2/EGR1 complex, and co-localizes at the same enhancers (III). Following INTS13 priming of the enhancers, the Integrator complex is assembled, facilitating enhancer activation and chromatin looping to ultimately activate transcription of the target genes (IV).Collectively, our data demonstrated that INTS13/Integrator targets poised enhancers that are required for monocytic differentiation. While these enhancers are primarily bound by the EGR1/2 transcription factors, the co-factor NAB2 is the essential molecular bridge that allows binding of INTS13 to EGR-dependent enhancers. Altogether, the INTS13/EGR1/NAB2 axis is functionally required to coordinate and elicit activation of monocytic and macrophagic genes during myeloid differentiation (Fig. 7B). DiscussionIn this work, we characterize a novel function of the Integrator protein complex, and demonstrate that an accessory (non-catalytic) subunit of a general activator machinery can operate as a mediator of lineage-determining TFs. We characterize a novel mechanism of enhancer regulation, in which a co-activator subunit (INTS13), a DNA-binding transcription factor (EGR1/2), and a non-DNA-binding co-factor (NAB2) take part. We demonstrate co-occupancy of this ternary complex at chromatin and capture their physical interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS. Our data suggest that the INTS13/EGR/NAB2 axis is a priming complex for enhancers. In fact, we initially found that INTS13/EGR/NAB2 bind to active and poised enhancers. Poised enhancers, which lack H3K27 acetylation but retain mono-methylation of H3K4, have been previously described in differentiated and multipotent cells (Creyghton et al., 2010; Ostuni et al., 2013; Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011; Zentner et al., 2011). We showed that INTS13 and NAB2 target poised enhancers during monocytic differentiation, preceding the wave of H3K27 hyperacetylation. Persistently poised enhancers, that we detect after 16h of PMA stimulation, may become activated at a later time point, as our data suggest. It is also possible that additional co-factors are needed to elicit activation of a subset of INTS13/EGR1/NAB2 targets. Importantly, enhancers regulated by INTS13, EGR1 and NAB2 are required for proper expression of genes that confer monocytic identity. Our analysis of EGR1 represents the first profiling of this zinc finger TF in differentiating progenitors and reveals the unexpected breadth of its role as a lineage-determining factor via enhancer regulation. TFs such as PU.1 and ERG (Ets) are generally considered master regulators of myeloid commitment (Alvarez-Errico et al., 2015). In fact, when we searched for DNA motifs associated with INTS13-enhancers we retrieved both PU.1 and ERG, though less significantly enriched than EGR1 and not centrally positioned with respect to the INTS13 peak summit, underscoring that the Integrator complex preferentially operates via EGR1 during monocytic differentiation. EGR1 and EGR2 were previously proposed to regulate monocytic differentiation by repressing granulocytic genes (Krishnaraju et al., 2001; Laslo et al., 2006; Nguyen et al., 1993). Instead, our data suggest that EGR1 and EGR2 (which we find functionally redundant by ChIP and proteomic analyses) directly regulate enhancer-mediated activation of monocytic- and macrophagic-specific genes, such as CSF1R. Furthermore, we revealed an essential and unexpected role of the co-factor NAB2. EGR1 and EGR2 were previously shown to interact with NAB2 by two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down experiments, such interaction is deemed important for neuronal differentiation and development (Kumbrink et al., 2005; Kumbrink et al., 2010; Svaren et al., 1996). Previous biochemical evidences suggested that NAB2 merely served as co-repressor for a subset of EGR1 target promoters (Lucerna et al., 2003; Svaren et al., 1996). Our data reveal, instead, that NAB2 functions as a molecular switch, determining INTS13 recruitment at EGR1 sites in both primary and HL-60 cells. Furthermore, depletion of NAB2 phenocopies loss of INTS13 and EGR1: cell lines and primary CD34+ cells depleted of NAB2 fail to activate a monocytic transcriptome and are blocked at a progenitor stage. Collectively, we present the first comprehensive molecular characterization of NAB2 and provide the first evidence of NAB2 binding profile at chromatin. We propose that the role of NAB2 in myeloid differentiation is to regulate timely activation of monocytic enhancers by recruiting INTS13. Beyond monocytic differentiation, EGR1/NAB2-dependent enhancers may play a role in other developmental pathways. For instance, we suggest that T-cell activation may also require INTS13 as a modulator of EGR1 sites. Also, EGR1 and NAB2 were previously implicated in neural development, raising the possibility that INTS13 is a major effector of cell commitment and differentiation in such context.Another critical finding of our work is that the Integrator complex is not functionally homogeneous. In particular, we focus on the INTS13 subunit, which was recently described as an integral component of the human and drosophila Integrator complexes (Chen et al., 2012; Malovannaya et al., 2011). Our data show that INTS13 is, de facto, a physical and functional submodule of Integrator. INTS13 is part of the full Integrator complex in myeloid cells (Figure 1A, \u200b,3G3G and \u200band6A),6A), but can also exist as a small subcomplex (perhaps associated with additional INTS subunits, Fig. 3G). INTS13 is not required for the core catalytic activity of Integrator (RNA endonucleolysis), nor is it essential for cell growth of progenitor and stem cells under resting conditions (Fig. 1), but is indispensable for cell commitment and differentiation. Unlike INTS11, INTS9, and INTS1 (Baillat et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012), INTS13 is dispensable for processing of U snRNAs and, likely, for termination of noncoding eRNAs that employs the same catalytic activity centered around the \u03b2-CASP domain of INTS11 (Lai et al., 2015). A previous report suggested that INTS13 (also known as ASUN) had an influence on U snRNA processing (Chen et al., 2012). However, the effect of INTS13 depletion on a GFP-UsnRNA reporter system was significantly lower than the effect of INTS9 depletion (Chen et al., 2012). Furthermore, reporter constructs may not entirely reflect Integrator\u2019s activity at endogenous U snRNA loci. However, we cannot exclude that INTS13 may retain regulatory activity towards U snRNA processing in lower eukaryotes. Further studies are needed to address the evolution of the Integrator complex and to determine the complete map of core and accessory subunits of this essential transcriptional regulator.In conclusion, our data suggest that large and ubiquitously expressed co-activator complexes are not just passive facilitators of transcription, but may actively partake in the organization of cell- and tissue-specific enhancer-promoter activity.

Supernatant kept as flow-through. Beads were washed three times with co-IP buffer, followed by one wash with 0.05% NP-40 in PBS. Glycine elution was performed with agitation in 0.1M glycine pH 3.0 for one minute, and 1M Tris base pH 11.0 was added to neutralize the pH of the eluate. Flag-peptide competition elution was performed by incubation with excess FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Eluate was stored at \u221280\u00b0C or prepared for SDS-PAGE.Size-exclusion chromatography 0.4 ml of HL-60 nuclear extract (5mg total protein) was loaded onto a Superose 6 10/30 GL column (GE Life Science) equilibrated with BC500 buffer. Flow rate was fixed at 0.4 ml/min, and 0.4 ml fractions were collected.Antibody crosslinking Dynabeads Protein A (Invitrogen), 500 \u03bcl, were washed three times with PBS prior to crosslinking with 20 \u03bcg INTS13 antibody (Bethyl). Beads and antibody were diluted in PBST and incubated with agitation for 2 hours at room temperature. The antibody-bound beads were washed three times with 200mM triethanolamine pH 8.2, then resuspended in freshly made 10mM DMP (dimethyl pimedlimidate dihydrochloride) in 200mM triethanolamine pH 8.2 and gently rotated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The crosslinking reaction was stopped with gentle rotation in 50mM Tris pH 7.5 for 15 minutes. Crosslinked beads were washed three times with PBST, twice with 0.1M glycine pH 3.0, twice with PBST, and stored in PBST + 0.02% sodium azide at 4\u00b0C.Mass spectrometry After co-immunoprecipitation, eluates were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described previously. The eluates were run into a 10% Tris-glycine gel at 110V for ten minutes. The gel was stained with Colloidal Blue staining kit (Invitrogen), and further processed at the proteomics facility at the Wistar Institute. Briefly, the gel lanes were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS on the Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer. The data were searched against the UniProt human database (September 2016) and provided sequences using MaxQuant 1.5.2.8 (Cox and Mann, 2008). False discovery rates for protein and peptide identifications were set at 1%.Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) Chromosome Conformation Capture was performed as reported in (Dekker et al., 2002) with minor changes. 1\u00d7107 HL-60 cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking. The reaction was quenched with 0.25 M glycine and cells were collected by centrifugation at 225 g for 8 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Cell pellet was lysed in 5 ml cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 0.1 mM EGTA) with freshly added protease inhibitors on ice for 10 minutes.Isolated nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C then re-suspended in 0.5 ml of 1X Cutsmart buffer (New England Biolabs) with 0.3% SDS and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C while shaking at 900 rpm. Next, samples were incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C after addition of 2% Triton X-100.400 U of PstI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) were added to the nuclei and incubated at 37\u00b0C over night while shacking at 900 rpm. 5 \u03bcl of samples were collected before and after the enzyme reaction to evaluate digestion efficiency.The reaction was stopped by addition of 1.6% SDS and incubation at 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes while shaking at 900 rpm. The sample was then diluted 10-fold with 1.15\u00d7 ligation Buffer (660 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM DTT, 50 mM MgCl2, 10mM ATP) and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C while shaking at 900 rpm. 100 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) were added to the sample and the reaction was carried at 16\u00b0C over night. For each sample, 300 \u03bcg of Proteinase K were added for protein digestion and de-crosslinking at 65\u00b0C overnight. On the next day, RNA was removed by adding 300 \u03bcg of RNAse and incubating the sample for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. DNA was purified twice by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol over night at \u221280\u00b0C. Purified DNA was quantified by qubit, diluted to 3ng/ul and analyzed by real time quantitative PCR. The \u0394Ct method was applied for analyzing data, using the actin Ct values as control. Primer sequences are reported in Supplemental Table 3.ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR sample processing Samples from different conditions were processed together to prevent batch effects. ChIP-seq was performed as previously described (Lai et al., 2015), with some modifications. For each replicate, 10 million HL-60 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, harvested and washed twice with 1\u00d7 PBS. The pellet was resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0,7% SDS, 500 \u03bcM DTT, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA) and chromatin was sheared to an average length of 200\u2013400 bp, using a Covaris S220 Ultrasonicator. The chromatin lysate was diluted with SDS-free ChIP lysis buffer. For ChIP-seq, 10 \u03bcg of antibody (5 \u03bcg for histone modifications) was added to the 10 million lysated cells along with Protein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. For RNAPII ChIP-seq, a custom rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal domain was used. On day 2, beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers: Mixed Micelle Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.2% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 65% sucrose), Buffer 500 (500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% Na deoxycholate, 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA), LiCl/detergent wash (250 mM LiCl, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA) and a final wash was performed with 1\u00d7 TE. Finally, beads were resuspended in 1\u00d7 TE containing 1% SDS and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min to elute immunocomplexes. Elution was repeated twice, and the samples were further incubated overnight at 65 \u00b0C to reverse cross-linking, along with the untreated input (5% of the starting material). On day 3, after treatment with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 3 h, DNA was purified with Zymo ChIP DNA Clear Concentrator kit (Zymo research) and quantified with QUBIT. Barcoded libraries were made with NEB ULTRA II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500, producing 75bp SE reads. For ChIP-qPCR samples, on day 3 DNA was purified with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega), resuspended in 200 ul and 5 ul were for each PCR reaction. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2ChIP-seq analyses Sequences were aligned to the reference hg19, using Burrows Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), with the MEM algorithm (Li, 2013). Aligned reads were filtered based on mapping quality (MAPQ > 10) to restrict our analysis to higher quality and likely uniquely mapped reads, and PCR duplicates were removed. We called peaks for each individual using MACS2, at 5% FDR, with default parameters (Zhang et al., 2008). Heatmaps and average profiles were generated with ChAsE v. 1.0.11 (Younesy et al., 2016). EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) was used to detect cis-regulatory elements (CREs) which significantly gained INTS13 and/or INTS11 after PMA treatment (FDR < 10%). Specifically, INTS11 PMA peaks replicated across all samples were used as reference for the INTS11 differential binding analysis. Similarly, INTS13 replicated across all samples were used as reference for the INTS13 differential binding analysis.Subcellular fractionation Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (Lai et al., 2015), with minor changes. Briefly, cells were resuspended in cold cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.15% NP-40) using wide orifice tips, incubated on ice for 5 minutes, layered onto cold sucrose buffer (10 Mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 Mm NaCl, 24% sucrose w/v) and centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Nuclei were gently resuspended in glycerol buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.85 mM DTT) using wide orifice tips, and same amount of nuclei lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 M urea, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) was added. After a brief incubation for 1 minute on ice, chromatin was isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Chromatin-bound RNA was isolated with Trizol protocol and miRNeasy kit (Qiagen).RNA-seq sample processing Samples from different conditions were processed together to prevent batch effects. Total RNA and chromatin-bound RNA were extracted using Zymo Direct-Zol RNA miniprep Kit (Zymo research) and miRNeasy kit with Trizol protocol and in-column DNAse treatment (Qiagen), respectively. Quality of total RNA was assessed by the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) using Agilent Bioanalyzer. All retained RNA samples had a RIN > 8.1 \u03bcg of total or chromatin-bound RNA were depleted of ribosomal RNA using the NEBNext rRNA depletion kit (New England Biolabs). rRNA-depleted RNA was purified with the miRNEasy kit (Qiagen) and used to produce barcoded RNA sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs), and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500, producing 75bp SE reads.RNA-seq analyses Reads were aligned to hg19 using STAR v2.5 (Dobin et al., 2013), in 2-pass mode with the following parameters: --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --outFilterMultimapNmax 10 --outFilterMismatchNmax 10 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.3 --alignIntronMin 21 --alignIntronMax 0 --alignMatesGapMax 0 --alignSJoverhangMin 5 --runThreadN 12 --twopassMode Basic --twopass1readsN 60000000 --sjdbOverhang 100. We filtered bam files based on alignment quality (q = 10) using Samtools v0.1.19 (Li et al., 2009). We used the latest annotations obtained from Ensembl to build reference indexes for the STAR alignment. FeatureCounts (Liao et al., 2014) was used to count reads mapping to each gene. RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011) was instead used to obtain FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments mapped). We analyzed differential gene expression levels using read counts, normalized by feature length with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014), with the following model: design = ~condition, where condition indicates either CTRL or PMA.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISAll statistical analyses were performed using R v3.3.1.DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITYTotal RNA-seq, chromatin RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data are available on GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE106359\",\"term_id\":\"106359\"}}GSE106359.Figures were made with the package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).
