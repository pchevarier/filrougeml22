IntroductionCardiac muscle contraction in vertebrates is mediated by two molecular motors, MYH6 and MYH7, which are also referred to as myosin heavy chain \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively [1], [2]. Actin-induced ATPase activity of the MYH7 protein is two- to three-fold less than that of the MYH6 protein, and a relatively subtle change in the MYH6/MYH7 ratio has been shown to affect cardiac function. For example, myocyte fragments containing 12% MYH6 protein develop 52% greater power output than that by myocyte fragments without MYH6 [3]. A decrease in MYH6 expression and increase in MYH7 expression is observed in rodent models with experimental heart failure [4] and myocardial infarction [5]. Thus, the transition from MYH6 to MYH7 found in heart failure is thought to be a maladaptive response [6]. The thyroid hormone (T3) signal is shown to strongly activate transcription of the MYH6 gene (positive regulation) and reduces that of the MYH7 gene (negative regulation) in mice and rats [1], [2], [7]. MYH7 represents 90% of total cardiac myosin heavy chains in rodent embryos, with the remainder being MYH6. However, the MYH6/MYH7 ratio is markedly inversed by an elevation in serum T3 and T4 levels after birth. Interestingly, a T3-induced decrease in MYH7 and increase in MYH6 levels are similar to their gene expression profiles found in physiological cardiac hypertrophy induced by exercise [6], [8], while cardiac function has been shown to be reduced in hypothyroidism. Overexpression of the T3 receptor (TR) isoforms [9] or type-2 deiodinase [10] in the mouse heart is known to improve cardiac function. However, abnormally high concentrations of serum thyroid hormone may induce tachycardia and/or cardiac ischemia [6]. Thus, developing a T3 analog that does not have a deleterious effect on the heart may be a promising treatment for heart failure.TRs belong to the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily, and are encoded by two separate alleles, TR\u03b1 and \u03b2. The TR\u03b1 gene generates TR\u03b11, \u0394\u03b11, \u03b12, \u0394\u03b12, and \u03b13 through alternative splicing while the TR\u03b2 gene generates TR\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u0394\u03b23 with the use of the different promoters. Among them, TR\u03b11, \u03b21 and \u03b22 are regarded as the major functional TRs [11]. In contrast to the limited distribution of the TR\u03b22 protein (pituitary, hypothalamus, inner ear, and retina), TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 are ubiquitously expressed [11]. Although various conditions including T3 administration [12], [13] and pressure overload [4] influence the expression levels of endogenous TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21, the amount of TR\u03b11 mRNA in the stable condition of cardiac tissue was shown to be two- to three-fold higher than that of TR\u03b21 mRNA [4], [7]. Thus, TR\u03b11 is regarded as the major mediator of T3 signaling for cardiac function [14]. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by T3 (positive regulation) has been clarified in detail [11]. In positively regulated genes, including the MYH6 gene [7], [15], TR heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and each receptor directly recognizes one of the half-sites (typically, AGGTCA) of T3-responsive element (TRE) via their DNA-binding domains (DBDs) [11]. Unliganded TR on TRE associates with co-repressors, such as nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) or silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), resulting in the active suppression of target genes (silencing) [11], [16]. Upon T3 binding to TR via its ligand-binding domain (LBD), silencing is relieved by the dissociation of NCoR or SMRT from TR. T3-bound TR (T3/TR) subsequently recruits co-activators including the p160 family, cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300, and MED1, all of which interact with T3/TR via their LXXLL motifs (L is leucine and X is any amino acid) and activate the transcription of target genes (transactivation). The p160 family and CBP/p300 exhibit intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity while MED1 is a constituent of the Mediator complex that precisely mediates information of liganded NHRs and DNA-binding transcription factors to RNA polymerase II [17].In contrast to positive regulation by liganded NHR, little is known about the molecular mechanism of negative regulation by T3, and a strategy to investigate it has not yet been established [16], [18]. Previous studies reported that TR\u03b21, but not TR\u03b11, mediates negative regulation of the MYH7 gene [4], [19]. However, this should be reconsidered because TR\u03b21-deficient mice exhibited the inhibition of MYH7 expression by T3 presumably via the remaining TR\u03b11 [20]. Although the existence of a negative TRE (nTRE) has been postulated in the MYH7 promoter as sequences homologous to a single half-site [2], [21], its function has not been experimentally verified. The best example of T3-dependent negative regulation was described for the gene encoding the \u03b2 subunit of thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone \u03b2 subunit, TSH\u03b2) [16], [22]. Because TSH\u03b2 expression in the pituitary thyrotroph increases in hypothyroidism, one would presume that unliganded TR activates the TSH\u03b2 gene. Moreover, it has been proposed that unliganded TR may be critical for the global activity of the TSH\u03b2 promoter. Based on this, a short DNA sequence (GGGTCA) similar to a single half-site was reported as nTRE [22], which is required for transactivation of the TSH\u03b2 promoter by unliganded TR in HEK293 cells [23]. Nevertheless, TSH\u03b2 expression was not decreased, but rather increased in mice completely deficient in both TR\u03b2 and TR\u03b1 genes {[16] and references therein}. This finding implies that unliganded TR per se is not a transcriptional activator for the TSH\u03b2 gene and raises the question about the definition of nTRE [24]. We previously demonstrated that reported nTRE [23] is dispensable for inhibition of the TSH\u03b2 gene by T3/TR using monkey kidney-derived CV-1 cells [25] co-expressed with two transcription factors, GATA2 and Pit1, which are essential for TSH\u03b2 gene activity and are critical determinants of thyrotroph development [16], [24], [26], [27]. We proposed the tethering model, in which the DBD of TR does not directly recognize DNA, but associates with the GATA2-Zn finger domain via protein-protein interactions [16], [27]. In this scenario, TR interferes with the transactivating function of GATA2 in a T3-dependent manner, resulting in the TSH\u03b2 gene repression.As in the case of the TSH\u03b2 gene, MYH7 expression was also maintained in mice completely deficient of both the TR\u03b2 and TR\u03b1 genes [20]. Thus, MYH7 expression is thought to be maintained by a factor other than unliganded TRs. Morkin et al. [1] analyzed the 5\u2032 flanking region (nt \u22121285 to nt +126) of the human MYH7 gene using a primary culture of rat fetus cardiomyocytes. The results of this study showed that the short sequence encompassing nt \u2212277 to \u2212298 is critical for MYH7 expression. Similar conclusions were made for the rat and rabbit MYH7 genes [28], [29]. These studies suggested that two MCAT (muscle C, A, and T) sites and an A/T-rich sequence in this region play a pivotal role in basal expression of the MYH7 gene. The importance of these elements was also confirmed by a study with transgenic mice in which the reporter gene harboring 5.6 kb of the mouse MYH7 promoter was introduced [30]. Promoter analyses with rat cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle-derived cells have suggested that TEAD/TEF family transcription factors (referred to as TEADs) recognize MCAT sequences and the A/T-rich element in the MYH7 gene [1], [2], [31], [32]\nvia the TEA domain, which is highly conserved among TEADs [31]\u2013[34]. The TEAD family consists of four members, i.e., TEAD-1 (TEF-1/NTEF), TEAD-2 (ETF/ETEF-1/TEF-4), TEAD-3 (DTEF-1/TEF-5ETFR-1), and TEAD-4 (RTEF-1/TEF-R1/TEF-3/ETFR-2/FR-191) [32]. While TEAD-2 is expressed temporarily in the developmental stage, the expression of other TEADs has been detected in adult tissues [32]. Although TEAD-1 knockout mice show embryonic lethality, mice in which TEAD-1 was conditionally overexpressed in cardiomyocytes exhibited heart failure with increased MYH7 gene expression [35]. In contrast to the ubiquitous localization of TEAD-1, TEAD-3 expression was shown to be more abundant in the heart than in skeletal muscle [32], [33] and TEAD-4 was mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and the lung [33]. Maeda et al. [36] suggested that TEAD-3 mediates \u03b11-adrenaline signals, which play a pivotal role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy accompanied with increases in the expression of MYH7 [2], [32], [37].Interestingly, in vivo\n[21], [38] and in vitro\n[15], [39] studies have suggested that negative regulation by T3/TR can be detected in the rodent MYH7 promoter containing these MCAT sites and an A/T-rich region. It may be reasonable that T3-dependent repression is detectable only when T3/TR interferes with the activity of DNA-binding transcription factors, which maintain overall transcription levels [16], [18]. Based on this hypothesis, we explored the molecular mechanism by which T3/TR regulates TEAD-dependent activity of the MYH7 promoter. Because endogenous TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 expression levels were shown to be markedly affected by various conditions including T3 administration [12], [13] and cardiac pressure overload [4], we used a cell culture system. In addition to rat neonatal cardiac muscle-derived H9c2 cells [40], we employed kidney-derived CV-1 cells [25] because they have often been used not only in studies of the MYH6 gene (positive regulation) [15], but also of the TSH\u03b2 gene (negative regulation) [16], [26], [27]. Our reconstitution system revealed that unliganded TR is not the transcriptional activator for the MYH7 gene, and that putative nTREs [2], [21] are dispensable for T3-induced inhibition. We propose here a tethering mechanism in which T3/TR inhibits the transcriptional activity of TEADs via the interaction of TR-DBD with the TEA domain of TEADs, which causes the inhibition of MYH7 promoter activity. Although distinct transcription factors, i.e., TEADs and GATA2, maintain the basal activities of MYH7 and TSH\u03b2 genes, respectively, the tethering mechanism is thought to be a common aspect in the T3-dependent negative regulation of these two genes. Materials and MethodsPlasmid constructionsBecause the firefly luciferase-based reporter gene may be artificially suppressed by T3/TR [16], [18], [26], we employed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)- and modified Renilla luciferase (hRluc)-based reporter systems (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The human MYH7 promoter encompassing nt \u2212293/+125 was fused with the CAT reporter gene and hRluc reporter gene, generating MYH7-CAT and MYH7-hRluc, respectively. Del-1-CAT (deletion of distal MCAT and the A/T-rich region) and Del-2-CAT (deletion of the A/T-rich region and both MCATs) were generated using PCR amplification of \u2212254/+125 and \u2212198/+125 of the human MYH7 promoter, respectively. Using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), we mutated distal MCAT (Mut-1 and Mut-dM), the A/T-rich region (Mut-2 and Mut-AT), distal MCAT plus the A/T-rich region (Mut-3), proximal MCAT (Mut-4 and Mut-pM), both MCATs plus the A/T-rich region (Mut-5 and Mut-MAM) and all of the reported nTREs (MYH7-mnTRE-CAT). Expression plasmids for human TR\u03b21 (pCMX-hTR\u03b21), human TR\u03b11 (pCMX-hTR\u03b11), and the deletion constructs of hTR\u03b21 (C1 and C2), and GST-DBD have been described previously [16], [27]. The expression plasmid (pcDNA3-6myc-TEAD-1) for the N-terminal six tandem myc-tagged mouse TEAD-1 (6myc-TEAD-1) was a gift from Dr. Michinori Kitagawa (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). Expression plasmids for mouse TEAD-3/DTEF-1 (pXJ40-DTEF-1) and mouse TEAD-4/RTEF-1 (pXJ40-RTEF-1) were provided by Dr. Tomoji Maeda (Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan). Using site-directed mutagenesis, a stop codon was introduced at codon 220 in pcDNA3-6myc-TEAD-1 to generate TEAD-1\u0394C. The DNA fragment encompassing codons 101\u2013426 of mouse TEAD-1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the Not1/Xho1 site in the pcDNA3-6myc vector to generate pcDNA3-6myc-TEDA-1-TEA. The TEA domain of mouse TEAD-1 (codons 1\u2013101) was amplified by PCR and was subcloned into the BamH1/Xho1 site in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to generate pGEX-4T-1-TEA (GST-TEA). All mutated sequences and subcloning sites were confirmed by sequencing.Cell culture and transient transfectionMonkey kidney-derived CV-1 cells [25] and rat neonatal cardiac muscle-derived H9c2 cells [40] were grown in a monolayer culture at 37\u00b0C under CO2/air (1\u223619) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml). CV1 cells were trypsinized and plated in 60 mm dishes for 24 h prior to transient transfection using the calcium-phosphate technique. Cells were transfected at a density of 2\u00d7105 cells per well with 2.0 \u00b5g of the MYH7-CAT reporter gene, 0.4 \u00b5g of expression vectors for the TEAD family transcription factors and/or TRs, and 1.8 \u00b5g of the \u03b2-galactosidase expression vector, pCH111 (a modified version of pCH110, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The total amount of the expression plasmid was adjusted with the pCMX empty vector (7.2 \u00b5g of DNA in total per dish). After cells were exposed to calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates for 20 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS depleted of thyroid hormone [26], [41] or medium supplemented with T3. Cells were harvested after incubation for an additional 24 h, and CAT activity was measured as described previously [27]. H9c2 cells at a density of 2\u00d7105 cells per well were transfected with 4.0 \u00b5g of the MYH7-hRluc reporter gene and 0.4 \u00b5g of expression vectors for TR\u03b21 using Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 5 h incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5% FCS depleted of thyroid hormones or medium supplemented with T3. Renilla luciferase activities were measured with the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corp.) using a Lumicounter 700 (Microtech Nichi-on, Chiba, Japan). CAT and Renilla luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency determined by the \u03b2-galactosidase assay [27]. We performed transfections with pCMV-CAT (5.0 ng/well) or pGL4.74[hRLuc/TK] (2.0 \u00b5g/well), for each reporter assay, the magnitudes of which were adjusted to a value of 100.Gel shift assayThe PG1-probe (wild-type the distal MCAT site and an A/T-rich element, sense; 5\u2032-gctgtggaatgtgaggcctggcctgggagatatttttgctgc-3\u2032 and antisense; 5\u2032-gcagcaaaaatatctcccaggccaggcctcacattccacagc-3\u2032), PG2-probe (wild-type A/T-rich element, sense; 5\u2032-ggcctgggagatatttttgctgcact-3\u2032 and antisense; 5\u2032-agtgcagcaaaaatatctcccaggcc-3\u2032), and PG3-probe (wild-type proximal MCAT, sense; 5\u2032-gcacagtccatgccataaca-3\u2032 and antisense; 5\u2032-tgttatggcatggactgtgc-3\u2032) were labeled with \u03b3-32P-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan).

DNA\u2013protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 80 min at room temperature. Anti-c-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was added for the supershift assay. The gel was dried, and labeled bands were visualized using the BAS-1000 autoradiography system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).Immunoprecipitation and Western blottingExpression vectors for FLAG-tagged TR\u03b21 (pCMX-FLAG-rTR\u03b21) and 6myc-TEAD-1 (pcDNA3-6myc-TEAD-1) were co-transfected into CV-1 cells using the calcium phosphate method. After cells had been exposed to calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5% FCS depleted of thyroid hormone [41] or medium supplemented with T3. After a 24-h incubation in the presence or absence of 1 \u00b5M T3, CV-1 cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were lysed in hypotonic buffer [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 \u00b5M EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet-P40, 3 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin] and incubated on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in a high-salt buffer [20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 \u00b5M EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 3 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin] and gently agitated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in binding buffer [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 3 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin, and leupeptin] at 4\u00b0C overnight. After four washes with hypotonic buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted using the anti-c-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. TX, USA), and analyzed by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). To confirm the expression of wild-type and mutant TRs transfected into CV1 cells, a 0\u20133 \u00b5g/6 cm diameter dish of the expression plasmids for wild-type TR\u03b21, FLAG-tagged TR\u03b21, C1, C2 and FLAG-tagged TR\u03b11 were transfected and whole-cell extracts were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against N-terminal region of TR\u03b21 (PP-H3825A-00, Perseus proteomics, Japan), FLAG (M2, Sigma) and TR\u03b11 (sc-772, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). To assess the expression level of endogenous TEAD-1, TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 in H9c2 cells, the cells in a 10-cm dish were harvested, and whole cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with the antibodies against TEAD-1 (Becton Dickinson Transduction Laboratories, NJ, USA), N-terminal region of TR\u03b21 (PP-H3825A-00) and TR\u03b11 (sc-772), respectively.GST pull-down assay\nE. coli (DH5\u03b1) that had been transformed with pGEX-4T-1-TEA (GST-TEA) or GST-DBD was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-\u03b2-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The E. coli pellet was sonicated, and fusion proteins were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for purification. Receptor proteins (TR\u03b21, C1 and C2), 6myc-TEAD-1, and TEAD-1 mutants (TEAD-1\u0394C and \u0394TEA) were translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 35S-methionine. Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins in binding buffer [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, and 2 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin] for 3 h at 4\u00b0C and washed three times with the binding buffer. The bound fraction was analyzed by 10\u201314% SDS-PAGE and visualized using a BAS-1000 autoradiography system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).RNA interferenceSix \u00b5l of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies) plus 300 \u00b5l of Opti-MEM-I was mixed with 300 \u00b5l of Opti-MEM-I containing 1.5 \u00b5l of 50 \u00b5M siRNA, Rn Tead1 5, or Rn Tead1 6 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes and then applied to a monolayer of H9c2 cells cultured in a 6-cm dish. After a 48-h culture, the cells were harvested and used for Western blotting or RT-PCR.Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)H9c2 cells cultured in 10% FCS were incubated, and total RNAs were purified by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method. One \u00b5g total RNA was mixed with random hexanucleotides and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. Using the SYBR Green I kit and a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), precipitated cDNA was quantified by real-time PCR using the following primers: forward primer (5\u2032-CGAGTCCCAGGTCAACAA-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-GGCTTCACAGGCATCCTTA-3\u2032). The cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also amplified with the forward primer (5\u2032-TGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-TCCACCACCCTGTTGGCTGTA-3\u2032). The thermal cycling conditions were 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 10 sec at 95\u00b0C for denaturing, 10 sec at 62\u00b0C for annealing, and 7 sec at 72\u00b0C for extension. PCR signals were analyzed using LightCycler software version 3.5 (Roche Diagnostics).Statistical analysisEach CAT or Renilla luciferase reporter assay was performed in duplicate three or more times, and each result was expressed as the mean \u00b1 S.D. Significance was examined by ANOVA and Fisher's protected least significant difference test using Stat View 4.0 software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered significant. ResultsTEADs stimulate the MYH7 promoter encompassing two MCAT sites and an A/T-rich element in CV-1 cellsThe structure of the human MYH7 promoter (nt \u2212293/+125) is illustrated in Figure 1A. The DNA sequences of these elements are highly conserved among species. Because the firefly luciferase-based reporter gene may be artificially suppressed by T3/TR [16], [18], [26], we employed the CAT-based reporter system. On the basis of previous reports in which endogenous TEADs in rat car_diomyocytes may recognize these MCAT sites and the A/T-rich element [28], [30], [31], we transfected the expression plasmid for TEAD-3, TEAD-1, and TEAD-4 into CV-1 cells and examined their effect on MYH7 promoter activity. As shown in Figures 1B, C, and D, these TEADs potently activated the MYH7 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. We conducted deletion analyses of the MYH7 promoter (Fig. 2A) to confirm the importance of DNA recognition by TEADs. Although deletion of distal MCAT and the A/T-rich region (Del-1) decreased the magnitude of TEAD-3-induced activity (Fig. 2B), its basal activity was also slightly lower than that of the wild-type (p\u200a=\u200a0.078), which resulted in a modest reduction in fold activation (Fig. 2C). The truncation of all MCATs and the A/T rich region (Del-2) strongly reduced TEAD-3-induced activity (Fig. 2B) as well as fold activation (Fig. 2C). We then performed mutation analysis (Fig. 2D). Although the reduction in promoter activity was modest for the distal MCAT (Mut-1) or A/T rich region (Mut-2) mutation, the mutation of both distal MCAT and the A/T rich region (Mut-3) as well as that of the proximal MCAT (Mut-4) markedly reduced MYH7 promoter activity (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained when all MCATs and the A/T rich region were mutated (Mut-5, Figs. 2D and 2E). Taken together, these results suggested that TEAD3-induced transactivation is mainly maintained by proximal MCAT and partially by distal MCAT and the A/T rich region. We performed a gel shift assay with 32P-radiolabeled oligo DNAs encompassing the distal MCAT site and an A/T-rich element (PG1), as well as the A/T-rich elements alone (PG2) (Fig. 3A). As shown in Figures 3B and 3C, binding signals were abolished or reduced by specific, but not non-specific competitors (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 8; Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 6). The finding that competition of the binding signal by the mutant competitor, M1 (Fig. 3B, lane 5), was much clearer than that by M2 (lane 6) indicated that TEAD-1 binds the A/T-rich element with higher affinity than distal MCAT. Similar results were obtained when we used proximal MCAT (PG3) as a probe (Fig. 3D, lanes 4, 5, and 6). These bands were supershifted (Fig. 3B, lane 9; Fig. 3C, lane 7) or eliminated (Fig. 3D, lane 7) by the anti-myc antibody. In Figure 3D, we found a band that was abolished by specific competitors (asterisk, lane 3). This signal was thought to be nonspecific because it was observed in the control lane (lane 2) and was not affected by the anti-myc antibody (lane 7) although we could not exclude the possibility that the in vitro translation system may contain a TEAD family transcription factor other than TEAD-1. Collectively, TEAD family transcription factors bind with the two MCAT sites and the A/T-rich element with various affinities, resulting in MYH7 promoter activation.Open in a separate windowFigure 1TEAD family transcription factors activate the human MYH7 promoter.(A) Schematics of the human MYH7 promoter region (upper panel) and structure of MYH7-CAT (middle panel).

We found that transactivation of the MYH7 promoter by TEAD-3 was inhibited by 10 nM T3 in the presence of TR\u03b21 (Fig. 4A). TEAD-1-induced transactivation was also inhibited by T3-bound TR\u03b21 (T3/TR\u03b21) (Fig. 4B). The observation that TEAD-induced activity of the MYH7 promoter was repressed by T3/TR\u03b21 in non-cardiac CV-1 cells suggests that a cardiomyocyte-specific factor other than TEADs and TR is not essential for negative regulation of the MYH7 gene. As shown in Figure 1A, a constitutive inhibitory sequence (\u03b2 negative regulatory element, \u03b2NRE) has been reported at nt \u2212332/\u2212300 [2], [31]. However, inhibition by T3/TR\u03b21 is independent of this sequence because our MYH7-CAT lacks it. As shown in the left panel of Figure 4C, when TEAD-3 was co-expressed (gray bar), MYH7 promoter activity was significantly increased by the large amount of unliganded TR\u03b21 (0.8 \u00b5g). The T3-dependent repression presented by the fold repression (right panel) was in a TR\u03b21 dose-dependent manner. As shown in the left panel, the MYH7 promoter was not activated by unliganded TR\u03b21 without TEAD-3 (open bar) at an amount sufficient for T3-dependent inhibition of the MYH7 promoter induced by TEAD-3 (gray and solid bars). Thus, unliganded TR\u03b21 per se is not the transcriptional activator for basal activity of the MYH7 promoter. The TR\u03b2-selective T3 analog, GC-1 [14], also suppressed the promoter activity induced by TEAD-3 (Fig. 4D). Taking advantage of the fact that CV-1 cells do not express endogenous TR [16], we examined whether TR\u03b11 may mediate negative regulation of the MYH7 gene by T3. Unexpectedly, not only TR\u03b21, but also TR\u03b11 mediated the repressive effect of T3 on the MYH7 promoter (Fig. 4E). The expression for both receptors was confirmed by Western blot (inset). Taken together, TR\u03b11 as well as TR\u03b21 inhibited TEAD-induced transactivation of the MYH7 promoter. Because the cardiac expression of TR\u03b11 mRNA is two- to three-fold higher than that of TR\u03b21 [7], [8], we tested whether TR\u03b11 may exhibit a dominant negative effect on the suppression induced by GC-1-bound TR\u03b21 (GC-1/TR\u03b21) [15], [42]. Although increasing amount of TR\u03b11 (0 to 0.8 \u00b5g/dish) moderately relieved the inhibition of the MYH7 promoter by GC-1/TR\u03b21, similar de-repression by TR\u03b11 was observed when this promoter was inhibited by T3/TR\u03b21 (data not shown). Thus, in this assay system, we could not conclude that TR\u03b11 has the dominant negative effect on the negative regulation by GC-1/TR\u03b21.Open in a separate windowFigure 4T3-bound TRs (T3/TRs) repress TEAD-induced activity of the MYH7 promoter.(A) and (B) T3/TR\u03b21 represses promoter activity of the MYH7 gene induced by TEAD-3 (A) or TEAD-1 (B).

Because the amino acid sequences of DBD and LBD in TR\u03b11 have high homology with those in TR\u03b21 (Fig. 5A), we speculated that, in addition to LBD, DBD may also be involved in T3-dependent repression of the MYH7 gene. We aimed to examine the function of the truncation mutants, C1 and C2 (Fig. 5A), both of which preserved the amino acid sequence required for the nuclear localization signal (NLS). The expression levels of these mutants and wild-type TR\u03b21 are shown in Figure 5B\n[26], [27]. As predicted, full-length TR\u03b21 and C1 repressed TEAD-3-induced activation of the MYH7 promoter in the presence of T3 (Fig. 5C), whereas C2 did not. Hence, DBD are required for negative regulation of the MYH7 promoter by T3.Open in a separate windowFigure 5T3-dependent repression requires DBD.(A) Schematic representations of wild-type TR\u03b21, its mutants (C1 and C2), and wild-type TR\u03b11.

The results are means \u00b1 S.D. for six independent experiments. *, P<0.05 of T3 (\u2212) vs. T3 (+).Reported nTREs are not necessary for repression of the MYH7 promoter by T3/TRThe finding that DBD are required for T3-dependent inhibition (Fig. 5) raised the possibility that direct recognition of DNA by DBD may be necessary for the negative regulation of the MYH7 promoter by T3/TR. As shown in Figure 6A, four putative nTREs in rat MYH7 genes were suggested based on sequence homology with a single half-site (consensus sequence: AGGTCA) [21]. However, their functional relevance was not experimentally assessed. Because all of the sequences corresponding to rat nTREs were included in the human MYH7 promoter sequence in MYH7-CAT (Fig. 6A), we attempted to mutate these sequences to generate MYH7-mnTRE-CAT. As shown in Fig. 6B and 6C, the mutation of all of these nTREs significantly increased the TEAD3-independent activity (open bars) via unknown mechanism. However, the repression by TR\u03b21 in the presence of 10 nM and 1 \u00b5M T3 was clearly maintained, which suggested that nTREs are not crucial for inhibition by T3/TR.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Reported nTREs are dispensable for repression of the MYH7 promoter by T3/TR.(A) Schematic representation of the rat MYH7 promoter and reported nTREs.

Based on the hypothesis that ligand-dependent inhibition can be detected only when T3/TR attenuates the activity of the DNA-binding transcription factor maintaining global transcription levels [16], we tested whether TR\u03b21 interacts with TEADs. As shown in Figure 7A, N-terminal six tandem myc-tagged mouse TEAD-1 (6myc-TEAD-1) was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged TR\u03b21 (FLAG-TR\u03b21) into CV-1 cells. We found that 6myc-TEAD-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-TR\u03b21 (Fig. 7A), and this interaction was T3-independent (Fig. 7B). As shown in Figure 7C, the large part of the N-terminal amino acid sequence, i.e., TEA domains, is highly conserved among TEADs, whereas that of the remaining C-terminal regions has lower homology [32], [33]. Given that suppression by T3/TR\u03b21 is detected in transactivation of the MYH7 promoter by TEAD-1 as well as TEAD-3 (Figs. 4A and 4B), the TEA domain is thought to be the common interface of interaction with TRs. Indeed, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the TEA domain (GST-TEA, Fig. 7C) interacted with 32S-labeled TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 (Fig. 7D), suggesting the direct binding of TEAD-1 with TRs. As demonstrated using the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 7A), the association of GST-TEA with TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 was again T3-independent (Figs. 7E and 7F). We then tested the binding of GST-TEA with the truncation mutants of TR\u03b21 (Fig. 8A). We revealed that DBD, but not the N-terminal domain of TR\u03b21, is necessary for the interaction with GST-TEA (Fig. 8B). Although both DBD and LBD have the amino acid sequences highly conserved between TR\u03b11 and TR\u03b21 (Fig. 5A), LBD failed to interact with the TEA domain (Figs. 8A and 8B). With this observation in mind, we fused TR\u03b21-DBD with GST to generate GST-DBD (Fig. 8C). As shown in Figure 8D, GST-DBD bound with TEAD-1 (left panel). Although the interaction was not affected by truncation of the C-terminal domain (middle panel), it was abolished by deletion of the TEA domain (right panel), which confirmed that the TEA domain of TEAD-1 is required for the interaction with TR\u03b21-DBD. These findings coupled with the results shown in Figure 6 indicate that TR-DBD is not used for the direct recognition of putative nTREs in negative regulation of the MYH7 gene [2], [21], but is involved in the protein-protein interaction with the TEA domain of TEAD-1, which is highly conserved among TEADs (Fig. 7C).Open in a separate windowFigure 7TRs directly interact with TEAD-1.(A) Co-immunoprecipitation of TR\u03b21 with TEAD-1.

When endogenous TEAD-1 expression was efficiently knocked down (Fig. 9A), MYH7 expression measured by RT-PCR was significantly reduced (Fig. 9B), suggesting the importance of TEAD-1 for global promoter activity of the MYH7 gene in H9c2 cells. To evaluate the possible involvement of other TEADs, we examined the effect of mutations of two MCAT sites and the A/T-rich element. Because of the low transfection efficiency of this cell line, MYH7-hRluc (Fig. 9C) was newly generated by fusing the MYH7 promoter (nt \u2212293/+125) with modified Renilla luciferase (hRluc). As shown in Figure 9D, mutating proximal MCAT (Mut-pM) eliminated MYH7 promoter activity, whereas mutating the distal MCAT site (Mut-dM) or A/T rich element (Mut-AT) modestly reduced it. The reduction in activity by these mutations (Fig. 9D) was greater than the RNA knockdown of TEAD-1 (Fig. 9B), which suggests the partial involvement of TEADs other than TEAD-1 in transactivation of the MYH7 gene in H9c2 cells. Because it was previously confirmed that the DNA sequence of the hRluc coding region did not mediate artificial negative regulation by T3 [18], we attempted to examine the effect of T3/TR on MYH7 promoter activity. Endogenous TEAD-1 protein levels were not influenced by the 1 \u00b5M T3 treatment (Fig. 9E). Expression of endogenous TRs in H9c2 cells was not detected by Western blotting (Fig. 9F) and the effect of T3 (1 \u00b5M) on the MYH7 promoter was minimal (Fig. 9G, lanes 1 and 2). Overexpression of TR\u03b21 significantly (p<0.05) reduced MYH7 promoter activity (lanes 1 and 3), which may have been because of the small amount of endogenous T3 produced by H9c2 cells [46]. Importantly, the addition of 1 \u00b5M T3 significantly suppressed transcriptional activity of the MYH7 promoter (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that, in cardiomyocytes, H9c2, T3/TR inhibits activity of the MYH7 gene, which is maintained by TEADs.Open in a separate windowFigure 9Basal expression of the MYH7 gene depends on TEADs and is inhibited by T3/TR in the rat embryonic cardiomyocytes, H9c2.(A) Western blots with antibodies against anti-TEAD-1 and \u03b2-actin show the effect of transfection of two sets of RNAi on TEAD-1 (Rn Tead1 5 or Rn Tead1 6) in H9c2.

DiscussionWe established a reconstitution system with CV1 cells to investigate the involvement of TEADs in negative regulation of the MYH7 gene by T3/TR (Figs. 1\u20134). Although the results in Figures 2 and \u200band33 suggest the importance of proximal MCAT, previous reports using endogenous TEADs [29], [30] and the results with H9c2 (Fig. 9D) indicated that distal MCAT and the A/T-rich region also play some roles in activating the MYH7 gene. In any case, our results support TEADs being a critical transcriptional activator for the MYH7 gene [1], [2], [28]\u2013[32]. Using this system, we demonstrated that T3/TR inhibits human MYH7 promoter activity induced by TEADs (Fig. 4). Although previous studies have suggested that TR\u03b21, but not TR\u03b11, may mediate negative regulation of the MYH7 gene by T3 [8], [19], our reconstitution system with CV-1 cells revealed that TEAD-dependent activation of the MYH7 promoter is also repressed by liganded TR\u03b11 (Fig. 4E), which is a major TR in cardiac tissue [4], [7], [14]. This is supported by inhibition of MYH7 expression by T3 remained in TR\u03b21-deficient mice [20]. We also demonstrated that T3-dependent repression requires TR\u03b21-DBD (Fig. 5C), the amino acid sequence of which have high homology with that of TR\u03b11 (Fig. 5A). Although we have shown here that 10 nM T3 inhibits the MYH7 gene via TRs in CV1 cells transfected with TEAD-3 (Fig. 4A), it should noted that the inhibition of this gene by T3 in vivo may be more potent than that observed in our reconstitution system [20]. In future, further study will be required.In the presence of TR\u03b21, TEAD-induced activity of the MYH7 promoter was repressed by GC-1, a TR\u03b2-selective T3 analog [14] (Fig. 4D). Importantly, TR\u03b2-selective T3 analogs are expected to have a minimal effect on heart rate [14], [47], because heart rate is mainly regulated by TR\u03b11, but not TR\u03b21 [14]. Moreover, TR\u03b2-selective T3 analogs exhibited milder oxygen consumption than that of T3 [48], and liganded TR\u03b21 was shown to play a critical role in forming capillary networks in coronary endothelial cells of the pathologically hypertrophied heart [49]. Thus, TR\u03b2-selective T3 analogs may be applicable for the treatment of heart failure by reducing MYH7 expression [1], [2], [38]. Although TR\u03b11 mRNA is expressed two- to three-fold higher than that of TR\u03b21 in the cardiac tissues [7], [8], we could not detect the dominant negative effect by TR\u03b11 on the inhibition by GC-1/TR\u03b21 (data not shown). The weak affinity of GC-1 with TR\u03b11 [10-fold lower affinity than that with TR\u03b21 [14] may relieve the dominant negative effect by TR\u03b11 that does not bind T3.In contrast to rodents, reports on cardiac MYH7 expression in human subjects with hypo- and hyperthyroidism are limited. In large vertebrates including primates or rabbits [2], [7], MYH7 represents 70 to 90% of the total myosin heavy chain protein with the remainder being MYH6, whereas MYH7 accounts for only approximately 10% of the total myosin heavy chain protein in the cardiac tissue of adult rodents [8], [21]. Therefore, it may be difficult to detect increased MYH7 expression in human subjects with hypothyroid conditions [50]. In contrast, Kawana et al. [51] reported the findings of a myocardial biopsy from a subject with hyperthyroidism. Their immunohistochemical study suggested an increase in the percentage of MYH6 during the course of thyrotoxicosis returning to normal levels following treatment. Their findings may imply that, in human, T3 increased and decreased the expression of MYH6 and MYH7, respectively. In the present study, we demonstrated that T3/TR inhibited transactivation of the human MYH7 promoter by TEADs (Fig. 4). Consistent with these findings, the administration of exogenous T3 or T4 significantly reduced MYH7 expression in large animals, including the baboon [1], [52], rabbit [53], and calf [1]. In contrast, the contents of cardiac myosin isoforms were not altered in a case of sudden death of a female subject with hyperthyroidism [54]. Nevertheless, autopsy studies have indicated the existence of chronic congestive heart failure with endocardial fibrosis. Because both pressure overload [4] and cardiac fibrosis [55] are known to increase MYH7 expression, the repressive effect by T3 might be masked in this case.Although we cannot exclude the involvement of the far upstream DNA sequence in the MYH7 gene (Fig. 1A), the results in Figure 4 clearly indicate that the DNA sequence, nt \u2212293/+125, functions to mediate T3-dependent inhibition in CV-1 cells as long as TR and TEADs are co-expressed. Regarding negative regulation of the TSH\u03b2 gene by T3, we previously proposed the tethering model in which TR interferes with the transactivating function of GATA2 in a T3-dependent manner [16], [27]. The following findings of T3-induced negative regulation of the MYH7 gene are reminiscent of that in the TSH\u03b2 gene, although the activator for the MYH7 gene (i.e., TEADs) is distinct from that of the TSH\u03b2 gene (i.e., GATA2). First, T3-induced inhibition of the MYH7 promoter is readily detected even in CV-1 cells co-expressed with TR and TEADs (Fig. 4), which suggests that negative regulation of this gene may not require tissue-specific factors other than TRs and TEADs. Second, although the intact DBD of TR is required for the inhibition of TEAD-induced activation by T3/TR (Fig. 5), single half site-like sequences reported as putative nTREs [2], [21] are dispensable for MYH7 gene inhibition by T3 (Fig. 6). In this regard, the function of so-called nTREs [16] proposed based on sequence similarity with the half site should be tested [45]. Moreover, the hypothesis that these nTREs play a role in MYH7 gene repression by a microRNA, miR208a [56], should be reconsidered. Third, although MYH7 expression was shown to be increased with hypothyroidism [6], [7], [20], unliganded TR per se is not a transcriptional activator (Fig. 4C). Indeed, the results shown in Figures 1, \u200b,2,2, and \u200band99 and the findings of previous studies [1], [2], [28]\u2013[32] clearly suggest that TEADs are the main transcriptional activators for the MYH7 gene. The results in Figure 4 indicate that TEAD-induced transcriptional activation of the MYH7 promoter (nt \u2212293/+125) is required to detect negative regulation by T3/TR. Finally, we found that TR-DBD directly interacts with the TEA domain (Fig. 8), which is highly conserved among TEADs (Fig. 7). Although the central domain of TR (C-domain) has been designated as DBD because it directly recognizes DNA sequences of TREs in positive regulation [11], it also functions as the interface for an association with DNA-binding transcription factors via a protein-protein interaction [16], [27], [43]\u2013[45]. The abovementioned results (Figs. 7 and \u200band8)8) coupled with the finding that nTREs were dispensable for T3-dependent inhibition (Fig. 6) suggest that TR-DBD is not used for the direct recognition of nTRE, but for a protein-protein interaction with the TEA domain of TEADs (Fig. 7C). This interaction may also account for the observation that unliganded TR\u03b21 functions as a weak co-activator for TEAD-3 (Fig. 4C, gray bar in the left panel). Taken together, we propose that the negative regulation of MYH7 is mediated via a tethering mechanism in which liganded TR attenuates the transactivation function of TEADs via a protein-protein interaction (Fig. 10) as in the case of GATA2 in negative regulation of the TSH\u03b2 gene [16], [27].Open in a separate windowFigure 10Tethering model of T3-dependent negative regulation of the MYH7 gene.T3/TR interferes with the transactivation function of TEADs. In this model, putative nTREs are not necessary for inhibition by T3/TR. TR-DBD is used for the protein-protein interaction with the TEA domain of TEADs, but not for direct recognition of the DNA sequence.In addition to our tethering model (Fig. 10) or nTRE hypothesis [2], [21], three other possibilities exist for negative regulation of the MYH7 gene by T3/TR. First, MYH7 expression may be upregulated by the microRNA, miRNA-27a, via inhibition of TR\u03b21 expression [19]. This stems from the hypothesis that TR\u03b21, but not TR\u03b11, may mediate negative regulation of the MYH7 gene [4]. However, this is not the case (Fig. 4E) [20]. Second, because the sequence similar to the GATA-responsive element exists in the A/T-rich region [57], GATA-induced activation may mediate inhibition by T3/TR, as is the case of the TSH\u03b2 gene [16], [27]. Nevertheless, an in vitro study revealed that GATA family transcription factors did not directly bind with this region [57] and that GATA4 alone did not activate the MYH7 promoter [58]. Finally, antisense RNA against MYH7 heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) may be increased by T3/TR via positive TREs of the MYH6 promoter, which is located 4.0 kb downstream of the MYH7 gene in rat chromosome 15 [59], [60]. However, this hypothesis does not account for the following observations. i) Negative regulation by T3/TR is clearly observed in the reporter genes fused to the MYH7 promoter (Fig. 4) [15], [21], [61]. Because these reporter constructs lacked the sequence corresponding to MYH7 hnRNA, its transcriptional repression by T3 should be independent of antisense RNA against MYH7 hnRNA. ii) An inverse relationship between MYH7 and MYH6 mRNA levels has not been observed in mice deficient for TRs [20].Given that T3-dependent negative regulation of the MYH7 gene is mediated by interactions between TRs and TEADs (Fig. 10), what is the final target of T3 signaling? Recent analyses with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have suggested that histone modification is involved in negative regulation of the MYH7 promoter [62], [63]. One plausible explanation is that T3-induced transcriptional repression may be mediated by NCoR or SMRT associated with histone deacetylases {[16] and references therein}. However, T3-dependent inhibition of the MYH7 gene was maintained in knock-in mice with the NCoR mutant, which does not interact with unliganded TR {[22] and references therein}. Likewise, no histological abnormalities except for the lung were reported in knock-in mice with the SMRT mutant, which does not associate with unliganded TR [64]. Of note, nucleosome densities at the transcriptionally active promoters are often low [65]. This may imply that there are relatively few histones around the transcription start site of the MYH7 gene (Fig. 10) immediately before inhibition by T3. From this point of view, T3-induced transition from transcriptional activation to repression may be controlled by a mechanism other than histone modification. Mediator complex is known to directly bind with RNA polymerase II and regulate its enzymatic activity positively or negatively [17]. MED1, a constituent of Mediator complex, not only interacts with T3/TR via its LXXLL motifs, but also functions as a co-activator for GATA2 [27]. Based on this finding, we previously suggested that MED1 may play a role in negative regulation of the TSH\u03b2 gene by T3 [16], [27]. Interestingly, MED1 may also play a role in transcriptional regulation of the MYH7 gene because MYH7 expression was increased in mice in which the MED1 gene was deleted specifically in the cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle [66]. However, further studies are necessary because TSH\u03b2 expression decreased, rather than increased in mice heterozygous for the MED1 gene {[16] and reference therein}.Microarray analyses have indicated that approximately 40% of cardiac genes are repressed by T3 [67], [68]. For example, T3 was shown to inhibit the expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor [69] and that of phospholamban, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a protein [7]. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor is a key component of the pathogenesis of heart failure, and gene inactivation of phospholamban has been shown to enhance basal cardiac contractility. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of T3/TR-induced negative regulation of the MYH7 gene, the expression of which is a molecular marker for heart failure [1], [2], [38]. Interestingly, both TEAD-3 and GATA2 are targets of the protein kinase C pathway from membrane receptors. The \u03b11-adrenaline pathway has been shown to stimulate MYH7 expression [2], [32], [37] presumably via TEAD-3 [70], while the signal from thyrotropin-releasing hormone potentiates GATA2 transcriptional activity [16], [71]. Therefore, MCAT sites and the A/T-rich element in the MYH7 gene (Fig. 10) and GATA-responsive elements in the TSH\u03b2 gene appear to be points of convergence for both activating and repressing signals. Given that ligand-dependent inhibition is detectable only when liganded NHR attenuates transactivation by the transcription factor essential for overall transcription, identification of such an activator may provide a clue to explore the mechanism of ligand-dependent negative regulation [16], [18], [26].
