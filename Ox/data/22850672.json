Regulation of RNAPII transcription is\ncrucial for cell growth and differentiation and is achieved by the concerted activities of a\nlarge number of proteins. As RNAPII is unable to recognize a promoter, promoter-specific\ninitiation by RNAPII requires a set of conserved general transcription factors (GTFs),\nTFIIB, TFIID, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC) at a promoter\n(Hahn, 2004). RNAPII was originally isolated as a\nmultisubunit enzyme from mammalian cells (Roeder et al,\n1976) but rigorous definition of its subunit composition (Rpb1\u2013Rpb12) was\nfacilitated by purification and characterization of its yeast counterpart (Young, 1991). The atomic coordinates of RNAPII were obtained by X-ray\ndiffraction analysis of three-dimensional (3D) crystals grown from highly purified yeast\nprotein (Cramer et al, 2001; Gnatt\net al, 2001). The structure of RNAPII can be delineated as an assembly\nof distinct modules. A core module containing the active centre accounts for approximately\nhalf of the total mass of the enzyme (\u223c500\u2009kDa), and three additional modules\nsurrounding the DNA-binding cleft are mobile: the jaw-lobe (Rpb1\u2013Rpb2), shelf (Rpb5),\nand clamp (Rpb1). X-ray structures of RNAPII\u2013TFIIB (Kostrewa et\nal, 2009; Liu et al, 2010) along with\nthat of the TFIIB\u2013TBP\u2013TATA-element ternary complex (Nikolov\net al, 1995) allow for the development of a model for the PIC. As large\nnumbers of protein contacts are involved in PIC, its formation stands as a key point of\nregulation (Fuda et al, 2009).Beyond PIC formation, an additional layer of regulation at the promoter requires\nco-activators for cell viability. Co-activator proteins convey signals from DNA-binding\nactivators or repressors to RNAPII, allowing for up or down-regulation of gene expression.\nAmong the co-activators, of critical importance is Mediator\u2014an essential and conserved\nprotein complex of \u223c30 polypeptides that supports gene activation by\n\u2018mediating' between the activator and the PIC (Conaway et\nal, 2005; Kornberg, 2005; Malik and Roeder, 2005, 2010). Remarkably, an\nin-vitro transcription assay containing purified mammalian proteins including GTFs,\ngeneral co-activator PC4, and 12-subunit RNAPII, displayed an unregulated and unfettered\nhigh degree of transcription in the presence of DNA-binding activators with or without\nMediator (Hu et al, 2006). As such, it appeared that\ntranscription factor activation of RNAPII was not dependent upon Mediator in contrast to\nMediator's established role as an essential transcriptional co-activator (Belakavadi and Fondell, 2006; Casamassimi and Napoli,\n2007; Cai et al, 2009). This apparent\ndiscrepancy was resolved by the disclosure of a novel RNAPII isoform, RNAPII(G), containing\nthe RNAPII-associated polypeptide, Gdown1 of 43\u2009kDa, which suppresses activated\ntranscription but is relieved only in the presence of Mediator (Hu et\nal, 2006). Essentially, Gdown1 confers Mediator responsiveness upon\nRNAPII. Gdown1 is one of the many products of the GRINL1A complex transcription unit\n(Roginski et al, 2004) and is a novel RNAPII subunit\n(POLR2M) as it is resistant to dissociation from RNAPII by high salt and urea, and is found\nas a percent of native enzyme (Hu et al, 2006).Considering the fundamental role of transcription, and the large number of interacting\ntranscription proteins needed for effective transcription, it is important to derive a\nrudimentary understanding as to how Gdown1 could crosstalk with the transcription machinery.\nHere, by employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) followed by single-particle analysis,\nwe obtained the 3D structure of RNAPII(G) in an unstained state to \u223c19\u2009\u00c5\nand revealed the binding sites of Gdown1 on RNAPII. In addition, we obtained the 3D cryo-EM\nmap of mammalian RNAPII\u2013TFIIF and uncovered the densities of TFIIF on RNAPII and found\nTFIIF shared several sites with those of Gdown1. As such, the notion Gdown1 and TFIIF would\nexclude each other was suggested and confirmed by a gel-filtration competition assay. Our\nfindings thus confer a steric mechanism underlying Gdown1 inhibits TFIIF function (Cheng et al, 2012; Jishage et al,\n2012). Finally, the involvement of Mediator negating Gdown1 to restore\ntranscription initiation is discussed. ResultsBiochemical characterization of bovine RNAPII and RNAPII(G)After receiving the native bovine RNAPII and RNAPII(G) in ammonium-sulphate precipitant,\nthe proteins were thawed and exchanged into physiological buffer conditions. At that\nstage, the RNAPII and RNAPII(G) enzymes were examined for their subunit composition on a\nSDS\u2013PAGE stained by Coomassie Blue. As shown in Figure 1A, the\nGdown1 in the native RNAPII(G) appears to be approximately stoichiometric when compared\nwith the two largest RNAPII subunits, with the ratio Rpb1: Rpb2: Gdown1\u223c0.81: 1: 0.74.\nBoth forms of polymerase were tested for their activity in a nonspecific transcription\nelongation assay with tailed DNA template without the requirement of general transcription\ninitiation factors. RNAPII and RNAPII(G) were active in generating early arrested RNA\ntranscripts of 13\u201316 bases length and additional readthrough products of various\nlengths. Quantitation of early arrest or readthrough transcripts indicated a 1.5- to\n2.5-fold increase in the amount of transcripts by RNAPII(G) compared with those of RNAPII\n(Figure 1B). This increase in activity of RNAPII(G) compared with\nRNAPII was also observed by others (Cheng et al, 2012;\nJishage et al, 2012). We further analysed\nGdown1's propensity as a disordered protein by rendering its sequence to folding\nanalysis (Prilusky et al, 2005). Interestingly, the\nmajor folded region of Gdown1 appears to be in the N-terminal half, ranging from amino\nacid 55\u2013113 (Figure 1C). To validate such prediction,\nrecombinant Gdown1 proteins were subjected to limited trypsin proteolysis followed by mass\nspectroscopy. As anticipated, the cleavage mainly took place in the C-terminal region\n(Figure 1D).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Biochemical and bioinformatics characterization of RNAPII(G). (A) Purification\nof native RNAPII and RNAPII(G). Both forms of calf thymus RNAPII are presented in the\nSDS\u2013PAGE Coomassie stained gel, with Gdown1 and the RNAPII subunits Rpb1, Rpb2,\nand Rpb3 labelled. By dividing the integrated intensity over the respective molecular\nweight, the relative amounts of Rpb1, Rpb2, and Gdown1 in RNAPII(G) were determined to\nbe 0.81: 1: 0.74. (B) Nonspecific transcription elongation assays. 0.4 and\n0.8\u2009\u03bcg of RNAPII (lanes 1\u20132) and RNAPII(G) (lanes 4\u20135) were used\nfor the assays as previously described (Gnatt et al,\n1997). RNA fragments from the early arrest or read-through are marked. As a\ncontrol, \u03b1-amanitin, an RNAPII inhibitor, was added to RNAPII (lane 3) and\nRNAPII(G) (lane 6), respectively. All six lanes were from the same blot and only\nirrelevant lanes have been removed for the figure. Lanes 1 and 2 correspond to lanes 1\nand 2 in the source gel; lane 3 corresponds to lane 4 in the source gel and lanes\n4\u20136 correspond to lanes 6\u20138 in the source gel. The source data has been\nuploaded for full information. (C) Folding analysis of Gdown1. Program FoldIndex\nwas used to evaluate the folding propensity of Gdown1.

Single letter amino acid codes in the predicted folded region\nare denoted in green in contrast to the red colour for those in the predicted unfolded\nregion.

Figure source\ndata can be found with the Supplementary\ndata.Single-particle analysis of native bovine RNAPII and RNAPII(G) complexes in\nnegative stainRNAPII and RNAPII(G) display different behaviour in solution. As shown in an EM image\n(Figure 2A), RNAPII(G) predominantly formed monomers. By contrast,\nRNAPII mainly formed dimers (Figure 2D). Images of RNAPII dimeric\nparticles or RNAPII(G) monomeric particles were aligned using the SPIDER (Frank et al, 1996) and clustered with XMIPP (Sorzano et al, 2004). 7689 RNAPII(G) particle images\nconferred a set of class averages resembling the 2D projections of yeast RNAPII X-ray\nstructure (Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure 1A). By the common-line method (Penczek\net al, 1996), those class averages were used to generate an initial\nmodel, which was used to guide the angular reconstruction (Penczek\net al, 1994) of RNAPII(G) to obtain a volume with\n\u223c30\u2009\u00c5 resolution (Supplementary\nFigure 1B). As the EM structure of RNAPII(G) was superimposed with the 12-subunit\nyeast RNAPII (Armache et al, 2005; PDB: 1WCM) (Figure 2C), good agreement was found, while Gdown1 density was virtually\nundetected. As to RNAPII dimers, alignment and clustering of selected dimeric particle\nimages resulted in very few numbers of different classes, indicating the dimmers had\npreferred orientations. A class average of the dimer images (Figure\n2E) carried the feature of yeast RNAPII dimers previously identified in 2D\ncrystal (Darst et al, 1991; Asturias\net al, 1998). To investigate the interface for dimerization of\nRNAPII, a dimer model was built from the 3D reconstruction of a negative-stained RNAPII(G)\nto suit the 2D dimer class average, by which the Rpb3 or Rpb4 subunit is suggested to\nparticipate in the dimer contact (Figure 2F). That Gdown1 can break\nthe dimer formation suggests its binding sites on RNAPII include those interfacial areas.\nInterestingly, antibody against the Rpb3 subunit could induce a large fraction of RNAPII\n(\u223c70%) to form monomers (Supplementary\nFigure 1C). As suggested by our low-resolution negative-stain EM study together\nwith the folding analysis, Gdown1 may dwell on RNAPII in an extended form, leading us to\npursue a higher quality and more detailed structure by cryo-EM. Furthermore, though native\nRNAPII and RNAPII(G) appear relatively stoichiometric, we were unable to achieve a\ncomplete separation of native RNAPII(G) so that some amounts, though very minimal, of\n12-subunit RNAPII certainly contaminate our RNAPII(G) preparation. Therefore, for the\ncryo-EM study, we generated RNAPII(G) particles by reconstituting RNAPII with a three- to\nfour-fold excess of recombinant Gdown1 (Hu et al,\n2006).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Image analyses of native bovine RNAPII complexes.

Therefore, a\ncryo-EM structure of bovine RNAPII (12-subunit) reconstructed from its monomer projections\nwas pursued. However, the dimeric form of RNAPII as opposed to the monomeric form of\nRNAPII(G) was not suited for a direct comparison. In an attempt to generate monomers from\nthe bovine RNAPII dimer, the screening of salt conditions was exhausted but none of them\nsucceeded to dissociate the 12-subunit RNAPII dimers into monomers. Interestingly, as\nRNAPII was supplemented with a nucleic acid scaffold (Kettenberger\net al, 2004; Chen et al, 2009)\n(Supplementary Figure 2A), RNAPII\npredominantly formed monomeric particles in cryo images (Supplementary Figure 2B). The 12-subunit bovine RNAPII\nreconstituted with dsDNA/RNA is herein designated as the RNAPII elongation complex. We\nfirst generated a cryo-stained structure of bovine RNAPII elongation complex (Supplementary Figure 2C) by the angular\nreconstruction method using the negative-stained EM volume of RNAPII(G) as an initial\nmodel (Figure 2C). The cryo-stained structure of bovine RNAPII was\nconsistent with that of the human RNAPII EM structure (EMD-1284) (Kostek et al, 2006) obtained by a similar approach (Supplementary Figure 2D). The cryo-stain reconstruction\nwas employed to guide the angular parameters of \u223c20\u2009000 unstained cryo-EM\nimages of bovine RNAPII elongation complex to a resolution \u223c19\u2009\u00c5 (Figure 3). As the resultant cryo-EM map of bovine RNAPII elongation\ncomplex was properly contoured according to the molecular mass of RNAPII, it gave no\nsporadic densities on the surface that did not belong to RNAPII but agreed nicely with\nthat of the X-ray structure of the yeast RNAPII elongation complex filtered to the same\nresolution (Kettenberger et al, 2004; PDB: 1Y1W)\n(Figure 3). Since we did not inject any X-ray model of RNAPII for\nreconstructing the RNAPII cryo-EM images, the remarkable match between the cryo-EM maps of\nRNAPII with the X-ray structure strongly indicated that our reconstruction algorithm was\nreliable and could be applied to other RNAPII complexes in this study.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Cryo-EM reconstruction of the reconstituted bovine 12-subunit RNAPII elongation\ncomplex. Three views of the cryo-EM reconstruction of bovine RNAPII elongation complex\nat \u223c19\u2009\u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.15). Superimposed with the EM envelop is the\nX-ray structure of yeast 12-subunit RNAPII (coloured ribbons) (PDB: 1Y1W). The threshold\nfor rendering the EM reconstruction is chosen based on a molecular weight of\n\u223c520\u2009kDa.Cryo-EM of the 13 subunit bovine RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation complexTo assure a complete stoichiometric presence of Gdown1 in the reconstituted RNAPII(G)\nsamples, we added four-fold recombinant human Gdown1 (rGdown1) to the 12-subunit bovine\nRNAPII to form the RNAPII\u2013rGdown1 complex. RNAPII\u2013rGdown1 was previously\ndetermined to be functionally equivalent to native bovine RNAPII(G) (Hu\net al, 2006). The ratio of four for reconstitution was determined by\ntitration of rGdown1 to RNAPII followed by negative-stain EM observation to assess the\nminimal amount of rGdown1 required to turn the majority of RNAPII dimmers into monomeric\nparticles (Supplementary Figure 3B). Such\nratio of Gdown1 to RNAPII was found to completely inhibit promoter-specific transcription\n(Jishage et al, 2012). The RNAPII\u2013rGdown1\ncomplex is herein termed RNAPII\u2013Gdown1. In addition, the RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex\nwas reconstituted with dsDNA/RNA to form the RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation complex, whose\nreconstruction would be used to compare with that of RNAPII elongation complex. The 3D\ncryo-EM reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 (Supplementary Figure 3C) and RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation (Figure 4A) were both obtained to a resolution of 19\u2009\u00c5 (Supplementary Figure 3E) from\n\u223c25\u2009000 unstained particle images respectively via the same route as for the\nRNAPII elongation complex. By subtracting the cryo-EM volume of RNAPII elongation complex\nfrom that of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation complex, a positive difference map was\nobtained and scored based on thresholding in units of standard deviation (\u03c3). Those\ndensities above 5\u03c3 spread on RNAPII extensively with the majority found in the\nvicinity of the DNA cleft (Figure 4B); they were estimated to\naccount for a mass of \u223c40\u2009kDa, fairly close to that of Gdown1. We divide those\non the top of RNAPII into \u2018a' through \u2018e' according to where they\ndwell (Figure 4B). Remarkably, in region a, a bulky domain with mass\nof \u223c6\u2009kDa above 10\u03c3 appeared on the Rpb5 shelf and connected to the Rpb1\njaw. We named this domain Gdown1-a. To verify the localization of Gdown1 on RNAPII,\nantibody labelling experiments were performed. By negative-stain EM, a polyclonal antibody\nagainst Gdown1 was located near the Rpb1 jaw where the Gdown1-a is (left panel in Figure 4D). To further locate the terminal regions of Gdown1, a\nglutathione S-transferase (GST) was fused to the N-terminus of Gdown1 and a monoclonal\nantibody against GST was found also near the Rpb1 jaw (right panel in Figure 4D). Since our structural results indicated Gdown1 direct contacted the\nRpb5 subunit of RNAPII, we tested if Gdown1 and Rpb5 would bind to each other with an\nin vitro pull-down assay. Indeed, recombinant Gdown1 and Rpb5 co-purified through\ntwo distinct affinity steps, supporting the notion that Gdown1 and Rpb5 would physically\nassociate (Supplementary Figure 3F).Open in a separate windowFigure 4Cryo-EM reconstruction of reconstituted bovine RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 and antibody\nlabelling experiments.

The threshold for rendering\nRNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation is chosen based on a molecular weight of\n\u223c560\u2009kDa. (B) A positive difference map was calculated between the\nbovine RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation and bovine RNAPII elongation complex (grey mesh)\nby using volumes that were both filtered to 15\u2009\u00c5, and shown in yellow hue\nabove 5 \u03c3. The most conspicuous density above 10 \u03c3 is in the gap between the\nRpb5 shelf and the Rpb1 jaw is shown in deep green. (C) A negative difference map\nwas calculated between the bovine RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation and bovine RNAPII\nelongation complex and shown in pink hue. The additional densities attributed to the\nRNAPII elongation complex are likely to be the result of conformational changes (outer\ndensities).

The left panel shows a similar analysis employing a\nmonoclonal antibody recognizing GST, fused to the N-terminus of Gdown1. Antibody\ndensities are encircled in the top rows, and their location denoted with arrows in the\nlower 3D models.Cryo-EM of bovine RNAPII\u2013TFIIF elongation complexThe structure of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 established herein has immediate functional\nimplications. If common sites of association with RNAPII exist for other transcription\nfactors, Gdown1 may poise a challenge for them to access RNAPII because Gdown1 binds to\nRNAPII so tightly as it does not dissociate either in high salt or in urea (Hu et al, 2006), in contrast to other transcription factors\nthat readily dissociate from RNAPII in the presence of high salt (Cheng\nand Price, 2009).Based on the reasons to be described, TFIIF was thought to be susceptible. In higher\neukaryotes, TFIIF is composed of a large and a small subunit, RAP74 and RAP30, and their\nyeast homologues are dubbed Tfg1 and Tfg2 respectively. Yeast also contains a third TFIIF\nsubunit Tfg3 not present in other eukaryotes (Henry et al,\n1994; Kimura and Ishihama, 2004). In the previous\ncryo-EM study using the yeast proteins (Chung et al,\n2003), the Tfg2 subunit was assigned in the DNA-binding cleft, mainly inferred\nfrom the crystal structures of bacteria RNAP holoenzyme (Murakami et\nal, 2002; Vassylyev et al, 2002),\nwhile the Tfg1 subunit was interpreted to reside largely alongside or on the RNAPII stalk,\nformed by subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7.However, an alternative approach utilizing cleaving reagents mapped the residues of Tfg1\nin the Tfg1/Tfg2 dimerization domain on the lobe/protrusion region of Rpb2 (Chen et al, 2007; Eichner et al,\n2010). Recently, high-resolution cross-linking followed by mass spectroscopy\nallowed for positioning of almost all TFIIF residues on RNAPII (Chen\net al, 2010), in which an extended track of Tfg1 was found on Rpb2,\nfrom the Rpb1 jaw-Rpb5 shelf to the Rpb2 lobe/protrusion. Providing that the interactions\nbetween RNAPII and TFIIF are largely conserved between yeast and mammals, RAP74\u2014the\nmammalian homologue of Tfg1 would associate with mammalian RNAPII in a similar region.To resolve the controversies as to the location of TFIIF on RNAPII, we re-investigated\nthe cryo-EM structure of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF but in the context of mammalian proteins by\nreconstituting bovine RNAPII with recombinant human TFIIF. The updated RNAPII\u2013TFIIF\ncryo-EM map has direct relevance to mammals and would eliminate any imprecise inference\nfrom the yeast.As the addition of recombinant TFIIF to bovine RNAPII did not turn the dimeric RNAPII\ninto the monomeric form as effectively as Gdown1, we supplemented the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF\nwith nucleic acid scaffold, which is herein termed RNAPII\u2013TFIIF elongation complex.\nThe cryo-EM structure of the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF elongation complex was reconstructed to a\nresolution of 19\u2009\u00c5 (Supplementary\nFigure 4D) from \u223c25\u2009000 monomeric particle images (Supplementary Figure 4B) using the similar approach for\nRNAPII(G). The 3D cryo-EM envelop of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF elongation (Figure\n5A) also matches well with that of the bovine RNAPII elongation cryo-EM\nstructure. However, by subtracting RNAPII from RNAPII\u2013TFIIF, densities attributed to\nTFIIF were revealed. Those scored above 5\u03c3 mainly appeared around the DNA cleft but\nnot in the cleft and were distributed in regions labelled \u2018a' through\n\u2018e', used for describing Gdown1 (Figure 5B). Regions\n\u2018a' to \u2018c' accord with the localization of TFIIF on RNAPII by\ncross-linking experiments (Chen et al, 2010); for\nexample, \u2018a' on the Rpb1 jaw domain corresponds to the charged domain of Tfg1\n(RAP74), \u2018b' around the Rpb2 lobe area encircles the dimerization domain of\nTfg1\u2013Tfg2 (RAP74\u2013RAP30) together with the N-terminus of Tfg1 (RAP74), and\n\u2018c' next to the Rpb2 protrusion corresponds to the linker of Tfg2 (RAP30). To\nfurther confirm the localization of RAP74 independently by EM, the same GST strategy was\nemployed. The GST protein fused to the N terminus of RAP74 was detected on the Rpb2 side\nof RNAPII, near the jaw or lobe (Figure 5D), agreeing nicely with\nthe finding by cross-linking (Chen et al, 2010).\nImportantly, as soon as the positive difference ascribed to TFIIF is overlaid with that of\nGdown1 (Figure 5E), it is evident that most of Gdown1's sites\nclash with TFIIF. The conflict occurs on the jaw/shelf (region a in Figure\n5E), where Gdown1-a meets with the charged region of RAP74 (Chen et al, 2010) and also likely with part of RAP30 (Wei et al, 2001; Le et al,\n2005); near the lobe/protrusion (regions b and c), where Gdown1 clashes with\nthe N-terminus of RAP74 and the RAP74\u2013RAP30 dimerization domain (Chen et al, 2010); and on the clamp (region e), where Gdown1 can run\ninto RAP30, according to the X-ray study of yeast RNAPII-Tfg2 (Kornberg, 2007). Such findings strongly suggest that Gdown1 and TFIIF would\nmutually exclude each other from accessing RNAPII.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Cryo-EM reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF.

(E)\nCommon, overlapping regions attributed to both Gdown1 in Figure 4B\n(green) and regions attributed to TFIIF in Figure 5B (blue) are\nshown in yellow.Gdown1 blocks the interaction between RNAPII and TFIIFTo confirm that Gdown1 impedes TFIIF association with RNAPII, competition assays using\nsize exclusion chromatography, namely gel filtration, were employed. To assess the\nmigration behaviour of RNAPII, RNAP\u2013TFIIF and TFIIF on a gel-filtration column,\nexcess amount of recombinant human TFIIF (16\u2009\u03bcg) were incubated with bovine\nRNAPII (10\u2009\u03bcg, RNAPII to TFIIF ratio 1:8) and subjected to fractionation. As\nshown in Figure 6A, the silver-stained SDS\u2013PAGE gel reveals\nthe four largest subunits of RNAPII (Rpb1\u2013Rpb3, Rpb5) and two subunits of TFIIF\n(RAP74 and RAP30), allowing for assignment of the molecular constituent in each fraction.\nFollowing these bands as markers, it appeared that RNAPII spread across many fractions\n(fractions 19\u201329). Nevertheless, RNAPII peaked in earlier fractions (fractions\n20\u201322) together with the seemingly stoichiometric TFIIF co-migrating, indicating\nthat the constituent was the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex. The excess amount of free TFIIF\n(fractions 24\u201335) was partially resolved from the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex\n(fractions 20\u201322) and ran slightly behind as anticipated. Likewise, an excess of\nGdown1 (4\u2009\u03bcg) was added to RNAPII (10\u2009\u03bcg, RNAPII to Gdown1 ratio 1:4)\nto form the RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex, resulting in a similar gel-filtration pattern;\nthe RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex appeared earlier (fractions 20\u201323) and the free\nGdown1 followed (fractions 26\u201328) (Figure 6B). Interestingly,\nas Gdown1 was added to the pre-formed RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex, the TFIIF bands used to\nco-migrate with RNAPII in those earlier fractions (fractions 20\u201322) were retarded to\nthe major positions of free TFIIF (after fraction 24) (Figure 6C).\nThe replacement of TFIIF by Gdown1 in those earlier fractions indicates that Gdown1\ndisplaces TFIIF from RNAPII, in keeping with the proposed steric exclusion mechanism. On\nthe contrary, in the reverse experiment, the excess TFIIF (16\u2009\u03bcg) employed to\nchallenge the pre-formed RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 failed to displace Gdown1 bound to RNAPII\n(Figure 6D).Open in a separate windowFigure 6Competition assay using fractionation on a size exclusion column (Superose 6).\n(A) Major fractions of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex (18\u201322) and major\nfractions of excess amount of free TFIIF (24\u201335) are visualized on SDS\u2013PAGE\nwith silver staining. To form RNAPII\u2013TFIIF, eight-fold TFIIF was used. (B)\nFractions of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex (20\u201323) and major fractions of free\nGdown1 (26\u201328). To form RNAPII\u2013Gdown1, four-fold Gdown1 was used (C)\nThe RNAII\u2013TFIIF complex challenged by Gdown1. The RNAPII-associated TFIIF\n(18\u201322) now disengages and becomes mostly free (24\u201335). RNAPII bound TFIIF\nare replaced by Gdown1 (19\u201322). (D) The RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex\nchallenged by TFIIF. Gdown1 remains mostly associated with RNAPII (21\u201324) and\nTFIIF remains free (25\u201335). Marked bands are major RNAPII subunits: Rpb1\n(220\u2009kDa), Rpb2 (133\u2009kDa), Rpb3 (31\u2009kDa), Rpb5 (25\u2009kDa),\nTFIIF subunits: RAP74 (74\u2009kDa), RAP30 (28\u2009kDa), and rGdown1. In the gel, M\nstands for marker and L for load. The stained gel strip on the left of each panel\nrepresents \u223c2.5% of the column load. DiscussionIn this study, the single-particle cryo-EM technique was used to visualize the 3D structure\nof mammalian RNAPII and its isoform RNAPII(G) in the unstained state. Importantly, the\nGdown1 domain \u2018a' of \u223c6\u2009kDa was found situated on the Rpb5 shelf and\nconnected to the adjacent Rpb1 jaw. It is noted that the interactions between Gdown1 and\nRNAPII in this region was recently reported by using cross-linking method (Jishage et al, 2012). Our observation of Gdown1 on RNAPII\nsupports the idea that it is largely flexible or disordered because otherwise a bulky volume\nas large as the stalk of Rpb4\u2013Rpb7 (45\u2009kDa) would have been detected. Although\nat the current resolution, it is difficult to define the domain organization or orientation\nof Gdown1 on RNAPII, some questions along this line can be addressed: for instance, what\nwould be the primary sequence that corresponds to Gdown1-a domain that seems to have a good\ntertiary structure? This sequence has to meet two criteria: (1) domain criterion; it forms a\nfold that resists proteolysis; (2) proximity criterion; it is close to the N-terminus\nbecause Gdown1-a is near the antibody recognizing the GST fused to the N-terminus\n(<40\u2009\u00c5 including the GST dimensions); note that this condition would not be\nvalid if Gdown1 were largely folded. As such, the best candidate would be the folding\nsegment in the N-terminal half of Gdown1 (green island in Figure 1C).\nStrikingly, the total mass (\u223c6.5\u2009kDa) of those 59 amino acids virtually coincide\nwith that of Gdown1-a. Of course, it awaits confirmation, perhaps best by high-resolution\ncross-linking experiments. Another question is which part of Gdown1 that causes RNAPII to\nform monomer? Our modelling analysis (Figure 2F) suggests that the\nRpb3 subunit of RNAPII is situated at the dimer interface. In fact, Rpb3 was reported to\ncross-link with Gdown1 as well (Jishage et al, 2012).\nIndeed, a positive density ascribed to Gdown1 was detected on Rpb3 (Supplementary Figure 3D), and we reason that it\ncorresponds to the sequence (277\u2013358), which shows similarity to the C-terminal region\nof RAP30 (Jishage et al, 2012), whose yeast homologue\nregion cross-links to Rpb3 (Chen et al, 2010).Furthermore, we updated the cryo-EM structure of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF using the mammalian\nproteins. The densities ascribed to TFIIF tether on RNAPII in the vicinity of DNA cleft in a\nmassive manner and RAP74 is located on the Rpb2 side, not alongside the stalk of\nRpb4\u2013Rpb7 (Chung et al, 2003). Such assignment is\nentirely consistent with the results obtained by the cross-linking studies using homologous\nyeast proteins (Chen et al, 2010). As the densities of\nGdown1 and those of TFIIF were overlaid, overlap of densities occurs on the regions of\nRNAPII as aforementioned. The comparison of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF with RNAPII\u2013Gdown1\nrevealed that TFIIF shared with Gdown1 not only a number of common sites but also similar\nflexible character.That Gdown1 could exclude TFIIF was confirmed by gel filtration herein. Such exclusion has\na profound impact on any process involving the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF machinery. During\ntranscription initiation, TFIIF is needed for the formation of the PIC complex to facilitate\nRNAPII initiation at a promoter. As such, Gdown1 exclusion of TFIIF would inhibit\ninitiation, providing for a mechanism to explain the previous finding of Gdown1 repressing\nthe promoter-specific transcription (Hu et al, 2006).\nConsidering that TFIIF is at the heart of basal transcription, Gdown1 repression might be\nmitigated by a large excess of TFIIF, which was demonstrated by Roeder's lab (Jishage et al, 2012). However, in our hands two-fold excesses\nof TFIIF did not displace Gdown1, and furthermore we do not believe that extremely large\nexcesses of TFIIF that might potentially dislodge Gdown1 are available in vivo for\nsuch a task. As such, it is important to consider the role played by Mediator in these\nevents.Previously, Mediator was shown to remove the Gdown1 restriction on activated transcription\n(Hu et al, 2006). Since elongation factors were absent\nfrom that study, Mediator necessarily acted during initiation. It is therefore likely that\nMediator would be involved in the removal of Gdown1 from RNAPII at the stage of PIC\nformation through a mechanism coupled with Mediator function in enhancing the assembly of\nthe PIC (Cantin et al, 2003; Baek et\nal, 2006; Takagi and Kornberg, 2006). At a\npromoter, Mediator could associate with RNAPII, and perhaps with RNAPII(G) as well (Jishage et al, 2012). Interestingly, a biochemical study on the\nhead module of Mediator using yeast proteins indicated that the head module would not stably\nassociate with RNAPII in the absence of TFIIF (Takagi et al,\n2006). This line of thought was augmented by a recent cryo-EM study of human\nMediator complex by Taatjes's team (Bernecky et al,\n2011), showing the docking RNAPII on the Mediator appears to be dynamic, while\nTFIIF can promote the stability of the Mediator\u2013RNAPII complex by specifying the\norientation of RNAPII on the Mediator scaffold. Conversely, Mediator would promote the\nassociation of RNAPII and TFIIF. With this in mind and based on our finding of the\nTFIIF/Gdown1 steric overlap together with Gdown1's tight binding to RNAPII, we reason\nthat the crosstalk of TFIIF with Gdown1 may be facilitated by Mediator during a three-way\nmeeting, which could account for Mediator relief of Gdown1 repression at the promoter. To\nelaborate the molecular details, we introduce a scheme relating to the interplay among\nRNAPII, TFIIF, Mediator and Gdown1 according to the principles of protein\nassociation/dissociation and the stability of the Mediator\u2013RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex\n(Figure 7). This would assure a highly regulated process with\neffective initiation for RNAPII(G) only in the presence of activators that can subsequently\nrecruit Mediator to \u2018swap out' Gdown1 for TFIIF.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Steric model of Gdown1 repression and relief by Mediator. In this model, Mediator acts\nas a scaffold to promote the association of RNAPII with TFIIF to create an unfavourable\ncircumstance for Gdown1 to dwell on RNAPII at the overlapping sites of TFIIF; henceforth\ndestabilizing the association between RNAPII and Gdown1 and eventually yielding the\nswapping between Gdown1 and TFIIF on RNAPII to allow for transcription initiation to\nensue (RNAPII is coloured in cyan, Gdown1 in green, TFIIF in blue, and Mediator in grey.\nPIC stands for \u2018pre-initiation complex'). (A) When RNAPII(G) is\nrecruited to the promoter, the PIC would not be generated considering the exclusion of\nTFIIF on RNAPII and transcription would be prevented. (B) Steric hindrance of\nTFIIF binding to RNAPII by Gdown1 is relieved by the Mediator complex and Mediator swaps\nTFIIF for Gdown1 on RNAPII. (C) Once Gdown1 is removed, promoter escape ensues\nwith the possibility of some RNAPII enzymes to re-associate with Gdown1, in accord with\nrecent findings of RNAPII(G) downstream of promoters (Cheng et\nal, 2012) and others to remain with TFIIF. Considering that RNAPII(G)\nis substoichiometric, it is also possible that RNAPII initiates at promoters in the\nabsence of Gdown1 and therefore unhindered by Gdown1.At the level of elongation, one would ask what and how Gdown1 might do since Gdown1 would\ntake place of TFIIF, which is thought to remain associated with RNAPII after the promoter\nclearance and drastically increase the rate of transcription (Tan et\nal, 1994; Gu and Reines, 1995). First, the\nregulatory effect through steric interference by Gdown1 may not be limited to TFIIF but can\nbe applicable to a number of RNAPII-associated elongation proteins other than TFIIF. For\nexample, it is known that stalling of RNAPII can occur near the promoter, which depends on\nproteins of DSIF and NELF (Yamaguchi et al, 1999a,\n1999b). Such promoter proximal pausing is relieved by pTEFb\nphosphorylating Rpb1, the largest RNAPII subunit (Price, 2008).\nCan Gdown1 interfere with the binding of DSIF? To examine such, we compared our\nRNAPII\u2013Gdown1 structure with the related one in which the RNAP is associated with\nSpt5, the homologue of DSIF (Klein et al, 2011), and\nalso with the structure of RNAPII\u2013TFIIS (Kettenberger et al,\n2003) or RNAPII\u2013CE (Suh et al, 2010),\nand therefore suggested that Gdown1 would affect DSIF but would not do so to TFIIS or CE.\nThese conjectures have been confirmed by Price's in-vitro experiments (Cheng et al, 2012). Secondly, the observation of modest 1.5- to\n2.5-fold increase in RNA production and the transcript length enhancement by Gdown1\n(Cheng et al, 2012), though less efficient than TFIIF,\nprompts us to suspect that Gdown1 is a RNAPII processivity factor. Perhaps our EM structures\npresented herein would account for the structural basis of the enhancement of elongation and\nthat the common enhancement of Gdown1 and TFIIF may be the result of their association with\nthe common RNAPII regions by stabilizing the elongation prone conformation of RNAPII and\nrestraining template release. To elaborate, consider that Gdown1-a on the Rpb1 Jaw-Rpb5\nshelf can contribute to securing the incoming DNA and the C-terminal region has potential\ncryptic DNA-binding activity for upstream DNA (Price et al,\n1989; Tan et al, 1994), while the entirety\nof Gdown1 can impact the relative positions and/or stability of the two RNAPII mobile\nelements: the jaw lobe and the clamp. By encompassing the DNA on all sides, akin to closing\na door, which is slightly ajar, the opportunity for DNA to depart from the enzyme is greatly\nreduced. That Gdown1 can work as a processivity factor is in accordant with the observation\nof RNAPII elongation complexes entering productive elongation without loss of Gdown1\n(Cheng et al, 2012).Considering that a Gdown1 homologue does not exist in yeast, the question as to\nGdown1's role in metazoans is raised. Perhaps for complex organism development there\nis much that can go wrong and Gdown1 presents an additional level of scrutiny requiring\ncareful execution of gene expression. We also speculate that Gdown1 may be a master brake,\nlimiting unwanted transcription of some genes by preferentially localized with proximity to\ntheir promoters (Cheng et al, 2012; Jishage et al, 2012) until Mediator removes Gdown1 and allows for TFIIF\nassociation. Another important need for Gdown1 could be in processivity, especially for\nextremely long genes such as the 2.5-Mb human dystophin gene which can require 16\u2009h\nto transcribe (Tennyson et al, 1995). Gdown1 would\nsecure and stabilize the elongation complex, yet be compatible with the TFIIS elongation\nfactor (Wind and Reines, 2000) to aid in generating complete\nRNA transcripts. Such large genes are mostly metazoan specific, which perhaps explains a\nneed for Gdown1 in higher organisms to generate some very extended RNA molecules.In conclusion, our study has revealed a structural basis underlying the Gdown1 regulatory\nmechanism in part by restricting TFIIF association with RNAPII. In general, it is suggested\nthat Gdown1 can restrict or permit RNAPII-binding proteins other than TFIIF that are\ninvolved in initiation and elongation. Materials and methodsRNAPII and RNAPII(G) purificationRNAPII and RNAPII (G) were purified as previously described (Hu et\nal, 2006). Briefly, RNAPII was enriched by precipitating the homogenized\nand clarified calf thymus extract with polyethyleneimine (PEI); the pellet was dissolved,\ncleared by centrifugation, followed by Mono Q chromatography, and affinity chromatography\nusing a monoclonal 8WG16 antibody column (Thompson et al,\n1990). The eluted proteins were subjected to UNO-Q HPLC chromatography\n(Bio-Rad) to separate RNAPII and RNAPII(G). Both forms of RNAPII were stored as\nammonium-sulphate precipitate under \u221280\u00b0C and shipped on dry ice via TNT\nservice. For the subsequent EM and biochemical characterization, the frozen\nammonium-sulphate precipitant was thawed immediately upon arrival, and dissolved in a\nbuffer containing 50\u2009mM Tris\u2013Cl (pH=7.5), 200\u2009mM potassium\nacetate (KOAc), 5\u2009mM MgCl2, 5\u2009mM DDT and 10% glycerol. The\nremoval of ammonium-sulphate was achieved by buffer exchange with the dissolving buffer\nusing an Amicon centrifugal filter unit (MWCO 100\u2009kDa; Millipore). The proteins\nwere further stored as aliquots (1\u2009mg/ml) at \u221280\u00b0C.RNAPII(G) nonspecific promoter assayThe transcription elongation assays were performed as previously described (Gnatt et al, 1997). Briefly, nonspecific initiation on a\ntailed template was employed. The tailed template was formed by annealing a nontemplate\nstrand: 5\u2032-AACACCAGCGAGCAAGGCGTTTCGGGGAAGAAAAA, and a template strand:\nTTTTTCTTCCCCGAAACGCCTTGCTCGCTGGTGTTCCCCCCCCCCCC. 0.4 or 0.8\u2009\u03bcg of polymerase,\nRNAPII or RNAPII(G), were employed, and \u03b1-amanitin, an RNAPII-specific inhibitor,\nwas used as negative control. Quantification of bands was performed using the NIH free\nImageJ software.Expression of recombinant human Gdown1 and TFIIFRecombinant Gdown1 expression plasmid, originally constructed in the pET151 vector\n(Hu et al, 2006), was subcloned into a pET21a vector\nusing NdeI and NotI restriction sites. The Gdown1 protein was overexpressed\nin BL21 cells (Invitrogen) by IPTG induction (0.4\u2009mM) and grown overnight at\n20\u00b0C. The protein was purified by using a nickel-NTA column with standard procedure as\ndescribed by the manufacturer (Sigma). Further HPLC purification was depicted in Supplementary Figure 3A. The purified proteins\nwere stored at \u221280\u00b0C. A bacterial expression plasmid encoding human TFIIF was\nconstructed in the pACYCduet1 vector. To express TFIIF, Escherichia coli BL21\n(DE3)-RIL cells (Merck) transformed with the TFIIF containing duet plasmid was grown at\n37\u00b0C and the temperature was lowered to 30\u00b0C when OD reached 0.4 for induction\nwith 0.84\u2009mM IPTG. The cells were further grown for 3\u2009h at 30\u00b0C before\nharvest. TFIIF was purified using a nickel-NTA column in the same manner as Gdown1 was,\nwith slight modifications in the washing step by raising the concentration of NaCl to\n300\u2009mM and that of imidazole to 40\u2009mM (see also Supplementary Figure 4A).Limited proteolysis analysis of Gdown1Purified recombinant Gdown1 was digested with trypsin (7500:1) at 30\u00b0C. After\n40\u2009min, the reaction was quenched by heating at 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The\ndigestion products were subsequently analysed by LC mass spectrometry.Size exclusion chromatography assaysTo form RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 or RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex, 10\u2009\u03bcg of bovine\nRNAPII was mixed with individual recombinant proteins, rGdown1 or rTFIIF, and incubated\nfor 60\u2009min at 20\u00b0C, respectively. For rGdown1, 4\u2009\u03bcg was used,\nrepresenting a rGdown1 to RNAPII ratio of 4:1. As to the formation of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF,\nabout eight-fold recombinant TFIIF (16\u2009\u03bcg) was used. The size exclusion\nchromatography was carried out using the AKTA purifier system (GE Health/Amersham\nBiosciences). A Superose 6 column PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with\nequilibrating buffer (50\u2009mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5 at 4\u00b0C), 100\u2009mM NaCl,\n1\u2009mM TCEP, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail). The protein sample\n(\u223c30\u2009\u03bcl) was loaded onto the column for fractionation with a total elution\nvolume of 3.2\u2009ml at a flow rate of 0.06\u2009ml/min. The fractions were collected\nwith 60\u2009\u03bcl per fraction. The protein complex in each fraction was concentrated\nwith nickel beads (Sepharose High Performance, GE Healthcare). In brief, 10\u2009\u03bcl\npre-equilibrated Ni-beads were added to individual fraction from (15\u201335)\nrespectively, and incubated with mixing at 4\u00b0C overnight. The supernatant was\ndiscarded; the same volume of 2 \u00d7 SDS\u2013PAGE sample buffer was added to the\nbeads, boiled on a heating block for 10\u2009min. The denatured protein samples were\nseparated on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel using MES running buffer and\nvisualized with silver stain. In all, 5\u2009\u03bcl of 10-fold diluted protein ladder was\nloaded onto an SDS\u2013PAGE gel. To challenge RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 with rTFIIF, RNAPII\nwas first incubated with four-fold rGdown1 at 20\u00b0C and mixed at 550\u2009r.p.m. for\n60\u2009min. After the first incubation period, eight-fold rTFIIF was added, and another\n60\u2009min of incubation was performed, followed by loading the protein samples onto a\nSuperpose 6 PC 3.2/30 size exclusion column. To challenge RNAPII\u2013TFIIF with rGdown1,\nRNAPII was first incubated with four-fold rGdown1, and eight-fold rTFIIF was added after\nthe first incubation period for an additional incubation period before size exclusion\nchromatography was carried out.EM sample preparationIn brief, a frozen aliquot of bovine RNAPII or RNAPII(G) (1\u2009mg/ml) was freshly\nthawed and diluted with de-ionized water to a final concentration of 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml\nfor direct EM usage or for reconstitution. To reconstitute bovine RNAPII complexes,\nincubation of bovine RNAPII with additional proteins were performed at 20\u00b0C for\n60\u2009min before the EM sample was prepared. To form a RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex,\nthe molar ratio of recombinant Gdown1 to RNAPII was adjusted to 4:1. For\nRNAPII\u2013elongation complexes, three-fold of nucleic acid scaffold containing the\nbubble DNA and a 35-nt RNA was used (Supplementary\nFigure 2A). For RNAPII\u2013TFIIF, six-fold recombinant TFIIF together with\nthree-fold nucleic acid scaffold was added. In this study, three different techniques for\npreserving RNAPII complexes were employed, including negative-stain, cryo-staining and\nunstained cryo. To make an EM specimen, 3\u2009\u03bcl of protein solution was applied to\nCu grid (300 mesh) or quantifoil grid coated with thin carbon film to enhance the Thon\nring observation. The carbon film was made by evaporating a carbon rod onto a cleaved mica\nsheet with an evaporator (Edwards Auto 306), deposited on the grid to dry, and freshly\ndischarged with amylamine in a glow-discharger (EM Science, EM-100) before applying\nprotein solution. For the negative-stain technique, 2% uranyl acetate was used; the\nsample was either sandwiched by another layer of thin carbon (Tischendorf et al, 1974) or deep-stained (Stoops\net al, 1991). For cryo-staining, the protein-adsorbed grids were\nfirst stained with 1% uranyl acetate and not allowed to dry; the sample was\nimmediately blotted with a filter paper (Wattmann No. 1, smooth side) and plunged into\nliquid ethane with a customer built plunger in a cold room with 80% humidity\n(Golas et al, 2003; Ohi et\nal, 2004). The frozen EM samples were then stored under liquid nitrogen\nbefore EM. For unstained cryo preservation, the procedure was the same as cryo-staining\nexcept no staining agent was used.Electron microscopyNegative-stain preserved native bovine RNAPII or RNAPII(G) were collected on Kodak SO-163\nfilms by a 200-kV HRTEM (JEOL 2011, LaB6 filament, Cs=1.0\u2009mm) at\nmagnification of \u00d7 40\u2009000 with\n\u223c10\u2009e\u2212/\u00c52, defocus of\n\u223c2\u20133\u2009\u03bcm. The micrographs were developed for 12\u2009min at 25\u00b0C\nin full strength with the Kodak D-19 solution, dried and digitized on a Zeiss/Integraph\nflat-bed densitometer using a step size of 14-micron, corresponding to 3.5\u2009\u00c5\non the object scale. For cryo-staining, Cu grids (300 mesh) were loaded with a layer of\ncarbon film and glow discharged with amylamine; the specimens were observed using a Gatan\n914 quick-load cryo-holder on a 200-kV field-emission microscope (JEOL 2010F,\nCs=3.0\u2009mm) at magnification of \u00d7 52\u2009000 and images of the\nreconstituted RNAPII complexes were collected on a 4K \u00d7 4K CCD (Gatan 895) with the\ndoses controlled at\n\u223c10\u201320\u2009e\u2212/\u00c52 and defocus near\n\u223c2.5\u2009\u03bcm. At such magnification, each CCD pixel corresponded to\n2.9\u2009\u00c5. For cryo-EM imaging of unstained specimens, Quantifoil R2/2 grids\n(Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH) were loaded with a very thin layer of carbon film and glow\ndischarged with amylamine; images of the reconstituted RNAPII complexes were collected on\na 4K \u00d7 4K CCD (Gatan 895) by the same 200\u2009kV field-emission microscope with\nthe magnification adjusted to \u00d7 78\u2009000 and the doses\n\u223c10\u201320\u2009e\u2212/\u00c52 with defocus\ncontrolled in the range \u223c2.0\u20134.0\u2009\u03bcm. At such magnification, each CCD\npixel corresponded to 1.9\u2009\u00c5.Immuno-electron microscopyFor antibody decoration against the GST-tagged Gdown1 in the RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex\nor against the RAP74 subunit within the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF complex, RNAPII complexes were\nincubated with two-fold antibody and then subjected to gel filtration for fractionating\nthe RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 antibody or the RNAPII\u2013TFIIF antibody complex. Application\nof the polyclonal antibody against Gdown1 also followed the same procedure. To disclose\nthe location of the antibody in complex, a 120-kV TEM (JEOL 1400, LaB6\nfilament, Cs=3.4\u2009mm) and 4K \u00d7 4K CCD camera (Gatan 895) were used; the\nmagnification used for visualizing antibody was \u00d7 104\u2009000 and the defocus\nwas\u223c1.5\u2009\u03bcm.Single-particle reconstruction of RNAPII complexesTo analyse RNAPII(G) preserved in negative-stain, a total of 7689 particle images were\ninteractively selected by using EMAN BOXER (Ludtke et al,\n1999). The images were pre-aligned on SPIDER (Frank et\nal, 1996), transferred to XMIPP for classification by the CL2D method\n(Sorzano et al, 2004) into 128 classes (Supplementary Figure 1A). Subsequently,\nrepresentative class averages were selected and an initial model was derived by the\ncommon-line method (Penczek et al, 1996). To\nreconstruct a 3D structure of RNAPII(G) by back-projection, the initial model was injected\nfor assigning the initial orientation parameters to the individual raw images by the\nprojection matching method (Penczek et al, 1994), by\nwhich 10\u201320 cycles of angle refinement were used until convergence occurred.Before we pursued cryo-EM of RNAPII complexes in the unstained state, reconstruction of\neach complex preserved by cryo-staining was generated. More precisely, the negative-stain\nreconstruction of RNAPII(G), lowpass filtered to 40\u2009\u00c5, was used as initial\nmodel for calculating the cryo-stained reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 from a total\nof 13\u2009000 cryo-stained images. The same procedure was repeated for obtaining the\ncryo-stained reconstruction of RNAPII in an elongation form also using 13\u2009000\nimages, and for obtaining cryo-stained reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013TFIIF, 13\u2009000\nimages were employed as well. The resolution of reconstruction was estimated by the degree\nof similarity between the two reconstructions derived from each half-set using Fourier\nshell correlation (FSC) method and the reported resolution is based on\nFSC=\u223c0.15 (Kostek et al, 2006).A total of 25\u2009000 cryo-EM images of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 in the unstained state\nwere used to calculate the cryo-EM reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 by the\nback-projection method using the cryo-stained reconstruction of RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 as the\ninitial model. The same approach was used for obtaining the cryo-EM reconstruction of\nRNAPII in elongation form (\u223c20\u2009000 particles) and for that of\nRNAPII\u2013TFIIF (25\u2009000 particles) by using the respective cryo-stained\nreconstruction as the initial model. The resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction was\nestimated by the FSC method as described. The difference mapping was performed using the\nRobEM program (R Ashmore and T Baker, unpublished data) and two thresholds (5\u03c3 and\n10\u03c3) were used to present the positive and negative difference maps.Docking of the X-ray structure and volume renderingUCSF Chimera (Goddard et al, 2007) was used to\nanalyse and display the EM reconstructions. The PDB ribbons of yeast RNAPII (1WCM or 1Y1W)\nwere first roughly aligned into the reconstruction volumes by visualization. Further\noptimization of the fitting was achieved by using \u2018Fit Model in Map' of\nChimera. Each reconstruction was rendered with a threshold yielding a volume consistent\nwith the molecular weight by assuming an average protein density of\n1.21\u2009\u00c53 per dalton (Harpaz et al,\n1994).EMDataBank accession codesThe cryo-EM maps of bovine RNAPII elongation complex, RNAPII\u2013Gdown1 complex,\nRNAPII\u2013Gdown1 elongation complex and RNAPII\u2013TFIIF elongation complex have been\ndeposited in the EM database (http://emdatabank.org/) with accession codes\nEMD-5440 to EMD-5443.
