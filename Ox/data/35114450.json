At the end of December 2019, a pneumonia patient with unidentified etiology was found positive for pan-\u03b2-coronavirus which has the closest resemblance to another coronavirus, Bat CoV-RaTG13 (Zhou\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). This new virus was termed SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whole genome sequencing analysis of clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 patients revealed a total of 104 different viral strains as of yet (Hu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). It generally is transmitted during close unprotected contact with infected persons via virus-loaded droplets and aerosoles. Due to its novel nature, there is no immune defence present in host. Globally 178,202,610 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 3,865,738 deaths as of June 21, 2021 (Anonymus\u00a02021, WHO coronavirus disease COVID-19 Dashboard 2021).The symptoms of COVID-19 are non-specific and can be asymptomatic to severe pneumonia characterized by fever, coughing, shortness of breathing and also death. Headache, fatigue, anosmia, sore throat, increased sputum production, rhinorrhea, anorexia, dyspnea, pleurisy, skin sensitivity, hemoptysis, myalgias, and diarrhea can be developed as COVID-19 symptoms (Anaya\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Rehman\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). On a mean incubation period of 5-6 days after infection, an infected person may develop pathological symptoms such as mild respiratory complications with fever. Many case reports showed that the mortality rate increases with age, people over 80 years of age having highest mortality rate and people over 60 years of age with other disorders including diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The case fatality rate (CFR) is also higher among males compared to female individuals at any age (Anonymous,\u00a02020a; Lee\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019).With the outbreak of COVID-19, the uses of medicinal plant and their product or traditional herbal preparation increased dramatically around the world (Peng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Based on preliminary clinical reports, FDA approved chloroquine sulfate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as first-line treatment (Gao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Gautret\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Naserghandi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Unfortunately, these conventional drugs are not as effective against COVID-19 infection as expected (Cao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Ferner\u00a0and Aronson,\u00a02020).Antiviral drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and kaletra (lopinavir and ritonavir combination drug) have also been put forward to improve the condition of COVID-19 patients (Guo,\u00a02020; Mifsud\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2019; Sheahan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Drug Controller General of India approved 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) for emergency use as add-on therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients (Balkrishna\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020a; Verma\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). However, the outcome of large randomized clinical trials was not very encouraging (Tu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The most common preventive and effective approach to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of vaccines (Khodadadi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Approximately, 78 vaccine candidates have already been developed worldwide and are at different stages of clinical evaluation (Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Thanh\u00a0Le et\u00a0al., 2020). Up to now, several vaccine candidates are approved through Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) including the Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine (BNT162b2), the Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) sold under brand name Covishield, the Moderna (mRNA 1273) vaccine by the American Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Company, CoronaVac by a Chinese company named Sinovac Biotech. Sinopharm in collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Beijing Institute of Biological Products developed inactivated Chinese Corona Virus (CVC) vaccine and BBIBP\u2011CorV, EpiVacCorona by a Russian company named Federal Budgetary Research Institution State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, China. Covaxin (BBV152) was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV). Sputnik V is a viral vector COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Russian Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Logunov\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Mishra\u00a0and Tripathi,\u00a02021). Still there are many vaccine candidates under clinical investigation. JNJ\u201178436735 formerly known as Ad26.COV2.S was developed by Johnson & Johnson, CanSino Biologics developed a recombinant vaccine called Ad5\u2011nCoV and NVX\u2011CoV2373 was developed by Novavax (Kashte\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). MethodologySpecific information on the topic was collected from the literature available from search engines such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science for retrieving published data (from 2003 to 2021) using different combination of keywords i.e., COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2, diagnosis/treatment guideline issued for COVID-19, cytokine storm, immunomodulation/anti-inflammatory/antiviral, post-COVID complications etc. The inclusion criteria limited to full text articles on pharmacological or therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 based on in-vivo, in-vitro, and in-silico and clinical trial reports on herbal drugs. News reports, editorial, peer review articles were also retrieved to and recent updates were included. The collected literature was electronically checked for duplicates using EndNote software. On the contrary, the exclusion criteria for the collected literature include, predatory journals source, non-english language. Guidelines from different traditional system of medicine to combat COVID-19The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes initiatives to develop COVID-19 therapies, including drug repositioning and traditional medicines. In many countries, traditional medicine has a long history and plays an important role in healthcare. Nowadays, WHO in collaboration with several research institutions is working on the medicinal plant-based products used in traditional medicinal systems, in order to explore their scientific and clinical potential for the treatment and management of COVID-19. In many countries, WHO provided support to perform clinical COVID-19 trials for traditional medicinal products (Anonymous\u00a02020b), WHO, Africa CDC push for COVID-19 traditional medicine research in Africa). The disease is almost controlled in China (Salzberger\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020), but still widespread in Europe, USA, India, Brazil and other countries, which have emerged as new epicentres of COVID-19 (Grasselli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). TCM is playing an important role to control the death rate. Along with TCM, Ayurveda might also help to manage COVID-19 (Sawarkar\u00a0and Sawarkar,\u00a02020; Patwardhan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). However, there is not much solid evidence yet to prove this hypothesis. One may critically ask, why is the outbreak not under control in India, if Ayurveda would really help. The same is true for all other traditional medicines worldwide in a similar manner. Currently the data from www.clinicaltrials.gov and http://www.chictr.org.cn include 46 plant-derived phytomolecules and 64 traditional Chinese medicinal preparations are under clinical investigations targeting both management and prevention of COVID-19 viral infection (Jin\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). But still, it requires reliable and high-quality clinical evidence due to small sample size and long time line (Luo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Nile and Kai, 2021; Pang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Wei et\u00a0al., 2020; Xu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). Randomized clinical trials, which reach international visibility and recognition concerning this issue, are urgently required to answer this question. The Ministry of AYUSH has come up with several preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. These preventive measures are published officially as Guidelines for Practitioners in Naturopathy, Siddha, Homeopathy, Unani, Ayurveda, Yoga and for Public Health and Health care Practitioners for COVID-19 (AYUSH\u00a0Guidelines for COVID-19 2020)AYUSH Guidelines for COVID-19) (Interdisciplinary\u00a0committee for integration of ayurveda and yoga interventions in the 'National clinical management protocol:\u00a0COVID-19\u2032 2020). The Unani system of medicine may offer potential candidates for controlling the disease burden. The textbooks of Unani medicine focused explicitly on air-borne respiratory infections. In Unani medicine, epidemics and pandemics were described with the common term waba, which means diseases affecting a large geographical area. Most of the Unani herbal drugs are cheap, easy to administer and easily available. As an example, vinegar is recommended made from Saccharum officinarum L., Rosa damascena Herrm., Tamarindus indica L., Rheum austral D. Don, Viola odorata L., Terminalia chebula Retz., Cassia fistula L. and Punica granatum L. (Nikhat\u00a0and Fazil,\u00a02020).Ayurveda can prevent the disease progression by regulating the immune-inflammation state in COVID-19 patients. The Ministry of AYUSH, India, recommended different preventive measures to improve the quality of life of individual patients. Daily practice of Yoga, Dhyana, and Pranayaam practices may help to withstand psychological perturbations in COVID-19 patients (Tillu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The use of spices such as Curcuma longa L., Cuminum cyminum L., Coriandrum sativum L., and Allium sativum L. is recommended for daily use. Consuming herbal decoctions of Ocimum sanctum L., Piper nigrum L., Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Cinnamomum verum J. Presl, Vitis vinifera L. are also recommended as teas to improve the immunity in COVID-19 patients. Taking Emblica officinalis Gaertn., Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers and Tribulus terrestris L. in equal ratio with honey suggested having benefits in post-COVID related complications. Daily consumption of ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal) also having benefits in prophylactic care. An ayurvedic herbo-mineral preparation known as Chyawanprasha is also recommended due to its immunoboosting properties and in the management of post-COVID related complications. Patients with sore throat and cough are advised as steam inhalation with Mentha arvensis L. or Trachyspermum ammi L. with Syzigium aromaticum L. powder (Gupta\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021a; Gupta\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021b).Based on the traditional and scientific evidence, the Ministry of AYUSH recommended the consumption of a poly-herbal decoction (Kadha) containing five different herbs namely, Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.), Dalchini (C. verum), Kalimirch (P. nigrum), Shunthi (Z. officinale) and Munakka (V. vinifera) for boosting immunity. The network pharmacology analysis data of this immunomodulatory formulation showed to modulate several signaling pathways involved in the regulation of immunity in biological systems such as HIF-1, Estrogen, Rap1, p53, PI3K-Akt, Toll-like receptor, MAPK, cAMP, Ras, Wnt, Adipocytokine, NOD-like receptor, Chemokine, NF-\u03baB, IL-17, TNF, Sphingolipid, and cGMP-PKG. Along with Kadha, it is also recommended to take raisins (dried Munakka) and golden milk (C. longa powder in hot milk) as a prophylactic against COVID-19 to boost immunity in the subjects with compromised immunity (Khanal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Schuster et\u00a0al., 2017). Global perspective of herbs and herbal formulae from different traditional systems of medicine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virusSoon after the outbreak of COVID-19, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China announced a combination of TCM and commercial medicines to treat COVID-19 patients (Lin\u00a0and Li,\u00a02020). After the global spread of COVID-19, rushes for traditional herbal medications against COVID-19 have been reported in different parts of the world (Ang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Benarba\u00a0and Pandiella,\u00a02020; Mani\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Mukherjee,\u00a02019; Paudyal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021).The exploration of herbs and herbal preparations used in traditional medicine, followed by bioassay-guided isolation of lead compounds from medicinal herbs, represent an attractive approach in combat this pandemic (Tahir\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). In several African countries, home remedies are used as alternative healthcare remedies to manage COVID-19. Natural spices and leaves of medicinal plants having the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were reported to be effective (Orisakwe\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020).Many natural products have broad-spectrum antiviral activity, may inhibit multiple steps in viral infection and replication and have been used in the treatment of SARS, MERS, influenza, and dengue virus. Fig.\u00a01\nrepresents the chemical structures of the bioactive phytomolecules to be useful for the management of COVID-19 related complications. Moreover, they have been reported as immunomodulators, inhibiting inflammatory effect concerned for the significant morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection (Khan\u00a0and Al-Balushi,\u00a02021; McKee\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020) (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3)\n. Medicinal plants that showed to be effective in the management of post-COVID related complications have been tabulated in Table\u00a04\n. Fig.\u00a02\nrepresents the probable inhibition mechanism of medicinal plants/products against SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. However, the phytochemicals could be toxic at certain levels, and hence in vitro and in vivo researches are needed to evaluate the safe and therapeutic levels for each natural compound before human clinical studies can be conducted (Mani\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Infusino\u00a0et\u00a0al., (2020) focuses the possible role of supplements, probiotics, and nutraceuticals in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mitigating the symptoms of COVID-19 in their study.Open in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowFig. 1Chemical structure of the compounds found to be active against COVID-19 virus.Table 1.

Herbal formulae from different traditional systems of medicineDuring the first outbreak of SARS in China (2002-2003), TCM showed a great potency in reducing the fatality rate (Yang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Chen\u00a0and Nakamura,\u00a02004; Yang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). After the outbreak of COVID-19, several TCM formulations have been frequently prescribed, e.g., Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Yu Ping Feng San decoction, Guizhi-and-Mahuang decoction, Shuang-Huang-Lian, Sang Ju Yin and Yu Ping Feng San, Dang Gui Long Hui pill, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Huashi Baidu decoction, Huoxiang Zhengqi, Jinhua Qinggan granules, Xuebijing injection, Reduning injection, Tanreqing injection, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, Xuanfei Baidu decoction, Shenmai injection and Ma Xin Gan Shi Tang etc (Table\u00a02). These herbal formulations have significant antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity to combat COVID-19 (Chan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018; Ding\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; Du\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Fu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018; Gao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Huang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; ;(Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015) Liu,\u00a02020; Poon\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006; Runfeng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Yang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020).Based on recent updates, several herbs and isolated phytomolecules were found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection through different mechanisms (Table\u00a03). Through the binding between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor of the host is the major reason of viral entry into the cells of the nasal and bronchial epithelium. SARS-CoV-2 virus ingestion, replication can easily be inhibited by inhibiting human ACE-2 receptor (Galani\u00a0and Andreakos,\u00a02021). Weng\u00a0et\u00a0al., (2019) showed that the phenol-rich extract of Sambucus formosana Nakai inhibited viral replication of human coronavirus NL63. Triterpenoids and flavonoid glycosides isolated from the ethanolic extract of Euphorbia neriifolia L. exhibited antiviral activity against human coronavirus. The molecular docking study of isolated 3\u03b2-friedelanol showed that the friedelane skeleton could be a potential scaffold for developing new anti-HCoV-229E drugs (Chang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). In another study, the methanol extract of Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze blocked the cytopathic effect of HCoV-NL63-infected cells (Tsai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Mechanism based inhibition of medicinal plants/products through regulation of cytokine storm in SARS CoV-2 infection has been represented in Fig.\u00a03\nFigure\u00a03\n.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Mechanism based inhibition of medicinal plants/product through regulation of cytokine storm in SARS CoV-2 infection.The Ministry of AYUSH in collaboration with the CSIR started clinical trials of four ayurvedic herbs with immunoboosting properties to alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. These are W. somnifera, T. cordifolia, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Piper longum L. with AYUSH-64. This polyherbal formulation is used against malaria-related fever (Vishamjvara), inflammation and joint pains (Gundeti\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Based on a clinical trial on patients with bronchial asthma, the polyherbal formulation DCBT4567-Astha-15 reduced clinical symptoms such as dyspnoea, wheezing, cough, expectoration, disability, and sleep disturbances (Murali\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006). This formulation is under clinical investigation to be used against COVID-19. Role of natural products in the management of post-COVID complicationsParkinsonismSARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the brain and it has been also isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of affected patients (Papa\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The dynamic pro-inflammatory state of COVID-19 accompanies abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in nerve fibres, neurons and glial cells, which leads to increased oxidative stress and causes neuro-inflammation (Stefanis,\u00a02012; Achbani\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020) and Parkinson's disease symptoms. During viral infections, \u03b1-synuclein participates in the innate immune response and acts as inhibitor of viral RNA and growth in neurons (Chana-Cuevas\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; McCann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. reduced dopaminergic neurodegeneration by decreasing \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and might, thus, be used as a potent anti-parkinsonian agent (Jadiya\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume bark and Centella asiatica (L.) Urb. leaves extract inhibit \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, stabilized and disintegrate the oligomers and fibrils (Berrocal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Khotimah\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015; Shaltiel-Karyo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). The flower petals of Carthamus tinctorius L. improved the behavioral dysfunction in a Parkinson's induced rat model by inhibiting \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and astrogliosis (Ren\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016). The stigma of Crocus sativus L. inhibited the fibril dissociation and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation (Inoue\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018). Crocin-1, crocin-2, and crocetin present in the extract were the major components responsible for the anti-Parkinson's effect. Leaves of Corema album (L.) D.Don ex Steud. promoted the formation of non-toxic \u03b1-synuclein species in vitro and inhibited its toxicity and aggregation in cells, by promoting the autophagic flux and reducing oxidative stress (Macedo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015). Geum urbanum L. inhibited \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation in a concentration-dependent way and partly disintegrated \u03b1-synuclein fibrils (Lobbens\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016). The root of Panax ginseng C.A.Mey. prevented dopaminergic loss by attenuating \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, microgliosis and apoptosis (Van\u00a0Kampen et\u00a0al., 2003). The root of Scutellaria pinnatifida A.Ham. also attenuated \u03b1-synuclein aggregation (Sashourpour\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017). Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim., Prunus japonica Thunb., Perillae Ramulus, Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. and Cuscuta chinensis Lam. displayed detoxification effects on \u03b1- synuclein-induced damage in a yeast model of Parkinson's disease (Fu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Sohn\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). The alkaloid acetylcorynoline from Corydalis bungeana Turcz. reduced \u03b1-synuclein aggregation leading to decreased lipid peroxidation which also maintained efficient cellular signaling (Follmer,\u00a02020). Curcuminoids prevented neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (Ojha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). Medicinal plants that showed to be effective for the mangement of post-COVID complications have been represented in Table\u00a04.Olfactory dysfunctions are very common among COVID-19 patients. A considerable portion of patients experienced with the loss of smell and taste, while one third additionally suffered from rhinitis. Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom of early stages of Parkinson's disease (Bocksberger\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Xiao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014). Hyposmia without nasal dysfunction and rhinorrhea was also documented (Giacomelli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Lechien\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Lovato and Filippis,\u00a02020).Mental problemsSARS-CoV-2 can appear as being both neuro-invasive and neuro-virulent. One in every three patients recovering from COVID-19 suffers from neuropsychological problems ranging from headache, dizziness, memory disorder, seizures, depression and lingering loss of smell or taste to mood disorders and deeper cognitive impairment. Those patients with insomnia feature stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, denial, anger, mental breakdown, and those with pre-existing mental illness experience worsening of their conditions (Anaya\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Czeisler\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Roy\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Sch\u00e4fer\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The demyelination syndrome troubles COVID-19 patients, in which the protective coating of nerve cells is attacked by the immune system. This is an autoimmune disease causing weakness, numbness, tingling, spurring psychosis and also hallucinations (Coony,\u00a02020).COVID-19 patients are challenged by severe stressors, including fear of death from life-threatening illness, pain from medical interventions, endotracheal intubation, limited ability to communicate, and the feeling to loose control (Kaseda\u00a0and Levine,\u00a02020). The Chicago medical center reported that more than 40% of COVID-19 patients exhibited neurologic manifestations and more than 30% of those had impaired cognition. Sometimes, the neurological manifestations can be calamitous and can even lead to death.Implementation of Indian herbs and herbal formulations such as Brahmi (B. monnieri), Shankhpushpi (Convolvulus prostratus Forssk.), Giloy (T. cordifolia), Malkangni (Celastrus paniculatus Willd.), Tulsi (O. tenuiflorum), Ashwagandha (W. somnifera) etc. can help managing psychological post-COVID conditions. Bacoside from B. monnieri induced an antioxidant environment in brain, and its neuroprotective activity was attributed to the regulation of mRNA translation and surface expression of AMPA, NMDA and GABA neuroreceptors in the brain. Acorus calamus L. is another plant, which is used as nerve tonic, tranquilizer, sedative etc. by reducing AChE levels and interaction with GABA receptors. It showed antidepressant properties by induction of \u03b11, \u03b12 and 5-HT1A receptors. Flowers of Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy showed anxiolytic activity and are also used as brain tonic in mental aberration and neurosis. The plant possesses strong antioxidant activity towards brain cells. It also inhibited AChE and 5-LOX, which are involved in neurodegenerative disorders. The seed oil of C. paniculatus exhibited significant antidepressant-like effects by interaction with dopamine D2 receptors, serotonergic and GABAB receptors. It also inhibited MAO-A and caused reduction in plasma corticosterone levels (Joshi\u00a0and Pandya,\u00a02020).TCM plants including Lily bulb, Rehmannia, Anemarrhenae and Ganmai Dazao decoctions were incorporated to treat depression. G. Dazao decoction was used to treat hysteria, whose symptoms were sadness, crying, mood disorders, and abnormal behaviour. It is composed of G. glabra, Triticum aestivum L. and Ziziphus jujuba Mill. According to the TCM theory, this decoction nourishes Yin of heart and calms mind (Ma\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). G. Dazao decoction combined with Lily bulb and Rhizoma Anemarrhena decoction is also used to treat depression, which effectively reduced the depression symptoms of patients and improved their sleep status. This modified G. Dazao decoction is clinically efficient and safe in the treatment of perimenopausal patients with severe depression, because of the regulation of monoamines and aminoacid neurotransmitters, regulation of immune inflammation, and also the reduction of the level of inflammatory factors (Li\u00a0and Gao,\u00a02014).Suanzaoren decoction, Huang lian E jiao secoction, Zhizi Chi decoction were also incorporated in the drug treasure trove to treat the anxiety of internal heat and Yin deficiency syndrome. Suanzaoren decoction is made from Ziziphus spinosa Hu, liquorice root, R. Anemarrhena, Poria cocos (Schw.) and Chuanxiong Rhizoma. Huang lian E jiao decoction is composed of Coptidis Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Colla Corii Asini and fresh egg yolk. The anti-anxiety properties of the Suanzaoren decoction was related to an increased NO concentration in the blood and the decrease of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 level in serum (Wang\u00a0and Xie,\u00a02004; Liu,\u00a02018). In another study, the combination of Suanzaoren decoction and Zhizi Chi decoction was significantly improved anxiety-related insomnia (Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014). The anti-anxiety activity of Suanzaoren decoction and Huanglian E jiao decoction was related to elevated \u03b3-GABA levels (Zhao,\u00a02012). Lily bulb, Rehmannia decoction and Guilu Erxian decoction were useful against post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; internal heat and Yin deficiency syndrome) by regulating synaptic plasticity, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and reducing fear memory (Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020).Kidney failureThe CDC reported that of the adults hospitalized for COVID-19 with underlying conditions in USA, 74.8% had chronic renal disease, but patients with chronic renal disease consisted of only 3% of the total cases (Abbott,\u00a02020). A recent clinical study with 701 patients from a hospital in Wuhan found that 5.1% of patients admitted for COVID-19 developed acute kidney injury (Cheng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). During the infection, the virus circulated in the blood to reach the kidney and caused damage to renal resident cells, which was manifested by proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer (Cheng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Henry\u00a0and Lippi,\u00a02020; Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with AKI was significantly higher (5.3 times higher in acute kidney injury than 1.5 times in chronic illnesses) (Alberici\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Su\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Xu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The main binding site for SARS-CoV-2 is the ACE2 protein, which is expressed in the kidney much more than the lungs (Serfozo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Ye\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006). Targeting of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 results in angiotensin dysregulation, innate and adaptive immune pathway activation, and hyper-coagulation to result in organ injury and AKI associated with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 might cause tubular damage through infiltrating renal parenchyma by an exaggerated and often uncontrolled surge of plasma pro-inflammatory factors (IL2, IL7, IL- 10, GSCF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1A and TNF-\u03b1) known as \u2018\u2018cytokine storm\u2019\u2019 (Wen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Inflammatory cells such as CD68+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells can be present in tubulointerstitium of affected patients. The hyper-activation of these immune cells may eventually promote fibrosis, induce epithelial cell apoptosis, and cause microvasculature change. Moreover, C5b-9 complex expression and disposition on tubular cells causes renal interstitial damage (Diao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Rodr\u00edguez\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018; Saffarzadeh\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012).Thirty-eight patients with moderate chronic renal failure were treated with 1 g Rheum palmatum L. (Chinese rhubarb) root extract per day, which led to significant decreases in serum BUN and creatinine level (Sanada,\u00a01996). Tincture of lespedeza (Lespedeza capitata Michx.) showed beneficial effect in patients with acute and chronic renal failure (Yarnell\u00a0and Abascal,\u00a02007). The effect may be due to the compound proanthocyanidins present in the plant extract showing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition effects (Wagner\u00a0and Elbl,\u00a01992). A study showed that Urtica dioica L. seed might be an effective herbal treatment for renal failure patients, as it lowers the serum creatinine levels and also reduces the symptoms (Treasure,\u00a02003). Roots of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees significantly reduced blood proteinemia and uremia (Rao,\u00a02006). Rheum officinale Baill. combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and and Chinese patented medicine Rheum (CPM-Rheum) might be used to improve the condition of impaired renal function (Yang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018).Heart failureSome patients having problems related to heart even exhibited signs related to mild to severe heart damage in post-COVID infection due to an overactive immune response with abnormal heart rhythms, heart muscle disease and also heart failure in severe cases of myocarditis (Sharma,\u00a02020). A report of the University of Frankfurt in Germany showed that more than 78% patients exhibited cardiac issue and 60% patients, who had COVID-19, exhibited cardiac inflammation (Puntmann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). In severe cases, elevated troponin levels in the blood were seen in infected patients. Multi-drug therapy may cause serious cardiovascular complications due to drug-drug interactions. The antiviral drug remdesivir reduced blood pressure and caused unusual heart rhythm (Citroner,\u00a02020; Healthline.com; https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-covid-19-may-damage-your-heart).The ACE2 receptor plays an important role in regulating blood vessel dilation and blood pressure. The anti-hypertensive therapy could raise the number of ACE2 receptors expressed on cells, generating more molecular gates for SARS-CoV-2 to enter (Pesheva,\u00a02020). In Ayurveda, Rasayana acts as antioxidant, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory drug and improves the cardiac health of patients (Rastogi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Cucurmin from C. longa blocked cytokine release, specifically IL-1, IL-6, pro-inflammatory cytokines and TNF-\u03b1 possesses anti-inflammatory activity in COVID-19 patients (Khanna\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Naringin, naringenin and hesperidin present in Citrus sp. inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, restrained cytokines via inhibiting HMGB1 expression and obstructed binding affinity of the ACE 2 receptor to the coronavirus (Cheng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). G. glabra root also exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, which induces interferon production in the body and prevents heart disease. Cannabis sativa L. shows anti-inflammatory actions by modulation of expression of ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2, which is a pre-requisite for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into host cells. Triterpenoids and flavonoids in Glycyrrhizae radix is used as anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective drug. Aconiti lateralis radix praeparata was widely used to treat heart failure in COVID-19 patients (Ang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). For cardiovascular and circulatory disorders, Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge and T. terrestris can be used in infected and recovered patients (Benarba\u00a0and Pandiella,\u00a02020). Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. ex Schult.) DC. exhibited immunostimulating and cardiovascular protective activity. Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil. possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by inhibition of the TLR4/NF-kB/NLRP3 pathway in murine alveolar macrophages (Firenzuoli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). P. longum contains phenanthrenes, phenylpropanoic acids, diarylheptanoids, piperidines, oxanes showing cardioprotective activity. T. cordifolia is well known for its cardiotonic activity and is used to treat heart diseases (First Report and Reccomendation, 2020, ayush.gov.in).Liver injurySome studies reported higher serum pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in infected patients with abnormal liver function (Duan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003; Feng\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Hepatic cells can be directly infected due to the ACE2 expression in the liver, bile duct cells and cholangiocytes, which may explain dysregulated liver function in COVID-19 patients (Chai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Hamming\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004). Liver biopsies in infected patients showed a significant increase in mitotic cells and ballooned hepatocytes, causing apoptosis of liver cells (Chau\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004). The SARS-CoV-specific protein 7a affects the liver tissue by inducing apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway (Tan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2004).Besides, application of high-dose antibiotics along with hepatotoxic antiviral drugs and steroids led to liver abnormalities and liver injury in 76% of COVID-19 patients (Ali,\u00a02020), as documented by elevated serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and TB (Cai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Guan\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020b\nZhao\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Pre-existing liver disease among COVID-19 patients showing comorbidities such as hypertension (68%) and diabetes (48%) increased the risk of mortality (Singh\u00a0and Khan,\u00a02020; Zhang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020a).T. cordifolia (leaf, stem and root), Momordica charantia L. (fruit), M. arvensis (leaves), Lawsonia inermis L. (leaves), E. officinalis, Eclipta alba (L.) Hassk. (leaves), Clitoria ternatea L. (leaves), Cassia angustifolia M. Vahl (leaves), Argemone mexicana L. (leaves), Abrus precatorius L. (seeds) normalized elevated levels of AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin in vivo (Battua\u00a0and Kumara,\u00a02009; Beedimani\u00a0and shetkar,\u00a02015; Bhuvaneswari\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Kavitha\u00a0and Geetha,\u00a02018; Kowti\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013; Mohamed\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; Nithianantham\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011; Shanmugasundaram\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010; Sourabi\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2012; Zahra\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). The fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum Schrad. & H. Wendl. normalized the serum parameters (SGOT, SGPT, ALP, TB) better than Juniperus communis L. fruit in paracetamol- and azithromycin-induced liver toxicity in rats (Singh\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015).Lung injuryThe heterogeneity of the clinical COVID-19 presentation has prompted the conceptualization of novel paradigms to individualize clinical management of COVID-19 (Gattinoni\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). The Berlin Criteria define the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure following an acute event (such as viral respiratory infection) that presents as bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on lung imaging in the absence of a purely cardiogenic or hydrostatic etiology (Definition\u00a0Task Force et\u00a0al., 2012). Nevertheless, a recent cohort study reported that 85% ICU patients with COVID-19 meet the Berlin Criteria definition of ARDS and that is a well-established supportive intervention for ARDS, such as low tidal volumes and prone ventilation, resulted in significant improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance (Ziehr\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Mortality attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly through the development of viral pneumonia-induced ARDS.The virus could cause lung parenchymal injury resulting in pneumonitis barring interstitial lung and/or alveolar inflammation features. Also, the virus could directly bind to the ACE-2 receptors facilitating endothelial dysfunction. The deregulated inflammatory response of cells (e.g., polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells) activated the production of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-9 and IL-8), inflammatory mediators (e.g., elastin, cathepsins, collagenases and gelatinases, cytokines, chemokines) and other inflammatory transmitters, which cause damage to the alveolar epithelial cells. The associated cytokine release syndrome could exacerbate both lung parenchymal and microvascular inflammation, promoting refractory forms of ARDS with associated hypercoagulable states and microthrombosis (Klok\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Tang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Zhang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020c). Several signal transduction pathways such as NF-\u03baB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), toll like receptors (TLRs), adrenergic receptors and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are involved in this inflammatory process (Chang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018; Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2019; Sun\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018a). Hence, it can be stated that the COVID-19-associated cytokine release syndrome may be the catalyst of two parallel inflammatory pathways: one promoting parenchymal lung injury and another one facilitating thromboembolic phenomena, resulting in a \u201cdual-hit\u201d lung injury (Fraiss\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2020; H\u00e9kimian\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Menter\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Another cause is lung edema and lung dilatation due excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause damage to the cell membrane by unsaturated fatty acids (Fu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017; Imai\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008). Several plant-derived phytomolecules were reported to be effective in acute lung infection through modulation of NF-\u03baB, MAPK and Nrf2 signaling pathways owing to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities (He\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). DiscussionTraditionally used Indian medicinal herbs/herbal preparations are promising candidates for the treatment and management of various illnesses through rejuvenating human wealth (Gomathi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Mukherjee\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2017). Ayurveda and Siddha practices are still widely used among the Indian population for maintaining human well-being (Mukherjee\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2019). By identifying certain phytocompounds, it is possible to effectively characterize medicinal herbs that could help to alleviate the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Hence, by repurposing Indian medicinal plants, more innovative treatment options can be penned down to defeat this viral pandemic and post-COVID related complications (Balachandar\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). In this review, we systematically summarized and analyzed the pharmacological importance of herbs and herbs-derived secondary metabolites which may be effective against COVID-19 related infections and by the traditional practice recommended by all available guidelines.Several therapeutic strategies were put forward for the development of treatments against COVID-19 from the pharmacological point of view such as antivirals (e.g., ribavirin, sofosbuvir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remidesivir, favipiravir etc.) (Clercq,\u00a02007) and antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) (De\u00a0Clercq,\u00a02009), anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., baricitinib) (Stebbing\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020), and monoclonal antibodies (Zheng\u00a0and Song,\u00a02020). In China, three patent herbal drugs, Lianhuaqingwen capsules and Jinhuaqinggan granules for mild conditions and Xuebijing (injectable) for severe conditions were approved to treat COVID-19 symptoms. These herbal formulations can effectively relieve symptoms, such as fever, cough, and fatigue, and reduce the probability of patients developing severe conditions (A report by National Health Commission of Chinese). Glycyrrhizin from liquorice root is the most frequently used Chinese herb, which inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of the SARS virus (Cinatl\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2003). T. cordifolia aqueous extract twice a day for 15 days can be effective against chronic fever, provided by AYUSH, Government of India as therapeutic approach against COVID-19 (Vellingiri\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). AYUSH also suggested that the extract of Eupatorium perfoliatum L. may be helpful to treat COVID-19-related respiratory symptoms (Vellingiri\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). After the acute phase of COVID-19, majority of the patients developed persistent and prolonged clinically significant physical and mental adverse outcomes affecting the quality of life. It was observed that such adverse outcomes were not confined; rather it is recognized as a multi-organ disease and increased risk of indolent death (Oronsky\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). The reviewed data shows that A. paniculata, Cassia tora L., Phyllanthus emblica L., G. glabra, Azadirachta indica A.Juss., Morus alba L., P. longum, Nigella sativa L., Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, U. dioica, C. longa, T. terrestris, Chrysanthemum indicum Thunb., Astragalus propinquus Schischkin, S. miltiorrhiza, Salvia officinalis L., C. zeylanicum, P. nigrum, Z. officinale, Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Psoralea corylifolia L., Ecklonia cava, T. cordifolia, Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M.Perry, W. somnifera were found to have enriched biological benefits due to their varied secondary metabolites. This may provide a more rational phytotherapeutic choice to improve the general well-being effectively by counteracting the biological complications caused by for patients affected with COVID-19. Conclusion and perspectivesAs a matter of fact, the pandemic is far from over. There are more questions than answers about diagnosis, treatments, and, what we need most, effective cures and aftercare. This review may serve as reference in traditional herbal medicine for COVID-19 treatment. The present review compiled pharmacological information of more than 50 herbal medicines, which potentially combat the viral infection and post-COVID complications through different mechanisms. Most information is rather based on some in-vitro and in-silico investigations and anecdotal clinical data. The basic molecular mechanisms are also unexplored yet.It should be noted that there is still no convincing clinical evidence on the activity of most herbal products. Unlike modern medicines, herbs are often claimed to be non-toxic, due to their natural origin and long-term use as traditional medicines. However, numerous difficulties can be occurred due to the adulteration, substitution, contamination, misidentification, intrinsic toxicity, drug-herb interactions and lack of standardization. For that reasons, pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness is a great concern for the further development of safe and effective herbal treatments. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, substantial progress has been made in pathogen monitoring, identifying sources, basic etiology, and clinical treatment. Herbs from traditional system of medicine may be useful in alleviating the disease symptoms but it requires more research works to unravel their therapeutic potential. The integration of traditional medicine into conventional treatment may be an alternative approach for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future. However, the global situation is very serious, and numerous questions remain unanswered. It will take combined efforts of traditional and western medical systems worldwide to ultimately extinguish this pandemic.
