A critical obstacle to overcome is the persistence of CD4+ T cells containing proviral genomes (1, 2), which are maintained at different depths of viral latency (3, 4). Efforts to purge this persistent viral reservoir have been the focus of over a decade of investigation, with substantial efforts focused on reversing viral latency (5).The original hypothesis of the \u201ckick and kill\u201d approach to reducing HIV-1 reservoirs was that small-molecule epigenetic modifiers, i.e., histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), could be used to induce viral protein expression in latently infected cells, exposing them to elimination by immune effectors, such as CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). HDACi orchestrate latency reversal through various mechanisms, primarily through enabling the acetylation of histones at the promoter region of the viral genome, the 5\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) (6, 7). HDACi facilitate changes in the chromatin architecture that enable the recruitment of host transcription factors to the LTR to promote viral transcription (8,\u201310).Clinical trials investigating HDACi have demonstrated increases in viral transcription, while failing to measurably impact the size of the reservoir in peripheral blood (11,\u201317). To achieve successful latency reversal, many inherent host-conserved blocks that maintain HIV-1 latency must be reversed, including HDAC suppression of viral transcription (18,\u201323), negative elongation factors that prevent viral RNA elongation (24,\u201326), and a lack of active HIV-1 regulatory proteins that orchestrate splicing (27,\u201329) and nuclear export (30, 31) of viral RNAs. HDACi alter the splicing of many host genes and modify aberrantly spliced transcripts to restore full-length mRNA in inherited disorders where the defect is an unsolicited splicing event (32,\u201338). Of particular interest, the removal of HDAC1 at host promoters by short interfering RNA (siRNA) or HDACi is implicated in inhibiting splicing (32). HDAC1 is associated with the HIV-1 LTR and removed during HDAC inhibition during latency reversal (6, 8, 9). In this context, with the provirus considered a gene unit, the full-length unspliced (US) viral genome may be favorably reactivated from latency using HDACi. This was demonstrated ex vivo (3) and in vivo, with the potent HDACi romidepsin (RMD) reported to increase US HIV-1 RNA (16) but failed to increase multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 RNA (39). Without the accumulation of MS HIV-1 RNAs, which express viral regulatory proteins that drive robust viral expression, it is not clear that viral genomes would be sufficiently induced to achieve antigen presentation and thus recognition by CD8+ T cells (40).While latency reversing agents (LRAs) must potently reactivate proviral genomes, any adverse effects on CD8+ T cell function must also be considered. HDACi, particularly romidepsin and panobinostat, have been shown to impair multiple functions of HIV-1- and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vitro, including proliferative capacity and ability to kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells (41,\u201345). Corresponding effects on CD8+ T cell function in clinical trials with individuals living with HIV-1 have been mixed. In vivo administration of the HDACi panobinostat transiently increased the activation of CD8+ T cells (46) and modestly increased the magnitude and breadth of cytokine-secreting HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, although without influencing the size of the reservoir (47). In contrast, evidence of transient in vivo suppression of CD8+ T cell responses was observed with romidepsin (B. Mothe, data presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections 2017, Seattle, Washington; reviewed in reference 48). Researchers investigating inflammatory or autoimmune disorders have harnessed this immunosuppressive activity of HDACi by utilizing pan-HDACi, which enable the acetylation of HDAC6 to impair CD8+ T cell function, including cytotoxicity (49,\u201353). Additionally, HDAC1, which is targeted by all HDACi investigated in HIV-1 clinical trials to date, has been implicated in maintaining the homeostasis of CD8+ T cells and is required to induce the expansion of and stimulate CD8+ T cells against viral infection (54, 55). The functional importance of HDAC1 and HDAC6 in their deacetylated states within CD8+ T cells has potential implications for the suitability of pan-HDACi as systemically delivered LRAs, which might be mitigated through the use of more-selective HDACi.Here, we employ a class I-selective HDACi, nanatinostat (VRx-3996; CHR-3996) (56), as a potential LRA. Nanatinostat has previously been demonstrated to increase histone H3 acetylation within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vivo (57). Nanatinostat is currently being investigated in a phase 1b/2 clinical trial to treat Epstein-Barr virus-positive lymphoma (VT3996-201, ClinicalTrials.gov) and has previously been evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00697879\",\"term_id\":\"NCT00697879\"}}NCT00697879, ClinicalTrials.gov) (57). We compare nanatinostat to a very well investigated class I-selective HDACi in the HIV-1 field, romidepsin (10, 16, 17, 39, 41), hypothesizing that both HDACi would achieve similar increases in US HIV-1 RNA but that they may prevent splicing of viral RNAs. We further postulated that this would affect the ability of HDACi-treated CD4+ T cells latently infected with HIV-1 to present antigen and thus to be recognized by CD8+ T cells, and that both HDACi would directly impact CD8+ T cell function. To investigate these hypotheses, we utilized primary CD4+ T cells from individuals living with HIV-1 suppressed by ART (for at least 3\u2009years) (Table 1) to compare the potencies of both HDACi to induce viral transcription and splicing. Parallel experiments were performed using a primary cell latency model, with CD4+ T cells from an infected individual and autologous HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell clones as \u201cbiosensors,\u201d to investigate whether HDACi-mediated latency reversal was sufficient to induce antigen presentation and recognition. We further directly measured any impairment of HDACi on primary bulk CD8+ T cell antiviral function through viral inhibition assays.TABLE 1Participant characteristicsOpen in a separate windowaDonors used in Fig. 1 and \u200band22 have unique symbol identifiers next to them. RESULTSNanatinostat reactivates latent HIV-1 in J-LAT 10.6 cells. As the first investigation of nanatinostat\u2019s potential LRA activity, we performed a dose-response experiment on the J-LAT 10.6 cell line, which is a Jurkat cell line that contains a copy of a full-length HIV-1 genome with a frameshift mutation in env and which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in place of the nef gene (58). Based on a study demonstrating 50% lethal concentration (LC50) values of up to 100\u2009nM nanatinostat in multiple cell lines (59), we opted to test a 2-fold serial dilution of nanatinostat, ranging from 1,000\u2009nM to 62.5\u2009nM. We observed a dose-dependent response in latency reversal, which was significant compared to what occurred with the vehicle carrier dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 0.001% DMSO matched by concentration with 1,000\u2009nM nanatinostat) even at the lowest concentration tested (62.5\u2009nM) (Fig. 1A). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin (PMA/I) was included as a positive control and potently increased GFP expression in this cell line (Fig. 1A). One hundred nanomolar nanatinostat was chosen as the concentration to use in the remainder of this study based on (i) this titration, (ii) viability data from primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1C to \u200btoE),E), and (iii) the fact that 100\u2009nM is a clinically relevant dose, as previously described (57).Open in a separate windowFIG 1Nanatinostat reverses HIV-1 latency in J-Lat 10.6 cells at concentrations that are minimally toxic to primary ex vivo CD4+ T cells. (A and B) HIV-1 latency reversal was assessed at 24\u2009h by measuring GFP expression in L-Lat 10.6 cells following a titration of nanatinostat (N-stat) (A) or the panel of LRAs used in this study (B), with DMSO as the negative control and PMA/I as the positive control.

(C and D) Primary CD4+ T cells from uninfected donors treated with a titration of nanatinostat (C) or from infected donors treated with the entire LRA panel used in this study plus ARVs (D), were tested for metabolic activity at 72\u2009h using the MTS assay. (E to G) Primary CD4+ T cells from ARV-treated individuals living with HIV were cultured in the presence of LRAs, including IL-2 and ARVs, and flow cytometry was used to measure live cells (E), MHC class I expression (F), and CD69 expression (G).

Paired t tests were used for <6 experiments (A, B, D), and the nonparametric Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used for sample sizes of at least\u20096 (C, E to G). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001.We then tested the full panel of LRAs to be used in our ex vivo reactivation studies with this cell line. J-LAT 10.6 cells were treated with nanatinostat (100\u2009nM), romidepsin (a 40\u2009nM dose was selected given its success in HIV-1 in vitro and ex vivo studies [10]), and bryostatin (10\u2009nM), using 0.001% DMSO as the negative control and PMA/I (10\u2009nM-500\u2009nM) as the positive control. At 24\u2009h posttreatment, each LRA had induced statistically significant increases in the percentages of cells expressing GFP, which is indicative of HIV-1 expression (Fig. 1B). Of the test LRAs, romidepsin induced the greatest increase in the frequencies of cells expressing GFP (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD], 57\u2009\u00b10.4%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), followed by nanatinostat (38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%; P\u2009=\u20090.0001) and bryostatin (38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). As expected, the most potent reactivation was observed with the positive control of PMA/I (87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001).Effects of nanatinostat on the viability and activation of primary CD4+ T cells. As a precursor to performing ex vivo latency reversal studies, we tested nanatinostat in two toxicity assays. Based on a study demonstrating LC50 values of up to 100\u2009nM nanatinostat in multiple cell lines (59), we opted to test a 2-fold serial dilution of nanatinostat, ranging from 1,000\u2009nM to 62.5\u2009nM. To measure the effects of nanatinostat on primary cell viability, CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-negative donor PBMCs were treated with the 2-fold titration of nanatinostat (Fig. 1C) (n\u2009=\u20096). The drug was washed out at 24\u2009h, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay was performed at 72\u2009h. This assay can indicate drugs that are cytotoxic or that induce proliferation as measured by the level of the MTS tetrazolium compound reduced by metabolically active cells, generating a soluble formazan dye (60). MTS readouts were normalized to those of DMSO. Each concentration of nanatinostat was observed to significantly alter the metabolic activity of the primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1C). The observed reductions in metabolic activity were modest, however, with a <20% reduction observed at the lowest concentrations; the median changes (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) were a 17% (13 to 22%) reduction at 125\u2009nM and a 12% (7 to 17%) reduction at 62.5\u2009nM (P\u2009=\u20090.03 for both comparisons). The positive-control, PMA/I, significantly induced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells (with a median increase in the formazan dye signal of 452% [IQR, 399 to 508%]; P\u2009=\u20090.03) (Fig. 1C).To more closely represent the upcoming ex vivo experimental conditions with CD4+ T cells from ARV-treated donors, we next used the full panel of LRAs in the presence of tenofovir, nevirapine, emtricitabine, and T20, with the addition of 10 U interleukin 2 (IL-2) (to promote cell survival), and assessed metabolic activity, viability, and activation using the MTS assay (n\u2009=\u20094) (Fig. 1D) and flow cytometry (n\u2009=\u20098) (Fig. 1E to \u200btoG).G). Cell metabolic activity was significantly reduced after HDACi treatment, whereas both bryostatin and PMA/I induced significant proliferation (Fig. 1D). We next employed a LIVE/DEAD fixable-stain assay, where dead cells with compromised membranes are labeled with dyes and measured by flow cytometry. In comparison with DMSO, both nanatinostat and romidepsin displayed significant toxicity, which was modest for nanatinostat treatment (median fold change [FC] [IQR], 0.1 [0.06 to 0.12]; P\u2009=\u20090.008) and more apparent for romidepsin (0.3 FC [0.22 to 0.4]; P\u2009=\u20090.008). Bryostatin and PMA/I did not significantly alter cell viability, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E). Given its importance in antigen presentation, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression was also measured. Only bryostatin and PMA/I changed its expression on CD4+ T cells (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] median FC [IQR] = 1.75 FC [1.6 to 2.3] [P\u2009=\u20090.008] for bryostatin and 3.2 FC [2.1 to 3.8] [P\u2009=\u20090.02] for PMA/I) (Fig. 1F). CD69 was also measured as a marker of early cell activation (61). Nanatinostat did not induce CD69 upregulation (Fig. 1G), whereas romidepsin did (9.4 FC from DMSO [3.8 to 29.6]; P\u2009=\u20090.008), in line with the results of a previous report (44). Bryostatin also increased CD69 expression (83.3 FC [30 to 207]; P\u2009=\u20090.008), and the largest increase was observed with PMA/I (100.1 FC [34 to 233]; P\u2009=\u20090.008) (Fig. 1G and \u200bandH).H). One hundred nanomolar nanatinostat was chosen as the concentration to use in the remainder of this study based on (i) the MTS titration (Fig. 1C), (ii) viability data in HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1D), and (iii) the fact that 100\u2009nM is the clinically relevant dose previously described (57). Although romidepsin displayed more toxicity than nanatinostat, we used 40\u2009nM in this study based on previously published data (10, 62).Nanatinostat and romidepsin stimulate HIV-1 transcription in ex vivo CD4+ T cells from ARV-treated individuals. Next, we assessed the ability of nanatinostat to increase levels of HIV-1 transcription from CD4+ T cells isolated from the ex vivo PBMCs of ARV-treated individuals. These cells were treated in the presence of ARVs, and IL-2 (10 U/ml) to maintain viability (63), with nanatinostat (100\u2009nM), romidepsin (40\u2009nM), or bryostatin (10\u2009nM), using DMSO (0.001%) as the negative control and PMA/I (10\u2009nM-500\u2009nM) as the positive control. To assess changes in viral RNA, we performed Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR). Unspliced (US) HIV-1 RNA was detected by using a primer set that crosses viral splice donor 1 to represent that a splicing event did not occur at this major splice donor (64). Pasternak and Berkhout caution that measuring only US RNA may not be the best surrogate for latency reversal (65); thus, to quantify a multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 RNA, primers were designed to capture a splicing event between splice donor 4 and splice acceptor 7, with a probe spanning the splice junction (3). This particular primer set captures HIV-1 tat and rev RNAs (3).Compared to results with DMSO (median number of copies per microgram of US RNA [range], 55.0 [11.6 to 192.4]), nanatinostat and romidepsin each significantly increased levels of US RNA (112 [26.8 to 439.2] copies and 328 [20.8 to 689.2] copies, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.004 for both) (Fig. 2A and \u200bandD)D) but not of MS RNA (with DMSO, 4.6 [0 to 10.6] copies; with nanatinostat, 5.4 [0 to 41.1] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.16; with romidepsin, 8.2 [0 to 67] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.11) (Fig. 2B and \u200bandE)E) (note that undetectable is 0 by ddPCR but is represented as 1 for the purpose of representation on the log-scale graphs; fold change graphs [Fig. 2D, \u200b,E,E, and \u200bandF]F] are presented to demonstrate normalized data over DMSO data, and values are divided by 1 if they are undetectable). The levels of induction of US RNA did not differ significantly between romidepsin and nanatinostat (P\u2009=\u20090.32). Representative examples of raw ddPCR plots are given in Fig. 2G, representing changes to US HIV-1 RNA. Bryostatin increased the level of US RNA (median, 149.3 [15.2 to 810.8] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and induced increases in MS RNA in 7/9 donors (median, 11.8 [0 to 129] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.02). PMA/I is a strong T cell mitogen used in vitro to potently activate T cells (66) and serves here as a positive control for HIV-1 reactivation studies, given its consistency in reversing latency (62). PMA/I induced the highest level of both US (median, 250 [64.0 to 994.0] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.004) and MS (median, 54 [16.5 to 121.5] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.004) HIV transcripts. PMA/I treatment was the only condition under which every donor had detectable MS HIV-1 RNA, and the level of spliced transcripts after PMA/I treatment was significantly higher than with both nanatinostat and romidepsin (P\u2009=\u20090.004 and P\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively) (Fig. 2B and \u200bandEE).Open in a separate windowFIG 2Ex vivo primary CD4+ T cells treated with nanatinostat significantly induce the transcription of unspliced but not multiply spliced HIV-1 RNAs and do not drive the production of detectable supernatant HIV-1 RNA.

(G) Representative example of ddPCR data demonstrating increases in US HIV-1 RNAs, with values depicting the concentration of positive droplets per sample.To test whether ex vivo treatment with HDACi was associated with virus production, we also measured cell-free HIV-1 RNA in the supernatant of the 72-h cultures. Neither HDACi demonstrated a significant release of supernatant HIV-1 RNA (Fig. 2C and \u200bandF).F). Six of nine donors displayed increases in HIV-1 RNA in the supernatant when their cells were treated with bryostatin compared to with DMSO (median number [range] of copies with DMSO, 0 [0 to 2,224] copies; bryostatin, 8,803 [0 to 167,106] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.02). PMA/I significantly enabled the detection of HIV-1 RNA in the supernatant (median, 38,871 [93.4 to 562,462] copies; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and was the only condition to stimulate the release of supernatant HIV-1 RNA for every donor. In conclusion, HDACi that were able to significantly increase the levels of US RNA but not MS RNA were similarly unable to induce significant increases in supernatant HIV-1 RNA, demonstrating an inability to completely reverse HIV-1 latency. Although PMA/I is used as a positive control and is not clinically viable, it significantly increased both intracellular species of HIV-1 RNA in this ex vivo model and HIV-1 RNA measured in the supernatant, demonstrating successful latency reversal.HIV-specific CD8+ T cell clones do not recognize antigen in HDACi-reactivated autologous CD4+ T cells in vitro. We next determined whether these LRAs could drive antigen presentation using CD8+ T cell clones as biosensors with an HIV-1 latency model (40, 67). CD8+ T cell responses were mapped using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay, and select responses were isolated as Gag- and Nef-specific CD8+ T cell clones (epitopes IRLRPGGKK [IK9] and RMRRAEPAA [RA9], respectively) using a gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b1) capture assay, followed by limiting dilution. Clones were checked for specificity by pulsing them with their cognate peptide in the presence of CD107a antibody, which is a marker for degranulation when CD8+ T cells contact their cognate peptide, as measured by flow cytometry. On the day of the biosensor assay, the Gag clone was confirmed to respond specifically to the peptide IK9 (89.2% CD107a+) (Fig. 3F, top panels) and the Nef clone to the peptide RA9 (84.9% CD107a+) (Fig. 3F, bottom panels), indicating that both were ready for use. A cultured central memory latency model was generated as previously described (schematic in Fig. 3A) (67, 68), using primary CD4+ T cells from the same donor from which the clones were derived (see Materials and Methods). Prior to LRA stimulation, ARV-treated superinfected and nonsuperinfected (mock) cells were positively selected for CD4 expression to remove residual productively infected cells expressing Gag and downregulating CD4 (Fig. 3B) This population of latently infected CD4+ T cells was treated with either DMSO, nanatinostat, romidepsin, bryostatin, or PMA/I for 24\u2009h and then washed, and at 48\u2009h, it was washed 3 more times to remove residual LRAs. These target cells were then cocultured with either the Gag- or the Nef-specific CD8+ T cell clone in the presence of CD107a antibody.Open in a separate windowFIG 3Gag- and Nef-specific CD8+ T cell clones do not recognize CD4+ T cells treated with nanatinostat in a biosensor assay using a model of HIV-1 latency. (A) Schematic of the previously described HIV-1 latency model used as target cells throughout this figure (67, 68). (B) Cultures were depleted of downregulating CD4+ T cells. (C and D) Cells were then reactivated with the indicated LRAs in the continued presence of ARVs for 48\u2009h prior to an 8-h coculture with either Gag- or Nef-specific CD8+ T cells clones (IK9 or RA9, respectively). Latency reversal was assessed by measuring the percentages of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag (C) and supernatant RNA (D), represented as FCs from values with DMSO. (E) Changes in the proportions of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag once cells were exposed to CD8+ T cell clones were assessed. (F) A CD8+ T cell clone specificity check was performed with cognate peptide. The flow cytometry results show that this clone potently degranulates in response to its peptide. (G) A representative example of the Gag-IK9-specific CD8+ T cell clones expressing antigen and undergoing degranulation in response to CD4+ T cells in which HIV-1 latency had been sufficiently reversed is displayed in the top panel, with mock-superinfected cells displayed in the bottom panel. (H and I) To assess antigen presentation, we measured the percentages of Gag-specific CD8+ T cell clones expressing CD107a (H), as well as the Nef-specific clones (I). (C to E) Paired t tests were used to compare the value with each LRA to that with DMSO (C, D) or the value for the CD8+ T cell clone to that with no clone (E). (H and I) Multiple t tests were performed using the Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons to assess differences between JRCSF-infected cells and mock-infected cells for each LRA. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.As a measure of latency reversal, Gag expression and supernatant HIV-1 RNA were quantified prior to the 48-h washout and addition of the CD8+ T cell clones (Fig. 3C and \u200bandD).D). Nanatinostat and romidepsin did not change the proportions of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag, as measured by flow cytometry, and did not increase cell-free HIV-1 RNA. Both bryostatin and PMA/I increased the proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.27; P\u2009<\u20090.001; and 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85; P\u2009=\u20090.005, respectively) and the level of supernatant HIV-1 RNA (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 1.78\u2009 \u00b1 0.18; P\u2009=\u20090.004; and 1.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23; P\u2009=\u20090.007, respectively), demonstrating latency reversal in this model. Changes in the proportions of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag were also assessed after coculture with the CD8+ T cell clones (Fig. 3E). Modest reductions were observed under conditions of treatment with DMSO, nanatinostat, and romidepsin with the Gag-specific clones but not the Nef-specific clone, consistent with killing of Gag-expressing cells by the former clone. Bryostatin and PMA/I, both of which induced significant Gag expression in this model, enabled the detection of more dramatic reductions in the proportions of cells expressing Gag by the Gag-specific clone (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; P\u2009=\u20090.001; and 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02; P\u2009=\u20090.004, respectively). CD107a is a marker for degranulation and is used as the readout of antigen recognition in this biosensor assay. In a representative example, we demonstrate degranulation by the Gag-specific CD8+ T cell clone under conditions where reactivated CD4+ T cells expressed antigen (Fig. 3G). Only bryostatin and PMA/I drove degranulation (0.4% and 8.48%, respectively), with neither HDACi inducing detectable degranulation. Despite an extensive washout, downregulation of the CD8+ receptor was observed for the bryostatin and PMA/I conditions, indicating activation in the presence of residual drug. However, this did not directly drive degranulation, given that nonsuperinfected CD4+ T cells also demonstrated this activation but did not show increased frequencies of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3G, lower panel). To assess degranulation, statistical comparisons were made between JRCSF-superinfected and nonsuperinfected (mock-infected) CD4+ T cells for each LRA condition. To control for possible nonspecific degranulation by direct effects of LRAs on CD8+ T cells, comparisons were made between superinfected and nonsuperinfected (background) target cells. For the Gag-specific clone, there was no significant difference in degranulation between superinfected and nonsuperinfected CD4+ T cells treated with DMSO, nanatinostat, or romidepsin, demonstrating that these LRA conditions did not sufficiently reverse latency to enable detectable antigen presentation of this epitope (mean difference \u00b1 standard error [SE] and adjusted P values with DMSO, 0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03; P\u2009=\u20090.12; with nanatinostat, 0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; P\u2009=\u20090.12; with RMD, 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02; P\u2009=\u20090.11) (Fig. 3H). CD4+ T cells treated with bryostatin or PMA/I significantly enabled degranulation of the Gag-specific clone, indicating that these LRAs reversed latency to the point of antigen presentation in this model (bryostatin, 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05; P\u2009=\u20090.005; PMA/I, 9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Fig. 3H). Results were similar for the Nef-specific clone in that nanatinostat and romidepsin treatment displayed no differences between JRCSF-infected and nonsuperinfected CD4+ T cells in the degranulation of the CD8+ T cell clones (nanatinostat, 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15; P\u2009=\u20090.12; RMD, 0.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13; P\u2009=\u20090.10) (Fig. 3I). Bryostatin-treated CD4+ T cells most potently enabled Nef-specific CD8+ T cell degranulation (5.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31; P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and PMA/I treatment also significantly drove degranulation of this clone (2.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23; P\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these data indicate that, in this model of HIV-1 latency, bryostatin and PMA/I enabled antigen presentation to CD8+ T cell clones against two different HIV-1 products, Gag and Nef, while the HDACi romidepsin and nanatinostat did not. This pattern of antigen expression also corresponded with the induction of detectable supernatant HIV-1 RNA, which was observed only for bryostatin and PMA/I. These results support the idea that LRAs which enable the release of cell-free HIV-1 RNA render CD4+ T cells recognizable by HIV-specific T cells in this in vitro assay.Nanatinostat exhibits less toxicity and functional impairment of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells than romidepsin in vitro. We and others have previously observed that HDACi can impair CD8+ T cell function against HIV-1 (41) and HTLV-1 (42), although this consideration may change depending on the specific HDACi tested and which classes of HDACs are targeted. For example, vorinostat has little impact on CD8+ T cell function at physiological doses (44). To assess any potential impacts of nanatinostat on CD8+ T cell function, we performed a series of viral inhibition assays. The IL-15 superagonist N-803 (400\u2009ng/ml, previously called ALT-803) was selected as a positive control, given that we have previously demonstrated its ability to enhance HIV-specific T cell function in vitro (41). As is represented in Fig. 4A, CD4+ T cells were superinfected with HIV-1 JRCSF and then cocultured with autologous bulk CD8+ T cells. Supernatants were collected on day 3 and day 7 postcoculture to measure viral inhibition by a reduction in detectable supernatant p24 compared to that of the culture with CD4+ T cells alone. Cells were also harvested on day 7 to measure changes in the percentages of cells expressing Gag across the various conditions. The negative control, DMSO, represents the individual\u2019s antiviral response from their unperturbed population of bulk CD8+ T cells, as measured by a reduction in HIV-1 Gag-expressing CD4+ T cells that have been superinfected relative to the level in the no-CD8+ T cell control condition. To investigate the effect of LRAs on CD8+ T cell function, we measured the frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag after 7\u2009days, as well as the proportions of CD8+ T cells that remained viable. Initially, when CD8+ T cells were cultured for the 24-h period with LRA prior to coculture with CD4+ T cells, we used the MTS assay to assess cell toxicity and proliferation and demonstrated that CD8+ T cells were not significantly affected by HDACi or N-803 relative to effects of DMSO at this time point (Fig. 4B).Open in a separate windowFIG 4Nanatinostat moderately impaired the abilities of CD8+ T cells to suppress viral replication, while romidepsin abrogated this activity under the conditions tested. (A) Schematic of viral inhibition assay. (B) LRA-treated CD8+ T cells were assessed for metabolic activity by the MTS assay and then cocultured with JRCSF-superinfected CD4s at an effector/target ratio of 4:1.

(F) Summary data depicting fold changes in frequencies of Gag+ CD4+ T cells on day 7. (G and H) Supernatant p24 levels were measured on day 3 (G) and day 7 (H) as a readout for viral replication. Each dot represents a different study participant, and FCs are expressed relative to the no-CD8 condition. (I to M) Shown are pairwise comparisons between nanatinostat and romidepsin (I to K) or between DMSO and N803 (L and M). The comparisons in panels I and L are derived from the data shown in panel D, the comparisons in panels J and M are from the data in panel C, and the comparisons in panels K and N are from the data in panel F. Experiments of 5 donors were performed in duplicate; donor results are graphed as means and standard deviations. Paired t tests were used to compare drug conditions to the condition with the DMSO control (A to C) or no-effector control (E to G). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.CD8+ T cells treated with either HDACi declined by day 7 of the culture period, whereas N-803 had no effect on the CD8+ T cells remaining in culture (Fig. 4C). Additionally, there were more CD4+ T cells remaining in culture after 7\u2009days for CD8+ T cells initially treated with nanatinostat and romidepsin than in cells treated with N-803 (Fig. 4D). A representative experiment (Fig. 4E) demonstrates the ability of LRA- or DMSO-treated CD8+ T cells to reduce the percentage of Gag-expressing CD4+ T cells at the end of the culture period, compared to the condition receiving no CD8+ effectors. Overall, DMSO-treated (control) CD8+ T cells enabled an average 63% reduction (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25; P\u2009=\u20090.02) in the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing Gag, while N-803-treated CD8+ T cells drove a greater reduction of 86% (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28; P\u2009=\u20090.03) (Fig. 4F). Nanatinostat-treated CD8+ T cells also significantly reduced the percentages of HIV-infected (Gag+) cells compared to the percentages with no effectors (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12; P\u2009=\u20090.02), however, only by an average of 37%, which was significantly less than the percentage in DMSO-treated CD8+ T cells (mean FC \u00b1 SD; 1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4; P\u2009=\u20090.04) (Fig. 4F). Romidepsin-treated CD8+ T cells did not measurably inhibit viral replication in these assays (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12; P\u2009=\u20090.38), and this was also significantly different from viral replication in the population of control CD8+ T cells (mean difference \u00b1 SD, 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7; P\u2009=\u20090.04) (Fig. 4F). N-803 significantly enhanced the abilities of CD8+ T cells to reduce levels of supernatant p24 on day 3 (mean FC \u00b1 SD, 0.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11; P\u2009=\u20090.007) (Fig. 4G). Thus, both HDACi tested impaired the abilities of CD8+ T cells to suppress viral replication, while N-803 enhanced this activity.When comparing nanatinostat to romidepsin at their tested doses, we observed more killing of CD4+ T cells with less toxicity to CD8+ T cells following coculture with the former (Fig. 4I and \u200bandJ).J). Nanatinostat treatment was also associated with greater CD8+ T cell-mediated reductions in the proportions of HIV-infected cells than romidepsin (32% less; 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 mean difference; P\u2009=\u20090.04) (Fig. 4K). We also directly compared N-803-treated CD8+ T cells to untreated (DMSO) cells and found that while both conditions did not significantly differ in proportions of CD4+ T cells versus CD8+ T cells remaining in culture (Fig. 4L and \u200bandM),M), N-803-treated CD8+ T cells exhibited significantly greater suppression of HIV replication (percentages of Gag+ cells at day 7) than untreated (DMSO) CD8+ T cells (mean, 70% less; mean difference\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41; P\u2009=\u20090.009) (Fig. 4N). Thus, whereas both HDACi tested in this study impaired CD8+ T cell function, this effect was observed to be substantially less for nanatinostat at concentrations where both agents exhibited similar effects on HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 2). DISCUSSIONOur results support that, while class I-selective HDACi act as a transcriptional \u201con switches\u201d for latent HIV-1, they do not facilitate the production of viral antigens or particles from primary CD4+ T cells, partially due to a lack of sufficient accumulation of spliced viral transcripts. The complexity of the HIV-1 proviral genome, with gene products encoded within overlapping exonic regions, multiple open reading frames, and nine major genes with distinct functions, which are compressed into a 10-kb genome, may require more than transcriptional initiation to achieve antigen presentation during latency reversal (3, 27, 64, 69). Cotranscriptional HIV-1 RNA splicing is tightly coordinated and important early during viral replication (27, 64, 70) (Fig. 5B). MS RNAs encode the regulatory proteins Tat, Rev, and Nef, which are required for successful viral replication. Tat is particularly important in driving robust viral transcription and elongation and coordinating viral splicing (71), and the absence of Tat is more essential than the cellular environment in maintaining viral latency (72). Unspliced transcripts contain secondary structures termed the Rev response element (RRE), which retain HIV-1 RNAs in the nucleus. Rev is required to export RRE-containing viral transcripts, including env and the unspliced genome, to the cytoplasm for translation or packaging (69, 73, 74). During latency reversal, when HDACi do not provoke a significant accumulation of tat and rev RNA or their encoded proteins, it is unlikely that this condition results in the production of virions, as evidenced here by a lack of supernatant HIV-1 RNA after HDACi treatment compared to after bryostatin and PMA/I treatment, which enabled the release of viral RNA (75) (Fig. 5B).Open in a separate windowFIG 5Latency reversal. (A) During HIV-1 latency and its reversal, we propose that when a series of blocks that maintain latency are overcome, the \u201ckick\u201d of \u201ckick and kill\u201d may be sufficient to stimulate antigen presentation and/or viral cytopathic affects, as was achieved by treatment with bryostatin and PMA/I in this study. Transcriptional initiation and RNA elongation. When the LTR of an integrated provirus is bound by HDACs, the first step in enabling the induction of transcription is through the removal of these HDACs with host histone acetyl (Ac) transferases or through treatment with HDACi. This alters the chromatin architecture so that transcription factors, i.e., NF-\u00eaB, can interact with the NF-\u00eaB binding sites within the HIV-1 LTR to drive transcriptional initiation. Transcription proceeds with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to transcribe through the trans-activation response element (TAR) region of LTR RNA. Elongation can pause here, with the TAR RNA and RNA Pol II associated with negative elongation factors. With Tat translation and its recruitment of P-TEFb to the TAR RNA, elongation may proceed. (B) Viral splicing and nuclear export. (B1) Tat drives transcriptional initiation and elongation and also orchestrates viral splicing. Spliced transcripts are then processed into poly-adenylated mRNA (B2) and exported to the cytoplasm to translate HIV-1 regulatory proteins, including Tat and Rev (B3). Both localize back into the nucleus, where Tat continues to drive transcription, elongation, and splicing, and once a threshold of Rev is achieved, a switch into late viral replication induces the accumulation of singly spliced and unspliced transcripts to create accessory and structural proteins (B4). Singly spliced and unspliced viral transcripts contain the RRE, restricting them to the nucleus. Rev binds the RRE to facilitate export of the transcripts into the cytoplasm (B4). Virus production and antigen presentation. Once the late viral gene products are expressed (B5), viral particles are created and will bud from the cell (B6). Cells may die via viral cytotoxicity. As viral proteins are expressed, some will be cleaved to be processed as antigen and complex with MHC I molecules, which will be transported to the cell membrane (B7). HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells can recognize their cognate antigen, stimulating degranulation and targeted death of the infected CD4+ T cell. Proposed model of latency reversal with HDACi. In this study, HDACi induce transcription in all donors. Some donors modestly accumulate spliced transcripts, although this does not occur for every donor, nor does it reach statistical significance compared to results with DMSO. HDACi do not drive the release of viral RNA into ex vivo cultures, and treated CD4+ T cells do not significantly induce degranulation of CD8+ T cell clones. Additionally, HDACi display toxicity to CD8+ T cells (B8), which impairs their function in vitro. We propose that while HDACi clearly initiate viral transcription, they do not consistently remove all blocks to viral latency required for clinical potency. Defective proviral genomes, for example, that encode Gag but lack a sequence containing the RRE may be transcribed and transported to the cytoplasm without blocks that require Rev and can be translated, processed as antigen, and recognized by CD8+ T cells (B9). We predict that defective genomes may be easier to reverse from latency with fewer blocks to overcome. We further predict that latently infected cells otherwise experience a burst of transcriptional initiation from the viral LTR, which eventually goes back into a latent state.Although changes to MS HIV-1 RNA after HDACi treatment did not reach statistical significance, some donors were able to increase the levels of MS RNA after HDACi treatment, yet this did not result in detectable supernatant HIV-1 RNA. This may be due to further blocks to latency that were not overcome, including the nuclear retention of spliced viral RNAs (76, 77), issues with 3\u2032 processing and polyadenylation (3), or the lack of cellular factors required for the nuclear export and translation of Tat and Rev, which are required to drive virion production. Alternatively, should Tat become expressed during latency reversal, long noncoding RNAs present in mCD4+ T cells may selectively promote the degradation of Tat protein (78). Tat posttranslational modifications driven by the acetylation of lysine residues by HDACi may additionally alter the behavior of Tat in its replication feedback loop, also affecting the ability to form virions (71). The capacity to reverse latency will also depend on the environment of the host cell. Recent evidence suggests differential activities of LRAs in their ability to reactivate latency based on the cellular subset (79, 80). Distinct changes to the activation state of host factors associated with viral replication, i.e., histone acetylation, NF-\u03baB, and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), differ based on LRA stimulation and the cell subset treated (80). While this paper investigates total CD4+ T cells, it will be interesting in the future to investigate the effects of these LRAs on the induction of spliced versus unspliced transcripts across various T cell subsets or across different tissues (81). In donors where MS HIV-1 RNA failed to accumulate while US HIV-1 RNA increased after HDACi treatment, this may have been due to the recently described emerging role of HDACs and histone modifications in splicing (82). HDACs together with serine-arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSF), involved in the maintenance of viral latency and viral splicing, respectively, coordinate the interface between chromatin organization and cotranscriptional alternative splicing (83, 84). The kinetic coupling of HDACs and SRSF proteins in regulating splicing can be disrupted by the addition of an HDACi. HDAC1, which is associated with maintaining latency of the viral LTR, is demonstrated to regulate splicing in its deacetylated state, where the addition of an HDACi can inhibit splicing (32). SRSF proteins undergo proteasomal degradation if acetylated within their RNA recognition motif, which may be affected by the addition of an HDACi (85). While these two potential mechanisms may play a role in the ex vivo experiments carried out in this study, the environment of the cell subset undergoing latency reversal may affect the behavior of the HDACi with host cellular factors (86).Our results identify a key discrepancy between the J-Lat cell line and primary CD4+ T cells, where the products of multiply spliced HIV-1 transcripts were expressed in the former. The reporter gfp replaces nef in the proviral sequence harbored within J-Lat cells; GFP expression is therefore encoded by a multiply spliced viral RNA. While our results with primary CD4+ T cells indicate inhibition of viral RNA splicing by HDACi, the activation of GFP expression in J-Lat cells by both romidepsin and nanatinostat demonstrates that appreciable splicing occurred in this context. We interpret this discrepancy as arising from the multitude of host factor differences between primary CD4+ T cells and transformed cell lines. Jurkat T cells, the parental cell line of J-Lat cells, are tetraploid, with thousands of identified deletions, insertions, inversions, and chromosomal translocations, promoting an extensive deviation from normal T cell biology (87). Other researchers have demonstrated differences in alternative splicing between primary cells and their representative model immortalized cell lines (88,\u201390). Marked discrepancies in HIV-1 transcriptional profiles, T cell phenotypic markers, and antiviral restriction factors were recently reported between latently infected HIV-1 cell lines and infected primary T cells (4). Thus, in the current study, J-Lat cells served the role of an initial check for the activities of our LRAs, with the understanding that the activity in these immortalized cells would not closely mimic the biology that occurs during latency reversal of primary CD4+ T cells.A key feature of our study was the use of an HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell clone biosensor assay to elucidate whether HDACi-induced transcriptional initiation from the LTR was sufficient to drive antigen presentation (41, 67). T cells are exquisitely sensitive and specific and can form an immunological synapse with a target cell presenting as few as 10 MHC-peptide complexes on the cell surface (40, 67, 91). We hypothesized that if the observed HDACi-induced increases in US RNA were enough to drive antigen presentation, even without enabling splicing and the expression of MS proteins, the HDACi would drive degranulation of the Gag-specific clone (as Gag is expressed by an US transcript), but not the Nef-specific clone (Nef is expressed by a MS transcript). However, we observed that neither HDACi triggered the degranulation of either CD8+ T cell clone, while degranulation was observed with bryostatin and PMA/I. These data are consistent with a requirement for regulatory gene products expressed from MS transcripts to achieve antigen expression and subsequent presentation to HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, i.e., the nuclear export of US RNA by Rev. Thus, in these experiments, CD8+ T cell recognition of reactivated cells occurred in agreement with the release of cell-free HIV-1 RNA as achieved by bryostatin and PMA/I. In contrast, HDACi treatment, which did not enable detectable cell-free HIV-1 RNA, was not associated with CD4+ T cell recognition by these clones.Given that our biosensor assay uses an intact laboratory strain virus, the inability for HDACi to enable antigen presentation in this study is based on a replication-competent genome that has entered latency. However, 98% of viral reservoirs in individuals on ART are typically comprised of defective proviruses that contain APOBEC3G-induced hypermutations, internal deletions, or frameshift nonsense mutations obtained during recombination or error-prone reverse transcription, respectively, as well as sequences containing mutations in splice donor and acceptor sites (92,\u201394). Large internal deletions can encompass the tat and rev open reading frames, including within the env sequence (92), which may make the nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA possible in the absence of Rev. Defective genomes are also capable of transcription and translation and can be targeted by CD8+ T cells (94). Intact replication-competent proviral genomes are hardwired to achieve successful viral replication but depend on a well-defined set of cellular factors that remain scarce or inactivated in latently infected CD4+ T cells (72). In the deepest state of HIV-1 latency, a completely transcriptionally quiescent intact provirus may be the most difficult to reactivate, as studies have demonstrated that multiple rounds of strong T cell stimulation may be required to reverse latency of certain replication-competent genomes (95). Defective genomes may be easier to reactivate depending on what region of the genome is deleted or mutated, with fewer potential hurdles to overcome (96) (Fig. 5). In an LRA-induced HIV eradication assay, we recently demonstrated resistance to killing of CD4+ T cells harboring replication-competent intact genomes, whereas defective proviral genomes were more readily reactivated and killed by CD8+ T cells (97). This might be attributed to the inability of a durably quiescent intact genome to be reactivated with a single round of LRA stimulation compared to that of a defective provirus with fewer blocks during reactivation, particularly deletions that remove the RRE from the genome (96). Additionally, antigen presentation may be affected by the action of the LRA. Unspliced host RNAs that encode the proteolytic machinery that influence antigen processing and presentation are retained in the nuclei of unactivated CD4+ T cells, and T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent or -independent pathways can release these RNAs, changing the cytosolic compositions of certain HIV-1 epitopes, altering the MHC HIV-1 peptidome (98). This might affect what peptides are presented and thus recognized by CD8+ T cells in this study.In comparing our results to those of clinical studies, we note that S\u00f8gaard et al. (16) observed modest increases in viral load with in vivo romidepsin treatment, suggesting full reversal of latency. However, they also observed transient yet statistically significant increases in early and late activation markers in all CD4+ T cell subsets (16). Without further validation, it remains difficult to differentiate whether the reported virus production was driven by the targeted mechanism of chromatin remodeling or whether it was an outcome of cell activation. Other in vivo studies have not assessed the activation status of CD4+ T cells after HDACi treatment or demonstrated significant increases in plasma viral load (11,\u201316). Thus, our ex vivo assessment of unspliced and spliced viral RNAs builds on the growing literature that includes spliced RNAs as a measurement for latency reversal (4, 39, 65, 81). Further mechanistic research is warranted to define the role of splicing during latency reversal and how it pertains to antigen presentation and recognition by HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.While studying the action of HDACi in latency reversal, it is also important to elucidate their effects on CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity (reviewed in reference 48). Romidepsin has been implicated in delayed impairment of CD8+ T cell function ex vivo (44), and we have previously demonstrated that romidepsin can reduce the viability, IFN-\u03b1 production, and proliferation of CD8+ T cells, while impairing the ability of CTL clones to kill infected target CD4+ T cells (41). Studies that have subsequently assessed the impact of romidepsin in vivo on HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in clinical trials have yielded mixed results. S\u00f8gaard et al. reported a lack of statistically significant impairment in HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses (16), whereas Mothe and colleagues observed a transient, but significant, 35% decrease in the magnitudes of HIV-1-specific T cell responses (IFN-\u03b1) after romidepsin treatment (B. Mothe et al., presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections 2017, Seattle, WA; abstract 450, reviewed in reference 48). An important limitation that we perceive in the former study was that the sample size tested (n\u2009=\u20095) is unable to yield a significant result with the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test that was used (this particular statistical test requires a minimum sample size of 6 to calculate a P value of\u2009<0.05) (99). Thus, we consider the question of whether or not romidepsin impairs HIV-1-specific T cells in vivo to be unresolved. While this paper builds upon our previous work by using primary ex vivo CD8+ T cells rather than CTL clones, we acknowledge limitations of in vitro assays with regard to the complex in vivo interactions that take place amid the diversity of cell types within peripheral blood versus tissue microenvironments, where reservoir cells and HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells reside. However, our results highlight the ongoing importance of assessing a variety of readouts throughout the process of latency reversal in vitro and in vivo.Though the role of the IL-15 superagonist N-803 in the current study is primarily to serve as a positive control, our data provide further evidence that it directly enhances the antiviral activity of ex vivo HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. N-803 has also been shown to exhibit LRA activity in vitro (40) and in vivo in CD8-depleted rhesus macaques (100) as well as to drive trafficking of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood into the B cell follicles within lymph nodes (101), an important anatomical viral reservoir (102). Investigators have also demonstrated that N-803 can reduce SIV loads in monkeys without ART, likely by enhancing CD8+ T cell and/or NK cell function (101, 103). Thus, our study adds to the body of evidence supporting the prioritization of N-803 for in vivo studies related to an HIV-1 cure. It would also be of interest, in future studies, to test combinations of nanatinostat and N-803, both for potential synergy as LRAs and to determine the net effect on CD8+ T cell-mediated viral inhibition.Limitations of this study include using the quantification of viral RNA transcripts from bulk RNA samples. As with any such PCR assay, we cannot distinguish between a single RNA being reactivated from multiple proviruses versus many RNA transcripts being reactivated from a single provirus. The amount of RNA induced per cell may also differ depending on the LRA used, which might affect the capacity to express antigen. Another limitation is the particular HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses of the individual used in our biosensor assay, restricting the variety of presented epitopes that we were able to study with our CD8+ T cell clones. Different LRAs may also modify the repertoire of epitopes presented (98). Finally, the lower limit of sensitivity of our CD8+ T cell biosensor assay is unknown, and thus the lack of detectable degranulation should not be interpreted as an absolute lack of antigen expression but rather the lack of detection above an unknown threshold. That being said, there are lines of evidence supporting the idea that this is a highly sensitive way of measuring antigen expression: (i) as mentioned above, T cells can form an immunological synapse with a target cell presenting as few as 10 MHC-peptide complexes on the cell surface (40, 67, 91) and (ii) the numbers of CTL clone cells that can degranulate is proportional to the number of target cells that express antigen, given that this is driven by direct effector-target cell interactions. Thus, the observation that \u223c10% of CTL clones degranulate following coculture with target cells, where only \u223c0.25% of cells have detectable Gag expression by flow cytometry, is consistent with a high degree of sensitivity. Furthermore, this assay is unique in that the threshold of detection of latency reversal is directly relevant to the desired outcome of kick and kill eradication strategies, as both depend upon triggering CTLs to degranulate.This study thus provides insights that are relevant both to the interpretation of outcomes of kick and kill clinical trials that have been conducted to date and to the design of future studies. We postulate that limitations in accumulating spliced HIV-1 RNA and their encoded regulatory proteins preclude the nuclear export of RRE-containing US RNA, at least for intact genomes, reducing antigen processing and presentation in HDACi-treated CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5). Our results also highlight the importance of considering putative LRAs from the perspective of immune effectors, both in terms of their abilities to induce bona fide antigen expression and in terms of their potential to either impair or enhance immune cell function. Potential approaches that may leverage the ability of class I-selective HDACi to initiate transcription, while addressing the limitations identified here, include (i) the targeted delivery of these agents to the exterior of CD4+ T cells or in a triggered release manner (104), thus avoiding impairment of CD8+ T cells as well as other potential off-target effects, and (ii) combinations with putative agents which may enhance viral splicing or enhance CD8+ T cell function, such as N-803, or other immunotherapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODSEthics statement. Study participants (HIV-infected individuals) were recruited from the Maple Leaf Medical Clinic in Toronto, Canada, through a protocol approved by the University of Toronto Institutional Review Board or through Whitman Walker Health in Washington, DC, through a protocol approved by the George Washington University Institutional Review Board. Secondary use of these study participants was approved through the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Boards. All subjects were adults and gave written informed consent. Clinical data for these participants are given in Table 1.J-Lat 10.6 experiments. J-Lat 10.6 cells were seeded at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells per well in a 96-well plate and with a 2-fold serial dilution of nanatinostat (1,000\u2009nM to 62.5\u2009nM) or with PMA-ionomycin (10\u2009nM-0.5\u2009\u03bcM) as the positive control or DMSO as the negative control, given that all drugs were dissolved in DMSO. DMSO was added at 0.001%, the highest compound concentration used for the LRAs. Three experiments were performed in duplicate. A concentration of 100\u2009nM was chosen based on this titration to move forward with remaining experiments. J-Lat 10.6 cells were seeded as in previous experiments and treated in duplicate with nanatinostat (100\u2009nM; Viracta), romidepsin (40\u2009nM; Selleck Chemicals), bryostatin (10\u2009nM; Sigma-Aldrich), PMA-ionomycin (10\u2009nM-500\u2009nM; Sigma-Aldrich), or DMSO. Cells were harvested at 24\u2009h and analyzed for changes in GFP expression by flow cytometry.MTS viability assay. To assess cellular viability following treatment with nanatinostat, total CD4+ T cells were negatively selected from PBMCs using the EasySep human CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies), cultured in duplicate at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well in a 96-well plate, and either treated with a 2-fold titration of nanatinostat (1,000\u2009nM to 62.5\u2009nM), left untreated, treated with PMA-ionomycin (10\u2009nM-500\u2009nM) as the positive control, or treated with DMSO as the negative control. Drugs were washed at 24\u2009h and cells were harvested at 72\u2009h for the MTS assay, which was performed as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Abcam). Additional MTS assays were performed with CD4+ T cells from individuals living with HIV and with the entire LRA panel, including nanatinostat (100\u2009nM; Viracta), romidepsin (40\u2009nM; Selleck Chemicals), bryostatin (10\u2009nM; Sigma-Aldrich), PMA-ionomycin (10\u2009nM-500\u2009nM; Sigma-Aldrich), or DMSO, in the presence of ARVs.Ex vivo studies of CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals on ART. PBMCs were collected by leukapheresis from HIV-1-infected individuals on ART. Total CD4+ T cells were negatively selected from PBMCs using the EasySep human CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were cultured at 5 million cells per well in a 24-well plate in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, 10 U/ml IL-2, 1\u2009\u03bcM tenofovir, 1\u2009\u03bcM nevirapine, 1\u2009\u03bcM emtricitabine, and 10\u2009\u03bcM T20. Cells were treated with nanatinostat (100\u2009nM; Viracta), romidepsin (40\u2009nM), bryostatin (10\u2009nM), PMA-ionomycin (10\u2009nM-0.5\u2009\u03bcM) as the positive control, or DMSO as the negative control. Drugs were washed out at 24\u2009h, ARV medium was replenished, and cells were harvested at 72\u2009h for flow cytometry or stored in TRIzol (Life Technologies) for RNA extraction. Cells were stained with Aqua LIVE/DEAD viability dye (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and anti-CD3, -CD4, -HLA-abc, and -CD69 antibodies (BioLegend) and analyzed by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA for each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (RT; Life Technologies).Quantification of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA by ddPCR. Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed using primer/probe sets as previously validated for comparisons of MS and US HIV-1 RNAs (3, 105). We used the tat/rev assay from the work of Yukl et al. (3) to measure MS HIV RNA and chose a primer set to measure gag RNA that includes splice donor 1 to define an US HIV-1 RNA transcript. Five hundred nanograms of input cellular RNA per reaction mixture was mixed with ddPCR Supermix for probes (no dUTPs) (Bio-Rad) and the following primer/probe sets: forward primer 5\u2032-TCTCGACGCAGGACTCG-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-TACTGACGCTCTCGCACC-3\u2032, and probe FAM-CTCTCTCCTTCTAGCCTC-MGBNFQ (where FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein) for unspliced gag HIV-1 RNA and forward primer 5\u2032-CTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAA-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-GGATCTGTCTCTGTCTCTCTCTCCACC-3\u2032, and probe FAM-ACCCGACAGGCC-MGBNFQ for tat/rev HIV-1 RNA. Droplets were prepared using the Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sealed plates were cycled using the following program: 95\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s and 59\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 98\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, with a 2\u00b0C/s ramping speed. Reactions were analyzed in duplicate using the QX200 Droplet Reader, and numbers of RNA copies per nanogram of RNA were estimated using QuantaLife ddPCR software. No RT controls were used for the US RNA condition.Measuring supernatant HIV-1 RNA in ex vivo cultures. Viral RNA was extracted from 100\u2009\u03bcl of culture supernatant using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA was eluted in 60\u2009\u03bcl nuclease-free water and immediately analyzed by quantitative RT PCR (qRT-PCR). HIV-1 RNA copies were quantified using the AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR kit; reactions were prepared by mixing 8.5\u2009\u03bcl of extracted viral RNA with 0.4 \u03bcM primer iSCA-for (5\u2032-TTTGGAAAGGACCAGCAAA-3\u2032), 0.4 \u03bcM primer iSCA-rev (5\u2032-CCTGCCATCTGTTTTCCA-3\u2032), and 0.25 \u03bcM probe iSCA (5\u2032-FAM-AAAGGTGAAGGGGCAGTAGTAATACA-TAMRA-3\u2032, where TAMRA is 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) in a 25-\u03bcl final volume on ice. Samples were analyzed on an ABI Viia7 real-time PCR system using the following cycling parameters: 45\u00b0C for 10 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u2009s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Tenfold serial dilutions of an RNA standard and negative-control wells were included in each run.Biosensor assay. An IFN-\u03b1 ELISPOT assay was used to map HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses using 270 optimal peptides, and specific responses were cloned as previously described (41). Clones were checked for specificity by incubating them for 5\u2009h with their cognate peptide in the presence of CD107a antibody, a marker for degranulation. Meanwhile, a model for HIV-1 latency was used as previously described (67) as modified from reference 68. Briefly, naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from an individual living with HIV-1 on suppressive ART and expanded using anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-12 antibodies in the presence of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and anti-CD3 anti-CD28 Dynabeads. Cells were superinfected with JRCSF on day 7 or not superinfected. On day 13, cells were treated with ART, and 3 days later, productively infected downregulating CD4+ T cells were removed using a CD4+ selection kit (Thermo Fisher). Cells were treated with LRAs for 24\u2009h and then washed, ARVs were re-added, and cultures were maintained for 48\u2009h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The supernatant was collected to detect cell-free HIV-1 RNA, and cells were more extensively washed before coculture with the CD8+ T cell clones specific for Gag (IK9 epitope) or Nef (RA9) in four biological replicates in the presence of CD107a antibody for 8\u2009h. Recognition of target cells was observed by measuring live CD107a+ CD3+ CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry.Viral inhibition assay. To investigate the effects of HDACi on the function of CD8+ T cells, viral inhibition assays were performed as previously described, with modifications (106). Briefly, CD4+ T cells from individuals living with HIV-1 were isolated as described above, cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 30 U/ml IL-2, and treated with 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml each of anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; BioLegend) and anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2; BioLegend) for 48\u2009h. The following day, autologous CD8+ T cells were negatively selected using an EasySep human CD8+ T cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies) and treated with nanatinostat (100\u2009nM), romidepsin (40\u2009nM), N-803 (400\u2009ng/ml), or DMSO (0.001%) for 24\u2009h. On day 3, CD4+ T cells were infected with JRCSF at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 3\u2009h at 37\u00b0C, and the virus was washed well. CD8+ T cells were washed well before being cocultured in duplicate with autologous CD4+ T cells at an effector-to-target ratio of 4:1 in the absence of ARVs to allow for viral replication. The supernatant was harvested at days 3 and 7 postinfection for p24 ELISAs (NCI, Frederick, MD). Cells were harvested on day 7, stained with Aqua LIVE/DEAD viability dye (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and anti-CD3, -CD4, and -CD8 prior to cell permeabilization and intracellular staining with antibodies against HIV-1 Gag (KC57- RD1; Beckman Coulter), and analyzed by flow cytometry.Statistical methods. GraphPad PRISM version 7 software was used for statistical analyses. ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank the participants living with HIV-1 who have donated samples through leukapheresis.
