Rapidly establishing the diagnosis with a confirmatory biopsy is key to initiate lifesaving therapy.\n 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONGranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly termed Wegener's granulomatosis, is an antibody\u2010mediated vasculitis that mainly affects the upper respiratory tract, the lungs, and the kidneys, with an annual worldwide incidence of about 10\u201020 cases per million.\n1\n, \n2\n GPA can affect all organs; however, the number of affected organs is reported highly variable. According to the 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference,\n3\n GPA is a small\u2010to\u2010medium vessel necrotizing vasculitis leading to necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. While its onset is usually subacute, splenic involvement in GPA is reported in the literature, but life\u2010threatening nontraumatic splenic rupture is rarely documented as primary manifestation. Furthermore, GPA rarely causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without radiologic evidence of pulmonary bleeding and/or granulomatosis. Here, we report a case of GPA with nontraumatic splenic rupture as primary manifestation followed by ARDS lacking prominent disease\u2010specific findings on chest computed tomography (CT). 2.\u2003CASE HISTORYA 32\u2010year\u2010old, obese Caucasian (height 192\u00a0cm, weight 128\u00a0kg) with a past medical history of former intravenous drug abuse, moderate arterial hypertension, and minor ischemic stroke presented with diffuse myalgia of four weeks duration with profuse diaphoresis and weight loss of about five kilograms over two months. Initially suffering from odynophagia and myalgia for which he went to his family doctor and was started on amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for presumed pharyngitis plus prednisone for seven days. Ten days later, the patient developed suprapubic pain, dysuria, and alguria and was treated as an outpatient with ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection for seven days. Serological markers supporting an underlying viral infection with a compromised immune system returned negative for HIV, HCV, and HBV. Anti\u2010HBs was 283\u00a0IE/l, indicating an immunocompetent response to a previous vaccination.Persistent worsening myalgia and testicular pain finally lead to self\u2010admission of the patient to a rural emergency department. On clinical examination, the patient had no fever, was hemodynamically stable, normotensive, and normocardic. The only abnormal clinical features were bilateral diffuse testicular tenderness with pain, and a slightly swollen lower limb showing a positive Homan's sign. Initial laboratory studies were as follows: white blood cell count 12.6\u00a0G/l, 74% banded neutrophils, C\u2010reactive protein 119\u00a0mg/l, serum creatinine 56\u00a0\u03bcmol/l, and creatinine kinase 29\u00a0U/L. The patient was admitted to the medical ward. Urine analysis showed proteinuria (0.78\u00a0g/24\u00a0hours) with normal urine and serum protein electrophoresis. Blood and urine cultures returned negative. Ultrasound showed bilateral epididymitis with a predominantly right\u2010sided orchitis and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Further, ultrasonic examination showed a deep vein thrombosis of the right leg for which the patient was prescribed a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin. A cervico\u2010thoraco\u2010abdominal CT scan returned normal.Five days later, the patient complained about a painful left upper flank and a progressive hemoglobin decrease was noted. Abdominal contrast\u2010enhanced CT scan revealed splenic rupture with subcapsular hematoma of about 16x16 cm, haemoperitoneum, and signs of active arterial bleeding (Figure\u00a01). The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and radiological embolization of the main splenic artery was performed, while systemic anticoagulation was suspended. Over time, the respiratory status worsened with the patient requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation for hypoxic respiratory failure (Figure\u00a02). Follow\u2010up thoracic CT showed predominant left\u2010sided atelectasis, marginal pleural effusions without signs for pulmonary embolism, and no structural lung parenchymal abnormalities. Due to constant need for blood transfusions, progressive pulmonary deterioration\u2014most likely multifactorial in origin but aggravated by this abdominal mass effect caused by the splenic rupture with subsequent massive abdominal hemorrhaging, a splenectomy was performed. This had an immediate positive effect on mechanical ventilation, at least temporary. Histological analysis showed subcapsulary necrosis and hematoma with central acute focal inflammation of small to larger arteries in the proximity of focal splenic necrosis (Figure\u00a03). While waiting histological results, the patient developed severe ARDS requiring prone positioning to optimize oxygenation and muscular blocking agents in order to secure lung\u2010protective ventilation with permissive hypercapnia.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Abdominal contrast\u2010enhanced computed tomography (CT) showing splenic rupture,\u00a0subcapsular hematoma, and active arterial bleeding (red arrow).

With orchitis present as a prominent feature in this patient, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) was considered, but when biomarkers returned highly positive for PR\u20103 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), an ANCA\u2010associated vasculitides was favored, suggesting GPA (298.8\u00a0IU/mL). Methylprednisolone was prescribed at 5mg/kg. In the light of persistent severe hypoxemia, a contrast\u2010enhanced pulmonary CT scan was performed showing right lateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolism with discreet ground\u2010glass infiltration without nodules (Figure\u00a04A\u2010C). Therapeutic heparinisation was re\u2010introduced, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care academic center for evaluation of veno\u2010venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Figure\u00a02).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4(A) Pulmonary contrast\u2010enhanced computed tomography (CT) showing minimal\u00a0alterations of lung parenchyma and right\u2010sided small pleural effusion. A left chest\u00a0tube was placed during splenectomy with subcutaneous emphysema.

(C) Pulmonary contrast\u2010enhanced computed tomography (CT) showing discrete signs of\u00a0bilateral pulmonary infiltratesOn admission to the tertiary care center, the patient's oxygenation was severely compromised (P/F\u2010ratio 72 on 100% oxygen). Transesophageal echocardiography was unremarkable showing normal left and right ventricular dimensions and function with competent valves, no wall motion abnormalities and only a small patent foramen ovale, in summary not explaining this patients\u2019 severe hypoxemia (Video S1\u2010S3). Intensive supportive therapy including a lung\u2010protective ventilation strategy (Vt max. 6\u00a0mL/kg PBW, Pplat\u00a0<=\u00a030\u00a0cm\u00a0H2O) with permissive hypercapnia, regularly assessing individual pulmonary mechanics (measuring quasi\u2010static compliance and applying PEEP at highest Compliance (or adequate saturation)), proning, aggressive negative fluid balance, and emergency immunosuppressive therapy (pulse methylprednisolone 1\u00a0g) lead to partial stabilization with successful weaning of the supplemental O2 to 50% within 12\u00a0hours after admission to our ICU.An emergency veno\u2010venous ECMO therapy could therefore be avoided. Having averted the immediate life\u2010threatening problem, drug\u2010induced vasculitis (ie, cocaine) was considered, given the patient's history of former drug abuse. This was abandoned when repeat toxicological results came back negative. Urinalysis showed unspecific and moderate microscopic hematuria, of a presumed glomerular origin.On the subsequent day, emergency renal biopsy results confirmed necrotizing, pauci\u2010immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figure\u00a05). Total plasma exchange (TPE) was started followed by cyclophosphamide bolus (1g) iv with continued pulse methylprednisolone (1g per day for 3\u00a0days followed by 1mg/kg of body weight). Following immunosuppressive therapy, the patients\u2019 clinical evolution was rapidly favorable, and subsequent transfer to a community ICU for weaning from mechanical ventilation and treatment of intensive care unit acquired weakness was performed.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Renal histology showing pauci\u2010immune glomerulonephritis with partial (focal) necrosis (hematoxylin/eosin) 3.\u2003DISCUSSIONSplenic involvement in GPA is rare and reported in only few patients.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Nevertheless, autopsy studies show a high percentage of splenic lesions suggesting frequent asymptomatic splenic involvement.\n7\n A recent report suggests that splenic lesions, that is, mainly vascular infarctions, are common in ANCA\u2010associated vasculitis (AAV), particularly in GPA,\n8\n and may not always be visible on contrast\u2010enhanced abdominal CT scans.\n8\n, \n9\n Splenic rupture is rarely described as a life\u2010threatening condition, especially in the early stages of GPA. In the case presented here, splenic involvement was recognized early and finally pointed to the diagnosis of severe GPA (PR\u20103 ANCA titers). Interestingly, the reported unspecific symptoms including presumed uro\u2010genital tract infection and deep vein thrombosis were likely unspecific but presumably associated presentations of GPA. Anticoagulation might have supported intrasplenic bleeding in the presence of vasculitis. Thus, indication and anticoagulation management should trigger caution in severe GPA.Alveolar hemorrhage is a common feature in severe GPA which may require ECMO\n10\n treatment in selected cases. However, the progression and the severity of pulmonary symptoms in our patient with oxygen\u2010refractory respiratory failure leading to severe ARDS without distinct (ie, disease\u2010specific) radiological findings were unusual. Chest CT patterns of lung parenchymal lesions related to arteritis typically include (besides alveolar bleeding) ground\u2010glass opacities, reticular shadowing, interlobular septal thickening, consolidation/ granulomatosis, and honeycomb appearance. In severe GPA, the previously described consistency rate between radiological and lung histological findings on GPA patients was previously determined as 100%.\n11\n Pulmonary nodules and masses are the most common radiologic findings in GPA and are seen in up to 70% of patients either at presentation or during the course of the disease.\n12\n Diffuse ground\u2010glass opacity and consolidation are noted in up to 50% of patients with GPA.\n13\n In the case presented here, despite severe hypoxemic respiratory failure fulfilling the BERLIN criteria for ARDS,\n14\n disease\u2010specific radiological findings were lacking on repeat CT scans.We thus conclude that even in the absence of disease\u2010specific radiological signs of GPA, severe intrapulmonary GPA, likely induced by small\u2010 to medium\u2010sized vasculitis may be present. This seems of prognostical importance and should institute guideline\u2010based treatment including focused immunosuppressive therapy.
