Limiting factors for efficient\nAP-MS studies are the general low abundance of these proteins and\nthe technical difficulties associated with the purification of TFs\nfrom mammalian cells.7 As the elucidation\nof the function of TFs is highly relevant to human diseases, a more\ndetailed understanding of the biological role of TFs is required.TFs have often been found to operate in large, dynamic multiprotein\ncomplexes involved in several different cellular processes.8 TFs have also been shown to associate with different\ninteractors that can modulate transcriptional output.9 In addition, mutations affecting the protein interaction\nprofile of specific TFs result in aberrant phenotypes as previously\nreported for the protein C/EBPalpha.10In the hematopoietic system, the TF C/EBPalpha is a master regulator\nof the myeloid compartment, and the role of this protein is specifically\nrequired for functional neutrophilic differentiation.11 Deletion of the C/EBPalpha gene results\nin the complete absence of mature granulocytes.12 In addition, mutations in the C/EBPalpha protein have been\nidentified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).11 Thus, changes in C/EBPalpha function are closely\nlinked to leukemogenesis.13 It has been\nproposed that the functions of C/EBPalpha are dependent on the formation\nof different protein complexes to promote cell cycle arrest and terminal\ndifferentiation.14\u221216 A global and comprehensive characterization of the\nTF C/EBPalpha-containing protein complexes is therefore critical in\nunderstanding the role of this protein. C/EBPalpha was chosen as an\nexample to demonstrate our new AP-MS methodology in the identification\nof protein complexes associated with a selected transcription factor. Experimental\nProceduresCellsThe cDNA for rat C/EBPalpha was stably expressed\nin the myeloid progenitor cell line FDCP-1 from a modified bicistronic\npMSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA)\nwith a carboxyl-terminal streptavidin (STREP)\u2013hemagglutinin\n(HA) tag. Transduced cells were isolated by FACS-sorting for the GFP-positive\npopulation. Cells were cultivated in RPMI (PAA Laboratories, C\u00f6lbe,\nGermany) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA),\npenicillin (100 U/mL) (PAA Laboratories), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL)\n(PAA Laboratories) and 5 ng/mL murine IL-3 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill,\nNJ, USA).Affinity Purification \u2013 PreparationAll steps\ndescribed in the protocol were at 4 \u00b0C. Purifications were performed\nfrom 1 \u00d7 109 freshly harvested cells. After being\nwashed with PBS, cells were incubated in buffer N (300 mM sucrose,\n10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM DTT,\n0.75 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF,\n1 mM Na3VO4, protease inhibitors) for 5 min\non ice to lyse the cytoplasm. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation\n(500g for 5 min), and the supernatant (containing\nthe cytoplasmic fraction) was removed. The nuclear pellet was washed\n(1\u00d7) with buffer N. For the extraction of nuclear proteins, the\nnuclei were resuspended in buffer C420 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 420 mM\nNaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaF, 1\nmM Na3VO4, protease inhibitors), vortexed briefly,\nand shaken vigorously for 30 min. After centrifugation for 1 h at\n100000g, the supernatant contained the soluble nuclear\nproteins, while nuclear membranes and insoluble chromatin remained\nin the pellet.The protein concentration of the soluble nuclear\nfraction was measured by Bradford assay (using \u03b3-globin as the\nstandard). Fifteen milligrams of nuclear extract was subjected to\neither one-step or two-step affinity purifications. Prior to purification,\nall nuclear extracts were adjusted to 2 mg/mL and 150 mM NaCl with\nHEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, protease inhibitors). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C\non a rotating wheel with RNase A, benzonase, and avidin to remove\nRNA and nucleic acids (DNA) and to saturate endogenously biotinylated\nproteins, respectively. An aliquot of the sample was retained for\nimmunoblot (IB) analysis (Supporting Information,\nSupplementary Figure 1b, lysate).Two-Step Affinity PurificationTwo-step STREP-HA purifications\nwere performed essentially as previously described.17 Precleared extracts were incubated with 200 \u03bcL of\nStrepTactin sepharose beads (IBA, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and incubated\nfor 2 h at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating wheel. The sample was transferred\nto a Biospin column (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), and the flow-through\nwas removed by gravity flow (an aliquot of the flow-through was retained\nfor IB analysis, Supplementary Figure 1b, STREP-FT). Beads were washed 3\u00d7 with TNN-HS buffer (50 mM\nHEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM\nNa3VO4, protease inhibitors). Proteins bound\nto the beads were eluted with 3 \u00d7 300 \u03bcL 2.5 mM biotin\nin TNN-HS buffer (an aliquot of the biotin eluate was retained for\nIB analysis, Supplementary Figure 1b, STREP-Eluate).\nThe biotin eluate was subsequently incubated with anti-HA-agarose\nbeads (Sigma, St.Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating\nwheel. Samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 300g (an aliquot of the flow-through was retained for IB analysis, Supplementary Figure 1b, HA-FT), and the beads\nwere washed 3\u00d7 with TNN-HS buffer. Another two washing steps\nwith TNN-HS buffer without detergent and inhibitors were performed\nto remove traces of detergent that are detrimental to LC\u2013MS\nanalysis. For one-dimensional gel-based liquid chromatography mass\nspectrometry (1D-gel-LC\u2013MS) analysis, bound proteins were eluted\nin 100 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min and centrifuged\nfor 3 min at 300g. The supernatant was transferred\nto a new eppendorf tube (100 \u03bcL) and 1/10 was retained for IB\nanalysis (Supplementary Figure 1b, HA-Eluate).\nFor one-dimensional gel-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry\n(1D-LC\u2013MS), bound material was eluted with 500 \u03bcL of\n100 mM formic acid and immediately neutralized with 125 \u03bcL of\n1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). From the final eluate, 200\n\u03bcL was retained for IB analysis (Supplementary\nFigure 1c, HA-Eluate).One-Step Affinity Purification:\nSTREP-tagFor one-step\nSTREP purifications, precleared nuclear extracts were incubated with\n200 \u03bcL of StreptTactin sepharose beads and at 4 \u00b0C incubated\nfor 2 h on a rotating wheel. Samples were centrifuged for 3 min at\n300g, the flow-through was transferred to a new eppendorf\ntube (for IB analysis, Supporting Information,\nSupplementary Figure 2a, STREP-FT), and the beads were washed\n3\u00d7 with TNN-HS buffer, and 2\u00d7 using TNN-HS buffer without\ndetergent and inhibitors (all washes in batch). For 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS\nanalysis, bound proteins were incubated with 100 \u03bcL of 2.5 mM\nbiotin in TNN-HS buffer 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, followed by centrifugation\nfor 3 min at 300g. The supernatant was transferred\nto a new eppendorf tube and 1/10 was retained for IB analysis (Supplementary Figure 2a, STREP-Eluate). Samples\nwere then alkylated with iodoacetamide and separated by 1D SDS-PAGE\non a 4\u201312% bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). Proteins were\nvisualized by silver staining, and the entire gel lane was excised\nand the 20 slices digested in situ with modified porcine trypsin (Promega\nCorp., Madison, WI, USA) as previously described.18 The obtained peptides were pooled into 10 samples and analyzed\nby online LC\u2013MS/MS (1D-gel-MS).The elution for 1D-LC\u2013MS\nwas performed using 312.5 \u03bcL of biotin in TNN-HS buffer for\n10 min at 4 \u00b0C, followed by centrifugation for 3 min at 300g. From the eluted material, 100 \u03bcL was retained for\nIB analysis (Supplementary Figure 2b, STREP-Eluate).\nThe remainder of the samples was digested with trypsin, and 2 \u00d7\n5% of the resultant peptides were analyzed as technical duplicates\nby LC\u2013MS/MS (1D-LC\u2013MS). The material not used for 1D-LC\u2013MS\nwas separated by off-line reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and\nthe resultant 10 fractions were analyzed by two-dimensional gel-free\nLC\u2013MS (2D-LC\u2013MS).One-Step Affinity Purification:\nHA-tagFor the one-step\nHA purification, precleared nuclear extracts were incubated with 200\n\u03bcL of anti-HA sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating\nwheel. Samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 300g, the flow-through was transferred to a new eppendorf tube (for IB\nanalysis, Sup. 2a, HA-FT), and beads were washed 3\u00d7 with TNN-HS\nand 2\u00d7 with TNN-HS buffer without detergent and inhibitors. For\nthe 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS approach, bound proteins were eluted in 100\n\u03bcL of 4\u00d7 Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged\nfor 3 min at 300g. The supernatant was then transferred\nto a new eppendorf tube (100 \u03bcL) and 1/10 was retained for IB\nanalysis (Sup. 2a, HA-Eluate). The eluted proteins were separated\nby 1D-SDS-PAGE, and entire lanes were excised in 20 slices, digested\nin situ with trypsin, and treated as reported before (1D-gel-MS).\nFor the 1D-LC\u2013MS, proteins were eluted with 500 \u03bcL of\n100 mM formic acid and immediately neutralized with 125 \u03bcL of\n1 M TEAB. As described above, 200 \u03bcL of the final eluate was\nretained for IB analysis (Sup. 2b, HA-Eluate).Reversed-Phase Reversed-Phase\n(RPRP) Separation19,20Tryptic digests were\nconcentrated and purified by solid\nphase extraction (SPE) (UltraMicroSpin columns 3\u201330 \u03bcg\ncapacity, Nest Group Inc., Southboro, MA, USA) prior to injection\nonto a Phenomenex column (150 \u00d7 2.0 mm Gemini-NX 3 \u03bcmC18\n110 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) on an Agilent 1200 series\nHPLC (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA) with UV detection at\n214 nm. HPLC solvent A consisted of 20 mM NH4OH pH 10.5\nin 5% acetonitrile and solvent B consisted of 20 mM NH4OH pH 10.5 in 90% acetonitrile. Ten time-based fractions were collected\nand acidified. The sample volume was reduced to approximately 2 \u03bcL\nin a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted to 10 \u03bcL with 5% formic\nacid.Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass SpectrometryAll\naffinity purifications were analyzed on a hybrid linear trap quadrupole\n(LTQ) Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMassachusetts, USA) coupled to a 1200 series high-performance liquid\nchromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) via\na nanoelectrospray ion source using liquid junction (Proxeon, Odense,\nDenmark). Solvents for HPLC separation of peptides were as follows:\nsolvent A consisted of 0.4% formic acid in water, and solvent B consisted\nof 0.4% formic acid in 70% methanol and 20% isopropanol. From a thermostatted\nmicroautosampler, 8 \u03bcL of the tryptic peptide mixture was automatically\nloaded onto a trap column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 \u03bcm, 5 \u00d7 0.3\nmm, Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a binary pump\nat a flow rate of 45 \u03bcL/min. 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used\nfor loading and washing the precolumn. After washing, the peptides\nwere eluted by back-flushing onto a 16-cm fused silica analytical\ncolumn with an inner diameter of 50 \u03bcm packed with C18 reversed\nphase material (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3 \u03bcm, Dr. Maisch GmbH,\nAmmerbuch-Entringen, Germany). The peptides were eluted from the analytical\ncolumn with a 27 min gradient ranging from 3 to 30% solvent B, followed\nby a 25 min gradient from 30 to 70% solvent B and, finally, a 7 min\ngradient from 70 to 100% solvent B at a constant flow rate of 100\nnL/min.21 The analyses were performed in\na data-dependent acquisition mode and dynamic exclusion for selected\nions was 60 s. A top 15 collision-induced dissociation (CID) method\nwere used, and a single lock mass at m/z 445.120024 (Si(CH3)2O)6)21 was employed. Maximal ion accumulation time\nallowed in CID mode was 50 ms for MSn in the LTQ and 500\nms in the C-trap. Automatic gain control was used to prevent overfilling\nof the ion traps and was set to 5000 in MSn mode for the\nLTQ and 106 ions for a full FTMS scan. Intact peptides\nwere detected in the Orbitrap Velos at 60\u2009000 resolution at m/z 400.Protein IdentificationPeak list information was extracted\nfrom the RAW MS files and converted into an MGF format with the msconvert\ntool (ProteoWizard Library v2.1.2708). The MGF files were searched\nagainst the mouse component of the UniProtKB/SwissProt database (www.uniprot.org; releases 2010-09, 2011-12, and 2012-05), including\nall protein isoforms plus the rat C/EBPalpha and known contaminant\nsequences (e.g., human keratin). An initial search was performed with\nthe protein search engine Mascot (www.matrixscience.com, version 2.3.02). Mass error tolerances on the precursor and fragment\nions were \u00b110 ppm and \u00b10.6 Da, respectively. Only fully\ntryptic peptides were considered with a maximum of one missed cleavage\nsite, and carbamidomethyl cysteine and methionine oxidation set as\nfixed and variable modifications, respectively. The Mascot peptide\nion score threshold was equal to 30, and at least three peptide identifications\nper protein were required.For both the precursor and fragment\nion data, linear recalibration transformations that minimize the mean\nsquare deviation of the measured from theoretical values were deduced\nfrom the initial identifications. Recalibrated MGF files were searched\nagainst the same protein database with Mascot and Phenyx (GeneBio,\nSA, version 2.5.14)22 using narrower mass\ntolerances (\u00b14 ppm and \u00b10.3 Da). All other search parameters\nwere identical to the initial first pass search. Mascot and Phenyx\noutput files were processed by internally developed parsers to filter\nand integrate protein identifications. For Mascot and Phenyx identifications,\nthe following peptide score thresholds were used: T1 = 14, T2 = 40, and T3 = 10; and T1 =\n4.2, T2 = 4.75, and T3 = 3.5, respectively (P-value <10\u20133). Proteins with at least two unique peptides above\nscore T1 or with a single peptide above T2 were selected as unambiguous identifications.\nAdditional peptides from these validated proteins with a score >T3 were appended to the final result. The validated\nidentifications from both algorithms were merged, spectral conflicts\nwere discarded, and protein groups were defined according to shared\npeptides. A false discovery rate (FDR) of <1% for protein identifications\nand <0.1% for peptides (including peptides exported with lower\nscores) was estimated by applying the same filtering procedure against\na database of reversed protein sequences.Bioinformatic AnalysesAll affinity purifications were\nanalyzed based on protein spectral counts. For each purification strategy,\nproteins identified in the control cells were subtracted from the\nproteins identified from the corresponding C/EBPalpha affinity purifications.\nMoreover, contaminants such as keratin, spectrin, plectin, and anti-HA\nantibody chains were removed from the list as known nonspecific binders\nfrequently observed in AP-MS. ResultsTo determine\nthe protein interactome of C/EBPalpha, an affinity-tagged\nvariant of the TF was expressed in the myeloid progenitor cell line\nFDCP-1. A well-established, double-affinity purification tag (STREP\u2013HA)\nwas used throughout.17,23 The tag consists of two STREP\nmotifs and three HA epitopes. A double-affinity tag enables the enrichment\nof a specific protein and associated interactors in two sequential\npurification steps. In parallel, nonspecifically binding proteins\nare removed from the sample.23 The first\npurification step takes advantage of the strong affinity that the\nSTREP-peptide has for a variant of streptavidin (StrepTactin). Bound\nprotein complexes are specifically eluted with biotin. The second\npurification consists of an immunopurification step using an anti-HA-antibody.\nBound proteins are eluted with formic acid or sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS) buffer for analysis by 1D-LC\u2013MS or 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS,\nrespectively.Because of the predominantly nuclear localization\nof C/EBPalpha,\nthe standard whole cell extract lysis buffers were not recommended.\nStarting from whole cell extracts, STREP-HA purifications of C/EBPalpha\nwere poorly enriched, and only the selected transcription factor and\na few interactors were identified by MS (data not shown). After several\nprotocols for extracting nuclear proteins (data not shown) were assessed,\na high-salt extraction approach using 420 mM NaCl was chosen.24 As nuclear extracts are rich in nucleic acids,\nabundant DNA- and RNA-binding proteins can be preferentially copurified\nand identified by LCMS. This occurs at the expense of the identification\nof the low-abundance proteins that typically constitute transcription\nfactor complexes. Thus, the nuclear extracts were treated with RNase\nA and benzonase to remove nucleic acids that are not protected by\nbound transcription factors. In parallel, the samples were also treated\nwith free avidin to remove the majority of the naturally biotinylated\nproteins (e.g., carboxylases) prior to affinity purification using\nStrepTactin. As avidin does not display any affinity for STREP, this\npreclearing step increases the specificity of the purification.Standardized two-step STREP-HA purifications17 from 15 mg of pretreated nuclear extracts were conducted\non C/EBPalpha-overexpressing FDCP-1 cells and control mock-infected\ncells that do not express any STREP-HA-tagged protein. Eluates were\nanalyzed by 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS and 1D-LC\u2013MS, and the identified\nproteins were filtered by subtracting all proteins detected in the\npurifications from the control cell line. Despite high quantities\nof purified C/EBPalpha, only a few protein interactors were observed\n(Supporting Information, Supplementary Figure\n1). Mainly ribosomal proteins, chaperones, and secreted proteins\nwere identified. The exception was Ddit3, a known C/EBPalpha interactor25 (Supplementary Figure 1a). Although the results showed that the two-step AP-MS approach correctly\npurified C/EBPalpha, the method appeared to be too harsh to retain\nand subsequently identify the different C/EBPalpha interactors. This\nis most likely due to the transient and/or unstable nature of transcription\nfactor complexes.26 Following treatment\nof the STREP-eluate with four different cross-linking reagents, the\npresence of several high molecular weight protein complexes associated\nwith the purified C/EBPalpha was confirmed by anti-HA immunoblot (Supplementary Figure 2a,b). On the basis of the\nimmunoblot of the one-step procedure combined with the two-step data\nfrom AP-MS, we surmised that the second purification step of the STREP-HA\npurification is indeed limiting for the detection of transient C/EBPalpha\nprotein complexes. In consideration of these findings and to augment\nthe sensitivity of the AP-MS analyses, our next efforts were focused\non one-step affinity purifications. The caveat with less stringent\npurification conditions inherent with a one-step procedure is that\nthe frequency of nondirect interactors in the purified material increases.2 To enhance the dynamic range of the LCMS analyses\nand boost the number of proteins detected, an additional 2D-LCMS approach\nwas introduced.20Taking advantage\nof the STREP and HA motifs in the double tag,\none-step purifications were combined with three LCMS approaches. A\ntotal of six independent AP-MS strategies were thus designed to characterize\nthe C/EBPalpha interactome (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). The\nSTREP motif allows specific elution of the purified TF complex with\nbiotin. The eluate is compatible with 1D-, 2D-LC\u2013MS and 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS.\nConversely, the HA-bound material was nonspecifically eluted with\neither SDS for 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS or with formic acid for 1D- and\n2D-LC\u2013MS. Although a specific elution with HA-peptides is possible,27 this approach is not compatible with gel-free\nLCMS as a large excess of free HA peptide drastically reduces the\ndynamic range of the MS analysis (data not shown).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Summary and flowchart\nof the different purification procedures\nused in this study. The two single step STREP and HA purifications\nare displayed on the left and right, respectively. The different elution\nbuffers are displayed in the orange boxes. Finally, each purification\nstep is visualized by a schematic of the alternative LC\u2013MS\nanalyses.Following the affinity purification\nprotocols described above,\nall one-step purifications were performed as biological replicates,\nand the eluted material was analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass\nspectrometer. The quality of the affinity purifications was monitored\nby immunoblotting for exogenous C/EBPalpha protein (Supporting Information, Supplementary Figure 3) and confirmed\nby the number of spectral counts specific for the TF. In all C/EBPalpha\nsamples, high numbers of nuclear proteins were identified associated\nwith the tagged TF (data not shown). In addition, residual biotinylated\ncarboxylases and anti-HA antibody chains originating from the STREP-\nand the HA-purifications, respectively, were also apparent (see Supplementary Table 1).For all proteins\nidentified in the STREP- versus the HA-purifications,\na 45% overlap was evident. Subtraction of proteins detected in the\nnegative controls, however, dramatically reduced the number of common\nproteins (Figure \u200b(Figure2a).2a). The same trend was observed\nwhen the proteins identified by all three different LCMS strategies\nwere compared. After filtering, the only shared protein was exogenous\nand endogenous C/EBPalpha (Figure \u200b(Figure2b,c).2b,c). Interestingly,\nboth the qualitative and semiquantitative profile of the proteins\nidentified with each of the two tags was substantially different.\nThis confirmed the high variability that has previously been reported\nin the literature for different tag-based affinity purifications28 (Figure \u200b(Figure2a).2a). Except for\nthe 1D-gel-free LC\u2013MS analyses of the anti-HA-tag purifications,\nall strategies identified a high number of proteins that specifically\nassociated with C/EBPalpha. Among these, 21 interactions have been\npreviously reported29 (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). In addition, both purification strategies were\ncharacterized by a different set of background proteins that associate\nwith the tag and/or the affinity resin. As summarized in Table S1, each approach can be preferentially\nselected based on a particular experimental design.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Venn diagrams of proteins\nidentified in the STREP- and HA-purifications\n(adapted from BioVenn, Copyright T.

In particular,\nthe biochemical procedures associated with different tag-based purification,\nvarious elution protocols, and alternative MS analyses may all preferably\nidentify certain classes of proteins. Therefore, a common network\nfeaturing the proteins identified from all six strategies was created.\nAccording to the interaction data from the literature, all proteins\nidentified with our approaches were clustered into previously described\nmultiprotein complexes (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). This approach\nmarkedly increased the connections between the six different strategies.\nC/EBPalpha was found to interact with different protein complexes,\nand nine of these were reproducibly retrieved by the different affinity\npurification methods (Figures \u200b(Figures44 and \u200band5).5). For instance, the MLL-SWI/SNF complex was identified\nby five out of six strategies, confirming the previously reported\ninteraction of C/EBPalpha with this complex.10,30,31 On the basis of these data, a total of nine\nfunctional nuclear protein complexes were identified from the intersection\nof more than two independent affinity purification approaches (Figure \u200b(Figure55).Open in a separate windowFigure 4C/EBPalpha network generated from the intersection of\nthe proteins\nidentified in the six one-step protein purification approaches. From\nthis analysis, is possible to identify nine protein complexes associated\nwith C/EBPalpha. All proteins shown in the figure were identified\nin our AP-MS analyses.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Interaction network of protein complexes associated with C/EBPalpha\nidentified by the six LCMS analyses for both STREP- and HA-purifications.\nThe network edges are proportional to the number of protein identified\nby each strategy.To confirm the robustness\nof the complexes, the interactome of\na previously described C/EBPalpha mutant was analyzed in the same\ncellular system. This mutant harbors a duplication of lysine 313 (C/EBPalpha\nKK) in the basic region-leucine zipper domain.32 Mutations affecting this domain frequently occur in AML\npatients10,32 and were shown to abolish DNA binding of\nC/EBPalpha. Hence, a 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS AP-MS experiment was conducted\nusing both the STREP- and HA-tags. Following the same approach described\nfor C/EBPalpha, a common protein\u2013protein interaction network\nwas generated for the KK mutant (Figure \u200b(Figure6).\nDespite6).\nDespite the different number of proteins identified, both C/EBPalpha\nand the C/EBPalpha KK mutant were found to associate with the same\nprotein complexes. The composition of some macromolecular complexes,\nhowever, was altered. For instance, more proteins described as part\nof the MLL-SWI/SNF complex were connected to the C/EBPalpha KK mutant.\nOn the other hand, the components of both the Sin3a-Hdac1 and PAF\ncomplexes were less represented (Figure \u200b(Figure6).\nIn6).\nIn the context of the C/EBPalpha KK mutant, these data suggest an\nalternative biological function for these protein complexes.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Interaction\nnetwork of protein complexes associated with C/EBPalpha\nand C/EBPalpha KK identified by STREP 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS and HA 1D-gel-LC\u2013MS\nanalyses.

All proteins\ndisplayed were identified in our AP-MS analysis, and the entire list\nof the proteins is available in the Supporting\nInformation. Discussion and ConclusionTFs are known to dynamically associate with several proteins and,\ndepending on the protein partners, TFs can execute different transcriptional\nprograms.9 In fact, TFs have been reported\nto act as macromolecular machinery complexes.33,34 Using C/EBPalpha as model, we developed a novel methodology to identify\ndifferent molecular complexes associated with TFs in mammalian cells.\nThe use of a double tag for parallel, independent single-step AP-MS\nprocedures from nuclear extracts markedly boost the number of proteins\ndetected as compared to sequential two-step AP-MS approaches. Ultimately,\nthe intersection of the data generated by the different AP-MS strategies\nstrongly emphasized the specific molecular complexes associated with\nthe selected TF to the detriment of so-called nonspecifically binding\nproteins.A low overlap in the proteins identified by each independent\nAP-MS\nstrategy was apparent, even within protocols adopting the same tag\naffinity purification approach (Figure \u200b(Figure2b,c).\nIn2b,c).\nIn contrast, however, when each protein was considered as a component\nof previously described macromolecular complexes, the overlap among\nthe different AP-MS procedures noticeably increased. Interestingly,\neach AP-MS strategy adopted favored the identification of alternative\nmembers that belong to the same protein complex (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). Although determining direct interactors of a TF can be\nquite complex, the use of the methodology proposed here can elucidate\nthe interactome of the TF of interest. In our study, a total of nine\nindependent protein complexes were identified associating with C/EBPalpha\n(Figure \u200b(Figure5).5). The same macromolecular complexes\nwere found to associate with a previously reported C/EBPalpha DNA\nbinding mutant (C/EBPalpha K313KK). Thus, the specificity of these\ninteractions is highlighted. More interestingly, however, was that\nsubtle differences were observed within the composition of some of\nthe nine protein complexes. This was particularly evident for the\ncomplexes that strongly associate with DNA, as observed for the PAF\nand the Sin3a\u2013Hdac1 complexes. Thus, the data are indicative\nof alternative biological functions for C/EBPalpha and the C/EBPalpha\nKK mutant (Figure \u200b(Figure66).Hence, the combined\nanalysis of data sets generated through different\nexperimental strategies enabled the robust and reproducible identification\nof explicit molecular complexes associated with the C/EBPalpha protein.\nOur studies suggest that the adoption of different AP-MS strategies\nfor a TF is more efficient in detecting specific protein complexes\nassociated to the protein of interest than increasing the number of\nbiological replicates for each single AP-MS approach. Indeed, different\nelution buffers and diverse MS strategies alter the reproducibility\nof the proteins complexes identified by the different independent\nAP-MS analysis.28 Conversely, the combined\nanalysis of data generated by at least two different AP-MS approaches\ntremendously enhances the robustness of TF molecular networks. Taking\ninto account affordability and depth of analysis required, the six\nstrategies described here provide the framework for optimization of\nthe purification procedure (see Supporting Information,\nSupplementary Table 1). The combination of experimental strategies\nfor the AP-MS-enabled characterization of interactors of the transcription\nfactor C/EBPalpha represents a dramatic improvement compared to standard\nAP-MS protocols.In summary, our systematic analysis showed\nthat one-step purifications\nfrom nuclear extracts of cells are necessary to analyze the protein\ninteraction network of a transcription factor. Depending on the purification\nstrategy chosen, the MS analysis must be adjusted accordingly. For\nSTREP-tag purifications, analysis by 1D- and 2D-gel-free LC\u2013MS\nis highly recommended. For anti-HA antibody-based purifications, a\nfractionation step at the protein (1D-gel-LC\u2013MS) or peptide\nlevel (2D-LC\u2013MS) is essential. Finally, to increase the robustness\nof the analysis of transcription factor complexes, we recommend the\nuse of a combination of at least two independent tag purifications.Overall, this study describes a new methodology to characterize\nthe C/EBPalpha protein interaction network. We believe this approach\ncan be robustly and generically extended to other transcription factors\nand other common nuclear proteins. AcknowledgmentsWe thank\nAndr\u00e9 C.
