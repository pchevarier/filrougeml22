For example, quiescent CD4+ memory T cells are susceptible to HIV-1 infection but do not support robust HIV-1 transcription and have been implicated as the primary reservoir of latent HIV-1. T cell transcription factors that regulate maturation potentially limit HIV-1 transcription and mediate the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 latency. We report that B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), a critical regulator of B and T cell differentiation, is highly expressed in memory CD4+ T cells compared to na\u00efve CD4+ T cells and represses basal and Tat-mediated HIV-1 transcription. Blimp-1 binds an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) within HIV-1 provirus and it is displaced following T cell activation. Reduction of Blimp-1 in infected primary T cells including CD4+ memory T cells increases RNA polymerase II processivity, histone acetylation and baseline HIV-1 transcription. Therefore, the transcriptional repressor, Blimp-1, is an intrinsic factor that predisposes CD4+ memory T cells to latent HIV-1 infection. IntroductionA remaining challenge in efforts to cure HIV-1 infection is targeting the latent reservoir which is resistant to current antiretroviral therapies (ART). Upon cessation of ART HIV-1 rapidly reemerges from latently infected cells to pretreatment viral loads (1, 2). Strategies to target this reservoir requires characterizing the cell populations that harbor latent HIV-1 and understanding the biochemical mechanisms that regulate provirus expression in these cells.Quiescent memory CD4+ T cells have been implicated as the primary HIV-1 reservoir because they are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, are long-lived and, with their ability to self-renew, potentially maintain pools of latently infected cells. Numerous T cell transcription factors, such as NFAT, GATA-3, c-Maf and ROR\u03b3t have been suggested to rapidly reactivate latent HIV-1 (3), but whether there are T cell specific factors that predispose memory cells to latent HIV-1 infection has not been demonstrated.The Prdm1 gene encodes B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), a Kruppel-like zinc-finger factor that is critical for the differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells and has been recently demonstrated to be expressed in dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes and T cells (4\u201314). In T cells Blimp-1 regulates the activation and generation of CD4 and CD8 T cell effector populations (15\u201318). Blimp-1 represses the transcription of several regulatory factors including Bcl-6, T-bet, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b2, while enhancing the transcription of IL-10 (19\u201322). In the context of HIV-1, Blimp-1 expression is increased in chronically infected patients and correlates with enhanced expression of negative regulators of T cell activation including PD-1, LAG3 and CTLA-4, and with T cell exhaustion and apoptosis (23\u201326). The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) includes binding sites for Blimp-1, suggesting that this factor directly binds provirus and regulates HIV-1 transcription (3).We demonstrate regulated expression of Blimp-1 in human CD4+ T cells including memory CD4+ T cell subsets. Furthermore, we show that Blimp-1 binds sequences downstream of the HIV-1 LTR limiting HIV-1 transcription in memory T cells. These results support a model in which Blimp-1 is a memory T cell specific factor that directly contributes to the establishment of HIV-1 latency. Materials and MethodsCell CultureDiscarded deidentified tissues from otolaryngology surgeries performed at Boston Medical Center were mechanically separated and cultured on plastic plates for 2\u20133 d to eliminate adherent cells. Cells in suspension were then positively selected for CD4+ T cells using the Dynabeads CD4-Positive Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). Whole blood from healthy, anonymous donors was purchased from NY Biologicals. The Boston University School of Medicine IRB reviewed the use of tonsils and blood for these studies and assigned it as non-human subject research. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by centrifuging through Histopaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich). CD4+ T cells were positively selected using the Dynabeads CD4 Positive Isolation Kit. Jurkat clone E6-1 was originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Primary CD4+ T cells and Jurkat cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (P/S), and 0.2 M L-glutamine. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 10% FBS and P/S. Cells were incubated in a 37\u00b0 C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were either left untreated, or activated with 0.1 \u03bcg/ml anti-human CD3 (BD Biosciences) and 1.0 \u03bcg/ml anti-human CD28 (BD Biosciences) for 30 min. 5 \u03bcg/ml of goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) was added to cross-link the receptors. T cells were harvested 24 h post-stimulation. All experiments with primary cells were performed with tissues from at least three different donors.Polychromatic flow cytometryCD4+ T cells were isolated from whole blood by negative selection using RosetteSep\u2122 Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail (STEMCELL Technologies). To sort T cell subsets cells were stained with CD3-PacificBlue (BD Biosciences), CCR7-PE-Cy7 (BioLegend), CD45RA-PE-Cy5.5 (Invitrogen), CD27-PE (BD Biosciences), CD4-APC (BioLegend). T cell subsets were separated with FACSAria.Transfections, Virus Generation and InfectionsHIV-1 -1 LTR/GLS-luciferase reporter constructs with an intact or mutated (GAAAGCGAAAG mutated to GCCCGCGCCCG) ISRE or NL4-3\u0394Tat-luciferase, Blimp-1, Tat, RSV LTR-LUC (27) and FIP-LUC (28) expression constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells via calcium phosphate transfection as described previously (29). The RSV-LUC and FIP-LUC were generously provided by Dr. S. Gummuluru, Boston University School of Medicine. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h post-transfection using Luciferase Assay System (Promega).Lentiviral vectors pNL4-3-LUC(+)Env(\u2212)Nef(\u2212) (30) (obtained from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), Blimp-1 shRNA (Dharmacon), FUGW Blimp-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Kathryn Calame, Columbia University, New York) were packaged by cotransfecting Tat, RSV-Rev, Gag/Pol and VSV-G into HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate as previously described (29). HIV-1 -1 titers were determined using a p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer). Viruses were collected 48 h post-transfection and filtered through a Puradisc 25 Syringe Filter with 0.45-\u03bcm Polyethersulfone membrane (Whatman). Jurkat cells were infected by culturing with supernatants containing HIV-1-LUC or lentiviral constructs for 12\u201316 h. CD4+ T cells were activated with 2\u03bcg/mL PHA and 10ng/mL PMA for 16 h, rested for 12 h and infected by culturing with HIV-1 -containing supernatant or spinoculated with HIV-1-LUC supernatant plus 1 \u03bcg/ml polybrene for 1.5 h at 1,200 \u00d7g without prior activation described by O\u2019Doherty et al (31). Overexpression of Blimp-1 led to less than 10% decrease in the doubling time of Jurkat cells when compared to control cells; however, cell counts were adjust prior to harvesting cells for experiments. There were no apparent adverse effects with overexpression of Blimp-1 in CD4+ cells purified from peripheral blood.Quantitative RT-PCRRNA was prepared by resuspending cells in TRIzol (Life Technologies), and cDNA was generated using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Promega). GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) was used for quantitative real-time PCR reaction. Blimp-1 transcripts (+2074 to +2372) were amplified using 5\u2032-CAGCTCGCCCACCTGCAGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCGCAGCGCAGTTCCCTTT-3\u2032 primers. Initiated HIV-1 transcripts (+1 to +40) were amplified using 5\u2032-GGGTCTCTCTGGTTAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGAGCTCCCAGGCTCA-3\u2032 primers and elongated HIV-1 transcripts (+5396 to +5531) were amplified using 5\u2032-GACTAGAGCCCTGGAAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTTCTTCCTGCCATAGGAG-3\u2032 primers as described previously (29). \u03b2-actin mRNA was amplified using a QuantiTect primer assay (Qiagen). PCR was carried out for 45 cycles, and the relative expression was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method (32), normalizing specific amplification of the transcripts of interest to the \u03b2-actin control for each specific sample. The product detected in the sh-Control was a calibrator, and the transcript levels in samples were calculated as fold changes in comparison to sh-Control.Immunoblot Analysis and AntibodiesWhole-cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with cold PBS and lysing them with buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.0 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem). Protein was measured using the BSA assay (Pierce). Samples were heated for 5 min at 100 \u00b0C before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-Blimp-1 serum (kindly provided by Dr. Kathryn Calame, Columbia University, New York), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Tat (4138; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program), anti-Sp1 (Upstate), anti-IRF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-IRF-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RNAP II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-AcH3 (Upstate Biotechnology) and rabbit IgG (Upstate Biotechnology).ChIP-qPCRChromatin immunoprecpitations were performed as previously described (29). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out using SYBR green reagents and the primers 5\u2032-GACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAACCAGAGAGACCCAGTAC-3\u2032, which amplify the \u2212102 to +16 region of the HIV-1 LTR, 5\u2032-CTGGGAGCTCTCTGGCTAACTA-3\u2032and 5\u2032-TTACCAGAGTCACACAACAGACG-3\u2032, which amplify the +30 to +134 region of HIV-1, 5\u2032-TCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTCGAGAGAGCTCCTCTGGTTT-3\u2032, which amplify the +142 to +237 region of HIV-1, and 5\u2032-ACAGTACTGGATGTGGGTGATG-3\u2032and 5\u2032-AATCCCTGGTGTCTCATTGTTT-3\u2032, which amplify the +2415 to +2522 region of provirus.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out using Student t test. A two-tailed distribution was performed on paired samples. Values of <0.01 were considered significant. ResultsBlimp-1 is Expressed in Primary Human CD4+ Cells Including Memory CD4+ T CellsAlthough Blimp-1 expression has been characterized in murine T cells we wanted to confirm that it shared a similar expression pattern in human primary CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells were isolated from tonsils, a rich source of follicular helper T cells (TFH), and from peripheral blood. Blimp-1 mRNA was detected by qRT-PCR and protein with immunoblots. Consistent with previous reports (33) tonsillar CD4+ T cells expressed low levels of Blimp-1 compared to the CD4+ T cells isolated from whole blood (Fig. 1A). Activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies resulted in 3-fold increase in Blimp-1 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B and C).Open in a separate windowFig. 1Blimp-1 is expressed in CD4+ memory T cellsA) CD4+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood and tonsils and Blimp-1 was measured by qRT-PCR. B) Blimp-1 levels were measured by qRT-PCR in unstinmulated or CD3 + CD28 stimulated primary CD4+ T cells enriched from peripheral blood. \u03b2-actin was used as a reference gene to normalize values. C) Immnoblots of lysates from resting and CD3 + CD28 activated primary CD4+ T cells obtained from whole blood for Blimp-1, Sp1 and \u03b2-actin. Sp1, a transcription factor, and \u03b2-acting served as loading controls. D) Sorting strategy and staining profiles for T cell subsets. Peripheral blood T cells were stained with Pacific Blue\u2013labeled antibody to CD3, APC\u2013labeled antibody to CD4, PE-Cy7\u2013labeled antibody to CCR7, PE-Cy5.5-labeled antibody to CD45RA and PE-labeled antibody to CD27. T cell subsets were separated by FACSAria into na\u00efve T cells (TN; CD4+CD3+CD45RA+), central memory T cells (TCM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7+CD27+), transitional memory T cells (TTM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7\u2212CD27+) and effector memory T cells (TEM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7\u2212CD27\u2212). E) and F) Expression of Blimp-1 in sorted memory CD4+ T cell populations measured by E) qRT-PCR using \u03b2-actin as a reference gene and by F) immunoblots. These experiments represent CD4+ cells obtained from at least three healthy individuals. Bars show average values \u00b1SD, n=3. *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001 (Student\u2019s t test).We also examined Blimp-1 expression in different memory CD4+ T cell populations obtained from peripheral blood. Flow cytometry based on CD45RA, CD27 and CCR7 expression was used to enrich for na\u00efve T cells (TN; CD4+CD3+CD45RA+), central memory T cells (TCM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7+CD27+), transitional memory T cells (TTM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7\u2212CD27+) and effector memory T cells (TEM; CD4+CD3+CD45RA\u2212CCR7\u2212CD27\u2212) (Fig. 1D). Although TCM have been implicated as the primary cell type that is latently infected, recent reports suggest that TEM and TTM contribute to the latent HIV-1 reservoir (34\u201336). Blimp-1 mRNA was measured in memory cells by qRT-PCR and protein levels were determined by immunoblots. Blimp-1 expression was 10-fold higher in long-lived TCM compared to na\u00efve T cells, whereas, even higher levels of Blimp-1 were observed in TTM and TEM (Fig. 1E, F). Overall, Blimp-1 is present in multiple T cell populations but is expressed at significantly higher levels in CD4+ T memory cells found within the latent reservoir.Blimp-1 Inhibits HIV-1 Transcription and Binds HIV-1 ProvirusBased on the transcriptional repressor function of Blimp-1 and our data showing its high expression in CD4+ memory T cells we hypothesized that Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 expression. To determine if Blimp-1 regulates HIV-1 LTR activity we performed co-transfection experiments with Blimp-1 and an HIV-1 LTR reporter. Blimp-1 inhibited the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene (HIV-1 LTR-LUC) by 67% when overexpressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). Overexpression of the HIV-1 transcriptional activator, Tat, was unable to rescue HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription in the presence of Blimp-1 (Fig. 2A). In addition, Blimp-1 inhibited an HIV-1 clone that lacked Tat (\u0394Tat-HIV-1-LUC) by only 30% but repressed transcription by greater than 70% when Tat was added back by co-transfection (Fig. 2B). Blimp-1 is not acting as a general repressor in these experiments since it failed to repress expression driven by Rous sarcoma virus LTR (RSV LTR) (27) and foamy virus internal promoter (FIP) (28) (Fig 2C). These data indicate that Blimp-1 inhibits basal HIV-1 transcription as well as transcription in the presence of Tat.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Blimp-1 represses HIV-1 transcription in the presence of TatA) and B) HEK293T cells were transfected with viral clones HIV-1 LTR-LUC containing the TAR element (A) or \u0394Tat- HIV-1-LUC (B) and vector control or Blimp-1 in the absence or presence of Tat. Luciferase assays and western blot analyses were performed 48 h post-transfection. (C) HEK293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 LTR-LUC, RSV LTR-LUC, FIP-LUC and vector control or Blimp-1. Luciferase assays and western blot analyses were performed 48 h post-transfection. (D) Jurkat T cells stably transduced with Blimp-1 lentivirus were infected with HIV-1. 48 h post-infection cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. (E) 16 h post-HIV-1 infection primary CD4+ T cells purified from peripheral blood were transduced with empty lentiviral vector or with vector expressing Blimp-1. 72 h post-transduction expression of Blimp-1 and HIV-1 were measured by qRT-PCR. HIV-1 released into supernatants was assessed by measuring p24 by an ELISA. These experiments were performed in triplicates and the data represent at least three independent experiments. Experiments with primary cells were performed with cells from at least three different people. White bars indicate vector control; black bars indicate Blimp-1 lentiviral vector. Bars show average values \u00b1SD, n=3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (Student\u2019s t test).We explored whether Blimp-1 regulates HIV-1 expression in CD4+ T cells. We established a Jurkat T cell line that stably overexpressed Blimp-1 and infected it with a single cycle env-minus HIV-1-luciferase virus (HIV-1-LUC). We do see a modest decrease in the doubling time in Jurkat cells overexpressing Blimp-1 (less than 10%); however, for all experiments cell numbers were adjusted so that assays were performed on comparable numbers of cells. HIV-1 transcription, as measured by the luciferase assay, was decreased by 55% in cells overexpressing Blimp-1 (Fig. 2D). In addition, primary human CD4+ T cells enriched from whole blood were infected with a HIV-1-LUC virus (30) and Blimp-1 was overexpressed using a lentiviral vector. Transduction of cells with Blimp-1 lentivirus resulted in over 13-fold increase in Blimp-1 mRNA (Fig. 2E). Cells overexpressing Blimp-1 had 65% decrease in HIV-1 transcription measured by HIV-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2E) and over 90% inhibition of HIV-1 replication measured by HIV-1 p24 ELISA (Fig. 2E). The data from Jurkat T cells and primary human CD4+ T cells confirmed that Blimp-1 is a repressor of HIV-1 transcription.HIV-1 provirus has four putative Blimp-1 binding sites, GAAAG, with two sites upstream of the transcription start site that overlap the NF-\u03baB sites (-104 to \u2013 80 bp) and a second set of sites located downstream of the transcriptional start site in an interferon sensitive response element (ISRE; +200 to +218 bp) (37) (Fig. 3A). Both regions have been reported to modulate HIV-1 transcription (37, 38). Mutating the HIV-1 ISRE ameliorated Blimp-1-mediated repression of HIV-1 following co-transfection into HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) demonstrate that Blimp-1 directly binds HIV-1 provirus. Chromatin was prepared from CD4+ T cells enriched from peripheral blood, infected with HIV-1 and protein-DNA complexes were enriched with Blimp-1-specific antibody. ChIPs show modest Blimp-1 binding at the -104/-80 bp site and 9-fold higher Blimp-1 binding at the +200/+218 bp ISRE site (Fig. 3C). Following T cell activation, Blimp-1 binding was not detected at the HIV-1 ISRE element. This inability to bind the HIV-1 LTR following activation explains in part why, despite increases in Blimp-1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3C, Fig. 1B and C), repression of HIV-1 is not observed in activated CD4+ T cells. Blimp-1 binding does not exclude the recruitment of other factors to the HIV-1 ISRE. ChIPs show that interferon regulatory factors (IRF) IRF-1 and IRF-8 bind to the HIV-1 ISRE in the presence of Blimp-1 (Fig. 3D) suggesting that Blimp-1 is not simply competing with other key transcription factors for binding to the HIV-1 LTR. These results suggest that Blimp-1 represses HIV-1 transcription by directly binding the proviral ISRE element.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Blimp-1 binds HIV-1 provirus(A) The location of the HIV-1 LTR, four putative Blimp-1-binding sites and ISRE mutations in provirus. (B) HEK293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 LTR-LUC or mISRE-HIV-1 LTR-LUC and control vector or Blimp-1 in the absence or presence of Tat. Luciferase assays and western blot analyses were performed 48 h post-transfection. (C, D) 96 h post-HIV-1 infection primary human CD4+ T cells from whole blood were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 h and ChIPs were performed using anti-Blimp-1, anti-IRF-1, anti-IRF-8 or anti-rabbit antibody. Binding was detected with -102F/+16R and +142F/+237R HIV-1 primer sets. These data are performed in triplicate and represent at three independent experiments. Bars show average values \u00b1SD, n=3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (Student\u2019s t test).Blimp-1 Limits HIV-1 Transcription in CD4+ Memory T Cell SubsetsThe above gain of function experiments demonstrated that Blimp-1 represses HIV-1 expression. To determine if Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 expression in the context of primary cells we reduced Blimp-1 expression in primary CD4+ T cells using shRNA. We infected CD4+ T cells purified from peripheral blood with HIV-1-LUC, transduced the infected cells with sh-Blimp-1 lentivirus and monitored HIV-1 expression. The efficacy of Blimp-1 knock-down was confirmed 96 h post-transduction by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and immunoblots (Fig. 4B). Diminishing Blimp-1 increased basal HIV-1 transcription and replication as measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4C), luciferase assay (Fig. 4D) and p24 ELISA (Fig. 4E) indicating that Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 transcription in primary CD4+ T cells. Activating T cells through CD3 + CD28 following Blimp-1 knockdown did not further induce HIV-1 transcription and actually decreased HIV-1 transcription by 80%. This apparent paradoxical result suggests that Blimp-1 is required for optimal induction of HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 4C) and indicates that Blimp-1 acts as both a repressor and transcriptional activator in the context of HIV-1-infected primary T cells. However, the ability of Blimp-1 to activate HIV-1 transcription is independent of Blimp-1 binding to provirus since ChIPs show it is displaced following T cell activation (Fig. 3C).Open in a separate windowFig. 4Blimp-1 represses HIV-1 transcription in resting CD4+ T cellsHIV-1 -infected primary CD4+ T cells enriched from peripheral blood were transduced with sh-Ctrl and sh-Blimp-1. 72 h post-knockdown cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 h. Expression of Blimp-1 was measure by A) qRT-PCR and B) immunoblots. HIV-1 expression was assayed by qRT-PCR using primers for (C) elongated HIV-1 mRNA and (G) initiated short transcripts, D) luciferase assay and E) HIV-1 p24 ELISA. ChIP analysis used anti-rabbit and anti-RNAP II (F) oranti-AcH3 (H) antibody and +30F/+134R and +2415F/+2522R HIV-1 primer sets. These experiments were performed in triplicate and the data are representative of at least three independent experiments. White bars indicate sh-control; black bars indicate sh-Blimp-1. Bars show average values \u00b1SD, n=3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (Student\u2019s t test).To gain insight into how Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 transcription we examined with ChIPs the distribution of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) on the HIV-1 genome. In cells expressing Blimp-1 there was an accumulation of RNAP II at the transcriptional start site and modest amounts of RNAP II downstream suggesting that Blimp-1 leads to RNAP II promoter proximal pausing (Fig. 4F). Diminishing Blimp-1 reduced RNAP II at the promoter and increased RNAP II downstream in provirus by 3-fold consistent with RNAP II release and greater processivity (Fig. 4F). We also used qRT-PCR to measure initiated versus elongated transcripts. In control cells there was an accumulation of initiated short HIV-1 mRNA but low expression of full length mRNA (Fig. 4G) as would be expected with RNAP II pausing (39). Decreasing Blimp-1 with shRNA altered the ratio of initiated to elongated HIV-1 mRNA so that the ratio was approximately one indicating processive transcriptional elongation (Fig 4G). Furthermore, knocking down Blimp-1 led to an increase in histone H3-acetylation (AcH3) at the positioned nucleosome (nuc-1) (Fig. 4H). These data suggest that Blimp-1 targets multiple steps of transcription regulation to limit HIV-1 transcriptional elongation.Blimp-1 was highly expressed in CD4+ TCM, TEM and TTM (Fig 1) memory cells which do not to support efficient HIV-1 transcription and contribute to the latent reservoir (34\u201336, 40). To examine whether Blimp-1 was limiting HIV-1 transcription in these cells we isolated different memory CD4+ T subsets from peripheral blood as described in Fig. 1, infected the cells with HIV-1 by spinoculation (31) and then decreased Blimp-1 with sh-Blimp-1 lentivirus. Spinoculation enhances viral binding which increases infection of cells without activating stimuli and results in higher integration rates than infection of cells in the absence of spinoculation. Decreasing Blimp-1 levels in all three CD4+ T cell memory populations resulted in significant increases, 2 to 12-fold, in HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 5B). The levels of induction correlated with the efficiency of Blimp-1 knockdowns observed with more modest induction in TCM and TEM cells in which Blimp-1 knockdowns were inefficient compared to robust induction in TTM where Blimp-1 expression was decreased by greater than 80% (Fig. 5A). These findings support a model in which Blimp-1 expression correlates with limited basal HIV-1 transcription in T memory cells.Open in a separate windowFig. 5Blimp-1 represses basal HIV-1 transcription in primary memory CD4+ T cellsTCM, TTM and TEM sorted as described above were infected with NL4-3 HIV-1 by spinoculation. 16 h post infection cells were transduced with sh-Ctrl and sh-Blimp-1. 72 h post-knockdown mRNA was collected. Expression of (A) Blimp-1 and (B) HIV-1 was measured by qRT-PCR using \u03b2-actin as a reference gene. These experiments were performed in triplicate and are representative of three separate infections from T cells obtained from three patients. Bars show average values \u00b1SD, n=3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 (Student\u2019s t test). DiscussionMemory CD4+ T cells are a major reservoir of latent HIV-1 and their longevity and homeostatic proliferation prevents virus clearance and supports HIV-1 persistence. Although several mechanisms potentially inhibit HIV-1 transcription, T cell specific transcription factors that intrinsically program the maturation of CD4+ memory T cells could contribute to the propensity of HIV-1 to become repressed in these cells. We present evidence that the lymphoid differentiation factor Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 transcription in CD4+ memory T cell subsets.Blimp-1 is expressed in a range of immune cells, such as B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. We confirmed that Blimp-1 is differentially expressed in CD4+ T cells, with low levels in CD4+ TN and CD4+ tonsillar cells but elevated expression in cells that have been shown to contribute to the latent reservoir, CD4+ TCM, TTM and TEM. It has been proposed that the reservoir is primarily made up of CD4+ TCM and to a lesser degree CD4+ TTM with CD4+ TEM representing the minority of latently infected cells (36, 40). The contribution of these cell populations to the reservoir inversely correlates with the expression levels of Blimp-1 with Blimp-1 being most highly expressed in TEM and more modestly expressed in TCM (Fig 1). Although, it is tempting to speculate that Blimp-1 may dictate the levels of HIV-1 found in each of these memory compartments, we have no evidence that Blimp-1 inhibits HIV-1 entry or the establishment of infection. Overexpression of Blimp-1 or knocking down Blimp-1 prior to HIV-1 infection has no effect on the number of proviruses as measure by Alu-HIV-LTR qPCR (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that Blimp-1 is primarily limiting transcription in these different T memory subsets.We also showed that Blimp-1 is induced upon T cell activation suggesting that Blimp-1 may have a role in limiting HIV-1 expression in non-memory T cell subsets. HIV-1 has been reported to preferentially replicate in different T effector cells such as TH2 relative to TH1 cells (41) and, although we did not specifically examine Blimp-1 expression in T effector subsets, Blimp-1 may influence HIV-1 expression as well as T cell maturation and function by regulating the expression of key lineage restricting transcription factors including PAX5, STAT6, Bcl-6 and T-bet (6, 7, 21, 42) and cytokines such as IL-10 (15, 43).Furthermore, Blimp-1 is required for robust CD4 and CD8 T cells antiviral responses against influenza and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and mediates murine gamma herpesvirus latency in splenocytes (16, 17, 44\u201346). Blimp-1 is associated with increased expression of inhibitory receptors and decreased polyfunctionality of exhausted CD4+ T cells during LCMV infection (47). In chronically infected HIV-1 patients Blimp-1 is elevated and correlates with an increase in T cell exhaustion markers (25, 26). This increase in Blimp-1 may be a direct result of infection since HIV-1 -pulsed dendritic cells enhance Blimp-1 expression (23, 24). It would be interesting to explore whether Blimp-1 limits HIV-1 transcription in different CD4+ T cell subsets similar to what is observed in different T memory subsets.Blimp-1 binds a GAAAG consensus sequence which is also found in ISREs present in Blimp-1 regulated genes CIITA, IDO1 and IFN-\u03bb1 (48\u201350). Although HIV-1 provirus contains four putative Blimp-1-binding sequences (3), we detected Blimp-1 binding only at the HIV-1 ISRE element. This cis-element has been implicated in regulating HIV-1 transcription by recruiting IRF family proteins IRF-1 and IRF-8 (51). Blimp-1 binds this element in resting cells and is displaced following T cell activation. It is possible that Blimp-1 antagonizes or competes with the transcriptional activator IRF-1, although, we do not observe significant changes in IRF-1 or IRF-8 binding in the absence or presence of Blimp-1 or in response to T cell activation. Changes in the ability of Blimp-1 to bind the HIV-1 ISRE may reflect post-translational modifications of Blimp-1 which is regulated by sumoylation and ubquitination (52, 53).Blimp-1 mediates repression of genes by recruiting epigenetic factors such as methyltransferases G9a, Prmt5 and LDS1, Groucho-proteins and histone deacetylases to promoters (54\u201358). LSD-1 and G9a limit HIV-1 transcription and are candidates for the repression observed in CD4+ memory T cells (59, 60). We observed that decreasing Blimp-1 increases acetylation at nuc-1 and releases RNAP II pausing. Blimp-1 limiting transcription elongation is also consistent with the observation that Tat cannot rescue HIV-1 expression in the presence of Blimp-1 and suggests that it is targeting a step prior to transcription elongation and recruitment of P-TEFb which is mediated by Tat.Blimp-1 can act as a transcriptional activator and is necessary for the induction of IL-10 and XBP-1 (6, 22, 61). We also observe that Blimp-1 can act as a repressor and trans-activator in primary CD4+ T cells. Intriguingly, Blimp-1 is required for efficient induction of HIV-1 transcription upon T cell activation (Fig. 4C). However, Blimp-1 does not occupy either set of binding sites following T cell activation despite increased Blimp-1 expression following CD3 + CD28 activation suggesting that Blimp-1 is not directly inducing HIV-1 transcription. The mechanism by which Blimp-1 induces HIV-1 transcription following activation is not clear and may reflect Blimp-1 interacting with other transcription factors, post-translational modifications of Blimp-1 or its ability to influence the expression of other host genes, cytokines and restriction factors that regulate HIV-1 transcription. Many transcription factors have been shown to act as negative and positive regulators. For example, in the context of RNAP II pausing, hypophosphorylated DSIF limits RNAP II processiveness, whereas, following recruitment of P-TEFb and hyperphosphylation, DSIF becomes a transcriptional activator and facilitates RNAP II transcriptional elongation (62, 63).We propose a model in which Blimp-1 is highly expressed in memory CD4+ T cells which do not support robust HIV-1 replication. In resting cells Blimp-1 binds the HIV-1 ISRE and represses HIV-1 transcription elongation whereas upon T cell activation Blimp-1 is released from HIV-1 provirus derepressing proviral transcription (Fig. 6). We show that Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor of HIV-1 and its expression in memory CD4+ T cells makes them prone to HIV-1 latency. Understanding how Blimp-1 is regulated and the transcriptional processes it coordinates to silence HIV-1 expression will provide insights into the establishment and maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir.Open in a separate windowFig. 6Model for the role of Blimp-1 in HIV-1 transcriptionBlimp-1 is highly expressed in memory CD4+ T cells, binds the HIV-1 ISRE and inhibits HIV-1 transcription in the presence of Tat. Following T cell activation Blimp-1 is released from HIV-1 provirus which correlates with increased RNAP II processivity, histone H3 acetylation and enhanced HIV-1 transcription.
