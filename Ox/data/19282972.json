Author SummaryMany proteins have an elongated structural domain formed by a stack of alpha\nhelices (alpha-rod), often found to interact with other proteins. The\nidentification of an alpha-rod in a protein can therefore tell something about\nboth the function and the structure of that protein. Though alpha-rods can be\nreadily identified from the structure of proteins, for the vast majority of\nknown proteins this is unavailable, and we have to use their amino acid\nsequence. Because alpha-rods have highly variable sequences, commonly used\nmethods of domain identification by sequence similarity have difficulty\ndetecting them. However, alpha-rods do have specific patterns of amino acid\nproperties along their sequences, so we used a computational method based on a\nneural network to learn these patterns. We illustrate how this method finds\nnovel instances of the domain in proteins from a wide range of organisms. We\nperformed detailed analysis of huntingtin, the protein mutated in\nHuntington's chorea, a neurodegenerative disease. The function of\nhuntingtin remains a mystery partially due to the lack of knowledge about its\nstructure. Therefore, we defined three alpha-rods in this protein and\nexperimentally verified how they interact with each other, a novel result that\nopens new avenues for huntingtin research. IntroductionTandems of repeated protein sequences forming structural domains occur in at least\n3% of proteins in eukaryotic organisms [1]. Characterization of\nthese repeats by sequence similarity is sometimes difficult as weak evolutionary\nconstraints cause rapid sequence divergence [2]. In particular, repeats\nincluding two alpha helices packed together then stacked to form a flexible rod\n(denoted here alpha-rod) belong to this category (see an example in Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Detection of repeats in an alpha-rod protein.Structure (alpha-backbone trace) of the 591 aa N-terminal fragment of human\nadaptor-related protein complex 2, beta 1 subunit, as forming part of the\nAP2 clathrin adaptor core [69] (PDB code 2VGL chain B). Green and blue\nrepresent residues in alpha-helix and in disordered conformation,\nrespectively. This structure has no residue in beta-strand conformation and\nis entirely composed of an alpha-rod of 14 repeats previously classified as\nHEAT repeats of type ADB [4]. The label for each repeat indicates the\nfollowing: repeat order, residue detected by the network, score of hit, and\nposition relative to residue used for training. For example, \u201c1\nN24 0.84\u22361\u201d indicates that the residue detected for\nrepeat #1 was N (amino acid code for asparagine) in position 24 of the\nsequence, with score 0.84, but that the residue in relative position 1 (that\nis, at 25) was the one used to train the network as being in the hinge. Ten\nout of the 14 repeats were detected, 8 of them with\nscore>\u200a=\u200a0.80. The inset shows\nrepeats 12 (right, top) and 1 (right, bottom) with the residue used as\npositive in the training underscored. A coloured label indicates the residue\nidentified by the network after training, which in both cases is not the one\ngiven in the training but others belonging to the hinge (E25 and S438). The\nfigure was generated using NCBI's linked viewer, Cn3D [70].Some of these alpha-rod repeats have been defined in terms of sequence similarity and\nare widespread in multiple protein families: HEAT [3],[4], Armadillo [5] and HAT\n[6].\nOthers are evident in just one protein family, for example the PFTA repeats [7]. Some,\nhowever, bear no statistically significant sequence similarity and may not have\noriginated from sequence duplication (for example, the all-helical VHS domain in\nDrosophila melanogaster Hrs protein [8], or the subunit H of\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar ATP synthase [9]).This divergence complicates the detection of alpha-rod repeats by methods based on\nsequence similarity. For example, profile-based methods used in the protein domain\ndatabases PFAM [10] and SMART [11] detect only two of the\n14 HEAT repeats of human AP-2 complex subunit beta-1 (Figure 1), and might fail to detect any repeats\nin other alpha-rod containing sequences.Despite the heterogeneity of alpha-rod repeats, they have common features (discussed\nin [4]):\nlength of about 40 amino acids, anti-parallel alpha-helices, and constraints given\nby the packing of consecutive repeats. This suggests that alpha-rod repeats are a\nprotein structural feature that obeys some physical constraints irrespective of\ntheir evolutionary origin and particular sequence. Coiled coils and transmembrane\nalpha-helices are other examples of such structural features. Statistical methods\nhave been used to predict coiled coils [12] and transmembrane\nalpha-helices [13] with excellent reliability, using algorithms that\nlearn to recognize these features from amino acid sequences. In particular,\nback-propagation neural networks [14] have been used with\nsuccess to predict secondary structure [15],[16], transmembrane\nalpha-helices [17], and protein residue solvent accessibility [18].We hypothesized that a back-propagation neural network could be better suited than\nhomology based methods for the detection of different types of alpha-rod repeats, if\ntrained in an appropriate set of sequences containing these repeats. The last ten\nyears have seen the resolution of a sufficient number of protein 3D structures of\nsequences with alpha-rod repeats to provide a useful training set for such\npredictions. ResultsWe manually compiled a set of protein sequences with known structures reported to\ncontain structural repetitions forming an alpha-rod composed of stacked repeats (see\nsupplementary Table S1 in Text S1, positives). To reduce redundancy, no two\nsequences with more than 70% identity were included in the set (after\nverifying that they were full length homologs). We included one protein from each of\nthree HEAT repeat types [4], two armadillo repeat proteins, and five other\nunrelated proteins. A similar sized set of sequences adopting a variety of\nstructures but without alpha-rod repeats was compiled as a negative set (Table S1 in\nText S1,\nnegatives).The input window of the neural network was chosen to be 39 amino acids, which is\nclose to the average repeat length. Since these repeats are characterized by two\nhelices of similar size, we chose as the central defining feature the middle residue\nin the hinge between the two helices. This residue should be equidistant from two\nsecondary structure elements with particular packing features, likely presenting a\nperiodicity of small and hydrophobic residues constrained by the intra-repeat\ninteractions between the two helices and the inter-repeat interactions with the\nstack of consecutive repeats [4]. Therefore, the network was trained to detect the\ncentral residue of the hinge (see Methods). The file with the annotated sequences\nused for the training is provided as supplementary Dataset S1.Analysis of Proteins of Known StructureThe parameters of the method were optimized using the analysis of proteins of\nknown structure. We found that hits above a score of 0.8 were reliable,\nespecially when the protein had several of them in the appropriate periodicity.\nIdentification of a sequence as containing an alpha-rod was optimal when\nrequiring at least three hits above a score of 0.8 with a minimum spacing of 30\namino acids between hits and a maximum of 135. Further details can be found in\nthe supplementary Text S1.A total of 87 sequences were selected with this threshold, which can be grouped\nin 12 protein families of which 8 were not homologous to those used in the\ntraining set (Table S2 in Text S1). Since these examples correspond to\nproteins of known structure, it was easy to visually verify that of those eight\nfamilies seven were true positives and only one constituted a false positive.\nHomology of these proteins to the ones used in the training is extremely low or\nstatistically non-significant. Therefore, we concluded that the network was\nuseful in expanding our current knowledge of the occurrences of these repeats\nand we set to demonstrate this. For simplicity we will denote our methodology as\nARD (Alpha-rod Repeat Detection) henceforth.Analysis of Complete GenomesTo illustrate the coverage of the method we analyzed the complete protein sets\nfrom a series of fully sequenced organisms. The threshold tested in the analysis\nof PDB was used to select positive sequences. The results of the analysis are in\nTable 1. The fractions\nof alpha-rod repeat proteins are around 0.4% for the nine eukaryotic\ngenomes and lower (0.05%\u20130.21%) in the three\nprokaryotic organisms tested. No correlation was found between proteome size and\nfraction of positives.Table 1Results of predictions in complete genomes.OrganismProteinsHits1\nGenesFraction\nHomo sapiens\n43797159860.36%\nMus musculus\n32241125930.39%\nMonodelphis domestica\n32685131810.40%\nGallus gallus\n22250102750.46%\nXenopus tropicalis\n2832496690.34%\nDanio rerio\n36078116850.32%\nDrosophila melanogaster\n1978952410.26%\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n669723230.34%\nGibberella zeae\n1164037370.32%\nEscherichia coli\n4133220.05%\nAnabaena variabilis ATCC 29413\n563411110.20%\nMethanosarcina mazei\n3303770.21%Open in a separate window1At least three matches with\nscore>\u200a=\u200a0.8 and with\n>\u200a=\u200a30 aa spacing.Using ARD we were able to detect protein sequences that PFAM [10] and\nSMART [11] do not detect or that they detect with multiple\nprofiles (PFAM: Arm, HEAT_PBS and HEAT; SMART: ARM, EZ_HEAT and HEAT). Many of\nthese were not described in the literature.To illustrate the ability of ARD to identify new results we will focus on\nfamilies with at least one human gene. To illustrate how the method covers\nvarious profiles used by SMART and PFAM we will examine results on families with\nHEAT repeats of the PBS type from fungi, bacteria, and archaea. Finally, we\nillustrate an experimental application of the method to dissect domains in\nhuntingtin, the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, for which\nlittle is known regarding its structure and function.Survey of Human GenesA total of 86 human proteins were found to contain alpha-rod repeats, which we\ngrouped in 52 families on the basis of their sequence similarity. Of those\nfamilies, at least 16 have not been yet described to contain alpha-rod repeats\nin the literature, with 9 undetected by both the SMART and PFAM domain detection\nweb tools (see Table 2).Table 2Selected predictions for human genesa.RepresentativeDescriptionAb\nSPRRefc\nRelatedd\nNovelSTAG1Homologs of yeast subunit of the\ncohesin complex 3 (Scc3/IRR1)4000uSTAG2 STAG3SERAC1serine active site containing 13000uC8orf735000uC17orf666000uKIAA0423LOC2311611005uPSMD1proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase family5000uPSMD2 PSMD5No PFAM/SMARTMROMaestro3000\n[30]\n{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NP_775760.2\",\"term_id\":\"38564325\",\"term_text\":\"NP_775760.2\"}}NP_775760.2 Q8NDA8_HUMAN Q8ND95_HUMANNIPBLNipped-B homolog (Drosophila)7005\n[31]\nFRAP1FRAP1/mTOR160011\n[3]\nDomain redefinitionRRP12Ribosomal RNA processing 12 homolog (yeast)9110\n[28]\nCLASP1CLASP family10447\n[38]\nCLASP2CKAP5CKAP5183310\n[31]\nNot reported in literatureKIAA14686030uHEATR296611uHEATR49030uHEATR67224uTMCO77020uSTK36Serine/threonine kinase 36, fused homolog\n(Drosophila)7330uINTS4integrator complex subunit 48555uQ96LV5_HUMANRTDR1Rhabdoid tumor deletion region protein 1601*\n0uLOC1651867110uC1orf1756010uOpen in a separate windowaHits not included: reported in the literature (SF3B1, MMS19,\nhuntingtin, PSME4, NCAPD3, NCAPG2, TBCD, BTAF1, KOG1, PDS5B);\narmadillo repeats (JUP, RAP1GDS1); likely false positives (OBSCN,\nP2RY8, PACS2); other genes homologous to 3D structures discussed\nbefore.bPredicted number of repeats by ARD (A), SMART (S), PFAM (P), REP\n(R).cReference column. \u201cu\u201d indicates unknown from the\npoint of view of the literature.dClose homologous genes are indicated.*: Armadillo repeat.In particular, six families have neither literature nor database repeat\nassignment; for these, we could verify the repeats using a manually tuned\niterative PSIBLAST sequence search [19] of the region\nwith repeats, which showed significant similarity to alpha-rod repeat regions in\nother protein families. Four of these families encode proteins of unknown\nfunction: Serac1, C8orf73, C17orf66, and KIAA0423 (and homolog LOC23116). A\nfifth family has three members in humans, the stromal antigens 1, 2 and 3\n(STAG1-3), subunits of the cohesin complex, which mediates cohesion between\nsister chromatids [20]. In particular, the phosphorylation of STAG2\nis essential for cohesin dissociation during prophase and prometaphase [21]. This\nfamily has two homologs in Xenopus (demonstrated to form part\nof two different cohesion complexes [22]), the plant\nArabidopsis thaliana (Scc3, needed for the orientation of\nthe kinetochores during meiosis [23]) and yeast\n(Irr1/Scc3, involved in cell wall integrity [24]). The analysis of the\nfamily suggests that their sequences are composed of alpha-rod repeats (Figure 2 and Figure S3A in\nText\nS1).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Selected human protein families with alpha-rod repeats.The cartoon summarizes the findings for seven human proteins. The green\nellipses represent regions of alpha-rod repeats as deduced by a\ncombination of our method, analysis of homologs, and iterative sequence\nanalysis. Further details for each case, including an overview of repeat\npredictions and regions with amino acid bias overlaid to the multiple\nsequence alignment of the family using an update of the BiasViz software\n[71] are available as supplementary Figure\nS3 in Text S1.The sixth novel assignment case is the PSMD family (proteasome 26S subunit,\nnon-ATPase) members 1, and 2, and 5. PFAM/SMART identify these as containing\nrepeats of the Proteasome/cyclosome (PC_rep), originally predicted to be\ncomposed of a beta strand and a alpha helix [25]. However, ARD\npredicts 5 repeats which overlap with those. Secondary structure predictions\n(using JPRED3 [26]) and homology to alpha-rod repeats proposed\nfor PSMD1 yeast homolog Sen3/RPN2 [27] clearly suggest\nthat these are alpha-rod repeats, and that the current PC_rep motif used by\nPFAM/SMART cuts one of the helices in half. This suggests that the PFAM/SMART\ndomain definition should be revised.Another family for which a redefinition of the PFAM/SMART profile may be required\nis RRP12, homolog to the yeast Ribosomal RNA processing 12, identified as\nHEAT-repeat containing, Ran binding, and required for the nuclear export of both\nthe 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits in yeast [28]. SMART and PFAM\nidentify only one HEAT repeat in the human sequence because other repeats\noverlap with domain NUC173, defined as present in several nucleolar proteins\n[29], whereas ARD identifies 9 repeats.Three other families remain undetected by PFAM and SMART profiles but have been\ndescribed to contain alpha-rod repeats in separate publications: these are the\nMRO (Maestro), which expresses a nucleolar protein of unknown function during\nmale mouse gonad development [30], FRAP1/mTOR, which we described as repeat\ncontaining in the first publication defining the HEAT repeats [3]\n(Figure 2 and Figure S3B\nin Text\nS1), and NIPBL (the homolog to Drosophila Nipped-B)\nrelated to sister chromatid cohesion yeast proteins Scc2 and Mist4 [31].For ten other gene families, PFAM and SMART suggest the presence of the repeats\nbut their coverage is more limited than that of ARD and this evidence remains\nunreported in the literature. This is the case of STK36/FU (the homolog to\nDrosophila fused, a mediator of sensitivity to PARP [32]),\nINTS4 (integrator complex subunit 4, which associates with the C-terminal domain\nof RNA polymerase II large subunit [33]), and of eight\nhypothetical proteins: C1orf175, LOC165186, HEATR2, HEATR4, HEATR6, KIAA1468,\nRTDR1 (deleted in rhabdoid tumour), and TMCO7 (which interacts with MACF1, the\nmicrotubule-actin crosslinking factor 1 according to a two-hybrid screening\n[34]).The combination of ARD analyses of the human protein homologs in other organisms,\nsecondary structure prediction and definition of regions of amino acid\ncomposition bias facilitates the definition of the boundaries of domains\ncomposed of repeats sometimes reused in different domain architectures. Here we\npresent three examples.We found that the LOC165186 and KIAA0423 hypothetical human proteins (mentioned\nabove) define two families whose structured sequence is likely alpha-rods; these\ntwo proteins share a C-terminal domain possibly made of more than 10 repeats\n(Figure 2 and Figure S3C\nin Text\nS1). LOC165186, conserved in mammals, has an additional N-terminal\ncomposition biased region of around 500 amino acids, whereas KIAA0423, conserved\ndown to worms, has an extra N-terminal domain of alpha-rod repeats connected to\nthe C-terminal repeat domain by a middle linker that is enlarged in the chordate\nsequences.Human CKAP5/TOG (cytoskeleton associated protein 5), a component of the\ncentrosome that is required for spindle pole assembly [35], has\nsimilar-length homologs in mammals, frog, and fly. Analysis of the family\nidentifies five alpha-rods of six repeats each in these sequences and a\nC-terminal non-repeat containing domain (Figure 2 and Figure S3D in Text S1).\nThe worm homologs are shorter since they have only three of the repeat domains.\nThe structure of one of those domains in Caenorhabditis elegans\nzyg9 was solved and confirmed the presence of an alpha-rod of six repeats [36].The CLASP family proteins are microtubule-associated proteins, conserved in\nanimals, fungi, and plants [37]. In humans,\nthere are two homologs, hCLASP1 and hCLASP2, which, similar to CKAP5, associate\nwith the ends of growing microtubules to participate in mitotic spindle\nformation [38]. Their multiple sequence alignment with\nhomologs suggests that they are formed by four alpha-rods (Figure 2 and Figure S3E in Text S1),\nalso noted in [38].Other genes previously identified in the literature and by SMART/PFAM are: TBCD\n(tubulin folding cofactor D) reported by [31]; PSME4/PA200,\nidentified as containing 18 HEAT-like repeats in [39]; BTAF1 (RNA\npolymerase II, B-TFIID transcription factor-associated, 170 kDa) whose homolog\nin yeast, Mot1, was noted by [31]; MMS19, involved in nucleotide excision\nrepair and transcription, noted by [40]; huntingtin [3];\nboth subunits of non-SMC condensin II complex D3 and G2, noted by [31];\nand PDS5B/APRIN, a chromatin regulator in hormonal differentiation [41],\nwhose homolog Spo76 in Sordaria macrospore was noted by [31].The existence of two cases where the evidence of repeats originates from low\nresolution electron microscopy images deserves special mention. SF3B1 (splicing\nfactor 3b, subunit 1) is proposed to have 22 repeats according to the structure\nobtained by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution of less than\n10 angstroms of its complex with splicing factor 3a (SF3B14/P14) where it is\nshown to coil around SF3B14 [42]. The low resolution electron microscopy\nstructure of the yeast complex of mTOR with KOG1 suggests that KOG1 has a middle\nalpha-rod domain [41]. We can confirm through ARD analysis that\nboth SF3B1 and KOG1 have alpha-rods in the regions suggested.As noted in the section on analysis of PDB, armadillo repeats are not well\ndetected by ARD and generally PFAM and SMART are as good or better than ARD in\nrecognizing them (for example, for JUP and ARMC8). However, two genes are\ndetected by ARD that are covered by one single PFAM armadillo match and no SMART\nmatches: these are HSPBP1 (hsp70-interacting protein) whose solved 3D structure\nindicates four armadillo repeats [43] and newly\nidentified RTRD1, for which we detect 3 and 6 repeats, respectively.Finally, of all 52 protein families with human genes we recognized just three\nfalse positives: PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2), OBSCN\n(obscurin, cytoskeletal calmodulin and titin-interacting RhoGEF), and P2RY9\n(purinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 8). This was determined by lack of\nfurther evidence (no homology to regions with repeats in other families,\nincompatible secondary structure predictions) combined with a small number of\nhits in the human sequence, in homologs in other species, or by the overlap of\nthose hits with other domains.Short Repeats Highly Identical within Protein SequencesIn the results of fungal and prokaryotic sequences, we noted a number of cases\nwhere the repeats identified for the sequences selected were so similar that it\nwas possible to align most of the repeats by hand in stark contrast to the very\ndivergent examples noted above. We illustrate these with 8 examples, which are\nnot related by homology (see Table S3 in Text S1). Their high percentage of\ninter-repeat sequence identity is indicative of very recent events of\nduplication occurring independently in these eight examples. Secondary structure\nprediction suggests that the structure of the repeat is composed of two helices\nof \u223c10 residues, with a middle loop of three, and an outer loop of\n\u223c10 residues, for a total length of 31\u201335 aa.Although most of the repeats were identified by SMART and PFAM (EZ_HEAT and\nHEAT_PBS profiles, respectively), not all repeat instances were marked and some\nwere detected with the alternative HEAT profile. In contrast, ARD identified all\nobvious repetitions and some additional borderline ones.Orthologs of these eight examples were identified in related taxa (Table S3 in\nText\nS1). The puzzling question remains of why or how these eight apparently\nunrelated families arose and converged to these short alpha-rod repeats. Whether\nthere are common mechanisms for the duplication and selection of these repeats\nand for their functions is, at the moment, unclear.Dissecting HuntingtinThe human protein huntingtin is involved in Huntington's disease. Its\nfunction remains unclear [44]. In 1995 we described that huntingtin\ncontains HEAT repeats [3] but their identification was restricted to 10\nunits covering \u223c400 scattered amino acids out of a total sequence length\nof 3144 amino acids. Since then, no other characteristic structural features\nhave been described for this protein, which complicates its description in terms\nof separate domains with independent folds and functions. As a result no 3D\nstructure of any fragment of this protein has been yet solved, and although\ninteracting partners of this protein have been found they are mostly restricted\nto the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the protein [45]. Here, we applied\nthe methodology described above to define alpha-rods in huntingtin and\nsubsequently tested the validity of our predictions experimentally.Initially, we produced an alignment of human huntingtin with a representative set\nof homologous sequences from the database (provided as supplementary Dataset\nS2). For this we used not only sequences from protein databases but also\nsequences derived from ESTs and from genomic fragments. We identified for the\nfirst time the existence of huntingtin homologs in worms (nematoda genus\nCaenorhabditis, and annelida Capitella\nsp.), amoebae (Naegleria fowleri and\nDictyostelium discoideum), sea anemone Nematostella\nvectensis, and choanoflagellate Monosiga\nbrevicollis, notably expanding the scope of this family. We did not\nfind homologs of huntingtin in fungi.The analysis of human huntingtin by ARD suggests six matches but other low\nscoring hits are consistently present in homologs. Comparison to biased regions\nsharply defines two N-terminal domains of six and seven repeats (H1 from amino\nacid 114 to 413 and H2 from 672 to 969) and suggests the existence of a\nC-terminal domain of seven repeats (H3 from 2667 to 2938) (Figure 2 and Figure S3F in Text S1).\nIterative sequence searches using PSIBLAST with these regions indicated homology\nto HEAT repeats in otherwise unrelated proteins in the 2nd or\n3rd iterations. Consistently, sequence analysis suggested a\nHEAT-repeat fold (using SVMfold [46]), and threading suggested that those regions\nadopt a HEAT-repeat fold with high likelihood (using GenTHREADER [47]).\nThe comparative protein structure modeling tool TASSER-Lite [48]\nproduced an alpha-rod for H1 and H2, but an alpha-beta barrel for H3\n(incompatible with the predicted secondary structure of the region using JPRED3\n[26]). Given secondary structure predictions and\nscattered matches it is tempting to speculate that other alpha-rods exist\noutside of the H1, H2, and H3 domains. However, we were unable to obtain\nconsistent results using PSIBLAST or threading for fragments outside these\nregions.To test our predictions, we produced huntingtin fragments spanning the complete\nsequence of the protein but separating the predicted alpha-rods into different\nfragments (Figure 3A) in\norder to study intra-molecular domain interactions in huntingtin by yeast two\nhybrid (Y2H) assays (see Methods). Our rationale is that only well defined\ndomains will fold and produce interactions, whereas wrongly defined domains will\neither not interact or produce nonspecific interactions.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Study of interactions between fragments of huntingtin.(A) Schematic overview of huntingtin fragments used in Y2H and LUMIER\nexperiments. (B) The results obtained with the Y2H assays. (C) The\nexpression of different fusion pairs was analyzed by Western blot using\nantibodies against V5-epitope (Invitrogen, 1\u22365000, monoclonal\nantibody) and Protein-A (Sigma 1\u22362000, polyclonal antibody);\n15 \u00b5l from 100 \u00b5l of each cell extract was loaded\nonto SDS-PAGE gel. Detection with anti-tubulin antibodies was used as a\nloading control. (D) Firefly luciferase activities of immunopurified\nprotein complexes in relative fluorescence units (RFU).We found that the huntingtin fragment Htt507-1230 with the H2 domain\nself-associates in the Y2H assays. In addition, interactions between Htt507-1230\nand Htt1-506Q23 (H1 domain) as well as with the fragment Htt2721-3144 (H3\ndomain) were observed (Figure\n3B). No other interactions were observed.The results obtained with the Y2H assays were also confirmed in mammalian cells\nusing a modified version of the LUMIER method (luminescence-based mammalian\ninteractome mapping technology, [49]). Protein A\n(PA)-Renilla luciferase- and Firefly-V5 luciferase (Luc)-tagged huntingtin\nfusion proteins were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and were assessed for the\nexpression of the fusion proteins by immunoblotting and luciferase assays (Figure 3C and 3D). The\nPA-Renilla-tagged fusion protein is then immunoprecipitated from the soluble\ncell extracts with IgG coated Dynal magnetic beads. After washing, binding of\nthe Firefly-V5 Luc-tagged fusion protein is quantified by measuring the firefly\nluciferase activity in a luminescence plate reader. As shown in Figure 3D, interactions\nbetween the huntingtin fragments Htt1-506Q23 and Htt507-1230, Htt507-1230 and\nHtt507-1230, Htt507-1230 and Htt2721-3144 were observed with the assays.Taken together, these experimental results give the first evidence of domains in\nhuntingtin that mediate potential intra- as well as inter-molecular huntingtin\ninteractions. One of many plausible structural assemblies of\nhuntingtin's domains that are consistent with our results and with\nthose in the literature is discussed in Figure 4.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Hypothetical 3D structure of huntingtin.The cartoon represents a hypothetical model of huntingtin interactions\nconsistent with our results. (a) The N-terminus with the poly-Q tail\n(red arch) is followed by the H1 alpha-rod domain (residues 114 to 431,\nyellow cylinder), a small domain (432 to 671, blue), the H2 alpha-rod\ndomain (672 to 969, yellow), a large domain (970 to 2666, green), the H3\nalpha-rod domain (2667 to 2938), and a small C-terminal domain\n(2939\u20133144). (b) The three rods could assemble by coiling\nanti-parallel to each other with H2 in the middle: that would explain\nthe interactions between H1 and H2, and between H2 and H3. (c) Formation\nof a huntingtin homodimer [66] with a second molecule of huntingtin\n(gray) could happen through their H2 domains. The N-terminal poly-Q tail\nand the H1 domain remain exposed and can interact with other proteins,\nas previously reported [45]. The figure was produced with Google\nSketchUp. DiscussionPerformance of the MethodWe have developed and applied a neural network for the prediction of alpha-rod\nrepeats. Analysis of the results suggests that it discovers more\nrepeat-containing proteins and repeats per protein than sequence similarity\nbased methods using manually curated profiles, which were previously the best\nmethod to detect these repeats. We estimate a level of false positives below\n10%: 1 in 12 families in the analysis of PDB (approximately\n8%), 3 in 52 families in the analysis of human genes (below\n6%). The level of false negatives could be eventually reduced by\nexpanding the training set after new structures of sequences with alpha-rod\nrepeats are solved, but one must be cautious about this to avoid\nover-prediction. Here, we preferred to train the neural network with a\nconservative set of known structures to demonstrate that they allow detection of\nrecently identified cases.We consider it very encouraging that the network learned from a small number of\nexamples and generalized to recognize repeats not used in the training, e.g. the\nshorter PBS lyase repeats, or those found for the first time in six human\nprotein families. Most of the repeats detected correspond to HEAT, PBS, and\nArmadillo.Whereas the network effectively detected a number of unrelated alpha-rod repeat\ntypes, it failed to detect the HAT repeats [6]. Although their\nlength is similar, their structural arrangement in highly parallel helices [50] and\nthe conservation of aromatic residues [51] make them\nsignificantly different from HEAT and Armadillo repeats explaining why they\ncannot be detected by our method.The performance of PFAM, SMART and ARD in predicting each type of alpha-rod\nrepeats in sequences deposited in the PDB database is summarized in Table 3. ARD outperforms\nPFAM and SMART in the detection of HEAT and PBS repeats but underperforms in the\ndetection of Armadillo repeats (although it identifies some proteins with\nArmadillo repeats that escape detection by both PFAM and SMART, see Table S2 in\nText\nS1). The proteins in PDB that are currently annotated with HAT repeat\nregions are detected exclusively by SMART.Table 3Evaluation of the predictions of PFAM, SMART and ARD, for all\nproteins in the PDB with four types of alpha-rod repeats.PFAM1\n%SMART2\n%ARD%TotalHEAT2136005810058PBS1251253754Armadillo44805090285055HAT007100007Open in a separate window1PFAM profiles used were PF02984 (HEAT), PF03130 (PBS), PF00514\n(Armadillo) and PF02184 (HAT).2SMART profiles used were SM00567 (PBS), SM00185 (Armadillo) and\nSM00386 (HAT).Evolutionary and Structural ImplicationsThe lack of a common evolutionary origin for all repeats forming alpha-rods\nindicates that some specific constraints drive convergent evolution to\nrepeatedly rediscover these repeats as a common solution to a general functional\nneed: protein\u2013protein interactions. Structures of alpha-rods suggest\nthat they are extremely flexible and this allows the ensemble to coil around\ntheir target as a boa constrictor would do with its prey. A good example is\ngiven by the structure of Exportin Cse1p in complex with Kap60p and RanGTP,\nwhere both Cse1p and Kap60p are alpha-rods which wrap around each other, and\nCse1p wraps around RanGTP [52].The necessity to coil around proteins possibly explains why the length of these\nrepeats varies between 30 and 45 amino acids. Shorter repeats might not produce\nenough interactions between the units to form the rod; consequently the rod\nwould not be stable enough and would unfold too easily. Longer repeats might not\nproduce a rod flexible enough to coil around typical protein targets of\ndiameters in the range of 30 to 50 angstroms.The current data from protein structures and the predictions of protein domains\nfor proteins with alpha-rods (See Table S2 in Text S1)\ndoes not suggest the co-occurrence of alpha-rods with other protein domains. We\nthink that this constitutes further evidence that alpha-rods can be used pretty\nmuch to bind any protein as needed.Functions of Proteins with Alpha-RodsNeuwald and Hirano identified in [31] several novel\nHEAT-repeat containing proteins with functions related to chromosomal\norganization and microtubule interaction. In agreement with this, here we have\nidentified many alpha-rod repeat containing sequences with related functions,\nnotably direct tubulin binding.A well characterized example is the TOG domain (an alpha-rod of HEAT repeats),\nwhich binds tubulin heterodimers to assist addition of tubulin to the plus-end\nof microtubules [53]; the crystal structure of the TOG domain in\nCaenorhabditis elegans Zyg9 suggests how this interaction\nmay happen through intra-repeat turns [36]. There is\nevidence of other microtubule-interacting sequences with alpha-rod repeats:\nyeast Stu2p binds tubulin [36], clathrin-coated vesicles are assembled along\nmicrotubules [54], the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) binds to\nmicrotubules [55], armadillo-repeat containing sperm antigen 6\n(Spag6) colocalizes with microtubules [56] (its homolog in\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii is PF16, involved in\nprotein\u2013protein interactions required for microtubule stability and\nflagellar motility [57]), huntingtin association with microtubules\nwas initially found in vitro [58] and then with the beta subunit of tubulin in\nvivo [59].A particular case is the plant specific family Tortifolia1/TOR1/SPR2, first\ncharacterized in Arabidopsis thaliana as microtubule-associated\nprotein and containing HEAT repeats [60]. Its N-terminal\nHEAT repeat domain has been proven to bind to tubulin [61]. Our analysis suggests\nthat this domain possibly contains seven repeats and is distantly related to the\nCLASP family (data not shown). Several non-plant protozoan sequences (in amoeba\nDictyostelium discoideum, and in ciliates\nParamecium tetraurelia strain d4-2 and Tetrahymena\nthermophila SB210) are more similar to the plant family than to\ndistantly related metazoan members hinting at a complex evolution for this\nfamily, possibly involving horizontal transfer events between plants and\nprotozoa (data not shown).Other proteins with alpha-rod repeats not known to be directly involved in\ninteraction with microtubules or tubulin have broadly associated functions:\nexcess importin-beta blocks kinetochore-associated microtubule formation and\nenhances centrosome-associated microtubule formation [62], STAG/Scc3 localizes\nto the spindle poles during mitosis and interacts with NuMA, a spindle\npole-associated factor required for mitotic spindle organization [60].This evidence further confirms a general function of eukaryotic alpha-rods in the\norganization of cellular structure, chromosome segregation, vesicular transport,\nand control of cell division by protein\u2013protein interactions that tend\nto involve the microtubules if not tubulin subunits directly.Study of HuntingtinWe demonstrated how to combine information from homologous proteins and secondary\nstructure predictions for a better definition of domains of repeats. We used\nthis approach to define three domains of alpha-rod repeats in human huntingtin:\nH1 between positions 114\u2013413, H2 between 672\u2013969, and H3\nbetween 2667\u20132938 (Figure\n3A). The definition of these three domains correlates well with\nprevious definitions of cleavage sites in huntingtin. In striatum of brains from\npatients of Huntington's disease a 40\u201350 kDa N-terminal and a\nC-terminal 30\u201350 kDa fragment are observed [63], which would\ninclude H1 and H3, respectively. In addition, several caspase cleavage sites\nhave been verified for huntingtin in positions 513, 552 and 586 [64], which fall in between predicted H1 and H2\nalpha-rods.Using our predictions, we verified for the first time interactions between\ndomains of human huntingtin. These involve three domains of HEAT-repeats.\nInteractions between domains composed of HEAT-repeats are known. For example,\nseveral of the subunits of the AP1 clathrin adaptor core are an alpha-rod of\nHEAT-repeats and interact with each other [65]. We observed the\nself-association of one of the huntingtin fragments containing a HEAT-repeat\ndomain. This suggests the possibility that huntingtin homodimerizes through\ninter-molecular association of this domain, in agreement with previous reports\n[66].\nHomodimerization through interaction of domains with HEAT repeats has been\nsuggested for the DNA-PKc/Ku70/Ku80 complex [67].The interaction of these domains implies their folding in functional units that\ncorrespond to the boundaries we have defined. These results are the first\ndemonstration of domains in huntingtin. This opens avenues for further research\ninto the structure and function of this large protein, which had been hampered\nuntil now by its lack of definition in terms of structural units. It is now\npossible to study the interaction of huntingtin with other proteins on a per\ndomain basis.ConclusionWe have provided a way forward for the description of these elusive repeats that\nwill facilitate the characterization of domains, structures, and eventually\nfunctions of a large number of proteins, possibly up to 0.5% of the\nproteomes of eukaryotic organisms. Further work is needed to expand the scope of\nthe method, for example to detect HAT repeats and conceivably other as-yet\nundiscovered alpha-rod repeats. To facilitate the use of the method we have made\nit available at http://www.ogic.ca/projects/ard. Results of the analysis of protein\nfamilies can be studied together using ARD in combination with secondary\nstructure predictions via an updated version of our BiasViz multiple sequence\nalignment viewer (http://biasviz.sourceforge.net). MethodsNeural NetworkWe used a neural network of feed-forward type with three layers of neurons [14]. Inputs were obtained by scanning the sequence\nwith a 39 amino acid window. The encoding procedure converts the sequence into a\nbinary string where each amino acid is codified by the binary pattern. The\nlength of the entry layer is 39 times 20, where 20 is the number of possible\namino acids. One hidden layer with three neurons is used for connecting the\ninputs with the output layer containing one neuron predicting whether the window\nis on a repeat or not (e.g. takes real values from 0.1 to 0.9 where the larger\nvalues indicates the larger probability of the repeat detection). This\narchitecture was found to be optimal in terms of recall and precision on the\ntraining set and computation time required for training and evaluation. Further\ndetails of algorithm and training procedure are available in the supplementary\nText\nS1.Cloning of Huntingtin FragmentsDNA fragments coding for huntingtin fragments separating predicted domains of\nalpha-rod repeats were generated by PCR amplification using pAC1-HD plasmid as\ntemplate. PCR reactions contained, in a 50 \u00b5l volume, \u223c50 ng\nplasmid DNA, 15 pmol primer oligonucleotides, 20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.8, 2.5 mM\nMgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 2.5 U Pwo DNA\npolymerase (Sigma). Fragments were amplified in 30 cycles with the following\nprofile: 60 s denaturation at 94\u00b0C followed by 120 s annealing at\n45\u201365\u00b0C and 120 s extension at 72\u00b0C. Amplified DNA\nproducts were isolated from 1.2% agarose gel and recombined into\nGATEWAY compatible pDONR221 plasmid (Invitrogen), thus creating the desired\nentry DNA plasmids. The identity of all PCR products was verified by DNA\nsequencing. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to generate\nhuntingtin fragments are available at the supplementary Text S1.Recombination of entry vectors with pACT-DM and pBTM116_D9 plasmids was used to\ncreate prey and bait plasmid constructs for Y2H interaction mating,\nrespectively. Recombination of different DNA fragments was checked by BsrGI\nrestriction.Y2H Analysis of Huntingtin FragmentsDNA sequences encoding the huntingtin fragments Htt1-506Q23, Htt507-1230,\nHtt1223-1941, Htt1934-2666, Htt2536-3144 and Htt2721-3144 were sub-cloned into\nDNA binding domain (baits) and activation domain (preys) Y2H plasmids using\nGATEWAY technology (Invitrogen) and a matrix of individual MATa and MATalpha\nyeast strains was generated for systematic interaction mating [68].\nThen, yeast strains expressing bait and prey proteins were mixed in 96-well\nmicrotiter plates and diploid yeast strains were formed on YPD agar plates. Y2H\ninteractions were scored by the frequency of appearance on the SDIV agar plates\nand \u03b2-galactosidase activity in SDII and SDIV nylon membranes,\nrespectively. Growth in SDII-agar was monitored as a mating control.Cell Line, Cell Culture and Western BlotHuman embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured in\nDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C and 5%\nCO2. Co-transfection of plasmids was done using Lipofectamine 2000\n(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The analyses were\nperformed after 48 hours of transfection. For immunoblotting and LUMIER assay,\ncells were lysed at 4\u00b0C for 40 min in 100 \u00b5l lysis buffer\ncontaining 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH\u200a=\u200a7.4, 150 mM\nNaCl, 0.1% NP40, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 75\nUnit/ml Benzonase (Merck) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche\nDiagnostic). The expression of the constructs was analyzed by Western blot using\nantibodies against V5-epitope (Invitrogen) and Protein-A (Sigma), while equal\nprotein loading with anti-tubulin antibodies (Figure 3C).LUMIER AssayFor LUMIER assay two vectors were generated based on pCDNA3.1(+)\n(Clontech). For the pPAReni-DM the following cassette was cloned between the\nBamHI and XbaI sites: Kozak sequence, a double protein A epitope, Renilla\nLuciferase and the ccdB cassette with flanking R1 and R2 att-sites. For the\npFireV5-DM vector the following cassette was cloned between the BamHI and XbaI\nsites: firefly Luciferase, V5 epitope and the ccdB cassette with flanking R1 and\nR2 att-sites. (Sequences of cloned inserts are in Supplementary Table S4 in\nText\nS1).Pairs of PA-Renilla and firefly-V5-tagged huntingtin-fragment fusion proteins\nwere co-expressed in HEK293 cells. Cell extracts were prepared and assessed for\nthe expression of the fusion proteins by immunoblotting and luciferase assays.\nProtein complexes were isolated from 70 \u00b5l cell extracts using 5\n\u00b5l IgG-coated Dynal magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Sheep anti-Rabbit\nIgG), subsequently washed with 100 \u00b5l PBS, and the binding of the\nfirefly-V5-tagged fusion huntingtin fragment (Co-IP) to the PA-Renilla-tagged\nfusion huntingtin fragment protein was quantified by measuring the firefly\nluciferase activity in a luminescence plate reader (TECAN Infinite M200).\nRenilla activity was also measured as a control for PA-Renilla constructs\nexpression and binding (IP, data not shown). Luciferase activity was measured\nusing the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a luminescence plate\nreader (TECAN Infinite M200). Each experiment was performed as triplicate\ntransfection.
