{"title": "A U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle with altered specificity induces alternative splicing of an adenovirus E1A mRNA precursor", "pubDate": "1989", "PMCID": "PMC362389", "DOI": "10.1128/mcb.9.8.3429-3437.1989", "PMID": "2477685", "abstract": "We have altered the specificity of U1 small nuclear RNA by replacing its 5' splice site recognition sequence (nucleotides 3 to 11) with sequences complementary to other regions of either the adenovirus E1A or the rabbit beta-globin mRNA precursor. We then used a HeLa cell transient expression assay to test whether such altered U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) could interfere with splicing of the targeted mRNA precursors. The altered U1 snRNPs were able to cause novel splicing of the E1A mRNA precursor, minor changes in the ratio of E1A 12 to 13S mRNAs, and modest nuclear accumulation of beta-globin mRNA precursors with either one of the two introns removed. Most of the altered U1 snRNPs did not affect the level of mature cytoplasmic mRNA significantly, but in one case an altered U1 snRNP (alpha 1) whose intended target was located downstream from the adenovirus E1A 12S 5' splice site was able to reduce the level of cytoplasmic 12S mRNA by approximately 60% and that of 13S mRNA by 90%. This alpha 1 snRNP induced an additional E1A splice, resulting in the appearance of 10 and 11S E1A mRNAs normally found only late in adenovirus infection. Thus, a trans-acting factor can induce alternative splicing. Surprisingly, the effects of alpha 1 on E1A splicing were not abolished by deleting the intended target sequence on the mRNA precursor.", "author": [{"author": "C Y Yuo", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510."], "href": "/?term=Yuo+CY&cauthor_id=2477685"}, {"author": "A M Weiner", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Weiner+AM&cauthor_id=2477685"}], "refPMID": ["2411548", "2744461", "3511059", "3720730", "2427015", "2943587", "3757028", "3808958", "3544217", "7350545", "519769", "316537", "6246511", "6789322", "6277502", "7063411", "7142161", "6190573", "6232278", "6201826", "6204860", "6235919", "6091052", "6207932", "3881765", "2581971", "3890181", "3160482", "3160483", "2950324", "3581171", "3304142", "2958276", "2958277", "2450678", "3129196", "2837425", "3056718", "3144434", "3144435", "3203381", "2412294"], "citedInPMID": ["2477685", "33361423", "21378395", "16682524", "9560205", "9334320", "8255769", "8035806", "7682651", "2362569", "2201909", "2011581"], "body": ""}
