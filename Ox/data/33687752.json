Other causes of ARDS\u2014such as infection with coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV2\u2014primarily target alveolar\u2010epithelial cells and can cause ARDS by causing alveolar inflammation and cell death.\n11\n Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches targeting alveolar\u2010epithelial injury and hyperinflammation during ARDS are areas of intense research.\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n\nRecent studies are providing evidence that carbohydrate metabolites and intermediates, in addition to their canonical function as energy substrate, play key functions in regulating inflammatory endpoints and can resolve lung inflammation.\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n Furthermore, hypoxia\u2010inducible transcription factor HIF1A is a critical regulator of alveolar\u2010epithelial carbohydrate metabolism during ALI.\n20\n Historically, HIF was identified in the 1990s as the transcription factor responsible for regulating hypoxia\u2010elicited increases in erythropoietin and other hypoxia\u2010dependent gene products.\n21\n, \n22\n Importantly, laboratory studies of ALI showed that during in vitro or in vivo models of alveolar injury, HIF1A is stabilized and contributes to optimal alveolar\u2010epithelial carbohydrate metabolism.\n20\n These studies point out that HIF1A is stabilized by succinate. Previous studies from the field of oncology provide evidence that succinate can function as a pharmacologic activator of HIF.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n However, the role of alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and its implications on succinate metabolism and HIF\u2010elicited lung protection are largely unknown.SDH is a unique metabolic enzyme since it plays a functional role in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and during mitochondrial respiration. In the TCA cycle, SDH is responsible for the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, and thereby directly controls intracellular levels of its upstream metabolite succinate.\n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n In addition, it functions in oxidative phosphorylation as complex II of the electron transport chain.\n28\n Due to its role in the TCA cycle, SDH is critical for controlling intracellular succinate levels. Succinate is the upstream metabolite of SDH and is therefore directly under the control of SDH. SDH has four distinct subunits, SDHA\u2010SDHD, with SDHA carrying the critical enzymatic activity that is responsible for the conversion of succinate to fumarate.\n28\n, \n29\n In order to study in the functional roles of alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate metabolism during ALI, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with targeted deletion of Sdha specifically in AT II cells. Our studies demonstrate that mice with ATII\u2010specific Sdha deletion succinate levels in their alveolar epithelia are elevated and mice are protected from ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. Extension of these studies revealed that Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice had increased Hif1a levels during ALI, which likely contributes to the observed protection during lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation. In line with those findings, mice with deletion of Hif1a in alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs (Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice) experience more severe lung injury. Finally, pharmacologic studies with cell\u2010soluble succinate attenuated lung inflammation and histologic tissue injury during ALI in vivo. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Cell culture and treatmentA549 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATTC), Manassas/VA, USA (ATCC Cat# CRM\u2010CCL\u2010185, RRID:CVCL_0023) and primary alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT II cells) were cultured as described previously\n30\n, \n31\n in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4.5\u00a0g/L glucose and stable L\u2010glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mix (all from Corning Cellgro, Manassas/VA, USA). Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37\u00b0C.2.2. Lentiviral generation of cell lines with knockdown of SDHAA cell line with stable decreased expression of SDHA was generated by lentiviral\u2010mediated shRNA expression as described previously.\n20\n To summarize: pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, targeting SDHA had the shRNA sequence of CCGGGCATCTGCTAAAGTTTCAGATCTCGAGATCTGAAACTTTAGCAGAT GCTTTTT (TRCN0000028093). For controls, non\u2010targeting control shRNA (SHC001: Sigma, St Louis/MO, USA, (RRID: Addgene_8453)) was used. Lentiviral suspensions carrying the plasmid were produced at the Functional Genomics Core Facility of the University of Colorado Boulder. The suspension was used for infection of A549 cells, and cells were selected with puromycin (1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for at least two passages before initiating stretch experiments.2.3. In vitro stretch modelIn order to mimic cyclic mechanical stretch as it occurs during injurious mechanical ventilation, we utilized a previously described in vitro model that applies cyclic mechanical stretch to cultured pulmonary epithelial cells.\n20\n In short, cells were plated on BioFlex culture plates (FlexCell International, Burlington/ NC, USA) that were coated with collagen type1 and cells were allowed to attach. Pulmonary epithelial cells were grown to 80% confluence and seeded with a density of 3 million per well. All cells were cultured in 4\u00a0mL medium (DMEM, 4.5\u00a0g/L glucose, 10% FBS, 0.02% L\u2010Glutamine). Plates were then placed on a FlexCell FX 4000T tension Plus System. Cells were stretched at 30% and a sine wave of 5s on, 5s off. Alveolar epithelial cells were then collected at specified time points and processed for further analysis. For controls, cells were cultured under identical conditions without application of cyclic mechanical stretch.2.4. MiceWild\u2010type mice (BL6C57) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664). Mice with Cre exclusively expressed in alveolar epithelial cells (Sftpc\ntm1(cre/ERT2)Blh, JAX stock #028054, (IMSR Cat# JAX:028054, RRID: IMSR_JAX:028054)) were generously provided by Bridget Hogan (Duke University, Durham NC).\n32\n We opted for the Sftpc\ntm1(cre/ERT2)Blh system, due to reports of off\u2010target toxicity in SPC\u2010tet\u2010O\u2010Cre animals.\n33\n For tissue\u2010specific knockout in the alveolar epithelium, Sdha floxed mice (Sdhatm2a(KOMP)Wtsi) obtained from UC Davis were crossbred with a flippase expressing mouse line (FLPe, Ozgen Bentley/WA, Australia, (IMSR Cat# JAX:016226, RRID: IMSR_JAX:016226)) to remove the neomycin cassette and generate homozygous Sdhaloxp/loxp mice. Sdhaloxp/loxp mice were crossed with SPC\u2010CreER animals to generate animals with ATII\u2010specific Sdha suppression (Figure\u00a03A). Conditional knockout was induced by 75\u00a0mg/kg/d i.p. tamoxifen over 5\u00a0days as described.\n34\n Genotyping of the resulting Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice was performed via PCR on tails to determine Cre and loxp expression as well as ensure specific deletion of the floxed area of Sdha by testing for null PCR (GeneTyper, New York/ NY, USA). SPC\u2010CreER animals were used as control animals in studies addressing the tissue\u2010specific Sdha, respectively, Hif1a knockout mice. Controls were matched for sex (male or female mice), weight (weighing 18\u201025g), and age (between 10 and 12\u00a0weeks) at the time of harvest for all genotypes.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Generation and characterization of mice with alveolar epithelial deletion of Sdha. A, Generation of mice with AT II\u2010specific deletion of Sdha. Animals homozygous for floxed Sdha allele (Sdhaloxp/loxp) were crossed with SPC\u2010CreER mice to generate the Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER line. Conditional Sdha suppression was induced by i.p. tamoxifen. Sdha suppression in AT II cells was confirmed with Western blot. B, Weights of Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice compared with SPC\u2010CreER control mice. Both groups were age matched at 10\u201012\u00a0weeks of age after having received tamoxifen for 5\u00a0days, 2\u00a0weeks prior to ventilation.

Total of 17 animals were used for panels C\u2010E (panel B encompasses animals from Figures\u00a03, \u200b,4,4, \u200b,55)2.5. Murine model of ALIMice were ventilated for 4\u00a0hours at low or high inspiratory pressure levels to investigate the effect of alveolar epithelial Sdha or Hif1a deletion during ALI, as described previously.\n8\n A peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 45\u00a0cm H2O was used for inducing ALI in mice, and a PIP of 15\u00a0cm H2O served as the control condition. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital [70\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) for induction and 20\u00a0mg/kg per hour for maintenance] and were maintained at a stable body temperature by a warming table, using a rectal thermometer probe in a closed\u2010loop circuit. A tracheotomy was performed, and the tracheal tube was connected to a mechanical ventilator (Siemens Servo 900C and Draeger Evita 2 Dura, with pediatric tubing). Mice were ventilated with 100% inspired oxygen.2.6. Ambient hypoxia exposureMice were maintained in normobaric normoxia or hypoxia for 24\u00a0hours. For hypoxia, mice were placed into a hypobaric chamber at a simulated altitude of 18\u00a0000 ft above sea level (395\u00a0Torr), conditions equivalent to 10% atmospheric oxygen. Normoxic mice remained in Denver (5, 280 ft) ambient air.2.7. Isolation of murine alveolar\u2010epithelial cellsPrimary alveolar epithelia were isolated from 10\u2010 to 12\u2010week\u2010old male or female mice matched in age, sex, and weight as described previously.\n35\n, \n36\n Mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (70\u00a0mg/kg). Mice were exsanguinated by removing the left atrium, and lungs were then lavaged with sterile PBS via the right ventricle. Dispase (Corning Lifesciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) was subsequently instilled intra\u2010tracheally followed by a low\u2010melting point agarose plug. Lungs were removed intact and incubated for 45\u00a0minutes at room temperature. Tissue was teased apart manually and then passed through a 70\u2010micron cell strainer (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes /NJ, USA). The cell mixture was then labeled with a mixture of CD16/32, TER119, CD45, and CD90 (all from BD Bioscience) and subsequently incubated with streptavidin\u2010labeled magnetic beads for negative selection for alveolar\u2010epithelial cells. In the final step, fibroblasts were removed by adherence to a petri dish for 2\u00a0hours.2.8. ImmunoblottingFor Western immunoblotting, cells were washed twice with ice\u2010cold PBS and lysed with 1x cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers/ MA, USA) including protease inhibitor PMSF (effective concentration 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). For immunoblotting of HIF1A, we extracted the nuclear protein fraction from alveolar\u2010epithelial cells using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham/MA, USA). Protein concentrations were determined using QuickStart Bradford dye reagent (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules /CA, USA), and equal protein amounts were denatured in sample buffer, separated by SDS\u2010electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% skim\u2010milk [w/v] in TBS incl. 1% Tween\u201020 [v/v], and probed with the respective primary antibodies: HIF1A (Novus Biologicals, Centennial /CO, USA, clone H1alpha67, Novus Cat. # NB100\u2010105, RRID: AB_10001154), SDHA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab137040 RRID: AB_2884996 (prelim)) and b\u2010actin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich Cat. # A5441, RRID: AB_476744). Secondary antibodies were as follows: HRP anti\u2010rabbit and (both from Cell Signalling Technology: Cat. #7074, RRID: AB_2099233 and Cat. # 7076, RRID: AB_330924). Densitometry was performed with ImageJ (NIH).2.9. Histopathological evaluation of acute lung injuryLungs were explanted and prepared for paraffin embedding as described.\n8\n 5\u2010\u03bcm sections were stained with H&E. Assessment of histological lung injury was performed as described previously\n37\n by grading using the following categories: a) infiltration or aggregation of inflammatory cells in air space or vessel wall: 1, only wall; 2, few cells (one to five cells) in air space; 3, intermediate; and 4, severe (air space congested); b) interstitial congestion and hyaline membrane formation: 1, normal lung; 2, moderate (<25% of lung section); 3, intermediate (25%\u201050% of lung section); and 4, severe (>50% of lung section); and c) hemorrhage: 0, absent; 1, present. Six representative images were obtained from each animal and were analyzed independently by 2 investigators, blinded to group assignments.2.10. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)Lung tissue was harvested immediately after euthanasia, cut into small pieces (3 mm3), and fixed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C, rinsed in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, and block staining in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate,\u00a0dehydrated using alcohol. The tissues were embedded in 100 EPON for 48\u00a0hours at 70\u00b0C. Ultra\u2010thin sections of 70\u00a0nm were cut and stained 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a JEOL JEM\u20101400Plus (JEOL USA Peabody, MA) transmission electron microscope. Representative images were obtained from each animal and were analyzed blinded to group assignments.2.11. Sample collection and measurement of BALF protein contentBronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained by lavaging the lungs 3 times with 1\u00a0mL PBS. After centrifugation at 300\u00a0g for 5\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C, cell\u2010free BAL was immediately snap\u2010frozen for subsequent studies. Pulmonary tissue was flushed with 10\u00a0mL saline via the right ventricle, and either snap\u2010frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C or conserved in formalin for histologic analysis. Protein content of BALF was measured via Bradford Assay as described previously.\n38\n\n2.12. Transcriptional analysis (qPCR)Total RNA was isolated from primary ATII cells, A549 cells, or murine lung tissue using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit by following the manufacturer's protocol, and c\u2010DNA was generated using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories Inc). RNA transcript levels were determined by real\u2010time PCR (iCycler, Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories Inc). Primers were obtained from Quantitect (Qiagen, Hilgen, Germany). The following primers were used for transcriptional analysis: Mm: \u03b2\u2010Actin\u2014QT01136772, IL\u20106\u2014QT00098875, CXCL\u20101\u2014QT100115647, Irg\u20101\u2014QT00250166, Sdha\u2014QT00265237, Sdhb\u2014QT00150206, Sdhc\u2014QT00157108, Sdhd\u2014QT01037582.

The expression of Sod2, Cat, Gpx1, HO\u20101, and Prdx\u20101genes in whole lung samples was assessed by qRT\u2010PCR using the primers as described before\n39\n as follows: qPCRSOD2For (5\u2032\u2010CTGGACAAACCTGAGCCCTA\u2010\u20323), qPCRSOD2Rev (5\u2032\u2010TGATAGCCTCCAGCAACTCTC\u2010\u20323), qPCRCATFor (5\u2032\u2010CAGCGACCAGATGAAGCA\u2010\u20323), qPCRCATRev (5\u2032\u2010CTCCGGTGGTCAGGACAT\u2010\u20323), qPCRGPx1For (5\u2032\u2010ACAGTCCACCGTGTATGCCTTC\u2010\u20323), qPCRGPx1Rev (5\u2032\u2010CTCTTCATTCTTGCCATTCTCCTG\u2010\u20323), qPCRHO\u20101For (5\u2032\u2010GGTCAGGTGTCCAGAG\u2010AAGG\u2010\u20323), qPCRHO\u20101Rev (5\u2032\u2010CTTCCAGGGCCGTGTAGATA\u2010\u20323), qPCRPRDX1For (5\u2032\u2010GTGAGACCTGTGGCTCGAC\u2010\u20323), qPCRPRDX1Rev (5\u2032\u2010TGTCCATCTGGCATAACAGC\u2010\u20323).2.13. Metabolite analysisAlveolar\u2010epithelial cells freshly isolated from the lungs of mice using antibody selection were used for metabolomics analysis. Metabolites from frozen cell pellets were extracted using ice\u2010cold methanol/acetonitrile/water (5:3:2) at a ratio of 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells per mL by vortexing for 30\u00a0minutes at 4 degrees C. Samples were clarified through centrifugation (10\u00a0min at 10\u00a0000\u00a0rpm, 4 degrees C), and 10\u00a0\u00b5L of supernatant was analyzed using a 5\u00a0minutes C18 gradient on a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC coupled online to a Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometer operating in positive and negative ion modes (separate runs) as previously described in detail.\n40\n Samples were normalized to cell count.2.14. ATP measurementATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used to measure the ATP from whole lung samples. A POLARstar Omega luminometer (BMG LabTech Inc Cary/ NC, USA) was used to measure relative luminescence of the samples according to manufacturer guidelines. The measured concentration of ATP was normalized to the protein concentration of the samples, which were measured using Bradford Assay.2.15. Mitochondrial ROS analysis with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)Mitochondrial ROS in lung tissue were measured by EPR as previously described\n41\n with several modifications. Freshly harvested lung tissue was weighed and homogenized in 300\u00a0\u00b5L sucrose using the BEAD RUPTOR (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA). The tissue homogenate was immediately placed on ice and homogenate transferred to a 1.5\u2010mL Eppendorf tube. 30\u00a0\u00b5L homogenate was added to 166\u00a0\u00b5L KHB\u00a0+\u00a0100\u00a0\u00b5M DTPA (metal chelators), treated with 4\u00a0\u00b5L of the mitochondrial specific spin probe, mito\u2010TEMPO\u2010H (9.5\u00a0mM stock, final concentration 0.2\u00a0mM), and incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C. After 1h, 150\u00a0\u00b5L was loaded into Teflon tubing and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR measurements were done at 77k using the Bruker EMXnano X\u2010band spectrometer (Bruker, San Jose, CA). EPR acquisition parameters were microwave frequency\u00a0=\u00a09.65\u00a0GHz; center field\u00a0=\u00a03438 G; modulation amplitude\u00a0=\u00a06.0 G; sweep width\u00a0=\u00a0150 G; microwave power\u00a0=\u00a00.316 mW; total number of scans\u00a0=\u00a02; sweep time\u00a0=\u00a060\u00a0seconds; and time constant\u00a0=\u00a01.28\u00a0ms Nitroxide radical concentration was obtained by double integration followed by Spin Count module (Bruker) and expressed as the nitroxide radical, and the concentration was normalized sample protein concentrations measured by Bradford Assay.2.16. Antioxidant enzyme analysisSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of oxygen radicals. For measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD), or catalase activity, the following assays were used, respectively: Lung tissues were homogenized in 0.5\u00a0mL of cold PBS in a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) for 2\u00a0minutes at 30\u00a0Hz, and the supernatant separated by centrifugation at 5000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0minutes at 4C. Aliquots of the same extract were used for measuring the enzymatic activities. SOD activity was measured using the cytochrome c reduction inhibition assay as described previously.\n42\n Crude extract samples were added to a mix of 50\u00a0mM xanthine, 10\u00a0mM cytochrome c, and 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA in 50\u00a0mM phosphate buffer pH 7.8. The sample\u2010reaction mix was homogenized and the rate of change of absorbance at 550\u2010526\u00a0nm monitored with a diode array spectrophotometer at 25 degrees \u00b0C. When the rate of change was unnoticeable, 4\u00a0mU/mL of xanthine oxidase (XO) was added and the changes in absorbance recorded. The rates of change in the cytochrome c reduction were between 30% and 70% of the control rate of the reaction mix plus XO without sample. The rate values were used to quantify superoxide dismutase with a SOD software program (developed by Joe M. McCord). Catalase activity was assessed according to Bergmeyer et al\n43\n using fresh stock concentrations of H2O2. Samples of the crude extracts or concentrated supernatants were added to 20\u00a0mM H2O2 in 50\u00a0mM potassium phosphate pH 7.0 and incubated at 25\u00b0C, recording the changes at 240\u00a0nm. The catalase content was estimated using the 43.6\u00a0M\u20101 extinction coefficient. The protein content of crude extracts was measured using the method described by Lowry et al\n44\n Lipid peroxidation was assessed utilizing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).TBARS were measured using the method described by Ohkawa et al.\n45\n\n2.17. Statistical analysisAs primary outcomes, we assessed the severity of ALI by determining mRNA expression levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, pulmonary barrier function, measuring protein content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and histology. For analysis of metabolomics from ATII cells, each data point was isolated from a different animal. For cell line experiments, each experiment was carried out independently. For analysis of histology, two investigators, who were blinded to genotype and treatment, performed scoring independently. All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 8.1.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). We conducted Grubbs\u2019 tests on all eligible data to examine outliers. No outliers were identified. We conducted Shapiro\u2010Wilk tests and constructed boxplots to examine normal distributions. All data approximately followed normal distributions and were summarized as means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Equal variances were evaluated by\u00a0F\u00a0test. Unless otherwise noted, we used the two\u2010sample t tests to compare means when equal variances were satisfactory. In data with significantly different variances, Welch's t tests were used. Bonferroni adjustment was employed in experiments involving more than one comparison. We reported two\u2010sided P values, and P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the data was reviewed by a faculty\u2010level statistician. The authors had full access to the data and have read and agree to the manuscript as written. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. ALI induced by mechanical ventilation decreases activity of SDHA in alveolar epitheliaWhile ALI and associated mechanical ventilation carry a significant morbidity and mortality, many episodes of ALI are self\u2010limited, suggesting the presence of endogenous protective pathways.\n19\n, \n20\n, \n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n Previous studies had suggested that inhibition of SDHA could lead to the accumulation of succinate and stimulation of endogenous protective pathways via enhancing the stabilization of HIF1A.\n20\n Based on these studies, we further investigated functional roles of alveolar SDHA during lung injury. To induce ALI in mice in vivo, we exposed mice to mechanical ventilation using pressure\u2010controlled ventilation (Figure\u00a01A).\n8\n, \n51\n For this purpose, wild\u2010type (WT) mice matched in age, gender, and weight underwent tracheostomy and were mechanically ventilated over 4\u00a0hours at an inspiratory pressure level of 45\u00a0cm H2O. Subsequently, we isolated AT II cells and analyzed SDH\u2010dependent metabolites (Figure\u00a0S1). We found that TCA cycle metabolites up\u2010 and downstream of SDH were altered in their abundance, including increased levels of succinate (upstream of SDH) and decreased levels of fumarate (downstream of SDH) as shown in Figure\u00a01B,C. These measurements indicate that ALI induced by mechanical ventilation is associated with decreased SDHA activity (Figure\u00a01D). In order to discern the mechanism of SDHA inhibition, we first examined the transcription levels of all SDH subunits in ATII cells and found no difference in their individual transcript levels in response to ALI (Figure\u00a01E), indicating that the observed reduction in activity of SDHA activity is not transcriptionally regulated.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1ALI induced by mechanical ventilation is associated with reduced activity of SDHA in alveolar epithelium. A, Schematic overview of ventilation experiments: 10\u2010 to 12\u2010week\u2010old mice were anesthetized and ventilated for 4\u00a0h with the following parameters: Pressure\u2010controlled ventilation (PCV), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 15\u00a0cm H2O in the control group and 45\u00a0cm H2O in the experimental group, PEEP 3\u00a0cm H2O, respiratory rate 80/min, and FiO2 1.0 were set equally in both groups. B and C, TCA cycle intermediates succinate and fumarate were determined with mass spectroscopy in ATII cells after mice were exposed to 15 or 45\u00a0cm H2O PIP. D, Succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) activity was determined by calculating the succinate to fumarate ratio. mRNA expression of SDH subunits (E) and Irg\u20101(F) was determined with qPCR. (G) Itaconate abundance was measured in ATII cells via mass spectroscopy. Data are represented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, n\u00a0=\u00a03\u20104, ns\u2010not significant, *P\u00a0<.05, **P\u00a0<.01, Welch's t test in F, t\u00a0=\u00a05.993 and df\u00a0=\u00a03.09; two\u2010sample t test in G, t\u00a0=\u00a03.43 and df\u00a0=\u00a05. A total of 21 animals were usedPrevious studies had indicated that the immune responsive gene 1 (Irg\u20101) protein, also known as cis\u2010aconitate decarboxylase, catalyzes the production of itaconate from the TCA cycle intermediate cis\u2010aconitate (see Figure\u00a0S1). Itaconate has been shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of SDHA, leading to an accumulation of succinate.\n52\n, \n53\n Therefore, we tested whether Irg\u20101 is involved in SDHA inhibition in alveolar epithelia during ALI. These studies revealed that Irg\u20101 mRNA expression was significantly induced in the whole lungs of mice exposed to ALI (Figure\u00a01F), and itaconate levels were elevated in isolated AT II cells of mice exposed to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation (Figure\u00a01G). Taken together, these studies suggest that during ALI, SDHA activity is decreased, which likely is mediated by increased inhibition through itaconate.3.2. Succinate attenuates epithelial inflammation during cyclic mechanical stretch exposureAfter having shown that during ALI, SDHA activity is decreased and concomitantly alveolar succinate levels are elevated in vivo, we next pursued in vitro studies to examine the functional implications of elevated succinate levels on inflammatory responses. For this purpose, we utilized an in vitro model of epithelial injury that mimics injurious mechanical ventilation.\n54\n Alveolar\u2010epithelial cells are plated on a mechanical device that exposes them to cyclic mechanical stretch, and thereby causes injury to alveolar\u2010epithelial cells, and concomitant increases in inflammation. Based on previous studies,\n20\n we hypothesized that the inhibition of SDHA and subsequent accumulation of succinate in alveolar epithelia functions to dampen inflammation. In these studies, we exposed the human pulmonary epithelial cell line A549 to injurious stretch conditions (30% stretch over 24h), following pre\u2010treatment with permeable succinate (dimethlysuccinate) or vehicle control. Dimethlysuccinate treatment was associated with decreased inflammatory responses when pulmonary epithelia were exposed to cyclic mechanical stretch for 24\u00a0hours, as shown by significantly decreased mRNA expression of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine Il\u20106 and chemokine Il\u20108 compared with controls (Figure\u00a02B,C). To further examine the functional consequences of SDHA inhibition on epithelial inflammation, we subsequently generated A549 cells with stable shRNA\u2010mediated knock down of Sdha (Figure\u00a02D). Subsequent exposure of pulmonary epithelia with shRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of SDHA to cyclic mechanical stretch over 24\u00a0hours demonstrated significantly attenuated increases in the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u20106 and chemokine IL\u20108 (Figure\u00a02E,F), as compared to controls. Taken together, these studies indicate that pharmacologic\u2010mediated increases in succinate or genetic repression of SDH is associated with decreased inflammation of pulmonary epithelial cells exposed to cyclic mechanical stretch such as occurs during injurious mechanical ventilation.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Succinate attenuates epithelial inflammation during cyclic mechanical stretch exposure. A, Schematic of in vitro cyclic mechanical stretch system. Cells were plated on a flexible membrane coated with collagen and vacuum to induce mechanical stretch to simulate injurious ventilation in vitro. B and C, mRNA expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u20106 and chemokine IL\u20108 was determined in human alveolar\u2010epithelial cell line A549 with qPCR after 24\u00a0h of mechanical stretch and treatment with cell\u2010permeable 10\u00a0\u03bcM dimethlysuccinate or vehicle.

IL\u20108 in A549 cells with stable knockdown of SDHA (shRNA SDHA) or scrambled controls (Scr A549). Cells were exposed to 24\u00a0h of cyclic mechanical stretch or control conditions.

Generation and characterization of mice with alveolar\u2010epithelial deletion of Sdha\nBased on the above in vitro studies indicating a protective role of succinate mediated by SDHA inhibition on epithelial inflammation during stretch, we next set out to perform a more detailed examination of the functional role of alveolar\u2010epithelial SDHA by generating transgenic mice with a conditional deletion of Sdha in ATII cells (Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER) (Figure\u00a03A). This approach is critical, since germ\u2010line deletion of Sdha is associated with embryonic lethality.\n55\n\nSdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER animals grow to adulthood without any congenital malformations and reach a weight similar to SPC\u2010CreER control animals (Figure\u00a03B). To characterize functional consequences of alveolar Sdha deletion on TCA cycle metabolites, we next measured TCA cycle intermediates upstream from SDHA (\u03b1\u2010ketoglutarate and succinate, see Figure\u00a0S1) using freshly isolated ATII cells from mice exposed to ALI (Figure\u00a03C,D). Consistent with a functional defect of Sdha, alveolar epithelia isolated from Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER had significantly higher levels of succinate or \u03b1\u2010ketoglutarate than SPC\u2010CreER control mice (Figure\u00a03C,D). Since SDH could also play functional roles in mitochondrial respiration, we next characterized global mitochondrial function in Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice or SPC\u2010CreER control animals. Comparison of electron microscopic images by a blinded reviewer of freshly isolated lung tissue of SPC\u2010CreER Sdhaloxp/loxp mice or control animals showed no structural differences and appear normal (Figure\u00a03E). In addition, measurement of the ATP concentration between SPC\u2010CreER and SPC\u2010CreER Sdhaloxp/loxp and analysis of the activity of mitochondrial ROS production or important lung antioxidant enzymes showed no biologically relevant differences between both genotypes (Figure\u00a04A\u2010J), providing further evidence that SDHA function in alveolar epithelium is predominantly constrained to the TCA cycle. This contrasts with studies in endothelial cells, which linked shear stress induced endothelial pyroptosis to inhibition of SDH subunit B (SDH\u2010B) and subsequent mitochondrial injury and increased ROS production.\n56\n However, as we did not find an effect of injurious ventilation on SDH\u2010B (Figure\u00a01E), this could explain while ROS production was not affected in the Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER animals.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4alveolar\u2010epithelial Sdha deletion does not affect ATP generation or ROS production.

Total of 20 animals were usedTaken together, these studies indicate that mice with ATII\u2010specific deletion of SDHA have no structural mitochondrial abnormalities or respiratory chain dysfunction but increased succinate levels during ALI secondary to genetic Sdha deletion.3.4. Alveolar\u2010epithelial Sdha deletion mediates lung protection during ALIAfter having characterized mice with conditional deletion of Sdha in ATII cells, we next pursued functional studies of ALI induced by injurious mechanical ventilation. For the purpose of these studies, we exposed Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice or SPC\u2010CreER controls matched in sex, age, and weight to ALI. Both genotypes showed increased inflammation after 4\u00a0hours of injurious mechanical ventilation, compared to mice exposed to low\u2010pressure mechanical ventilation as control. However, Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice exposed to ALI experienced a marked attenuation of the inflammatory response compared with the SPC\u2010CreER animals as evidenced by decreased expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcript levels in ATII cells (Figure\u00a05 A,B) and protein content of broncho\u2010alveolar fluid (Figure\u00a05C). Moreover, assessment of histologically visible lung damage by a blinded reviewer demonstrated attenuated injury (Figure\u00a05D,E). In addition, we found no apparent evidence for sex\u2010specific differences in lung inflammation between male or female Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice (see Figure\u00a0S2). Taken together, these studies provide genetic in vivo evidence for a protective role of alveolar\u2010specific Sdha deletion and implicate succinate elevation in attenuating alveolar injury.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Tissue\u2010specific alveolar\u2010epithelial Sdha deletion mediates lung protection during ALI: A\u2010E, Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice or age, gender, and weight\u2010matched controls (SPC\u2010CreER) were exposed PIP of 45\u00a0cm H2O to induce lung injury or control ventilation (15\u00a0cm H2O).

Total of 35 animals were used3.5. Alveolar\u2010epithelial Hif1a stabilization as mediator of succinate\u2010elicited lung protectionAfter having shown that mice with conditional deletion of Sdha in ATII cells experience attenuated lung injury in the context of elevated succinate levels when exposed to mechanical ventilation, we subsequently pursued studies to address a potential mechanism. Previous studies had indicated that stabilization of HIF in cancers can involve the inhibition or mutation of SDH, leading to elevation of succinate levels.\n25\n These studies suggest that succinate can function as inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs)\u2014a group of enzymes that target HIF for proteasomal degradation\n57\n, \n58\n, \n59\n, \n60\n\u2014thereby causing normoxic HIF stabilization.\n23\n, \n25\n, \n61\n Other studies had provided genetic and pharmacologic in vivo evidence that HIF1A expressed in alveolar\u2010epithelial cells provides lung protection during ALI.\n20\n Therefore, we pursued the hypothesis that deletion of Sdha is associated with elevated HIF1A levels as a mechanism for succinate\u2010dependent lung protection. Since hypoxia is a strong stimulus for HIF1A stabilization,\n62\n we first set out to determine HIF1A stabilization in Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER exposed to ambient hypoxia. These studies revealed increased Hif1a stabilization in Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER compared with SPC\u2010CreER control animals following 24\u00a0hours of exposure to 10% hypoxia (Figure\u00a06A,B). Next, we explored Hif1a stabilization in Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER compared with SPC\u2010CreER control animals after ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. These studies showed that Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice display increased Hif1a stabilization compared with SPC\u2010CreER (see Figure\u00a0S3A). To further investigate the functional role of Hif1a in ALI induced by mechanical ventilation, we next generated mice with conditional deletion of Hif1a (Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER) by crossing surfactant Cre\u00a0+\u00a0mice (SPC\u2010CreER) with Hif1a\nloxp/loxp mice (Figure\u00a06C,D). Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER animals grow to adulthood without any congenital malformations and reach a weight similar to SPC\u2010CreER control animals (Figure\u00a06E). However, Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER when exposed to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation experienced exacerbated lung injury compared with control SPC\u2010CreER mice, evidenced by elevated transcript levels of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u20106 (Figure\u00a06F) and chemokine CXCL\u20101 (Figure\u00a06G) in whole lung tissue and leakage of albumin into the broncho\u2010alveolar fluid (Figure\u00a06H). Consequently, lung injury assessed by histologic ALI score in Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER animals showed exacerbated lung injury compared with SPC\u2010CreER group (Figure\u00a06I,J). These findings in our mice with improved target\u2010specific Cre expression in the SPC\u2010CreER mice\n63\n are consistent with previous studies in mice epithelial deletion of Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC.\n20\n HIF1\u2010mediated effects have been shown to be sex\u2010specific.\n64\n However, we found no differences in CXCL\u20101 chemokine expression between male and female animals in response to ALI (see Supplemental Figure\u00a03B). Taken together, these findings provide indirect evidence that Sdha deletion and concomitant elevation of alveolar succinate levels can provide lung protection through increased HIF1A levels and enhanced \u201chypoxia signaling\u201d during ALI.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 6Alveolar\u2010epithelial Hif1a stabilization as mediator of succinate\u2010elicited lung protection.

Local delivery of dimethlysuccinate attenuate inflammation in lung injury induced by mechanical ventilationBased on our observations that SPC\u2010CreER Sdhaloxp/loxp animals do have increased succinate levels in their alveolar epithelia and show robust protection during ALI induced by mechanical ventilation, we next set out to test whether we could recapitulate the protective effects of alveolar\u2010epithelial Sdha deletion via therapeutic succinate supplementation. To achieve delivery to alveolar epithelia, we chose to give dimethlysuccinate (cell\u2010permeable form of succinate) via intratracheal route (i.t.). In these studies, we pre\u2010treated mice with dimethlysuccinate (10\u00a0\u03bcM, 50\u00a0\u03bcL i.t.) 15\u00a0minutes prior to induction of ALI (Figure\u00a07A), with the control groups receiving equal volumes of vehicle (0.9% NaCl). Consistent with our previous studies, treatment with dimethlysuccinate was associated with decreased expression of the transcript levels of in IL\u20106 and CXCL\u20101 during ALI induced by mechanical ventilation (Figure\u00a07B,C). Conversely, lung injury assessed by histologic ALI scoring showed attenuated lung injury in animals treated with dimethlysuccinate compared with control animals (Figure\u00a07 D,E). Taken together, those studies indicate that local, i.t. treatment with dimethlysuccinate functions to dampen inflammation during ALI.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 7Local delivery of dimethlysuccinate attenuates inflammation in ALI.

Total of 30 animals were used, and no animal was excluded from analysis 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONThe present studies were designed to gain additional insight on the impact of carbohydrate metabolites as regulators of alveolar inflammation during ARDS. Previous studies had suggested a central role of the TCA intermediate succinate as endogenous regulator of alveolar\u2010epithelial hypoxia signaling.\n20\n Since SDHA represents the central regulator for cellular succinate generation, we pursued pharmacologic and genetic in vivo studies to address the functional role of alveolar succinate metabolism during ARDS. These studies demonstrated that mice with alveolar\u2010epithelial SDHA deletion (Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice) experience higher succinate levels and concomitant lung protection during murine models of ARDS. For example, Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice experienced attenuated lung inflammation, less pulmonary edema, and improved histologic lung injury scores when exposed to injurious mechanical ventilation. Studies to address the mechanism of succinate\u2010mediated lung protection showed that alveolar Hif1a levels were elevated in Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice during hypoxia or during exposure to ARDS. Indeed, mice with alveolar\u2010epithelial Hif1a deletion (Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER) showed exacerbated lung injury during exposure to ARDS. Finally, studies exploring the SDHA pathway therapeutically revealed that pharmacologic treatment with intra\u2010tracheal succinate was associated with improved outcomes during ARDS induced by mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, i.t delivery of succinate appeared to improve that ALI phenotype more than alveolar\u2010epithelial\u2010specific deletion of Sdha as the wild\u2010type mice treated with i.t. succinate had better ALI scores than the Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice, which is suggestive of extra\u2010epithelial effects of succinate. Succinate mediates HIF1A stabilization by preventing its proteasomal degradation by PHDs. Although we cannot exclude that exogenous succinate might have non\u2013HIF1A\u2010mediated protective effects, we do not expect succinate, if given to Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC\u2010CreER mice, to have a significant protective effect in contrast to the wild\u2010type animals. Beside the alveolar epithelium, the pulmonary endothelium is also a critical part of the pulmonary barrier.\n65\n Succinate has been shown to affect endothelial VEGF and ROS production,\n56\n, \n66\n and therefore, increased alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate could have a secondary effect on the endothelium. Taken together, these studies indicate a protective role of alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate and suggest pharmacologic approaches to elevate alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate levels in ARDS treatment.The current studies suggest that alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate can function to protect during ARDS by enhancing HIF1A levels as a mechanism of lung protection. Several previous studies have suggested a protective role of HIF during ARDS. Some of these studies looked at pulmonary immune responses during hyperoxia.\n67\n Landmark research from the laboratory of Dr Sitkovsky had shown that mice exposed to poly\u2010microbial sepsis as a model of ARDS experience different disease outcomes dependent on the level of oxygenation they are exposed to. Mice kept at lower oxygen concentrations had improved outcomes, as compared to mice kept at 100% oxygen. The authors link those differences in outcomes to attenuated levels of HIF and dampened signaling events through the A2A adenosine receptor when exposed to 100% oxygen,\n68\n thereby providing indirect evidence for a protective role of HIF1A during ARDS.\n69\n Subsequent studies linked those findings to a functional role of natural killer T cells.\n70\n Extracellular adenosine has been shown to function as a protective regulator of alveolar inflammation during ARDS\n13\n, \n14\n, \n47\n and can signal through 4 distinct adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3).\n49\n In addition to the A2A adenosine receptor, previous studies had identified a functional role of HIF1A in regulating the A2B adenosine receptor during ARDS.\n71\n Functional studies of A2B signaling during ARDS models had shown a critical role of the A2B adenosine receptor in improving alveolar fluid clearance, and attenuating lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation,\n72\n or during LPS\u2010induced lung injury.\n73\n Again, other studies have suggested that HIF can function to provide lung protection during ARDS by optimizing alveolar\u2010epithelial carbohydrate metabolism.\n20\n, \n74\n During injurious conditions, alveolar epithelia are exquisitely dependent on the glycolytic utilization of carbohydrates as metabolic source. HIF is a known key regulator of the glycolytic system. In line with those findings, mice with alveolar\u2010epithelial Hif1a deletion fail to elevate their glycolytic flux rates.\n20\n Other investigators were able to confirm a lung\u2010protective role of HIF\u2010signaling in different models of ARDS,\n74\n, \n75\n, \n76\n including studies of virus\u2010associated ARDS.\n77\n Taken together with the current genetic and pharmacologic studies, these findings implicate HIF activation as a pharmacologic strategy to dampen lung injury during ARDS. Interestingly, ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating the impact of HIF activators in ARDS prevention or treatment in COVID\u201019 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04478071\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04478071\"}}NCT04478071).The functional role of succinate as a stabilizer of HIF1A has been suggested in previous studies from the cancer field.\n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n The critical step in regulating the stability of HIF1A involves PHD\u2010mediated targeting of the alpha\u2010subunit of HIF for proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of PHDs can occur due to lack of oxygen, thereby accounting for hypoxia\u2010mediated HIF stabilization.\n21\n, \n78\n Similarly, several small molecules have been identified as PHD inhibitors, which also accounts for the ability of cellular succinate to function as HIF activator. The current studies highlight an anti\u2010inflammatory role of HIF activation in alveolar\u2010epithelial cells. In contrast, different functional outcomes have been shown for succinate in endothelial cells mediated the activating G protein\u2013coupled receptor 91\n79\n or in inflammatory cells of the myeloid lineage. For example, studies in macrophages exposed to LPS identified succinate as a metabolite in innate immune signaling, which enhances interleukin\u20101\u03b2 production during inflammation.\n80\n Similarly, upon LPS stimulation, macrophages shift from producing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis while also increasing succinate levels.\n81\n Furthermore, recent studies show that plasma succinate is elevated in patients with ARDS secondary to trauma, which is in line with an animal of hemorrhagic shock\u2010induced ALI.\n66\n, \n82\n Additionally, pulmonary neutrophils could be primed with succinate, so that they responded to a second stimulus (LPS) with an increased inflammatory response.\n82\n These findings elucidate the complex nature of succinate\u2010mediated immune signaling in the context of ALI depending on the mechanism (trauma vs injurious ventilation) and primary target cell (alveolar epithelium vs myeloid cell). Taken together with the current findings, these studies suggest cell\u2010specific roles of succinate signaling in mediating inflammatory endpoints. However, the combination of attenuating alveolar inflammation while simultaneously enhancing myeloid inflammatory responses\n12\n is likely highly beneficial for ARDS treatment, where attenuating alveolar inflammation can function to dampen pulmonary edema and improving alveolar\u2010capillary function, while simultaneously allowing myeloid cells to function in pathogen elimination.\n83\n\nIn summary, the present studies highlight a novel role for alveolar\u2010epithelial succinate signaling in lung protection during ARDS. In extension of the present findings, several therapeutic implications for ARDS treatment can be considered for translation from bench to bedside. These approaches include direct use of cell\u2010permeable forms of succinate, inhibition of SDHA as a means for elevating intracellular succinate levels, or the use of pharmacologic HIF activators. The later have been used successfully in the form of orally available HIF activators for the treatment or renal anemia.\n84\n, \n85\n Repurposing HIF activators for ARDS prevention or treatment could represent a novel therapeutic approach, which is urgently needed for conventional ARDS, or for the treatment of patients experiencing COVID\u201019\u2013associated ARDS.\n1\n, \n67\n\n CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no competing interests.
