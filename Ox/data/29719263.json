The mRNA cap protects transcripts from 5\u2032 exonucleases and recruits factors involved in splicing, nuclear export, and translation initiation (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling, 2014a, Topisirovic et\u00a0al., 2011, Brannan et\u00a0al., 2012). In addition to the cap protecting transcripts during synthesis, the capping enzymes can have roles in transcription. The S.\u00a0cerevisiae cap methyltransferase, ABD1, is important for transcription of certain genes (Schroeder et\u00a0al., 2004). Although a mechanism has not been defined, the transcriptional defects resulting from ABD1 inactivation are rescued by the methyltransferase-dead enzyme, demonstrating independence from mRNA\u00a0cap methylation. The S.\u00a0pombe cap methyltransferase, PCM1, stimulates transcription by recruiting the elongation factor P-TEFb (Guiguen et\u00a0al., 2007). A role for the mammalian mRNA cap methyltransferase in transcription has not been observed, although it is recruited to transcription initiation sites (Aregger and Cowling, 2013, Glover-Cutter et\u00a0al., 2008).The 7-methylguanosine cap is synthesized in a three-step process. A triphosphatase hydrolyses the 5\u2032-phosphate of nascent transcripts and a guanylyltransferase adds guanosine monophosphate (GMP), linking guanosine to the first transcribed nucleotide via a 5\u2032-to-5\u2032-triphosphate linkage (Ramanathan et\u00a0al., 2016). This guanosine cap is methylated at the N-7 position by a RNA cap methyltransferase. Although the capping enzymes have species-specific configurations, the triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase are all recruited to RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and act co-transcriptionally on the nascent transcript (Buratowski, 2009, Perales and Bentley, 2009).In different eukaryotic species, the mRNA cap methyltransferases have homologous catalytic domains, but their mode of recruitment to RNA Pol II differs. In S.\u00a0cerevisiae, the cap methyltransferase ABD1 interacts directly with phosphorylated Serine 5 (phospho-S5) RNA Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), whereas in S.\u00a0pombe, the cap methyltransferase PCM1 is recruited in a complex with Cdk9/Pch1 (P-TEFb) (Pei et\u00a0al., 2006, Schroeder et\u00a0al., 2000). The mammalian cap methyltransferase, RNMT, has a N-terminal regulatory domain (residues 1\u2013120) that regulates activity and mediates recruitment to transcription initiation sites, although a direct interaction with RNA Pol II has not been observed (Aregger and Cowling, 2013, Aregger et\u00a0al., 2016, Pillutla et\u00a0al., 1998). RNMT has an activating subunit, RAM, which alters the dynamics of key active site residues, improving the environment for methyl donor binding (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011, Varshney et\u00a0al., 2016). RAM also has a high-affinity RNA binding domain, the biochemical function of which is unclear; it is required for cell viability but does not increase RNMT methyltransferase activity (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011, Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling, 2014b). The RAM RNA binding domain may increase the recruitment of\u00a0specific transcripts to the complex or have a function independent of mRNA cap methylation. In embryonic stem cells, the expression of a subset of pluripotency-associated transcripts depends on RAM, indicating a role for RAM in transcription or RNA stability (Grasso et\u00a0al., 2016).Here we report that RNMT-RAM functions independently of mRNA cap methylation to promote RNA Pol II-dependent transcription. Sublethal suppression of RNMT-RAM expression results in massively reduced RNA Pol II occupancy, reduced net mRNA synthesis, and reduced pre-mRNA levels. Increasing RNMT-RAM expression in cells increases transcription in a methyltransferase-independent manner. Furthermore, recombinant RNMT-RAM stimulates transcription in isolated nuclei, confirming that this mechanism is independent of mRNA capping, mRNA translation, and mRNA stability. RNMT-RAM associates with pre-mRNA along its entire length via interaction with RAM and interacts with several transcription-associated complexes. We propose that the human cap methyltransferase complex promotes transcription by RNA Pol II via multiple RNA and protein contacts along the transcription unit. ResultsRNMT-RAM Promotes RNA Pol II-Dependent TranscriptionTo investigate the cellular role of the mRNA cap methyltransferase, RNMT-RAM, HeLa cells were transfected with two RAM small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which reduce expression of RNMT and RAM (Figure\u00a01A) (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011). To focus these experiments on the role of RNMT-RAM, it was important to use a sublethal dose of RAM siRNA. Under the conditions used here, transfection of RAM siRNA for 48\u00a0hr did not result in toxicity; there was no reduction in cell number, no apoptotic morphology, and no induction of apoptosis as detected by PARP cleavage (Figure\u00a0S1). To investigate cellular transcription, cells were incubated with 3H-uridine for 30\u00a0min, which is converted to 3H-UTP and incorporated into nascent transcripts. mRNA was enriched by oligonucleotide (oligo)-dT affinity, and 3H-uridine incorporation was determined. Because the median half-life of mRNA is \u223c10\u00a0hr, a 30\u00a0min uridine pulse predominantly measures transcription (Yang et\u00a0al., 2003). Net mRNA synthesis was significantly reduced following RNMT-RAM depletion (Figure\u00a01A). In a similar experiment, while RAM was depleted by\u00a0RAM siRNA transfection, HA-tagged RNMT (HA-RNMT) was induced from a doxycycline-regulated promoter (Figure\u00a01B). HA-RNMT expressed in the absence of RAM was unable to increase net mRNA synthesis. Conversely, elevated expression of HA-RNMT and Fg-RAM (in the absence of siRNA transfections) increased net mRNA synthesis (Figure\u00a01C). Furthermore, co-expression of methyltransferase-dead (MTD) HA-RNMT and Fg-RAM increased net mRNA synthesis (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011). Therefore, RNMT-RAM promotes transcription independent of its role in mRNA cap methylation.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01RNMT-RAM Regulates Transcription Independent of mRNA Cap Methylation(A\u2013C) HeLa cells incubated with 60\u00a0\u03bcM 3H-uridine for 30\u00a0min.

Primers are indicated (n\u00a0= 4).(E) HeLa cells transfected with RAM siRNAs or sc siRNA for 36\u00a0hr. Levels of mature and pre-mRNA were determined by RT-PCR relative to sc siRNA control (n\u00a0= 4).For charts, average and SD are indicated. Student\u2019s t test was performed. \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.005.To investigate whether RNMT-RAM has a direct impact on transcription, nuclear run-on assays were performed. Nuclear run-on measures nascent transcription from engaged polymerase in isolated nuclei, independent of mRNA capping, translation, and stability (Groudine et\u00a0al., 1981). In these assays, nuclei prepared from log-phase HeLa cells were supplemented with nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), BrUTP (5-bromouridine-triphosphate), and RNase inhibitors, and transcription was allowed to progress (Roberts et\u00a0al., 2015). Bromouridine (Br-U) is incorporated into nascent transcripts, which are immunoprecipitated and used as a substrate for RT-PCR. Addition of recombinant RNMT-RAM resulted in up to a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in TSS (transcription start site) and gene body-associated transcription of multiple genes (Figures 1D, S2A, and S2B). For these assays, full-length human RNMT and RAM 1\u201390 were used; full-length recombinant RAM 1\u2013118 is unstable (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011). Thus, RNMT-RAM directly promotes transcription, increasing the output of engaged RNA Pol II, independent of mRNA cap methylation. On supplying RNMT and RAM alone to isolated nuclei, RAM 1\u201390 alone could stimulate transcription, whereas RAM 1\u201345, a mutant in which the RNA binding domain is deleted, could not (Figure\u00a0S2A).To further evaluate the mechanism by which RNMT-RAM influences transcription, we required the identity of the genes most affected by its inhibition. RNA sequencing was performed on HeLa cells following RAM depletion for 36\u00a0hr in 5 biological replicates (Figures S2C\u2013S2E). Despite the overall transcriptional repression, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that different transcript populations respond differentially to RAM depletion. For instance, transcripts within the most repressed decile and the least repressed decile exhibit a more than 2.5-fold difference in reduction in response to RAM depletion (Figure\u00a0S2E; Data S1). This indicates that there may be gene specificity in transcriptional regulation by RAM. The expression of a panel of mRNAs was validated by RT-PCR (Figures S2E and S2F). Transcripts coding for the RNA binding protein hnRNPH1, phosphodiesterases 3A and 4D, transcription factor FOXP2, and two non-coding RNAs MALAT1 and NEAT1, as well as GPC5, GAPDH, GSG2, and RNMT, were selected for further analysis. The transcripts most reduced in response to RAM depletion may be transcribed at a lower rate or have reduced stability. To assess the impact of RAM depletion on pre-mRNA levels, RT-PCR was performed on RAM-dependent transcripts using intronic primers. Following RAM depletion, hnRNPH1, PDE3A, PDE4D, and FOXP2 pre-mRNA levels reduced equivalently to\u00a0mature mRNA levels, consistent with RNMT-RAM controlling transcription (Figure\u00a01E). mRNA stability was assessed following transcriptional inhibition with actinomycin D. The decay of hnRNPH1, PDE4D, FOXP2, and MALAT1 mRNA was unchanged following RNMT-RAM depletion (Figure\u00a0S3).RAM Depletion Results in Reduced RNA Pol II OccupancyTo define the role of RAM in transcription, RNA Pol II occupancy on the genome was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Following transfection with RAM siRNA or non-targeting control for 36\u00a0hr, RNA Pol II ChIP was performed on three biological replicates that exhibited a high correlation genome wide and at an individual gene level (Figures S4A and\u00a0S4B). In genome-wide analysis, RAM depletion was observed to result in a significant reduction in RNA Pol II occupancy at the TSS (Figure\u00a02A) and within the gene body (Figures 2B and\u00a0S5). In single-gene analysis, 3,400 genes exhibited a significant change in RNA Pol II binding over the annotated locus and 2 kb flanking regions, of which 89% exhibited reduced RNA Pol II occupancy (Figure\u00a02C; Data S1). This was also visible at the\u00a0single genes investigated previously (Figure\u00a0S6). The RNMT locus exhibited an increase in RNA Pol II occupancy on RNMT-RAM suppression, indicating a feedback response (Figure\u00a0S6).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02RNMT-RAM Regulates RNA Pol II Occupancy(A and B) RNA Pol II ChIP-seq reads over annotated transcription start sites (A) and annotated genes (B) within the hg38 human assembly, 36\u00a0hr post-transfection with siRAM (red line) or sc siRNA (green line).

Genes for transcripts were categorized as most reduced and least reduced in RNA-seq following RAM depletion (Figure\u00a0S2E).(H) Log fold change in RNA Pol II ChIP-seq reads following RAM knockdown over gene sets plotted in (G).Data were pooled from three biological replicates for (A)\u2013(E). TSS, transcription start site; TES, transcription end site.An alternative approach to investigating RNA Pol II occupancy is to identify RNA Pol II peaks throughout the genome, i.e., regions where the RNA Pol II ChIP reads are significantly enriched relative to the input sample. Peak calling identified 9,464 consensus peaks in control cells, whereas following RAM depletion, only 1,323 peaks were identified, an 86% reduction (Figures 2D and S7). The RNA Pol II peaks remaining following RAM depletion were predominately (1,309 peaks) in the same location as in control cells. For individual RNA Pol II peaks identified in control cells, a significant reduction in read intensity was observed in response to RAM depletion across a range of peak read densities (Figure\u00a02E). Consistent with a reduction in RNA Pol II at the TSS and gene body, suppression of RAM expression resulted in a reduction in phospho-S5 and phospho-S2 RNA Pol II (Figure\u00a02F).RNMT-RAM suppression not only had a major impact on genome-wide RNA Pol II loading (Figure\u00a02A\u20132E) but also elicited a transcript-specific response (Figure\u00a0S2E). Therefore, we investigated which properties differentiated genes with different dependencies on RNMT-RAM. In control cells, from the 11,917 transcripts detected by RNA-seq (Figure\u00a0S2E), the 4,007 transcripts most repressed in response to RNMT-RAM suppression\u00a0had significantly more RNA Pol II loaded throughout the associated gene in comparison to the 4,059 least repressed transcripts, indicating that these two genes sets have distinct properties (Figure\u00a02G). When RNMT-RAM was suppressed, as expected, RNA Pol II was depleted more at the most repressed genes than at the least repressed genes (Figure\u00a02H).RAM Is Required for RNMT Interaction with RNAThe impact of RNMT-RAM on RNA Pol II occupancy and transcription suggested a potential functional interaction with transcribing polymerase. To investigate the mechanism of RNMT-RAM-dependent transcription, the RNAs to which RNMT-RAM binds (Figures 3 and \u200band4)4) and RNMT-RAM-interacting proteins (Figure\u00a05) were identified. Cellular protein-RNA complexes were captured by CLIP (crosslinking immunoprecipitation) (Huppertz et\u00a0al., 2014, Moore et\u00a0al., 2014). HA-RNMT was introduced into HeLa cells by retroviral infection, resulting in expression equivalent to endogenous RNMT (Figure\u00a0S8A). RNA was crosslinked to proteins by UV radiation; RNase-treated and HA-RNMT-RAM-RNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. Following 32P RNA labeling, RNMT-RNA and RAM-RNA complexes were visualized in SDS-PAGE as smears, migrating more slowly than RNMT (66\u00a0kDa) and RAM (14\u00a0kDa) (Figure\u00a03A). Protein-RNA bands were only detected following mild RNase treatment, indicating release of RNMT-RAM-RNA from masking and/or insoluble complexes, and were diminished at high RNase concentrations, confirming their derivation from RNA (Figure\u00a03A). The 50\u00a0kDa band observed is likely to be non-specifically labeled immunoglobulin G (IgG) heavy chain.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03RAM Is Required for RNMT-RNA Interaction(A) Anti-HA antibody CLIP (crosslinking IP) performed on HeLa cells expressing HA-RNMT or control.

Western blot analysis is shown.The dependency of RNMT-RNA binding on RAM was investigated. RNA binding to the RNMT lobe deletion mutant (\u0394416\u2013\u0394456) was below the limit of detection (Figure\u00a03B). This mutant is defective for RAM binding, which indicates that RAM is necessary for transcripts to bind efficiently to RNMT in cells (Varshney et\u00a0al., 2016). In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), RNMT and RAM expression is uncoupled, providing a system to study the action of RNMT independent of RAM (Grasso et\u00a0al., 2016). Upon RAM depletion in mESCs, RNA binding to wild-type RNMT was severely diminished (Figure\u00a03C). The RNA binding domain of RAM was previously mapped in\u00a0vitro to the aspargine- and arginine-rich (NR-rich) region (amino acids 56\u201391), and\u00a0RAM 1\u201355 binds to RNMT (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011). To map the regions of RAM required to bind to RNA in cells, GFP-CLIP assays were performed in which a series of RAM-GFP deletion mutants were purified from HeLa cells (Figure\u00a03D). Although the PY nuclear localization motifs at amino acids 98 and 114 are absent from RAM 1\u201390, all RAM-GFP proteins in this study are predominantly nuclear, probably due to\u00a0nuclear bias of GFP (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling, 2014b). As expected, wild-type RAM-GFP (1\u2013118) bound to RNA. However, all other RAM-GFP deletion mutants were defective for RNA binding. Therefore, full-length RAM is required for efficient RNA binding in cells.RNMT-RAM Binds the Entire Length of Pre-mRNATranscripts bound to HA-RNMT-RAM complexes were isolated from HeLa cells using CLIP and RNA fragments sequenced as in Huppertz et\u00a0al. (2014) (Figure\u00a0S8B). The quantity of RNMT-RAM-bound RNA fragments identified per transcript from three independent replicates exhibited a good correlation (Figure\u00a0S8C). The average RNMT CLIP reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) from three replicates was compared to input RPKM (Figure\u00a04A). This revealed a positive correlation between transcript expression level and RNMT binding (Pearson\u2019s correlation R\u00a0= 0.83). However, not all abundantly expressed transcripts were RNMT bound (population adjacent to the x axis), and a subset of RNMT-bound transcripts was below the limit of detection in the input sample (population adjacent to the y axis).Genome coverage analysis of the 727,624 uniquely aligned RNMT-RAM CLIP reads pooled from the three replicates revealed that most aligned to intronic regions of pre-mRNA, as opposed to the 5\u2032 localization expected of a 5\u2032 cap methyltransferase (Figure\u00a04B). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also bound by RNMT-RAM, including some highly enriched ones, e.g., MALAT1 and NEAT1 (Data S1). Because introns represent a large proportion of the annotated human genome, RNMT-RAM CLIP reads per kilobase of mRNA features were calculated (Figure\u00a04C). RNMT-RAM CLIP reads were evenly distributed between exons and introns but had increased enrichment over the UTRs. A correlation between UTR length and RNMT binding was not observed (Figure\u00a0S9A). Because RNMT-RAM binds to transcript introns (Figures 4B and 4C) and requires RNase treatment to be resolved on SDS-PAGE (Figure\u00a03A), it is likely that the complex binds to pre-mRNA during transcription.Although transcripts from 5,436 genes were identified as binding to RNMT (average log counts per million [logCPM] > 5), for further mechanistic analysis, the 684 transcripts found in the top quartile of all three RNMT-RAM CLIP replicates were designated as RNMT-enriched transcripts (Figure\u00a0S9B; Data S1). Analysis of RNMT CLIP read distribution over these RNMT-enriched transcripts confirmed that the RNMT-RAM complex binds the entire length of the nascent transcripts (Figure\u00a04D).RNMT-RAM Interacts with the Transcription-Associated ComplexesBecause RNMT-RAM binds to the full length of pre-mRNA and promotes transcription, we investigated whether it binds\u00a0to transcription-associated proteins. SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids\u00a0in cell culture) media were used to differentially label cellular proteins, allowing comparative quantitation. HA-RNMT was immunoprecipitated from extracts of\u00a0cells grown in R6K4 medium, and a mock IgG immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed on extracts of cells grown in R0K0 medium (Figure\u00a05A). Mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins enriched in the HA-RNMT IP compared to\u00a0the IgG IP (Figure\u00a05B; Data S2). HA-RNMT was found to interact with components of transcription-associated complexes, including three RNA Pol II subunits, POLR2G, POLR2H, and POL2L; transcription elongation proteins SPT4, SPT6, and ELP3; and members of\u00a0the PAF complex, PAF1, CTR9, CDC73, and LEO1.Although all previously identified RNMT-RAM-interacting proteins may have roles in RNMT-RAM-dependent transcription, we\u00a0restricted further analysis to the PAF complex (PAFc). PAFc binds directly to RNA Pol II across the gene and is involved in transcription initiation and elongation by interacting with transcriptional regulators and promoting many aspects of the transcription cycle (Jaehning, 2010, Kim et\u00a0al., 2010, Wade et\u00a0al., 1996, Yu et\u00a0al., 2015). The mechanistic relationship between RNMT-RAM and PAFc was further investigated. Endogenous CTR9 was identified in RNMT and RAM IPs (Figure\u00a05C), and endogenous RNMT was identified in CTR9 IPs (Figure\u00a05D). Endogenous LEO was also identified in RNMT IPs (Figure\u00a05E). Multiple members of the yeast PAFc bind RNA in\u00a0vitro and in cells\u00a0(Battaglia et\u00a0al., 2017, Dermody and Buratowski, 2010). The RNA dependency of the RNMT and PAFc subunit interaction was investigated. RNase A treatment did not disrupt the RNMT-CTR9 interaction, indicating that it is RNA independent (Figure\u00a05C). CTR9 interacted with the RNMT catalytic domain (Figure\u00a05F). The impact of RNMT-RAM on PAFc recruitment to genes\u00a0was assessed by investigating the occupancy of the CTR9 subunit. CTR9 recruitment to three RAM-responsive genes, hnRNPH1, FOXP2, and PDE3A, and one control gene, GAPDH, was investigated by ChIP (Figure\u00a05G). CTR9 recruitment to hnRNPH1, FOXP2, and PDE3A genes was reduced following RAM siRNA transfection. A smaller reduction in CTR9 recruitment to the GAPDH gene was observed.Consistent with its influence on PAFc recruitment, suppression of RAM expression resulted in suppression of hallmarks of PAFc function. PAFc co-operates with the Mediator complex to stimulate the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2Bub), which is critical for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) (Shilatifard, 2008, Yao et\u00a0al., 2015). PAFc also stimulates RNA Pol II CTD S2 phosphorylation (phospho-S2); this recruits Set2, which in turn catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) (Schwartz et\u00a0al., 2003, Yu et\u00a0al., 2015). RAM depletion resulted in suppression of H2Bub, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 (Figure\u00a05H) and suppression of RNA Pol II CTD phospho-S5 and phospho-S2 (Figure\u00a02F). RNMT-RAM interaction with POLR2G, POLR2H, POL2L, SPT4, SPT6, and ELP3 is also likely to affect these markers of transcription.RNMT-RAM-RNA Interaction Is Required for RNA Pol II OccupancyBecause RNMT-RAM binds across the length of pre-mRNA, binds to transcriptional regulators, and promotes transcription, the relationship between RNMT-RAM transcript binding and RNA Pol II occupancy was investigated. Genome-wide, RNMT-RAM transcript binding correlated positively with RNA Pol II occupancy over associated gene loci (Figure\u00a06A; genes products most enriched for RNMT binding are highlighted in red). In control cells, genes encoding the RNMT-enriched transcripts exhibited significantly higher levels of RNA Pol II loading than the remaining genes (mean logCPM RNMT enriched\u00a0= 7.58; mean logCPM unenriched\u00a0=\u00a05.5; p\u00a0< 2.2e\u221216) (Figures 6B and 6C). Upon RAM depletion, the genes encoding RNMT-enriched transcripts exhibited a greater fold reduction in RNA Pol II occupancy than the remaining genes\u00a0(Figure\u00a06D). This was particularly evident at the TSS, where the mean log fold change for RNMT-enriched genes was \u22120.80 and for unenriched genes was \u22120.47 (p\u00a0< 0.0001). Furthermore, the RNMT-enriched genes exhibited the largest decrease in RNA Pol II peak intensity (Figure\u00a06E; transcripts most enriched for RNMT binding are highlighted in red). Most (99%) genes with a significant response to RAM depletion exhibited a reduction in TSS-associated RNA Pol II (Figure\u00a06F).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06RAM Depletion Affects RNA Pol II Occupancy on Genes Coding RNMT-Enriched Transcripts(A) Scatterplot of RNA Pol II ChIP reads in control cells and HA-RNMT CLIP reads for annotated loci.

Horizontal line, p value of 0.05. DiscussionHere, we report that RNMT-RAM promotes RNA Pol II-dependent transcription. The impact of RNMT-RAM on transcription is direct and independent of mRNA capping, mRNA stability, and mRNA translation; expression of MTD RNMT-RAM promotes net mRNA synthesis in cells, and RNMT-RAM promotes the output of engaged RNA Pol II in isolated nuclei (Figure\u00a01). RNMT-RAM binds to pre-mRNA during transcription along the length of the transcript, in positive correlation with RNA Pol II gene occupancy (Figures 3, \u200b,4,4, and \u200band6).6). When RNMT-RAM is suppressed, there is a substantial loss of RNA Pol II from chromatin; 86% of RNA Pol II peaks reduce to below the threshold of detection (Figure\u00a02). The impact of RNMT-RAM on transcription is most apparent on genes to which RNMT-RAM binds the RNA products (Figure\u00a06). We emphasize that in this study, we established protocols for sublethal depletion of RNMT-RAM in cells, allowing the impact of RNMT-RAM to be studied independently of toxicity (Figure\u00a0S1).How does RNMT-RAM affect transcription? The activating subunit, RAM, has a key role. Previously, both the RNMT-activating domain (1\u201355) and the RNA binding domain (55\u201390) were demonstrated to be important for cell proliferation (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis and Cowling, 2014b). However, the mechanistic role of the RNA binding domain was unclear. On analysis of RNMT-RAM-bound transcripts, we did not identify a specific RNA motif to which the complex has enhanced affinity; rather, RAM was critical for RNMT to be recruited to all transcripts along their entire length (Figures 3 and \u200band4).4). As discussed, RNMT-RAM recruitment to transcripts positively correlates with RNA Pol II loading on genes, consistent with RNMT-RAM being recruited to RNA Pol II; the more nascent transcript emerging, the more RNA for RNMT-RAM to bind (Aregger and Cowling, 2013, Glover-Cutter et\u00a0al., 2008). What was unexpected was that suppression of RNMT-RAM expression resulted in repression of RNA Pol II occupancy on genes (Figure\u00a02), and the extent of this effect correlated with RNMT-RAM transcript binding (Figure\u00a06).One feature of the impact of RNMT-RAM on RNA Pol II distribution is that it reduces RNA Pol II at the TSS and the gene body (Figures 2 and \u200band6).6). RNA Pol II at the TSS can be highly unstable, undergoing rounds of premature transcription termination (Ehrensberger et\u00a0al., 2013, Wagschal et\u00a0al., 2012). Findings demonstrated that RNA Pol II at the TSS, rather than being stably paused, can be rapidly turning over, and induced transcription occurs when the dynamic RNA Pol II is stabilized (Krebs et\u00a0al., 2017, Nilson et\u00a0al., 2017). Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that RNMT-RAM increases RNA Pol II output throughout the gene. Our data are consistent with RNMT-RAM promoting RNA Pol II stabilization following initiation, thus increasing the peak proximal to the TSS and promoting RNA Pol II output.Which factors mediate RNMT-RAM-dependent transcription? A study in S.\u00a0cerevisiae reported that many RNA Pol II-associated factors, including PAFc, crosslink to nascent RNA (Battaglia et\u00a0al., 2017). The authors propose that interaction with nascent RNA contributes to elongation factor recruitment to transcribing RNA Pol II. The multiple contacts between RNMT-RAM, transcription-associated factors (RNA Pol II subunits SPT4, SPT6, and the PAFc), and pre-mRNA are likely to stabilize their interaction and retain these complexes on the transcript during synthesis (Figures 3, \u200b,4,4, and \u200band5).5). We demonstrated that RNMT-RAM suppression results in dissociation of PAFc from its target loci (Figure\u00a05). Therefore, both RNA Pol II and Ctr9 recruitment are reduced by inhibition of RNMT-RAM. Because PAF controls RNA Pol II action and, conversely, RNA Pol II has a PAF recruitment surface, it is not possible to determine which is the primary RNMT-RAM-controlled factor; it may be a combination of both.Previous studies described a checkpoint model for coupling mRNA capping with transcription (Orphanides and Reinberg, 2002, Saldi et\u00a0al., 2016). Several such mechanisms have been observed, including those that operate in global and gene-specific manners. The first step in cap formation, addition of inverted guanosine to the nascent transcript, is a necessary checkpoint to protect the pre-mRNA from degradation during synthesis, probably in all eukaryotes (Brannan et\u00a0al., 2012, Furuichi et\u00a0al., 1977). In addition, the capping enzymes have been observed to regulate transcription independent of enzymatic activity; such mechanisms identified to date operate in gene-specific manners. Because the relationship between the capping enzymes and the transcriptional machinery is fairly distinct in different eukaryotes, it is perhaps unsurprising that these enzymes influence transcription in species-specific mechanisms. In yeast species, the mRNA cap guanylyltransferases and methyltransferases interact with transcriptional regulators and have roles in promoting transcription (Guiguen et\u00a0al., 2007, Kim et\u00a0al., 2004, Schroeder et\u00a0al., 2004). In mammals, the capping enzyme (RNGTT) (triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase) counteracts transcriptional repression by the negative elongation factor (NELF) and promotes formation of transcriptional R loops (Kaneko et\u00a0al., 2007, Mandal et\u00a0al., 2004). The role of the human mRNA cap methyltransferase in transcription had not been addressed previously.The RNMT-RAM checkpoint discovered here is a mechanism to regulate transcription, which results in gene-specific changes in RNA Pol II occupancy and output. This is physiologically important in systems in which RNMT-RAM is regulated. For example, in embryonic stem cells, RNMT-RAM influences the expression of pluripotency-associated genes (Grasso et\u00a0al., 2016). Repression of RAM is required for repression of these genes during differentiation.In summary, we present a revised understanding of RNMT-RAM function. Because mRNAs are capped and depend on RNMT-RAM for translation, it is likely that a transient interaction with the cap methyltransferase suffices for the methylation reaction, whereas interaction along the full length of transcripts promotes transcription. Experimental ProceduresAntibodiesAntibodies were raised against full-length RNMT and RAM (Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et\u00a0al., 2011). Others were raised against actin (ab3280, Abcam); LEO1 (A300-174A-T, Bethyl Laboratories); phosphor-S2 Pol II (3E10) and phospho-S5 Pol II (3E8, Chromotek); CTR9 (12619S), H2Bub (5546P), H3K4me3 (9727S), and H3K36me3 (9763S, Cell Signaling Technology); Ac-H3 (06-599, Millipore); anti-HA horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (12013819001, Roche); and RNA Pol II (sc-899) and H3 (sc-10809, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Cell CultureHeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 46C mESCs were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated plates in Glasgow\u2019s minimum essential medium (GMEM), 10% knockout serum replacement, 1% mem-NEAA, 1\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100\u00a0U/mL recombinant Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 4\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5, 2\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5-HA-RNMT, 4\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5-HA-RNMT \u0394416\u2013456, 2\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5 HA-RNMT MTD, 2\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5-HA-RNMT \u03941\u2013120, and 1\u00a0\u03bcg pcDNA5-HA-RNMT 1\u2013120 or 4\u00a0\u03bcg of pcDNA5 RAM-GFP for 48\u00a0hr. siRNA transfections were performed with 200 pmol RAM siRNA or non-targeting control (siGenome, Dharmacon) using RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 36 or 48 and 72\u00a0hr in HeLa and mESCs, respectively. siRAM1 and siRAM4 in HeLa cells are D-021286-01 and D-021286-04 (Dharmacon). The siRAM mixture used in mESCs is equimolar D-049592-01 and D-049592-03 (Dharmacon). HeLa and mESCs stably expressing RNMT were made with the pBMN retroviral vector system and pPyPCAGGS vector. Cells were treated with 3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of actinomycin D or DMSO for RNA decay experiments.CLIPCLIP was performed according to Huppertz et\u00a0al. (2014) with the following alterations. Five to ten 100\u00a0mm plates with subconfluent HeLa cells were UV-crosslinked with 250 mJ/cm2 at 254\u00a0nm in Stratalinker 2400. Lysates were sonicated for five 30\u00a0s pulses in a Bioruptor (Diagenode) at low amplitude. Nuclease digestion with 5\u00a0\u03bcL Turbo DNase (Life Technologies) and 10\u00a0\u03bcL 1:500 (high) to 1:10,000 (low) dilution of RNase A (70194Z, Affymetrix) were performed in a thermomixer at 37\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min of shaking at 1,100\u00a0rpm. HA-RNMT was immunoprecipitated with 10\u00a0\u03bcL Pierce anti-HA magnetic beads for 2\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C. IP RNA was labeled using the 32P-labeled 3\u2032-RNA linker (5\u2032-Pmn.GGAACCGUGGGCUCUUAAGGU-3\u2032) prepared by kinase labeling and purification through Sephadex G-25 columns as in Moore et\u00a0al. (2014). Reverse transcription and linearization were performed using RT primer and Cut oligo as mentioned in Table S1. Sequencing for CLIP was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Reads were aligned with Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies), with duplicates collapsed using tools from the cross-induced mutation sites (CIMS) pipeline and reads per transcript counted with HTSeq (Anders et\u00a0al., 2015, Moore et\u00a0al., 2014). Genome coverage was calculated using BedTools, and the read distribution profile was plotted with ngs.plot, with combined data for all replicates (Quinlan, 2014, Shen et\u00a0al., 2014). Input sequencing, alignment, and quantification are described in the RNA-Seq section.\u00a0RPKM and CPM values were obtained from the edgeR package (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2010). Correlations with UTR length and input counts were\u00a0performed\u00a0with custom R scripts. RNMT-enriched transcripts were determined by intersecting the top quartiles of three replicates with a cutoff of 50 counts per million aligned reads. Gene Ontology analysis was performed on the Bioconductor GOseq package (Young et\u00a0al., 2010).ChIPChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using 2\u00a0\u03bcg anti-RNA Pol II or 5\u00a0\u03bcL CTR9 antibody with 25\u00a0\u03bcg HeLa chromatin as in Varshney et\u00a0al. (2015). Libraries for sequencing were prepared as in Wiechens et\u00a0al. (2016), and sequencing was performed on Illumina NextSeq. ChIP reads were aligned with STAR, correlations were performed with deepTools, and the read distribution profile was plotted with ngs.plot (Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013, Ram\u00edrez et\u00a0al., 2014, Shen et\u00a0al., 2014). Data from replicates were pooled for analysis of gene loci. Bedgraphs were visualized using the Integrated Genome Browser (Nicol et\u00a0al., 2009). Fragments aligning uniquely to each annotated gene locus\u00a0\u00b1 2 kb, to each annotated TSS \u00b1 1 kb, or to a gene body (TSS\u00a0+ 1 kb to TES\u00a0+ 2 kb) were counted with the HTSeq package (Anders et\u00a0al., 2015). Only loci with more than 5 uniquely aligned counts per million per gene locus or 1 uniquely aligned count per million per TSS were considered for log fold change and p\u00a0value calculations by exactTest in the Bioconductor edgeR package (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2010). Peaks were called using MACS2 call summits, with a q value cutoff of 0.01.IPsCell lysates were prepared in 50\u00a0mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50\u00a0mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 270\u00a0mM sucrose, 1\u00a0mM sodium orthovanadate, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 10\u00a0mM \u03b2-glycerol phosphate, 5\u00a0mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 10\u00a0\u03bcM leupeptin, 1\u00a0\u03bcM pepstatin, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL aprotinin, and phosphatase inhibitor (PI) 2 and PI3 cocktail (Sigma) and were precleared with 20\u00a0\u03bcL washed protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C on a rotating mixer. Resin was pelleted and supernatant was incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcg antibody for 2\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C. 1\u00a0\u03bcL RNase A (70194Z, Affymetrix) was added before IP where required. Protein G Sepharose beads were prepared by washing twice in lysis buffer, blocking with 1\u00a0mg/mL BSA at RT for 30\u00a0min, and washing thrice in lysis buffer. 20\u00a0\u03bcL of beads were added to each IP and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr on\u00a0a\u00a0rotating mixer. IPs were washed thrice with ice-cold lysis buffer without detergent and eluted with 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer by boiling at 70\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min before western blot analysis.Nuclear Run-OnNuclear run-on was performed as in Roberts et\u00a0al. (2015) with the following modifications. 2\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells plated the day before were lysed and washed in\u00a0buffer containing 10\u00a0\u03bcM leupeptin, 1\u00a0\u03bcM pepstatin, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL aprotinin, 1:1,000 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail II and III, and 5\u00a0mM DTT (Sigma). Nuclei were stored in nucleus storage buffer that contained the same protease and phosphatase inhibitors, DTT, and 1\u00a0U/\u03bcL RNAase inhibitor (RNAsin). 5fM recombinant RNMT and/or RAM protein were added to nuclei from a 10\u00a0cm plate and incubated for 20\u201330\u00a0min at 30\u00b0C, with 1\u00a0mM ATP, 1\u00a0mM cytidine trisphosphate (CTP), 1\u00a0mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP), 0.5\u00a0mM BrUTP, 0.5\u00a0mM UTP, and 1\u00a0U/\u03bcL RNAsin. Recombinant RAM 1\u201390 was used, rather than full-length RAM (1\u2013118), because the latter is unstable. Following nuclear run-on and RNA purification, Br-U IP was performed with more than 10\u00a0\u03bcg RNA (normalized across samples). Following IP, RNA was resuspended in 30\u00a0\u03bcL, with 10\u00a0\u03bcL used for cDNA synthesis and PCR.Quantification of Poly(A) RNA Synthesis by 3H-Uridine IncorporationSubconfluent HeLa cells were incubated with 60\u00a0\u03bcM 5,6-3H-uridine (PerkinElmer) for 30\u00a0min 36\u201348\u00a0hr post-transfection with siRNA or pcDNA5-based constructs. Total RNA was purified with TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified using a Qubit RNA BR assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Poly(A) mRNA was purified from total RNA using the NEBNext poly(A) mRNA\u00a0magnetic isolation module (NEB) or mRNA Direct (Ambion). 3H-uridine incorporation into mRNA was quantified by scintillation, counting equal amounts (40\u201370\u00a0ng) of purified poly(A) RNA.RNA-SeqRNA was extracted from HeLa cells using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Libraries were prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with the Ribo-Zero kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Reads were aligned using STAR software, and transcripts were quantified with the HTSeq package (Anders et\u00a0al., 2015, Dobin et\u00a0al., 2013). Library normalization and differential expression analysis were performed using the Bioconductor edgeR package (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2010). Only transcripts expressed above the threshold of 2 reads per million in 4+ replicates were considered for analysis. The p values were calculated using the GLMqlf test and adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Data were plotted using custom R scripts.RT-PCRRNA was isolated using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 100\u2013200\u00a0ng RNA was used to prepare cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed with the EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad) on the CFX384 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are in Table S1.SILAC Mass SpectrometryHEK293 cells were cultured in R0K0 media with 84\u00a0mg/L L-arginine (Sigma) and\u00a0146\u00a0mg/L L-lysine (Sigma) or R4K4 media with an of equal concentration L-arginine 13C and l-Lysine 4,4,5,5-D4 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for\u00a05\u00a0cell doublings and were lysed in 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 15\u00a0mM MgCl2, and 10\u00a0mM KCl. Lysates were precleared with protein G Sepharose. Equal cell lysates from R0K0- and R6K4-labeled 293 HA-RNMT cells were affinity purified with murine IgG agarose (Sigma) and monoclonal anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma), respectively, and washed with lysis buffer; eluates were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. The mix was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and lanes were excised into five slices before in-gel tryptic digestion. Samples were analyzed on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a U3000 nano-LC system (Dionex). Data were analyzed with MaxQuant (v.1.0.13.13) with the MaxQuant Human database and Mascot search engine v.2.3.2 (Matrix Science) (Cox and Mann, 2008, Cox et\u00a0al., 2009).
