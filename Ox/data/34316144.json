Etiology and Outcomes of ARDS in the Elderly Population in an Intensive Care Unit in North India. Indian J Crit Care Med 2021;25(6):648\u2013654.Keywords: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Elderly, Pneumonia, Respiratory failure, Sepsis IntroductionAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with acute onset (<7 days) hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral opacities on chest radiograph, either due to the injury to the lung parenchyma or the pulmonary vasculature.1 ARDS is subclassified as mild (200 < PaO2:FiO2 ratio \u2264300), moderate (100 < PaO2:FiO2 ratio \u2264200), or severe (PaO2:FiO2 ratio \u2264100) based on the degree of hypoxemia.2 The mortality increases from 27% to as high as 45% with increasing severity of ARDS.2 Apart from the severity of hypoxemia, several other factors affect ARDS outcomes, including the driving pressure, arterial PaCO2, the strategy used for mechanical ventilation, and others.3\u20137 There is limited information regarding the effect of age on mortality in ARDS.8\u201310Most clinical trials generally exclude elderly subjects with ARDS. In fact, major trials of ARDS do not address the issue of age-related mortality in ARDS.7,11,12 Previous trials have merely mentioned the mean age in comparator groups and have not explored the mortality in the elderly.7,11,12 With increasing global age, the proportion of elderly ARDS is likely to increase in the intensive care units (ICUs).13 Although the principles of ARDS management are similar in elderly patients, the resolution of ARDS and the outcomes might be different in the elderly population. The elderly subjects have an age-related decline of the physiological reserve and a higher prevalence of comorbid illness.14,15 These changes further enhance the stress due to acute illnesses, thereby increasing the risk of mortality in critically ill elderly patients.15,16 We hypothesized that old age would independently affect the outcomes in subjects with ARDS. Our objective was to compare the clinical characteristics and the ICU outcomes of elderly (age >65 years) subjects with ARDS. Materials and MethodsWe included all individuals diagnosed with ARDS admitted to the intensive care unit of Department of Pulmonary Medicine of our institute between February 1, 2001 and December 31, 2019. We use a specifically designed computer software to prospectively enter the patient data.17,18 We calculated the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) scores and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores using baseline values. Each subsequent day in respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) was calendar day timed from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. of the next day. We calculated the delta SOFA as described previously.19 We were granted a waiver for informed consent due to anonymized data's retrospective use by the Institute Ethics Committee.We used the American-European Consensus Conference criteria for acute lung injury and ARDS (before January 1, 2013) and Berlin definition (after 2013) for diagnosing ARDS.2All the patient records were screened for study inclusion. We excluded repeat ICU admissions from the analysis. We used a low tidal volume strategy to ventilate all our patients. We used midazolam and atracurium during the initial 48\u201372 hours to facilitate mechanical ventilation.20 In addition we provided stress ulcer and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis as per the ICU protocol. The subjects were given enteral nutrition.We recorded the following information: (a) demographic profile; (b) etiology of ARDS; (c) baseline APACHE II and SOFA scores; (d) daily SOFA score including the maximum SOFA score attained during RICU stay; (e) duration of mechanical ventilation; (f) worst values of the following physiologic and ventilator parameters recorded daily including PaO2:FiO2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), plateau pressure (Pplat), driving pressure (Pplat minus PEEP) and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (Ppeak); (g) ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS); and (h) final outcome.We categorized subjects with age >65 years as ARDSelderly, and those with age \u226465 years as ARDSnonelderly, based on previous studies and the World Health Organization definition of the elderly.9,21,22 We compared the ICU outcomes between elderly and nonelderly subjects with ARDS. We also investigated parameters that predicted mortality in subjects with ARDS.Statistical AnalysisWe used statistical software package (SPSS for MS-Windows, version 22.0, IBM Inc., Armonk, New York, United States) to perform statistical analysis. We used the Chi-square test and the Student's t-test (or Mann\u2013Whitney U test), or analysis of variance (or Kruskal\u2013Wallis) for comparing the differences between categorical and continuous variables, respectively. We have described the normally and non-normally distributed data as mean with standard deviation (SD), and median (interquartile range), respectively. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the factors affecting survival. The variables found significant (p <0.1) on the univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate logistic regression model to derive adjusted odds ratio and confidence limits. The level of significance was expressed as probability values (p value) and the odds ratio [95% confidence intervals(CIs)]. We constructed survival curves to study the effect of the category of ARDS on RICU stay using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. We used the log-rank test to study the differences between the survival curves. We used the mixed model technique for repeated measures analysis of variance to compare the trends in lung mechanics (static lung compliance, PaO2:FiO2 ratio) and ventilatory parameters (PIP, PEEP, plateau pressure, and driving pressure); the within-groups factor was the time (baseline to day 5 of RICU stay), and the between-groups factor was age (ARDSelderly vs ARDSnonelderly). We considered a p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. ResultsWe admitted 780 subjects with ARDS during the study period. We included 625 (ARDSelderly, 140 [22.4%] and ARDSnonelderly, 485 [77.6%]) subjects for further analysis. We excluded the remaining subjects due to survival for <24 hours, ambiguity in the diagnosis and etiology of ARDS, and the presence of insufficient information. The mean (SD) age of the study population (males, n = 352 [56.3%]) was 40.6 (17.8) years and was significantly higher in the ARDSelderly (67.3 vs 32.9 years). Serum glucose was significantly higher in the ARDSelderly (ARDSelderly vs ARDSnonelderly; mean \u00b1 SD, 150.5 \u00b1 98.7 vs 129.3 \u00b1 79, respectively; p = 0.009) at admission (Table 1). Comorbid illnesses were frequent in the ARDSelderly (p = 0.0001) than ARDSnonelderly. The mean \u00b1 SD APACHE II score at baseline was not different between the two arms (ARDSelderly vs ARDSnonelderly, 19.2 \u00b1 7.8 vs 18.4 \u00b1 8.2, respectively; p = 0.327). We did not find any difference in the APACHE II score even after recalculating the APACHE II score without age (ARDSelderly vs ARDSnonelderly, 16.4 \u00b1 8.9 vs 17.4 \u00b1 7.9, respectively; p = 0.238). We found no difference in the severity of illness at admission (baseline SOFA score) between the two groups (Table 1).Table 1Baseline characteristics, ventilatory parameters, and outcomes of patients with ALI/ARDSelderly and ALI/ARDSnonelderlyParametersTotal (n = 625)ARDSelderly (n = 140)ARDSnonelderly (n = 485)p valueDemographic profileMale gender, n (%)\u2007352 (56.3)\u2007\u200786 (61.4)\u2007266 (54.8)0.177Age, in years40.6 \u00b1 17.8\u2007\u200767.3 \u00b1 7\u200732.9 \u00b1 11.40.0001$Any comorbidity, n (%)\u2007176 (28.2)\u2007\u200783 (59.3)\u2007\u200793 (19.2)0.0001Laboratory parametersPlasma glucose\u2007134 \u00b1 84.2150.5 \u00b1 98.7129.3 \u00b1 790.009Hemoglobin, g/dL\u200710.9 \u00b1 3\u200711.1 \u00b1 2.9\u200710.9 \u00b1 30.451Serum albumin, mg/dL\u2007\u20072.3 \u00b1 2.5\u2007\u20072.3 \u00b1 1.4\u2007\u20072.3 \u00b1 2.80.855ICU severity scoresBaseline APACHE II score\u200718.6 \u00b1 8.1\u200719.2 \u00b1 7.8\u200718.4 \u00b1 8.20.324Baseline APACHE II score without age\u200717.2 \u00b1 8.2\u200716.4 \u00b1 8.9\u200717.4 \u00b1 7.90.238SOFA score at admission\u2007\u20077.8 \u00b1 3.6\u2007\u20077.2 \u00b1 3.3\u2007\u20077.9 \u00b1 3.70.058Delta-SOFA score\u2007\u2007\u20072 \u00b1 2.9\u2007\u20072.2 \u00b1 3.1\u2007\u20071.9 \u00b1 2.90.370Respiratory parametersPaCO2\u200739.1 \u00b1 13.8\u200739.3 \u00b1 14.7\u200739.1 \u00b1 13.50.881PaO2:FiO2 ratio\u2007167.9 \u00b1 67.8\u2007171.9 \u00b1 69.9\u2007166.8 \u00b1 67.20.430Cstat at RICU admission, mL/cm H2O\u200725.3 \u00b1 12.1\u200727.6 \u00b1 12.3\u200724.8 \u00b1 120.109Type of respiratory support0.094Oxygen supplementation\u2007140 (22.4)\u2007\u200740 (28.6)\u2007100 (20.6)Noninvasive ventilation\u2007\u200725 (4)8 (5.7)\u2007\u200717 (3.5)Invasive mechanical ventilation\u2007460 (73.6)\u2007\u200792 (65.7)\u2007368 (75.9)Ventilator parametersPIP, cm of H2O\u2007\u2007\u200728 \u00b1 8.1\u200726.8 \u00b1 7.6\u200728.3 \u00b1 8.20.087Plateau pressure, in cm of H2O\u200723.9 \u00b1 6.2\u200722.3 \u00b1 5.9\u200724.3 \u00b1 6.20.004PEEP, cm of H2O\u2007\u20078.2 \u00b1 4.4\u2007\u2007\u20077 \u00b1 3.3\u2007\u20078.4 \u00b1 4.60.012Driving pressure, cm of H2O\u2007\u20075.3 \u00b1 3.9\u2007\u20076.1 \u00b1 4\u2007\u20075.7 \u00b1 3.90.421Type of ARDS0.0001*Extrapulmonary ARDS\u2007312 (49.9)\u2007\u200748 (34.3)\u2007264 (54.4)#Pulmonary ARDS\u2007313 (50.1)\u2007\u200792 (65.7)\u2007221 (45.6)Severity of ARDS0.440Mild\u2007209 (33.4)\u2007\u200752 (37.4)\u2007157 (32.4)Moderate\u2007306 (49)\u2007\u200762 (44.6)\u2007244 (50.3)Severe\u2007110 (17.6)\u2007\u200726 (18.6)\u2007\u200784 (17.3)OutcomesMortality, n (%)\u2007224 (35.8)\u2007\u200763 (45)\u2007161 (33.2)0.012ICU length of stay, in days\u2007\u20079.6 \u00b1 8.8\u200710.6 \u00b1 8.9\u2007\u20079.3 \u00b1 8.80.121Hospital length of stay, in days\u200718.9 \u00b1 48\u200722.7 \u00b1 59.6\u200717.8 \u00b1 44.10.283Open in a separate window*Includes sepsis, acute pancreatitis, multiple transfusions, and malaria; #Includes community-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, vasculitis, \u00adtuberculosis, fat embolism, drowning, and paraquat poisoning; $Includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, \u00adimmunosuppression, and malignancy.

The most common cause of ARDS in the elderly was community-acquired pneumonia (47%, 66/140), while sepsis (43.5%, 211/485) was the most common cause of ARDS in the younger subjects. There was no difference in the baseline PaCO2, PaO2:FiO2 ratio, and static lung compliance or the severity of ARDS between the two study arms. Most of the subjects were managed with positive pressure ventilation (noninvasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation); the type of ventilatory support was similar between the two study groups. The mean \u00b1 SD plateau pressure (ARDSnonelderly vs ARDS elderly, 24.3 \u00b1 6.2 vs 22.3 \u00b1 5.9; p = 0.004) and applied PEEP (ARDSnonelderly vs ARDS elderly, 8.4 \u00b1 4.6 vs 7 \u00b1 3.3; p = 0.012) were significantly higher in the ARDSnonelderly arm than ARDSelderly. However, there was no difference in the baseline peak airway pressures and the driving pressures (Table 1). There was no difference in the trends of PaO2:FiO2 ratio between the two groups during the initial 5 days of RICU stay (Fig. 1). The plateau pressure reduced significantly with time (days 0 through 5) in both the groups and were significantly lower in the ARDSelderly compared to the ARDS nonelderly at all time. The driving pressure reduced during the RICU stay in ARDSelderly, while it increased in ARDSnonelderly during RICU stay. There were no significant differences in other parameters between the two groups. We found no difference in the duration of ICU and hospital LOS between the two groups. There were 224 (35.8%) deaths, and the mortality was significantly higher (p = 0.012) in the ARDSelderly compared to ARDSnonelderly (ARDSelderly vs ARDSnonelderly, 45 vs 33.2%).Open in a separate windowFigs 1A to FTime course of plateau pressure (left top panel), peak inspiratory pressure (left middle panel), driving pressure (left lower panel), PaO2:FiO2 ratio (right top panel), PEEP (right middle panel), and static lung compliance (right lower panel) from baseline to day 5 in the two groups of patients.

However, in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only variables that predicted outcome were the baseline SOFA score, the development of new organ dysfunction (delta-SOFA score), and pulmonary ARDS (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of parameters between survivors and nonsurvivorsParametersSurvivors (n = 401)Nonsurvivors (n = 224)p valueCrude OR (95% CI)Adjusted OR (95% CI)Female gender, n (%)\u2007\u2007189 (47.1)\u2007\u2007\u200784 (37.5)0.0230.67 (0.48\u20130.94)*0.76 (0.5\u20131.2)Comorbid illness$\u2007\u2007\u200795 (23.7)\u2007\u2007\u200781 (36.2)0.001\u20071.8 (1.3\u20132.6)*\u20071.5 (0.9\u20132.5)Laboratory parametersPlasma glucose126.2 \u00b1 76.7148.1 \u00b1 94.70.002\u2007\u20071 (1\u20131.01)*\u2007\u20071 (0.99\u20131)Hemoglobin, g/dL\u2007\u200711 \u00b1 3\u200710.9 \u00b1 3.10.9050.99 (0.9\u20131.1)Serum albumin, mg/dL\u2007\u20072.3 \u00b1 2.5\u2007\u20072.3 \u00b1 2.60.6861.01 (0.9\u20131.1)ICU severity scoresSOFA score\u2007\u20077.2 \u00b1 3.4\u2007\u20078.8 \u00b1 3.80.0001\u20071.1 (1.1\u20131.2)*\u20071.1 (1.1\u20131.2)*Delta-SOFA score\u2007\u20071.4 \u00b1 2.1; 0 (0\u20132)\u2007\u20073.2 \u00b1 3.7; 2 (0\u20135)0.0001\u20071.2 (1.1\u20131.3)*1.4 (1.3\u20131.5)*Respiratory parametersPaCO2\u200741.8 \u00b1 16.3\u200737.6 \u00b1 11.90.0001\u2007\u20071 (1.01\u20131.03)*\u2007\u20071 (0.9\u20131)PaO2:FiO2 ratio175.7 \u00b1 67.7154 \u00b1 65.90.00010.99 (0.99\u20131)*Cstat at RICU admission, mL/cm H2O\u200724.4 \u00b1 10.9\u200725.8 \u00b1 12.80.3000.99 (0.97\u20131)Type of respiratory support0.014Noninvasive support#\u2007119 (29.7)\u2007\u200746 (20.5)ReferenceReferenceInvasive mechanical ventilation\u2007282 (70.3)\u2007178 (79.5)\u20071.6 (1.1\u20132.4)*\u20071.3 (0.7\u20132.2)Ventilator parametersPeak airway pressure, cm of H2O\u200727.3 \u00b1 7.9\u200729.1 \u00b1 8.30.0121.03 (1\u20131.1)*1 (0.9\u20131)Plateau pressure, in cm of H2O\u200723.6 \u00b1 5.8\u200724.5 \u00b1 6.80.1381.02 (0.9\u20131.1)PEEP, cm of H2O\u2007\u20078.1 \u00b1 4.7\u2007\u20078.3 \u00b1 3.90.7021.01 (0.9\u20131.1)Driving pressure, cm of H2O\u2007\u20075.9 \u00b1 4.1\u2007\u20075.8 \u00b1 3.60.1020.99 (0.94\u20131)Type of ARDS0.016Extrapulmonary ARDS\u2007215 (53.6)\u2007\u200797 (43.3)ReferenceReferencePulmonary ARDS\u2007186 (46.4)\u2007127 (56.7)1.5 (1.1\u20132.1)*2 (1.3\u20133.1)*Category of ARDS0.012ARDSnonelderly\u2007324 (80.8)\u2007161 (71.9)ReferenceReferenceARDSelderly\u2007\u200777 (19.2)\u2007\u200763 (28.1)1.6 (1.1\u20132.4)*1.4 (0.8\u20132.4)Severity of ARDS0.001Mild\u2007150 (37.5)\u2007\u200759 (26.3)ReferenceReferenceModerate\u2007194 (48.5)\u2007112 (50)1.5 (1\u20132.1)*1.5 (0.9\u20133.3)Severe\u2007\u200756 (14)\u2007\u200753 (23.7)2.4 (1.5\u20133.9)*1.7 (0.9\u20132.5)Open in a separate window*Statistically significant; #Include oxygen supplementation and noninvasive ventilation; $Includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, immunosuppression, and malignancy.

There was no difference in time to death between the two study arms (log-rank test) DiscussionThis study highlights that while the elderly subjects had greater comorbid illnesses and more pulmonary ARDS than the younger subjects, they did not experience higher mortality than their younger counterparts. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of age on outcomes in subjects with ARDS.8,9,21,22 Notably, some of these studies were conducted before the landmark ARDSnet trial.7\u20139 Thus, a better understanding of the etiology and factors predicting outcomes in elderly subjects with ARDS is required. The proportion of elderly subjects with ARDS in our study was 22% and was lower than the previous studies (up to 60%).8,9,22 The lower prevalence of elderly subjects in our study could be due to the lower life expectancy of the Indian population compared to the western countries. It could also be due to a general perception of poor outcomes and physicians\u2019 reluctance to admit the elderly to the ICU.14The common etiology of ARDS in the elderly subjects was pneumonia, while sepsis was the most common cause of ARDS in younger individuals. In general, the incidence of pneumonia is higher in the elderly than in the young and is associated with higher mortality.21,23\u201325 Even in the current study, the presence of pneumonia and pulmonary ARDS was an independent predictor of mortality. The elderly subjects required lower PEEP and driving pressure than the younger individuals, possibly due to the difference in ARDS etiology between the two arms. It has been previously shown that a higher PEEP is required for the extrapulmonary compared to the pulmonary ARDS.26,27 The resolution of respiratory failure and lung mechanics was similar in the two groups; this contradicts that with a poor physiological reserve, the elderly subjects are more likely to require longer periods for recovery than their younger counterparts.15,16 In fact, the ICU and hospital stay were also similar in the two groups.The mortality (45%) in the elderly subjects with ARDS in our study was lower than those in previous studies (60\u201385%).9,10,15,28 Higher mortality could be due to the inclusion of subjects with HIV infection, active malignancy, and cirrhosis.9 The lower mortality in the elderly may also be due to the universal use of low tidal volume strategy and differences in ARDS etiology in our study. In another study, the SOFA score and the lung mechanics (PIP) rather than the age were predictors of mortality.21 Another study of ARDS secondary to trauma also demonstrated organ dysfunction at baseline rather than age to be a predictor of survival.22 Even in our study, higher severity of illness at baseline (SOFA score) was independently associated with a higher odds of death. Another factor that predicted mortality in our study was the delta-SOFA score, which signifies the development of new organ dysfunction. An increase in delta SOFA has been previously shown to be associated with an increase in ICU mortality and follows a linear pattern.29Intuitively, the presence of comorbid illness should affect outcomes in elderly subjects. However, the presence of comorbid illness did not impact the clinical outcomes in the current study. In a previous study, the mere presence of comorbidity was not associated with higher mortality in subjects with ARDS.30 However, a Charlson's comorbidity score of >4 predicted higher mortality.30 In another study, comorbid illness, such as COPD, chronic steroid use, and presence of diabetes mellitus, was not associated with a higher mortality.9,31 The presence of hyperglycemia has been associated with poor outcomes in critically ill subjects.32 The elderly subjects in the current study had significantly higher plasma glucose levels. However, on a multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher plasma glucose at admission did not predict mortality, possibly due to better glucose control in the ICU after admission.31Our study has a few limitations. The study was single-centered with the inherent flaws of a retrospective study design. We used an arbitrary cutoff value of 65 years. The number of very old subjects (>80 years) was less; thus, the results of this study may not be applicable to this age-group. The use of an arbitrary age cutoff is likely to ignore the with-in-age group heterogeneity in organ reserves, functional ability, and the ability to tolerate the various treatment.33 Thus, future studies may consider using an objective measure of frailty, which is more likely to represent the biological age. Finally, we do not have the follow-up details of subjects after discharge from the hospital.In conclusion, the outcomes in elderly subjects with ARDS are dependent on the severity of illness at admission, the occurrence of new organ dysfunction, and the etiology of ARDS rather than the age. More studies are needed to confirm our findings.
