The piRNA pathway is widespread in metazoans and relies on the cooperation between small RNAs and Argonaute (AGO) proteins to silence targets both post\u2010 and co\u2010transcriptionally; the precise molecular mechanisms through which it operates, however, vary between species.\nC.\u00a0elegans piRNAs play a fundamental role in recognizing non\u2010self DNA elements, inducing their repression and promoting a multi\u2010generational epigenetic memory of their silencing (Ashe et al, 2012; Bagijn et al, 2012; Shirayama et al, 2012; Lee et al, 2012). Moreover, they have been shown to regulate the expression of a subset of endogenous genes in the germline (Rojas\u2010R\u00edos & Simonelig, 2018). Most C.\u00a0elegans piRNAs are encoded by two specific clusters on chromosome IV, which contain thousands of intergenic and intronic individual piRNA transcription units enriched in Ruby motif\u2010containing promoters (motif\u2010dependent or type I piRNAs) (Ruby et al, 2006; Cecere et al, 2012; Gu et al, 2012; Billi et al, 2013). A smaller number of piRNAs are produced from other loci in the genome (Batista et al, 2008) and transcribed bidirectionally from transcription start sites (TSSs) flanked by YRNT motifs (motif\u2010independent or type II piRNAs) (Ruby et al, 2006; Gu et al, 2012).Mature C.\u00a0elegans piRNAs are 21 nt small RNAs with a 5\u2032 uracil bias (hence called 21U\u2010RNAs), a 5\u2032 monophosphate, and a 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at their extremities, and are post\u2010transcriptionally 2\u2032\u2010O methylated at the 3\u2032 end (Kamminga et al, 2010; Montgomery et al, 2012). They bind to the PIWI subfamily proteins of the AGO family and guide them to complementary target transcripts.Two PIWI proteins with germline\u2010restricted expression, PRG\u20101 and PRG\u20102, have been identified in C.\u00a0elegans, although only PRG\u20101 is required for maintaining wild\u2010type piRNA populations (Batista et al, 2008; Das et al, 2008; Wang & Reinke, 2008). Unlike in other animals, where PIWI/piRNA complexes silence their targets via a PIWI endonuclease \u201cslicing\u201d activity, PRG\u20101/piRNA complexes in C.\u00a0elegans trigger target degradation indirectly. The imperfect base pairing of the piRNA with its complementary transcripts elicits a localized silencing amplification response in which the targeted recruitment of the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) RRF\u20101 and EGO\u20101 leads to the generation of a secondary class of small RNAs (termed secondary endogenous siRNAs (endo\u2010siRNAs) or 22G siRNAs) that are 22 nt long, have a 5\u2032 guanine bias, and carry a 5\u2032 triphosphate. These abundant molecules in turn promote robust and sustained silencing upon loading onto worm\u2010specific AGO proteins (WAGOs) (Batista et al, 2008; Gu et al, 2009; Bagijn et al, 2012; Lee et al, 2012; Shirayama et al, 2012; Ashe et al, 2012; Mao et al, 2015).Interestingly, this silencing response can be inherited transgenerationally and persist for several generations, even in prg\u20101 mutant animals (Ashe et al, 2012). Once established, this long\u2010term silencing is independent of the initial piRNA trigger and instead relies on the germline nuclear RNAi pathway, including the AGO protein HRDE\u20101 (Ashe et al, 2012; Buckley et al, 2012), the nuclear RNAi\u2010defective proteins NRDE\u20101/2\u20104 (Ashe et al, 2012), the nuclear RNA helicase EMB\u20104 (Akay et al, 2017), and several chromatin\u2010associated factors (Ashe et al, 2012; McMurchy et al, 2017). Together, the piRNA and the germline nuclear RNAi pathways establish and maintain transgenerational silencing via the inheritance of small RNA populations and the deposition of chromatin silencing marks in the germline (Ashe et al, 2012; Buckley et al, 2012; Lee et al, 2012).Since PRG\u20101/piRNA complexes tolerate several mismatches when selecting for complementary transcripts, they can theoretically target any sequence (Bagijn et al, 2012; Lee et al, 2012; Shen et al, 2018; Zhang et al, 2018), including endogenous genes that are required to be expressed in the germline. To prevent silencing of germline\u2010specific genes, some nematodes have evolved a protection mechanism involving the CSR\u20101/22G siRNA licensing pathway (Seth et al, 2013; Shen et al, 2018; Zhang et al, 2018), in which endogenous secondary 22G siRNAs associate with the AGO CSR\u20101 and prevent target recognition by the piRNA pathway.Given the importance of piRNAs in the maintenance of genome stability, it is essential to understand how they are generated. Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs are transcribed by the RNA Pol II holoenzyme (Gu et al, 2012); (Billi et al, 2013), which transcribes a range of coding and non\u2010coding genes through three precisely defined and controlled steps: initiation, elongation, and termination (Adelman & Lis, 2012; Zhou et al, 2012). In eukaryotes, RNA Pol II is typically composed of 12 subunits (RPB1\u201012), of which 10 constitute the catalytic core, and two (RPB4 and RPB7 in yeast) are required for transcription initiation (Cramer, 2004). RPB1/AMA\u20101, the largest subunit, is essential for polymerase activity through its carboxy terminal domain (CTD) and, in combination with RPB9, forms the DNA\u2010binding groove of the holoenzyme (Acker et al, 1997). RPB2, the second largest subunit, forms a cleft in which the DNA template and the nascent RNA transcript are kept in proximity (Acker et al, 1992; Ponicsan et al, 2013), while RPB6 is part of a structure that stabilizes the active enzyme on the DNA template (Acker et al, 1994; del R\u00edo\u2010Portilla et al, 1999; Wani et al, 2014). The structural role of the other subunits is less well\u2010documented (Sainsbury et al, 2015).Faithful transcription is ensured by a proofreading mechanism called backtracking, during which the polymerase moves backward on the DNA template to correct base mis\u2010incorporation events (Bondarenko et al, 2006; Churchman & Weissman, 2011; James et al, 2017). As a result, the 3\u2032 end of the nascent transcript is displaced from the enzyme\u2032s active site, and the polymerase becomes transcriptionally inactive (Nudler et al, 1997; Komissarova & Kashlev, 1997; Thomas et al, 1998; Kettenberger et al, 2003; Wang et al, 2009; Cheung & Cramer, 2011). Backtrack recovery is required in order for the enzyme to resume transcriptional elongation, and often depends on cleavage of the backtracked RNA to generate a new 3\u2032 end, which allows realignment with the active site (Chedin et al, 1998; Kuhn et al, 2007; Walmacq et al, 2009). Eukaryotic RNA Pol II has a weak intrinsic cleavage activity, which is strongly enhanced by the transcription elongation factor TFIIS (Izban & Luse, 1992).RNA Pol II backtracking is associated not only with promoter\u2010proximal pausing rescue and rapid transcription elongation, but also with transcription termination (Sheridan et al, 2019). Transcription termination is critical to determine borders between genes and to avoid interference with downstream\u2010positioned loci, and it may be even more important for an organism like C.\u00a0elegans, with a compact genome (Caenorhabditis elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998). At nonpolyadenylated\u2010type loci, such as those encoding for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), termination depends on specialized processing of the 3\u2032 ends and often requires the Integrator complex, whose nuclease activity at specific cleavage sites is necessary for precursor transcript maturation (Uguen & Murphy, 2003; Baillat et al, 2005; Ezzeddine et al, 2011; Ezzeddine et al, 2012). Interestingly, transcription at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci shares evolutionary similarities to snRNA transcription (Beltran et al, 2019).Here, by using a combination of genetics and biochemical approaches, we show that the RNA Pol II subunit RPB\u20109 is required to promote the Integrator\u2010dependent cleavage of 3\u2032 ends of nascent transcripts upon RNA Pol II backtracking for transcription termination at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci in C.\u00a0elegans. In rpb\u20109 mutants, a defect in transcription termination leads to a reduction in mature piRNA levels, which in turn results in a drastic depletion of HRDE\u20101\u2010associated secondary 22G siRNAs and, ultimately, in the desilencing of two families of DNA transposons and a subset of somatic genes, likely in the germline. Results\nrpb\u20109 is required for piRNA pathway integrityIn order to identify components of the piRNA pathway, we have previously described a forward genetics screen for animals defective in their ability to silence the \u201cpiRNA sensor\u201d, a germline\u2010specific transgene containing a gfp reporter and responsive to the endogenous piRNA 21UR\u20101 (pmex\u20105::eGFP::his\u201058::as21UR\u20101::tbb\u20102) (Bagijn et al, 2012; Ashe et al, 2012; Weick et al, 2014) (Fig \u200b(Fig1A).1A). Wild\u2010type animals efficiently repress this gfp transgene via the piRNA pathway, while mutants of piRNA pathway components, such as prg\u20101 and mutator class genes, fail to do so and strongly desilence the piRNA sensor (Phillips et al, 2012). One of 22 independent mutants from our screen defined a new allele (mj261) of the gene rpb\u20109, which encodes for a conserved subunit of the DNA\u2010dependent RNA Pol II enzyme (Cramer et al, 2000). Studies in yeast have proposed a role for Rpb9 in various steps of transcription, including start site selection and transcriptional elongation, and in transcription\u2010coupled repair (Furter\u2010Graves et al, 1994; Hemming et al, 2000; Li & Smerdon, 2002; Nesser et al, 2006). We decided to explore the possibility that rpb\u20109 could provide a direct link between transcription and silencing in the context of piRNA\u2010mediated repression in C.\u00a0elegans.Open in a separate windowFigure 1\nrpb\u20109 is required for piRNA pathway integrity\nA Schematic of the EMS mutagenesis screen carried out using the piRNA sensor and identification of a novel allele (mj261) of the rpb\u20109 gene.B \nrpb\u20109 locus, in scale (top) and comparisons of RPB\u20109 protein domains to homologs in other species (bottom).

Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5m (G).\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans RPB\u20109 is composed of 167 amino acids. It comprises a central RPOL9 domain (a zinc ribbon) and a C\u2010terminal zinc\u2010finger motif\u2010containing domain also found in the C\u2010terminal portion of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS, hence named \u201cTFIIS C\u201d. The identified point mutation introduces a premature amber stop codon at glutamine 140 (CAG to TAG mutation), within the core of the TFIIS C domain (Fig \u200b(Fig1B).1B). As expected, rpb\u20109 mutants do not express full\u2010length RPB\u20109 protein at levels detectable via Western blotting, although we cannot exclude residual protein due to transcriptional read\u2010through (Fig EV1A).Open in a separate windowFigure EV1Related to Fig \u200bFig11\n\nWestern blot quantification of RPB\u20109 expression in wild\u2010type, rpb\u20109 (mj261), and rpb\u20109 rescue animals. rpb\u20109 alleles gk508135 and gk357431 (Thompson et al, 2013\n) are additional controls that do not show piRNA sensor desilencing.RPB\u20109 domain conservations.

Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0\u00b5m.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\n\nTo explore the conservation of RPB9, we aligned the amino acid sequence of the C.\u00a0elegans RPB\u20109 with its homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens. We observed that both the RPOL9 and the TFIIS C domains are conserved in all these species (with sequence identities from 44 to 69%) and that C.\u00a0elegans RPB\u20109 also possesses an additional N\u2010terminal portion, which does not contain any known or conserved domains (Figs \u200b(Figs1B1B and EV1B). We also compared the C.\u00a0elegans RPB\u20109 and TFIIS sequences, and found that their respective C\u2010terminal domains share 33% sequence identity and 53% sequence similarity, suggesting they might perform similar functions (Fig EV1C).In C.\u00a0elegans, rpb\u20109 is expressed both in the soma and in the germline, consistent with its role as RNA Pol II subunit (Serizay et al, 2020) (Fig \u200b(Fig1C).1C). When visualized under a fluorescence microscope, all rpb\u20109 animals desilence the piRNA sensor in the germline, albeit at a variable level (Fig \u200b(Fig1D1D (wild type), compare with Fig \u200bFig1E1E (rpb\u20109 mutant)). We measured the amounts of spliced gfp mRNA in these animals and observed increased levels of gfp expression, suggesting that rpb\u20109 affects its targets prior to translation (Fig \u200b(Fig1F1F).To test whether the rpb\u20109 mutation was causative for sensor desilencing, we constructed a synthetic transgene harboring the rpb\u20109 coding sequence under control of a germline\u2010specific promoter (pmex5::rpb9::par\u20105, mjSi70) and integrated it on chromosome I via the MosSCI technology (Fr\u00f8kjaer\u2010Jensen et al, 2008). This germline\u2010specific allele restores wild\u2010type levels of RPB\u20109 protein, as detected by Western blotting (Fig EV1A), and rescues the desilencing phenotype of rpb\u20109 mutants (Fig 1F and G). Importantly, a similar transgene containing the Q140STOP mutation does not rescue the phenotype (Fig EV1D). All together, these data demonstrate that rpb\u20109 is important for the robust function of the piRNA pathway.\nrpb\u20109 is required for establishing piRNA\u2010mediated silencingThe piRNA pathway involves multiple steps and intersects with other small RNA pathways. In order to understand whether rpb\u20109 is required for transgenerational maintenance of silencing, we crossed rpb\u20109 animals with animals expressing a germline gfp::h2b reporter (ppie\u20101::eGFP::his\u201058::pie\u20101) (Ashe et al, 2012; Buckley et al, 2012) and we assessed the transcriptional status of this transgene across generations upon a time\u2010limited exposure to gfp RNAi (Fig \u200b(Fig2A2A).Open in a separate windowFigure 2\nrpb\u20109 is required for the initiation step of the piRNA pathway\nSchematic of the germline\u2010specific pie\u20101::gfp::h2b::pie\u20101 sensor (top) and schematic of the experiment (bottom).Representative fluorescence images of transgene expression in wild\u2010type, rpb\u20109 (mj261), hrde\u20101 (tm1200), and prg1 (n4357); prg\u20102 (n4358) animals in the parental (P0) and inheriting (G1\u2010G6) generations. Scale bar\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0\u00b5m.Quantification of the percentage of desilenced individuals in wild\u2010type, rpb\u20109 (mj261), prg\u20101 (n4357); prg\u20102 (n4358) and hrde\u20101 (tm1200) populations across generations.\nIn wild\u2010type animals, exogenous double\u2010stranded (ds) gfp RNA uptake for one generation is sufficient to establish and maintain reporter silencing for several generations (Ashe et al, 2012; Buckley et al, 2012). Conversely, mutants of components of the multi\u2010generational germline nuclear RNAi pathway, albeit able to efficiently establish silencing in sustained presence of ds gfp RNA, fail to maintain it once this trigger is removed. This is the case for hrde\u20101, previously identified as the major germline\u2010specific AGO that binds secondary endogenous 22G siRNAs and directs initiation of the transgenerational germline nuclear RNAi pathway (Fig 2B and C) (Ashe et al, 2012; Buckley et al, 2012). Like wild\u2010type animals, rpb\u20109 mutants can efficiently (100%) initiate silencing upon gfp RNAi and are able to maintain it (91\u2013100%) even when the initial stimulus is removed (Fig 2B and C, Appendix Fig S1). This suggests that rpb\u20109 is not required for exogenous RNAi and its inheritance. Instead, it is required specifically for the endogenous piRNA\u2010mediated silencing. Similarly to rpb\u20109 mutants, prg\u20101; prg\u20102 double mutant animals are efficient in both the establishment and the maintenance of exogenous dsRNA\u2010induced silencing (Fig 2B and C, Appendix Fig S1). Hence, we conclude that rpb\u20109 is required for piRNA\u2010dependent transgene\u2010silencing upstream of hrde\u20101 and the multi\u2010generational germline nuclear RNAi pathway, independently of the exogenous RNAi pathway.\nrpb\u20109 is required to repress two DNA transposon families and a subset of somatic genesIn order to explore the genome\u2010wide consequences of piRNA pathway disruption in rpb\u20109 mutants, we performed a genome\u2010wide transcriptome analysis (polyA\u2010selected RNA\u2010seq and ribosomal RNA\u2010depleted RNA\u2010seq).We first analyzed the expression of DNA transposons and retrotransposons, both known to be targeted by the piRNA pathway. While no overall major changes were detectable in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type, we observed two de\u2010repression events, which affected two independent autonomous DNA transposon families, Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1 (Fig \u200b(Fig3A3A and Appendix Fig S2A). Since DNA transposons are the most abundant transposable elements in C.\u00a0elegans, and thought to be the only class active in this organism (Bessereau, 2006; Laricchia et al, 2017), we hypothesized they might be targets of piRNA\u2010mediated silencing. When we scanned these two transposons families for potential piRNA target sites (Bagijn et al, 2012), we found several matches. Chapaev\u20102 is a potential target of two piRNAs with up to two mismatches and ten piRNAs with up to three mismatches. CEMUDR1 is a potential target of one piRNA with perfect matching, five piRNAs with up to one mismatch, and 17 piRNAs with up to three mismatches (Fig \u200b(Fig3B).3B). Moreover, we also checked published data (Bagijn et al, 2012) for the density of endogenous 22G siRNAs antisense to these transposons in wild\u2010type and prg\u20101 animals and found that, for both transposons, 22G siRNAs were present at high levels in wild\u2010type animals but were decreased in prg\u20101 mutants. Together, these observations confirm that both Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1 are piRNA pathway targets and indicate that rpb\u20109 is required to repress their activity in the germline.Open in a separate windowFigure 3\nrpb\u20109 represses two DNA transposon families and a subset of somatic genes\nA Differential expression analysis of transposable elements in rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants versus wild type (polyA\u2010selected RNA\u2010seq libraries) [P \u2264\u00a00.01, log2(fold change)\u2265 1, DESeq2 analysis]B Table showing the numbers of matching piRNAs (with 0, 1, 2, and 3 mismatches, respectively) for each of the upregulated transposon families.C Genome\u2010wide differential gene expression analysis of rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants versus wild type (polyA\u2010selected RNA\u2010seq libraries) [P \u2264 \u00a00.01, log2(fold change) > 1 or < \u20131, DESeq2 analysis].D Differential expression analysis of germline\u2010specific and soma\u2010specific genes, as classified in Reinke et al (2004). \u201cAll genes\u201d is shown for comparison (polyA\u2010selected RNA\u2010seq libraries, n\u00a0=\u00a03).E\u2013G Pairwise correlation plots of rpb\u20109 (mj261) and prg\u20101 (n4357) (E), hrde\u20101 (tm1200) (F), or gonad\u2010dissected prg\u20101 (n4357) (Reed et al, 2020) (G) transcriptomes. Differentially expressed genes in rpb\u20109 (mj261) are shown in black, shared upregulated genes in red, and shared downregulated genes in blue. The piRNA sensor transcript is highlighted in green (total RNA \u201cRibo\u2010Zero\u201d RNA\u2010seq libraries).\nIn C.\u00a0elegans, the piRNA pathway has been previously implicated in the regulation of endogenous genes (Rojas\u2010R\u00edos & Simonelig, 2018). For this reason, we also analyzed the expression of endogenous mRNA transcripts in rpb\u20109 mutants. When we compared the polyA\u2010selected transcriptome of rpb\u20109 and wild\u2010type animals, we found a total of 1,556 misregulated transcripts in rpb\u20109 mutants, with 292 being downregulated (18.76%) and 1,264 upregulated (81.23%) (Fig \u200b(Fig3C3C).Since the piRNA pathway acts in the germline, we wondered whether some of the upregulated transcripts in rpb\u20109 mutants corresponded to desilenced somatic genes in the germline. To test this, we took advantage of published data (Reinke et al, 2004; Bezler et al, 2019) to classify transcripts into \u201cgermline\u2010specific\u201d and \u201csoma\u2010specific\u201d and used these classes to filter deregulated genes in rpb\u20109 mutants. We found that, while germline\u2010specific transcripts did not vary significantly, soma\u2010specific transcripts tended to be upregulated in rpb\u20109 mutants (Fig \u200b(Fig3D).3D). This suggests that, other than in controlling transposon activity, rpb\u20109 might be involved in the repression of a subclass of somatic genes in the germline. Importantly, analysis of total RNA libraries yielded comparable results, both for transposable elements and for mRNA transcripts (Appendix Fig S2A\u2013C).In order to explore the relationship between rpb\u20109 and the other major components of the piRNA pathway, we compared the transcriptomes of our rpb\u20109 mutants with those of prg\u20101 and hrde\u20101 mutants. We observed that rpb\u20109 and prg\u20101 mutants share a total of 51 deregulated genes (22 upregulated and 29 downregulated, linear regression correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.03, hypergeometric test P value < 2.7e\u201011, representation factor\u00a0=\u00a02.8) (Fig \u200b(Fig3E),3E), while rpb\u20109 and hrde\u20101 share 42 (36 upregulated and 6 downregulated, linear regression correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.1, hypergeometric test P value < 1.9e\u201006, representation factor\u00a0=\u00a02.2) (Fig \u200b(Fig3F).3F). Importantly, we found the piRNA sensor transcript as upregulated in both rpb\u20109 versus prg\u20101 and rpb\u20109 versus hrde\u20101 comparisons, consistent with the idea that rpb\u20109 represses germline transgenes via both the piRNA pathway and its downstream effector, the nuclear RNAi pathway. These observations suggest that rpb\u20109 is required, together with prg\u20101 and hrde\u20101, for gene silencing at a subset of piRNA pathway targets.In order to refine this analysis, we decided to focus specifically on germline transcriptomes. By taking advantage of published datasets from gonad\u2010dissected samples (Reed et al, 2020) and comparing them with our own, we asked what proportion of misregulated genes in rpb\u20109 mutants could originate from within the germline. We observed a significant overlap between upregulated genes in rpb\u20109 animals and upregulated genes in prg\u20101 mutant germlines (525 genes, 40.8%, regression coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.2161) (Fig \u200b(Fig3G),3G), in agreement with the hypothesis that transcriptome misregulations in rpb\u20109 mutants mostly arise from germline\u2010related piRNA pathway defects.Many upregulated genes show invariant or reduced RNA Pol II enrichmentWe reasoned that the transcriptionally downregulated genes we identified above might be a result of a defect in the canonical role for rpb\u20109 in promoting transcription as part of the RNA Pol II complex, consistent with ubiquitous rpb\u20109 expression. Thus, in order to decipher the role of rpb\u20109 in the context of the piRNA pathway, we decided to focus our attention on upregulated genes.Given the reported role for rpb\u20109 in TSS selection (Hull et al, 1995; Sun et al, 1996; Ghazy et al, 2004), we sought to understand whether upregulation/desilencing of these genes would merely depend on increased binding of RNA Pol II at their TSS, or whether another mechanism could be implicated. In order to explore these possibilities, we performed an RPB\u20101/AMA\u20101 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP\u2010seq) analysis. We did not observe major differences in RNA Pol II binding genome wide (Fig EV2A), but noticed differential binding patterns for upregulated genes in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type. A certain proportion (138 genes, 33.3%) of the 384 upregulated genes with detectable RNA Pol II signal also showed increased (Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test, P\u00a0=\u00a02.06e\u201007) RNA Pol II binding at the TSS and within the gene body, compared to wild type (class I genes) (Fig \u200b(Fig4A).4A). Surprisingly, however, we observed that the majority of upregulated genes (246 genes, 66.7%) displayed unchanged (Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test, P\u00a0=\u00a00.77) or reduced (Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0136) RNA Pol II binding in rpb9 animals, despite being upregulated (or desilenced) (class II (Fig \u200b(Fig4B)4B) and class III genes (Fig \u200b(Fig4C)).4C)). Importantly, the piRNA sensor belonged to class III genes (Fig \u200b(Fig4D).4D). Analysis of total RNA libraries yielded similar results (Fig EV2B\u2013D).Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Related to Fig \u200bFig44\n\nA Analysis of differential RNA Pol II binding (RPB\u20101/AMA\u20101 ChIP\u2010seq) over all genes in rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants compared with wild type.B\u2013D Analysis of RNA Pol II binding at upregulated genes in rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants, as defined in Appendix Fig S2B.

As control, we additionally analyzed Pol II profiles over downregulated genes and observed that the majority of them (94%) displayed reduced (Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test, P\u00a0=\u00a07.26e\u20105) Pol II binding in rpb\u20109 mutants, as expected given the canonical role of rpb\u20109 in transcription (Fig EV2E).In order to elucidate novel rpb\u20109 nuclear functions, we set out to identify its protein interactors. To be able to perform an immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP\u2010MS), we generated an endogenously tagged rpb\u20109::ollas strain using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Jiang & Marraffini, 2015; Akay et al, 2017). RPB\u20109::OLLAS is expressed (Fig EV3A) and does not induce piRNA sensor desilencing (Fig EV3B), suggesting that the protein fusion is functional.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Related to Fig \u200bFig55\n\nWestern blot quantification of the amount of RPB\u20109 protein in the rpb\u20109::ollas line by Western blot. rpb\u20109 RNAi samples are shown for control.Representative DIC and fluorescence microscopy images of piRNA sensor expression in rpb\u20109::ollas (mj604). rpb\u20119 (mj261) is shown for control.

Four of them were other polymerase subunits: RPB\u20101/AMA\u20101, already reported to be associating with RPB\u20109 to form the DNA\u2010binding groove of the holoenzyme in human (Acker et al, 1997), and RPB\u20102, RPB\u20105, and RPB\u20107, all contacts that were never reported before. Interestingly, other proteins were factors involved in transcription elongation and termination, including the elongation factors SPT\u20105 (a component of the DSIF complex), CTR\u20109 (a component of the PAF\u20101 complex), and EMB\u20105 (human SUPT6h homolog), and the early\u2010termination factor NRD\u20101 (human SCAF4 homolog). The identity of these binding partners is consistent with a previously described role for Rpb9 in transcriptional elongation in yeast (Awrey et al, 1997; Hemming et al, 2000; Van Mullem et al, 2002).Open in a separate windowFigure 5\nrpb\u20109 is required for the robust production of piRNA pathway\u2010dependent HRDE\u20101\u2010associated secondary 22G siRNAs\nEnrichment analysis of RPB\u20109\u2010bound proteins in rpb\u20119::ollas (mj604) versus wild type by IP/MS [P \u2264\u00a00.05, log2(fold change) >\u00a01 or <\u00a0\u22121, Welch\u2019s t\u2010test]. n\u00a0=\u00a04 technical replicates (pooled).Transgene transcript length is not affected in rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants.

In order to test this hypothesis, we designed primers spanning three intron\u2013exon junctions along the gfp transgene within the piRNA sensor and measured unspliced gfp levels in rpb\u20109 mutants and wild\u2010type animals by real\u2010time qPCR. The results show that, although the unspliced transcript is significantly upregulated in rpb\u20109 mutants, the ratios of unspliced gfp levels along the transcript (3\u2032 end versus 5\u2032 end) are not significantly different compared with wild type, suggesting that transcriptional elongation at the piRNA sensor locus is in fact efficient in rpb\u20109 animals (Fig \u200b(Fig5B).5B). Taken together, these results suggest that the establishment of piRNA\u2010dependent silencing in rpb\u20109 mutants is defective upstream of nascent transcript synthesis.\nrpb\u20109 is required for robust secondary piRNA pathway\u2010dependent HRDE\u20101\u2010associated 22G siRNA productionNext, we tested whether the defect in piRNA target silencing in rpb\u20109 mutants was caused by a decrease in the abundance of endogenous secondary 22G siRNAs. Indeed, a strong reduction in the amount of these molecules could explain why reduced or unchanged RNA Pol II binding on class II and class III genes (with wild\u2010type lengths of nascent transcripts) still results in their upregulation/desilencing.Endogenous secondary 22G siRNAs are not only mediators of silencing, but they can also counteract it. This is for example the case for CSR\u20101\u2010associated 22G siRNAs, which are the effectors of a protection mechanism against the piRNA\u2010mediated silencing of germline\u2010expressed genes (Wedeles et al, 2013; Seth et al, 2013). We reasoned that, for these targets, high 22G siRNA amounts would correlate with higher gene expression rates. On the other hand, piRNA target genes would display high 22G siRNA amounts but low expression rates. For these reasons, we explored the correlation between mRNA expression levels and endogenous secondary 22G siRNA abundance genome wide. We subdivided the transcriptome into 20 bins (A to T), each containing 857 genes, which were ranked according to their 22G siRNA density in wild type (Fig \u200b(Fig5C).5C). We observed a general trend where 22G siRNA density correlated with mRNA expression levels, consistent with the idea that the more an mRNA is expressed, the more 22G siRNAs can be produced for that locus. A notable exception was the last bin (T), corresponding to the genes with the highest 22G siRNAs density (top 5%), but which displayed lower mRNA expression levels. This pattern is consistent with active 22G siRNA\u2010mediated silencing at high 22G siRNA densities. Interestingly, the mean expression levels of genes in bin T were higher in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type. This suggests that these genes are direct piRNA targets. In further support of this hypothesis, we found that the piRNA sensor belongs to this subset of genes (bin T). Finally, we observed that the highest proportion of piRNA targets (with \u2264\u00a01 mismatch (Bagijn et al, 2012)) belong to this bin (Fig 5C and D).We next explored the correlation between transposable element expression and endogenous 22G siRNA abundance. We generated 10 bins (A\u2010J), each containing 764 elements, and observed that the upregulated transposons Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1 were included in the last bin (J), which contains transposons with high 22G density, but lower expression (top 10%) (Fig \u200b(Fig5E).5E). This suggests that Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1, similarly to the piRNA sensor, are direct piRNA targets.Since different AGO proteins bind to different subsets of 22G siRNAs and mediate different outcomes with regard to gene silencing and gene licensing, we then examined how HRDE\u20101\u2010 and CSR\u20101\u2010dependent 22G siRNAs were distributed across the mRNA bins (Fig \u200b(Fig5D).5D). We observed that, where 22G siRNA abundance and mRNA expression correlated the most (bins N to S), CSR\u20101\u2010associated 22G siRNAs were present at the highest proportions and the mean expression of the corresponding genes did not change significantly in rpb\u20109 mutants (two\u2010sample t\u2010test, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Conversely, where 22G siRNA abundance and mRNA expression were anticorrelated (high 22G siRNAs but low mRNA expression) (bin T), HRDE\u20101\u2010associated 22G siRNAs were found in the highest proportions and the mean expression of the corresponding genes was higher in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type. These observations support the hypothesis that the genes belonging to this class are direct targets of piRNAs dependent on rpb\u20109 function. Interestingly, when we analyzed how class I, class II, and class III genes were partitioned across the bins, we observed that class II (and to a minor extent class III) genes mostly resided in the last bin (T), in agreement with our hypothesis of them being direct downstream targets of rpb\u20109\u2010dependent piRNAs (Fig \u200b(Fig5F).5F). Importantly, these observations held true also for the analysis of total RNA libraries (Fig EV3C\u2013E).As the piRNA sensor belonged to bin T, we examined the distribution of antisense 22G siRNAs mapping to it more closely. We observed that, while gfp 22G siRNAs mapping to the piRNA sensor were present at high levels over all exons in wild\u2010type animals, they were mostly depleted in rpb\u20109 mutants and partially recovered in the rescue strain (Fig \u200b(Fig5G),5G), indicating that rpb\u20109 is indeed required to induce the generation of sufficient secondary 22G siRNAs to repress the sensor. We observed a similar trend in secondary 22G siRNAs mapping across the two desilenced transposons Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1, confirming that rpb\u20109 is required to suppress their expression via the piRNA\u2010dependent generation of 22G siRNAs (Fig \u200b(Fig5H5H).Next, we quantified the density of 22G siRNAs mapping over all piRNA targets (Bagijn et al, 2012) and observed that many of these transcripts (33%, 64 genes) were depleted in antisense 22G siRNAs in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type (hypergeometric test, P\u00a0<\u00a00.017) (Fig EV3F). This confirms that rpb\u20109 is required for the production of 22G siRNAs at a subset of piRNA targets. We observed a similar phenotype in hrde\u20101 mutants, although the affected targets did not overlap completely with those of rpb\u20109 animals, in agreement with our transcriptome correlation analysis (Fig \u200b(Fig3F).3F). Consistent with a prominent role for prg\u20101 in the generation of piRNAs, prg\u20101 mutants showed an even stronger depletion in 22G siRNAs at piRNA targets. Importantly, the defect of rpb\u20109 mutants was reverted in the rpb\u20109 rescue strain (Fig EV3F). Together, these data indicate that rpb\u20109 is required to produce levels of HRDE\u20101\u2010bound 22G siRNAs that are sufficient to efficiently establish silencing at piRNA target loci.\nrpb\u20109 is required for the generation of mature piRNAsIn wild\u2010type animals, high levels of endogenous 22G siRNAs are part of a self\u2010sustaining response initiated by RdRPs upon binding of primary siRNAs, including piRNAs, to complementary transcripts. We therefore decided to measure the amounts of mature piRNAs in rpb\u20109 mutants.First, we analyzed global mature piRNA levels and found a significant reduction in their expression in rpb\u20109 mutants, which was restored in the rescue strain (Fig \u200b(Fig6A,6A, two\u2010sample t\u2010test P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Although this reduction was not as strong as in prg\u20101 mutants (Suen et al, 2019), it suggests that rpb\u20109 is required to produce mature piRNAs. We next wondered whether this reduction in expression levels affected all piRNAs or only a subset of them. We thus plotted piRNA expression data along chromosome coordinates in equal bins and observed that all the piRNA species encoded in the two chromosome IV clusters were downregulated in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type (Fig \u200b(Fig6B)6B) but were restored in the rescue (Fig EV4A). This suggests that rpb\u20109 controls piRNA production via a single mechanism, possibly independent of sequence variations among single piRNAs.Open in a separate windowFigure 6\nrpb\u20109 is required for the generation of mature piRNAs\nExpression levels of mature piRNAs in wild\u2010type, rpb\u20109 (mj261), rpb\u20109 rescue (mj261; mjSi70), and prg\u20101 (n4357) animals (n\u00a0=\u00a03, hypergeometric test).

We observed a subtle reduction in the mature levels of this piRNA in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type, both by Northern blotting (Fig \u200b(Fig6C)6C) and by RT\u2013qPCR (Fig EV4B). This is likely the primary cause of the observed loss of 22G siRNAs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that, although some 22G siRNAs were still detectable over the 21UR\u20101 target site within the piRNA sensor (Fig \u200b(Fig5G),5G), their levels were lower than wild type, and 22G siRNA spreading to the rest of the transcript was defective. We observed this previously in other piRNA pathway mutants (Akay et al, 2017).Similarly, the amounts of some of the piRNAs predicted to target the Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR\u20101 transposons were decreased in rpb\u20109 mutants (Fig \u200b(Fig6D),6D), confirming that rpb\u20109 represses them via the piRNA pathway. All together, these data indicate that rpb\u20109 is required to generate wild\u2010type levels of mature piRNAs.RPB\u20109 recruits Integrator at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci to terminate transcriptionWe reasoned that this decrease in the abundance of mature piRNAs in rpb\u20109 mutants would originate from a defect in the production of the corresponding piRNA precursors, so we decided to investigate the role of rpb\u20109 in piRNA loci transcription.In order to capture all piRNA precursors, we sequenced short capped RNAs from isolated germ nuclei obtained from young adult animals, after separation of chromatin\u2010bound (nascent) and nucleoplasmic fractions (as described in Beltran et al, 2020).We found that the amount of both chromatin\u2010bound (Fig EV5A) and nucleoplasmic (Fig EV5B) motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursors tended to be lower in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type, perhaps explaining the observed decrease in the levels of motif\u2010dependent mature piRNAs (Fig \u200b(Fig6B)6B) and suggesting that rpb\u20109 could be required for motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci transcription. We did not observe this trend for motif\u2010independent piRNA precursors, indicating that rpb\u20109 does not appear to be required for their transcription (Fig EV5C and D).Open in a separate windowFigure EV5Related to Fig \u200bFig77\n\nMotif\u2010dependent nascent piRNA precursor abundance in rpb\u20109 (mj261) and rescue (mj261; mjSi70) animals relative to wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a02).Motif\u2010dependent nucleoplasmic piRNA precursor abundance in rpb\u20109 (mj261) and rescue (mj261; mjSi70) animals relative to wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a02).Motif\u2010independent nascent piRNA precursor abundance in rpb\u20109 (mj261) and rescue (mj261; mjSi70) animals relative to wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a02).Motif\u2010independent nucleoplasmic piRNA precursor abundance in rpb\u20109 (mj261) and rescue (mj261; mjSi70) animals relative to wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a02). Central bands represent the median, boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers represent the lowest and highest values, excluding outliers.\nThe process of transcription depends on the tight regulation of initiation, elongation, and termination. Previous studies in yeast have shown that Rpb9 both modulates the selection of the TSS and is involved in the elongation of transcription: In cells lacking Rpb9, the population of TSSs is shifted upstream at a subset of promoters (Furter\u2010Graves et al, 1994; Hull et al, 1995; Sun et al, 1996), and in in vitro elongation assays, an RNA Pol II complex lacking Rpb9 pauses at intrinsic elongation blocks at a lower frequency compared with wild type (Hemming et al, 2000).In order to understand whether rpb\u20109 was required for precise initiation and/or elongation of transcription at piRNA genes, we examined the length of all piRNA precursors. We noticed that the median precursor length in rpb\u20109 mutants was higher than the median in wild type for both nascent and nucleoplasmic species and that this defect was reverted in the rescue (Figure \u200b(Figure7A).7A). In wild\u2010type animals, the length distribution of nascent piRNA precursors is bimodal, with peaks at 26 nt and 45 nt (Fig 7B and C, Beltran et al, 2020). In rpb\u20109 mutants, the length distribution is still bimodal, but both peaks are shifted to ~28 nt and ~47 nt, respectively (Fig 7B and C). Similarly, also the length distribution of nucleoplasmic piRNA precursors is shifted in rpb\u20109 mutants (Fig \u200b(Fig7D).7D). In both cases, the length defect is recovered in rescue animals (Fig 7B\u2013D).Open in a separate windowFigure 7\nrpb\u20109 is required for transcription termination at piRNA loci\nMedian precursor length shift of nascent (left) and nucleoplasmic (right) piRNA precursors in rpb\u20109 (mj261) mutants and rescue (mj261; mjSi70) animals compared with wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a02).

The average signal is normalized to sequences per million of mapped reads.\nDrawing a parallel from the aforementioned observations in yeast, the presence of longer piRNA precursors in rpb\u20109 mutants could be a consequence of the selection of an upstream TSS or of a defect in elongation/termination. In order to test whether TSS selection at piRNA loci depends on RPB\u20109, we analyzed the distribution of the 5\u2032 ends of short capped RNA reads. For both wild\u2010type and rpb\u20109 animals, as well as for rescue individuals, we observed an enrichment of reads initiating 2 nt upstream of piRNAs U sites, suggesting that TSS selection is not impaired in rpb\u20109 mutants and that the increase in piRNA precursor length is rather due to a defect in 3\u2032 end formation (Fig \u200b(Fig7E7E).At piRNA loci, termination of transcription is associated with promoter\u2010proximal RNA Pol II pausing at AT\u2010rich \u201ctermination signals\u201d (Beltran et al, 2019) and depends on the 3\u2032 end cleavage activity of the Integrator complex (Beltran et al, 2020). In order to understand whether rpb\u20109 could be required to recruit Integrator at piRNA genes to promote termination, we crossed our rpb\u20109 mutants with animals in which the core Integrator subunit INTS\u20106 and the piRNA biogenesis factor PRDE\u20101 are endogenously tagged with GFP (G\u00f3mez\u2010Orte et al, 2019) and mCherry (Weick et al, 2014), respectively, and analyzed Integrator localization via immunostaining. In wild\u2010type animals, the Integrator complex localizes throughout the nucleus, but accumulates specifically on piRNA genes, as indicated by the presence of INTS\u20106 clouds and their co\u2010localization with PRDE\u20101 signals (Fig 7F and G, Beltran et al, 2020). In rpb\u20109 mutants, Integrator is still homogeneously distributed in the nucleus, but the accumulation clouds are lost, and INTS\u20106/PRDE\u20101 co\u2010localization is significantly decreased (Fig 7F and G) (P\u00a0=\u00a01.7e\u201017, Welch\u2019s t\u2010test). This indicates that RPB\u20109 is required to physically recruit the Integrator complex at piRNA loci, where its cleavage activity is necessary to terminate transcription of piRNA precursors.To confirm this conclusion, we examined our samples for the presence of ~20 nt long 3\u2032 nascent RNA cleavage fragments, a signature of Integrator activity, downstream of 21U\u2010RNAs. Consistent with a role for rpb\u20109 in recruiting Integrator, we observed a marked decrease in the abundance of these fragments at the termination region (around the +38 nucleotide position from the TSS) in rpb\u20109 mutants compared with wild type (Fig \u200b(Fig7H7H).In conclusion, these data indicate that RPB\u20109 is required to promote transcription termination at motif\u2010dependent piRNA genes by physically recruiting the Integrator complex at the 3\u2032 ends of nascent RNAs upon RNA Pol II backtracking. DiscussionInitiation of piRNA pathway\u2010mediated repression depends on the faithful transcription of piRNA loci. Here, we have characterized the contribution of the RNA Pol II subunit RPB\u20109 to this process. We have shown that rpb\u20109 is required to promote efficient transcription termination at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci by physically recruiting the Integrator complex and eliciting Integrator\u2010dependent cleavage of the 3\u2032 end of nascent transcripts, and demonstrated that this activity is required to exert proper repression of two DNA transposon families, as well as a subset of somatic genes, in the germline. Mechanistically, a functional RPB\u20109 protein is required to produce a sufficient amount of mature piRNAs to ensure the generation of high levels of HRDE\u20101\u2010dependent secondary 22G siRNAs, which target complementary transcripts and thereby induce their silencing (Fig \u200b(Fig88).Open in a separate windowFigure 8Model of RPB\u20109 functionIn wild\u2010type animals, RPB\u20109 promotes Integrator\u2010dependent cleavage of nascent motif\u2010dependent piRNA precursors. piRNA precursors are then processed into mature piRNAs, which trigger a potent 22G siRNA amplification response. As a result, complementary target transcripts are silenced. In rpb\u20109 mutants, transcription termination is defective and leads to longer piRNA precursors. As a consequence, the amount of mature piRNAs is decreased and the amplification response impaired. Target transcripts fail to be silenced.Interestingly, a relatively modest decrease in mature piRNA levels in rpb\u20109 mutants is sufficient to provoke a drastic reduction in the amounts of endogenous secondary 22G siRNAs antisense to piRNA target loci. This is consistent with the fact that the piRNA pathway relies heavily on amplification mechanisms and small RNA thresholds to establish silencing. Because of this, it is possible that genes targeted by low\u2010abundance piRNAs are more sensitive to small changes in their amounts, and hence more susceptible to desilencing. Indeed, this seems to be the case for the Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1 DNA transposon families, which are targeted by lowly\u2010abundant piRNAs and show a strong desilencing phenotype in our mutants. Chapaev\u20102 and CEMUDR1 are also desilenced in prg\u20101 (Bagijn et al, 2012) and hrde\u20101 (Akay et al, 2017) mutants, in agreement with our conclusion that rpb\u20109 functions upstream of both these components in the piRNA pathway. However, this is not the case in prde\u20101 mutants; prde\u20101, like rpb\u20109, is also required for the transcription of motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci (Weick et al, 2014). We speculate that this discrepancy is due to the fact that PRDE\u20101 and RPB\u20109 perform different molecular functions in the context of piRNA loci transcription. While PRDE\u20101 defines the site of piRNA precursor generation, thereby influencing transcription initiation, RPB\u20109 is required for transcription termination. Impaired 3\u2032 end formation may affect different piRNA loci to different extents. As mentioned above, piRNA\u2010dependent transposon repression relies on specific small RNA thresholds: In this particular case, even minor differences in the abundance of certain mature piRNAs in rpb\u20109 versus prde\u20101 mutants could result in profound differences in their effects on repression of the same target.An interesting observation is that the termination defects of rpb\u20109 mutants are not detectable at deregulated genes other than at piRNA loci, suggesting that RPB\u20109, a conserved RNA Pol II subunit, may fulfill a very specific role in C.\u00a0elegans. Perhaps RPB\u20109 is part of an ancient network, which, together with SNPC\u20104 (Kasper et al, 2014) and the USTC complex (Weng et al, 2019), has been recruited to direct transcription at piRNA loci. The recent discovery that motif\u2010dependent piRNA units share evolutionary similarities with the highly conserved snRNA genes (Beltran et al, 2019), together with the fact that transcription of both these types of loci depends on the Integrator complex (Uguen & Murphy, 2003; Baillat et al, 2005; Ezzeddine et al, 2011; Ezzeddine et al, 2012) (Beltran et al, 2020), seem to favor this hypothesis. Whether rpb\u20109 is required for transcription termination of snRNA genes in C.\u00a0elegans is currently unknown, but we did not observe a significant reduction in the expression levels of most snRNAs in rpb\u20109 mutants, which indicates that RPB\u20109 is not essential for their transcription.Studies in yeast have shown that Rpb9 is located at the tip of the \u201cjaws\u201d of the RNA Pol II complex, proposed to clamp the DNA downstream of the enzyme active site (Cramer et al, 2001; Gnatt et al, 2001). Despite this remarkable feature, deletion of Rpb9 in yeast does not lead to cell death (Woychik et al, 1991), but only to minor transcriptomic changes in metabolism\u2010related genes (Hemming et al, 2000), suggesting that Rpb9 is an accessory subunit in this organism. To understand whether this was also the case in C.\u00a0elegans, we initially set out to generate complete knockout mutant animals via the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Although we were able to observe heterozygous editing events upon sgRNA injections in the germline, our attempts at recovering rpb\u20109 homozygous knockout mutants in the F2 progeny failed. This suggests that, similarly to rpb9 in D.\u00a0melanogaster, rpb\u20109 could in fact be essential in C.\u00a0elegans. The mutant we discovered in our screen may produce either a truncated protein that retains some functionality or full\u2010length protein at very low levels due to translational read\u2010through at the predicted premature stop codon.We have shown that S.\u00a0cerevisiae Rpb9 and C.\u00a0elegans RPB\u20109 share sequence identity at the two identified domains. In yeast, the N\u2010terminal domain of Rpb9 has been shown to influence TSS selection, while the C\u2010terminal domain has been reported to be involved in intrinsic transcript cleavage (Hemming et al, 2000). In our rpb\u20109 mutants, a truncated but partially functional RPB\u20109 protein might explain why TSS selection is not affected, but transcriptional termination is. Indeed, the mutation we discovered in our screen is predicted to interrupt translation within the TFIIS C domain, but leaves the RPOL9 domain intact, suggesting that the both RPOL9 and TFIIS C domains may perform conserved functions in S. cerevisiae and C.\u00a0elegans.The conservation between the C\u2010terminal domains of Rpb9 and tfiis in yeast has prompted in vitro studies with purified proteins. These early reports show that RNA Pol II ternary complexes lacking Rpb9 are defective in their response to TFIIS\u2010stimulated read\u2010through past an elongation block. They also suggest that the absence of Rpb9 does not affect the intrinsic cleavage ability of RNA Pol II nor its binding to TFIIS and that the addition of purified Rpb9 in trans restores the response of the complex to TFIIS (Awrey et al, 1997). It was thus proposed that Rpb9 might transmit a molecular signal from TFIIS to the RNA Pol II active site. Further genetic analyses in yeast supported this hypothesis (Hemming et al, 2000; Van Mullem et al, 2002). More recently, it has been shown that the association between Pol II and TFIIS is in fact perturbed in Rbp\u20109 mutant yeast (Sigurdsson et al, 2010).We have shown here that the C\u2010terminal domains of RPB\u20109 and TFIIS are conserved also in C.\u00a0elegans. According to our study, RPB\u20109 is required to promote Integrator\u2010mediated cleavage of the nascent transcript upon RNA Pol II backtracking at motif\u2010dependent piRNA loci. Concomitantly, (Beltran et al, 2020) have reported a similar role for TFIIS. The fact that piRNA precursors are longer but can still be cleaved in rpb\u20109 animals could perhaps indicate that TFIIS is still functional in these mutants, but not sufficient on its own to promote timely transcription termination. The same line of thought applies to tfiis mutants, which can terminate transcription, possibly thanks to a functional RPB\u20109 subunit, but do so in a defective manner (Beltran et al, 2020). Given these observations, we believe that it is possible that RPB\u20109 and TFIIS cooperate in the recruitment of Integrator activities to terminate transcription at piRNA loci. Supporting this hypothesis, offspring of double tfiis;rpb\u20109 mutants display a maternal\u2010effect embryonic\u2010lethal phenotype (Appendix Fig S3). This result suggests that, indeed, rpb\u20109 and tfiis are genetic interactors and may play a role in the same pathway. The lethal phenotype, however, prevented further molecular analyses of this mutant.Overall, our study sheds new light on how the piRNA pathway utilizes a core RNA Pol II subunit to guarantee high\u2010fidelity transcription termination.

Microinjection pads consisted of 2% agarose flattened onto a cover slip. Prior to microinjections, a pad was moistened by gently exhaling onto it, then a drop of halocarbon oil 700 (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was added to it. Young adult animals of the appropriate strain were transferred into the oil using an eyelash pick and flattened to the surface. Injections into gonad arms were performed using an Olympus IZ71 microscope equipped with an Eppendorf micromanipulator, FemtoJet injection rig, and Transfer Man joystick (Eppendorf). After injection, animals were left to recover in M9 medium, then transferred to individual plates, and left to recover overnight at 20\u00b0C. For selection of integrants, plates were placed at 25\u00b0C and offspring were assessed for moving unc\u2010119 rescue animals after 3 and again after 4\u00a0days. Once plates with motile animals had starved, they were chunked onto a new plate and any moving animals lacking the co\u2010injection marker were singled onto individual plates. A maximum of ten individual animals was picked from each parental plate. Offspring were screened or re\u2010individualized for the absence of any Unc phenotype to generate homozygous lines. Transgene integration was validated by PCR of the insertion locus and transgene and, if applicable, by expression of a fluorescent protein.

Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was performed on 1\u00a0ml of diluted RT reactions (1/5) using SYBR Green Kit (Life Technologies) on a OneStepPlus Thermocycler (Thermo Fisher). All samples were run in duplicates. Expression levels were normalized to the reference gene cdc\u201042. Primer sequences are listed in Appendix Table S3.Cloning of the RPB\u20109 RNAi plasmidThe RPB\u20109 RNAi plasmid was constructed by cloning a 500\u2010bp fragment containing most of the RPB\u20109 cDNA sequence into the L4440 RNAi feeding vector (Timmons & Fire, 1998) via Gibson assembly following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 50\u00a0ng of the rpb\u20109 insert was added to 50\u00a0ng of EcoRI\u2010digested L4440 vector and incubated in Gibson master mix for 1\u00a0h at 50\u00b0C. 1\u00a0\u03bcl of the Gibson reaction was transformed into 50\u00a0\u03bcl of Dh5\u03b1 chemically competent bacteria (NEB) and plated onto ampicillin\u2010resistant plates. Resistant colonies were screened for correct insertions by the Sanger sequencing with the M13 forward primer and an in\u2010house reverse primer (GGCCTTTTGCTCACATGTTC). The following sequence was synthesized as g\u2010Block (IDT): GAGACCGGCAGATCTGATATCATCGATGTATCTGCAATTAAAATCAAAGCTTGAAAATGTTTTATCATATTTTTTCAGAAAGATGAGCCAAGGGTATGATAATTACGATGATATGTACGATCAAAACGGTGCATCACCGGCGCCGAGTCAAAACGAAAAACCCGGGAAAAGTGGGCCTGGTTTTGTTGGAATCAAGTTTTGCCCAGAATGCAATAATATGCTGTACCCACGAGAGGATAAGGAATCACGAGTTTTGATGTATTCCTGCCGGAACTGTGAGCATCGTGAAGTCGCCGCTAACCCGTGTATCTATGTGAATAAGCTCGTTCACGAAATTGATGAGCTCACTCAAATCGTCGGAGATATTATTCACGATCCAACGCTCCCGAAGACTGAAGAACATCAATGTCCAGTCTGTGGCAAAAGTAAGGCTGTCTTCTTCCAGGCTCAAACAAAAAAGGCAGAAGAAGAATTCGATATCAAGCTTATCGATACCGTC (bold: L4440 homology arms, which flank an EcoRI restriction site in the backbone L4440 vector).Western blottingWestern blotting of RPB\u20109 in the rpb\u20109 (mj261) and rpb\u20109 rescue (mj261; mjSi70) (Fig EV1A) was performed using a human anti\u2010RPB\u20109 (NBP1\u201092344, Novus Biologicals) antibody and a mouse anti\u2010tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma) antibody.Western blotting of RPB\u20109 in the rpb\u20109::ollas line (Fig EV3A) was performed using a mouse anti\u2010tubulin (clone DM1A, Sigma) antibody and a rat anti\u2010ollas (NBP1\u201006713, Novus Biologicals) antibody.Protein samples were prepared by boiling approx. 50 adult animals per genotype in NuPAGETM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) sample buffer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Denatured proteins were resolved on NuPAGETM 4\u201312% Bis\u2013Tris gradient gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and wet transferred on 0.45\u2010\u00b5m pore\u2010sized nitrocellulose membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 240 mAmp for 2\u00a0h. After overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C, the membranes were incubated with HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence Reagents (Pierce ECL Thermo Scientific or Immobilon Western Millipore) were applied to the membranes, and the membranes were visualized on 18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024\u00a0cm X\u2010ray films in a darkroom.RPB\u20109::ollas immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometryN2 control or RPB\u20109::ollas animals were grown to young adult stage, washed 3X with M9 buffer, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen C.\u00a0elegans were crushed with a metallic grinder and lysed with a buffer containing 25\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH: 7.5, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X\u2010100, and Complete Mini Protease inhibitor tablets (Roche, EDTA free). The lysate was sonicated using a Bioruptor with 10 cycles 30\u00a0s on/30\u00a0s off and then centrifuged for 30\u00a0min at 16,000 g (4\u00b0C) to remove insoluble material. BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) was used to determine total protein concentration of the supernatant. 4\u00a0mg total extract, 10\u00a0mg anti\u2010ollas antibody (A01658\u201040, GeneScript), and 30 ml Protein A/G magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) were used per technical replicate. In total, 4 technical replicates were used both for the N2 control and for RPB\u20109::ollas. After 12\u00a0h of incubation at 4\u00b0C in a rotating wheel, beads were washed 4 times with a buffer containing 25\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH: 7.5, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, and Complete Mini Protease inhibitor tablets. Immunoprecipitates were then boiled with a 2X sample buffer for 15\u00a0min.For the identification of RPB\u20109::ollas interactors, samples were separated on a 4%\u201312% NOVEX NuPAGE gradient SDS gel (Thermo) for 10 min at 180 V in 1\u00d7 MES buffer (Thermo). Proteins were fixated and stained with Coomassie G250 Brilliant Blue (Carl Roth). The gel lanes were cut, minced into pieces, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Gel pieces were destained with a 50% ethanol/50\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) solution. Proteins were reduced in 10\u00a0mM DTT (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 1\u00a0h at 56\u00b0C and then alkylated with 5\u00a0mM iodoacetamide (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) for 45\u00a0min at room temperature. Proteins were digested with trypsin (Sigma) overnight at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were extracted from the gel by two incubations with 30% ABC/acetonitrile and three subsequent incubations with pure acetonitrile. The acetonitrile was subsequently evaporated in a concentrator (Eppendorf) and loaded on StageTips (Rappsilber et al, 2007) for desalting and storage.For mass spectrometric analysis, peptides were separated on a 20\u2010cm self\u2010packed column with 75\u00a0\u00b5m inner diameter filled with ReproSil\u2010Pur 120 C18\u2010AQ (Dr.Maisch GmbH) mounted to an EASY HPLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher) and sprayed online into an Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). We used a 94\u2010min gradient from 2 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow of 225\u00a0nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated with a top 10 MS/MS data\u2010dependent acquisition scheme per MS full scan. Mass spectrometry raw data were searched using the Andromeda search engine (Cox et al, 2011) integrated into MaxQuant suite 1.5.2.8 (Cox & Mann, 2008) using the UniProt C.\u00a0elegans database (August 2014; 27,814 entries). In both analyses, carbamidomethylation at cysteine was set as fixed modification, while methionine oxidation and protein N\u2010acetylation were considered as variable modifications. Match\u2010between\u2010run option was activated. Prior to bioinformatic analysis, reverse hits, proteins only identified by site, protein groups based on one unique peptide, and known contaminants were removed.For the further bioinformatic analysis, the LFQ values were log2\u2010transformed and the median across the replicates was calculated. This enrichment was plotted against the \u2013 log 10\u2010transformed P value (Welch\u2019s t\u2010test) using the ggplot2 package in the R environment.AMA\u20101 ChIP\u2010seq300,000 synchronized animals were grown to young adult stage on 140\u00a0mm NGM plates and collected in an M9 buffer per replicate (3 for wild type and 3 for rpb\u20109 mutant). Animals were washed in the same buffer three times. Animals were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then grinded with a metallic mortar. These extracts were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature 9 min. The crosslinking was quenched with the addition of 0.125 M glycine at RT for 5\u00a0min. for 4\u00a0min at 4,000\u00a0g (4\u00b0C). Following two washes, a final wash with a buffer containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 50\u00a0mM HEPES/KOH, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Then, the samples were sonicated for 30 cycles 30\u00a0s on/30\u00a0s off. Afterward, the samples were centrifuged for 30\u00a0min at 15,700 g (4\u00b0C). 1 mg of the supernatant was used for ChIP with 4 \u00b5g of AMA\u20101 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Novus, SDQ2357) incubated overnight rotating at 4\u00b0C together with 80\u00a0\u00b5l magnetic protein A/G beads (Thermo Scientific). Samples were then washed twice in 150\u00a0mM NaCl buffer, once with 500\u00a0mM NaCl buffer, once with 1\u00a0M NaCl buffer, once with TEL buffer (0.25\u00a0M LiCl, 1% NP\u201040, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8, and freshly added protease inhibitor), and finally twice in TE buffer (pH 8). Beads were then eluted twice in 60\u00a0\u00b5l ChIP Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 250\u00a0mM NaCl in TE pH 8) at 65\u00b0C. Eluates of same samples and input were treated with 2 \u00b5l RNAse at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h and then with 1\u00a0\u00b5l Proteinase K at 65\u00b0C to de\u2010crosslink overnight.Library preparation and sequencingChIP\u2010seq and polyA\u2010selected total RNA libraries were prepared with NEBNext\u00ae Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. Optimum PCR cycles were determined via StepOnePlus qPCR using PowerTrack SYBR Green reagents (Thermo Scientific). Ribo\u2010zero\u2010selected total RNA libraries were prepared with NEBNext\u00ae Ultra II Directional DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina.ChIP\u2010seq, 5\u2032 dependent and independent small RNA, and polyA\u2010selected total RNA libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 1500 machine at the Gurdon Institute.Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Life Technologies) and treated with Turbo DNase Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA was used for library preparation. Ribo\u2010zero\u2010selected total RNA libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 at the Cancer Institute, Cambridge. All sequencing was performed with SE50.Short capped RNA sequencing from nucleoplasmic and chromatin gradients were sequenced at the LMS Sequencing Facility on a HiSeq 2500 with SE75.RNA extraction and real\u2010time quantitative PCR of mature piRNAsTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Life Technologies) and treated with Turbo DNase Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 5\u00a0\u03bcg of total RNA was oxidized (25\u00a0mM NaIO4/1X borate buffer) for 10\u00a0min at 25\u00b0C in the dark. 10\u00a0ng of total RNA was reverse\u2010transcribed with a TaqMan Small RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) containing a gene\u2010specific RT primer and a TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real\u2010time quantitative PCR was performed on 1\u00a0ml of RT reactions using TaqMan Universal Master Mix No AmpErase UNG (Life Technologies) on a OneStepPlus thermocycler (Thermo Fisher). All samples were run in triplicates. Expression levels were normalized to the reference gene U18.piRNA precursor length analysisThe analysis of piRNA precursor length was carried out as described in Beltran et al (2020), except for a bootstrap sample size of 5000 sequences owing to a greater number of detected piRNA precursor sequences across conditions. Degradation fragment analysis was carried out as described in Beltran et al (2020).RNA\u2010sequencing data analysispolyA and ribo\u2010zero\u2010selected total RNA\u2010seq libraries were mapped using STAR v2.5.4b. to C.\u00a0elegans ce11 genome carrying the piRNA sensor as an extra chromosome. STAR mapping parameters were \u201c\u2010\u2010outMultimapperOrder Random \u2010\u2010outFilterMultimapNmax 5,000 \u2010\u2010outFilterMismatchNmax 2 \u2010\u2010winAnchorMultimapNmax 10,000 \u2010\u2010alignIntronMax 1 \u2010\u2010alignEndsType EndToEnd\u201d.Adapter sequences were trimmed from 5\u2032 dependent and 5\u2032 independent small RNA libraries with cutadapt v 1.15 (Martin, 2011) using \u201c\u2010m 14 \u2010M 32 \u2010a TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG\u201d parameters and were mapped against ce11 genome with the piRNA sensor using STAR with \u201c\u201c\u2010\u2010outMultimapperOrder Random \u2010\u2010outFilterMultimapNmax 500 \u2010\u2010outFilterMismatchNmax 1 \u2010\u2010winAnchorMultimapNmax 10,000 \u2010\u2010alignIntronMax 1 \u2010\u2010alignEndsType EndToEnd\u201d parameters. Aligned RNA\u2010seq reads were sorted and indexed with samtools v1.6 (Li et al, 2009). Total RNA read counts against the annotations were generated by featureCounts v1.6 (Liao et al, 2014) with parameters \u201c\u2010T 12 \u2010M \u2013fraction \u2010t exon\u201d from a GTF file.22 nt small RNA reads with a 5\u2032 G bias were extracted from 5\u2032 independent small RNA\u2010sorted bam files with a custom PERL script. Read counts with an antisense orientation to the transcriptional direction of annotated genes were extracted by featureCounts v1.6 using \u201c\u2010T 12 \u2010M \u2010\u2010fraction \u2010s 2 \u2010t exon \u201d parameters. We next calculated the antisense 22G small RNA density over 20 equal bins by TPM normalization for annotated genes. We then plotted corresponding mRNA TPM values in each bin and calculated the overlap between each bin with known HRDE\u20101, CSR\u20101 (Zhang et al, 2011), and piRNA targets (Bagijn et al, 2012). Antisense 22G small RNA profiles on the piRNA sensor and transposons were normalized as reads per million (RPM). A GTF file containing annotations for transposable elements was generated by RepeatMasker (Smit et al, 2015) v 4.1.0 run with rmblastn version 2.2.27+ using RepeatMasker database version 20140131, against the ce11 genome. Read counts of total and small RNA libraries on individual transposons were calculated using uniquely mapped reads. Normalized counts, variance\u2010stabilized counts, log2 fold changes, and adjusted P values were obtained using DEseq2 v 1.18.1 (Love et al, 2014). For differential gene and transposon expression, candidates with a log2 fold change bigger than 1 or smaller than \u22121 as well as an adjusted P value smaller than 0.01 were considered as statistically significant differential expression. To overcome false\u2010positive transposon differential expression, statistically significant upregulated transposon list was further filtered with the ones that span or overlap with the exons of statistically significant upregulated protein\u2010coding genes.piRNA abundance was analyzed using 5\u2032 dependent libraries. Small RNA read counts for piRNAs were obtained using featureCounts v1.6 with \u201c\u2010T 12 \u2010M \u2010\u2010fraction\u201d parameter and normalized as reads per million (RPM). Cluster analysis of 5\u2032\u2010independent small RNA libraries showing the fold change in small RNAs mapped piRNA targets in the indicated mutants compared with wild type. Fold change is displayed in natural log.To compare changes in small RNA targeting piRNA targets in between animal strains (Bagijn et al, 2012), small RNA reads per gene were counted and abundance calculated by correcting for library size using unique mapping reads (cutoff >\u00a050 reads per million). The mean small RNA abundance per gene was calculated; next, the fold change was calculated by dividing the mean abundance in mutant animals by the mean abundance in wild\u2010type animals.Statistical significance for mature piRNA abundance and IP/MS was determined by two\u2010sample t\u2010test and Welch\u2019s t\u2010test, respectively. To prevent zero values during log2 and log10 transformations, pseudo\u2010count 1 was added for TPM and RPM normalizations.ChIP\u2010sequencing analysisChIP\u2010seq libraries were mapped to C.\u00a0elegans ce11 genome with the piRNA sensor as an extra chromosome by BWA allowing multimappers. sam files were converted to bam format, and then, bam files were sorted and indexed using samtools v1.6. (Li et al, 2009) ChIP\u2010seq peaks were generated using MACS2 v 1.4.3 (Zhang et al, 2008) peakcall function against input libraries. Common peaks between individual replicates with a P value smaller than 0.01 were considered as significant peaks. Linear fold enrichment was calculated with MACS2 bdgcmp function by disabling \u2010\u2010SPMR option per replicate. Log2 and Z\u2010score transformations were performed on RStudio with a custom script. All individual replicates were combined with RStudio Rtracklayer and Genomic Ranges packages. Seqplots was used to generate density plots and heat maps (Stempor & Ahringer, 2016). Class I, class II, and class III genes were classified by mean log2 fold enrichment of combined replicates over gene bodies of statistically significant upregulated genes. Briefly, we considered genes for which mutant log2 fold enrichment was 1.5 times greater than that of wild type, as class I. Similarly, genes with a mutant log2 fold enrichment 1.5 times smaller than that of wild type was considered as class III. The rest of the upregulated genes remaining between these ratios were considered as class II.Immunofluorescence stainingsWorms were picked on glass slides and dissected to extrude the germlines. Germlines were subsequently freeze\u2010cracked on dry ice and fixed in cold 100% methanol for 20\u00a0min. Fixed slides were then washed in 0.05% Tween/PBS and incubated with diluted (1:1,000) anti\u2010gfp (Abcam #ab290) and diluted (1:1,000) anti\u2010mCherry antibodies (GeneTex #GTX128508) overnight. The following day, slides were washed in 0.05% Tween/PBS and incubated with diluted secondary antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI. Representative images were taken on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 63\u00d7 oil objective and 4\u00d7 digital magnification. Single\u2010plan images are shown.Image analysis\u2014quantification of Integrator::gfp signal in prde\u20101::mCherry fociTo quantify Integrator\u2010GFP signal within PRDE\u20101\u2010mCherry foci, a minimum of 16 PRDE\u20101\u2010mCherry foci from different nuclei were selected. Individual z\u2010planes were chosen based on PRDE\u20101\u2010mCherry maximum intensity. PRDE\u20101 foci were then segmented based on the threshold obtained by Otsu's method (Otsu, 1979). The resulting ROIs were used to measure the average intensity in the Integrator::gfp channel, either co\u2010localizing with PRDE\u20101 or at a minimum of 10 random places elsewhere in the nucleus across the slide as a normalizing factor. The analysis was implemented with a custom script written in Python and using the scikit\u2010image package.Materials availabilityTransgenic animals will be submitted to the C.\u00a0elegans Genetics Center.
