{"title": "Hypercapnia in late-phase ALI/ARDS: providing spontaneous breathing using pumpless extracorporeal lung assist", "pubDate": "2009", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s00134-009-1426-3", "PMID": "19183941", "abstract": "Objective:                       The fibroproliferative phase of late ALI/ARDS as described by Hudson and Hough (Clin Chest Med 27:671-677, 2006) is associated with pronounced reductions in pulmonary compliance and an accompanying hypercapnia complicating low tidal volume mechanical ventilation. We report the effects of extracorporeal CO(2) removal by means of a novel pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (p-ECLA) on tidal volumes, airway pressures, breathing patterns and sedation management in pneumonia patients during late-phase ARDS.                  Design:                       Retrospective analysis.                  Setting:                       Fourteen-bed university hospital ICU.                  Patients:                       Ten consecutive late-phase ALI/ARDS patients with low pulmonary compliance, and severe hypercapnia.                  Intervention:                       Gas exchange, tidal volumes, airway pressures, breathing patterns and sedation requirements before (baseline) and after (2-4 days) initiation of treatment with p-ECLA were analysed. Patients were ventilated in a pressure-controlled mode with PEEP adjusted to pre-defined oxygenation goals.                  Measurements and main results:                       Median reduction in pCO(2) was 50% following institution of p-ECLA. Extracorporeal CO(2) removal enabled significant reduction in tidal volumes (to below 4 ml/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory plateau pressures [30 (28.5/32.3) cmH(2)O, median 25, 75% percentiles]. Normalization of pCO(2) levels permitted significant reduction in the dosages of analgesics and sedatives. The proportion of assisted spontaneous breathing increased within 24 h of instituting p-ECLA.                  Conclusion:                       Elimination of CO(2) by p-ECLA therapy allowed reduction of ventilator-induced shear stress through ventilation with tidal volumes below 4 ml/kg predicted body weight in pneumonia patients with severely impaired pulmonary compliance during late-phase ARDS. p-ECLA treatment supported control of breathing pattern while sedation requirements were reduced and facilitated the implementation of assisted spontaneous breathing.", "author": [{"author": "Steffen Weber-Carstens", "affiliation": ["Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charit\u00e9, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Campus Mitte, Berlin, Germany. steffen.weber-carstens@charite.de"], "href": "/?term=Weber-Carstens+S&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Sven Bercker", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Bercker+S&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Matthias Hommel", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Hommel+M&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Maria Deja", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Deja+M&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Martin MacGuill", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=MacGuill+M&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Christiane Dreykluft", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Dreykluft+C&cauthor_id=19183941"}, {"author": "Udo Kaisers", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Kaisers+U&cauthor_id=19183941"}], "refPMID": ["10793162", "9310799", "16755257", "15995487", "10194172", "11170942", "12574072", "10404912", "10816184", "18191684", "17944027", "11435237", "4835444", "9449727", "15665727", "18380929", "17085254", "16100131", "17363773", "7509706", "17218438", "16515929", "16625127", "15644644", "18058085", "16540950", "16081547"], "citedInPMID": ["19183941", "31258917", "31197492", "25033302", "23922607", "23306584", "23074408", "20177660"], "body": ""}
