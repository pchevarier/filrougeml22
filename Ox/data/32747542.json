Their biogenesis is spatiotemporally regulated. However, related mechanisms are still poorly understood. Defective in snRNA processing (DSP1) is an essential component of the DSP1 complex that catalyzes plant snRNA 3\u2032-end maturation by cotranscriptional endonucleolytic cleavage of the primary snRNA transcripts (presnRNAs). Here, we show that DSP1 is subjected to alternative splicing in pollens and embryos, resulting in two splicing variants, DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2.

Taken together, this study uncovers a mechanism that spatially regulates snRNA accumulation. snRNAs are basal components of the spliceosome and play essential roles in the splicing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (1, 2). Most snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, and U5) are transcribed as presnRNAs by the DNA-dependent RNA Pol II. PresnRNAs are subjected to 3\u2032 maturation, which removes the RNA fragment transcribed beyond the 3\u2032 end of mature snRNAs by cotranscriptional endonucleolytic cleavage followed by a cytoplasmic 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonucleolytic trimming step (3, 4). The endonucleolytic cleavage occurs at the upstream of an RNA motif called the 3\u2032 box and is catalyzed by the DSP1 complex and the integrator complex (INT) in plants and metazoans, respectively (5\u20139).The DSP1 complex contains, at least, five components: DSP1\u2013DSP4 and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor of 73 kDa I (CPSF73-I). CPSF73-I is a metallo-\u03b2-lactamase/\u03b2-CASP family RNA endonuclease, which also cleaves the 3\u2032 end of premRNAs. DSP1 acts as a scaffold to bridge CPSF73-I and its catalytically inactive homolog DSP4. DSP1 and DSP4 are both required for the efficient and accurate cleavage of presnRNAs (8, 10). INT is composed of, at least, 14 subunits, including INT9, a paralog of CPSF73-I and its homolog INT11, a counterpart of DSP4. INT9 and INT11 form a catalytic active heterodimer and cleave presnRNAs (9, 11). INT also promotes the transcription termination of snRNAs, histone mRNAs, and some poly-A mRNAs (12). If not properly terminated, the 3\u2032-read-through transcripts of presnRNAs can be produced, resulting in extended chimeric RNAs named \u201csnmRNAs,\u201d which contain protein-coding sequences of downstream of snRNA loci in metazoans (13\u201315). Besides snRNA maturation, the DSP1 complex and INT play essential roles in development since their mutants display various developmental defects and/or embryo lethality (8, 16\u201319). For instance, the weak dsp1-1 mutation results in smaller plant size and defects in pollen and embryo development (8).Important structural and functional roles of snRNAs in the spliceosome suggest that they may be present in cells at constant amounts (20\u201322). However, snRNA levels vary among different organs and developmental stages (2, 23, 24), and the spatiotemporal regulation of snRNA accumulation is critical for various biological processes (25\u201327). For example, the snRNA contents are correlated with the amount of the transcription activator SHOOT REDIFFERENTIATION DEFECTIVE 2 (SRD2), which is strongly expressed in highly proliferated tissues, and impaired function of SRD2 has a stronger impact on the development of these tissues (24). Various conserved transcription factors that control snRNA transcription have been identified in plants and metazoans (21, 28, 29). However, the mechanism regulating the spatiotemporal accumulation of snRNAs is still less known.Alternative splicing (AS) is a conserved posttranscriptional mechanism that generates multiple mRNAs from a coding gene through the selection of variable splicing sites, diversifying genetic information for limited gene numbers (30\u201334). AS also influences gene expression levels as transcripts generated by AS are often degraded through nonsense mediated decay (NMD) (35, 36). Several features of AS transcripts trigger a translation-dependent NMD pathway, including premature termination codons (PTCs), long 3\u2032-UTR, downstream splice junction, and upstream open reading frames (ORFs) (37). However, some AS transcripts can generate truncated proteins with altered function, stability, and/or cellular localization (30\u201334). In plants, AS affects multiple important biological processes, including development, circadian rhythm, starch metabolism, hormone signaling, flowering time, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (38\u201344). More than 60% of Arabidopsis and 40% of Brachypodium distachyon genes are subjected to AS (37, 42). Yet, the biological consequences of most AS events remain unexplored.Here, we show that an AS form of DSP1 (DSP1\u03b2) is essential for snRNA biogenesis and for the development of pollens and embryos. DSP1\u03b2 is specifically expressed in pollens and embryos, suggesting that it is an organ- or developmental stage-specific regulator. DSP1\u03b2 and the original DSP1 form (DSP1\u03b1) act cooperatively since each of them alone is necessary but not sufficient to maintain snRNA biogenesis and pollen/embryo development. DSP1\u03b2 only contains the first Armadillo/\u03b2-cateninlike (ARM) cluster of the three existing in DSP1\u03b1, through which both variants interact with CPSF73-I. We show that DSP1\u03b2 reduces the DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction by direct competition and thereby promotes the release of CPSF73-I and Pol II from the 3\u2032 end of snRNA genes, preventing the production of 3\u2032-read-through transcripts of presnRNAs. We propose that DSP1\u03b2 enhances snRNA biogenesis through facilitating the transcription termination of snRNAs and the rapid cycle of CPSF73-I in pollens. ResultsPollen and Embryo Developments Require Two Splicing Variants of DSP1. As previously reported (8), the hypomorphic dsp1-1 mutant in which the expression levels of DSP1 are reduced by a T-DNA inserted in the second intron (8) had pleiotropic developmental defects, including a reduction in plant size, fertility, and pollen viability, compared with Columbia (Col) (wild-type, [WT]) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A\u2013C). Expression of a WT copy of the DSP1 gene driven by its native promoter (pDSP1::GDSP1-MYC) rescued the developmental defects of dsp1-1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Interestingly, the expression of the DSP1-coding sequence (pDSP1::DSP1-MYC) rescued the vegetative phenotypes in the 24 transgenic lines tested, but not the pollen and seed development defects in T2 plants (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A\u2013C). The levels of DSP1-MYC were similar in transgenic dsp1-1 harboring pDSP1::GDSP1-MYC or pDSP1:DSP1-MYC (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). These results led us to hypothesize that normal pollen and embryo developments might require an AS variant generated by DSP1. To identify the splice variants, we performed RT-PCR analysis on RNAs from flowers and seeds using a series of primer pairs (P1\u2013P5) recognizing various positions of the DSP1 gene (Fig. 1A, p1\u2013p5). Both p2 and p3 detected potential DSP1 splicing variants (Fig. 1B). Because the fragments amplified by p2 and p3 overlap in exon 3 and exon 4, this result suggests that an alternative splicing form of DSP1 may exist. This variant was named as DSP1\u03b2 while the original DSP1 transcript was renamed as DSP1\u03b1. Sequencing analysis showed that an alternative 5\u2032-splicing site in the third exon of DSP1 was used to generate DSP1\u03b2 in which a 3\u2032 portion of the third exon (nucleotides: 1,175\u20131,242 in the genomic DNAs) was removed compared with DSP1\u03b1 (Fig. 1A\u2013C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A\u2013C) and results in a PTC in the fourth exon. Because PTC may trigger the RNA NMD), we asked if DSP1\u03b2 is a target of NMD. We compared the accumulation of DSP1\u03b2 in Col with that in iba1 (AT5G47010), which is defective in the NMD pathway (45). The NMD-sensitive AS transcript of MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 3 (MAF3, At5g65060) (37) was used as the control. iba1 increased the levels of the MAF3-AS transcript but not the DSP1\u03b2 transcript (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), suggesting that DSP1\u03b2 may not be a target of NMD. To determine if DSP1\u03b2 could produce a functional protein, we used the coding region of DSP1\u03b2 to generate a chimeric construct driven by a 35S promoter with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag at the C terminus (p35S::HA-DSP1\u03b2-GFP) according to Ghelli et al. (44) (Fig. 1D). When transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana), the transgene produced an \u223c63 Kd protein, which is the predicted size for HA-DSP1\u03b2-GFP, resulting in a GFP signal (Fig. 1D). To confirm that DSP1\u03b2 was, indeed, translated in vivo, we generated an antibody recognizing both DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2G). This antibody detected the existence of DSP1\u03b2 in flower but not in seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig. S2E). Moreover, we found that the levels of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 were reduced in the weak dsp1-1 allele (8). These results demonstrate that DSP1\u03b2 was, indeed, translated into a protein in vivo.Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Both DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 are required for pollen and embryo developments.

(F) Developing seeds in dissected green siliques. (Scale bar = 1 mm.)Next, we asked if DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 are required for pollen and embryo developments. Expression of DSP1\u03b1 (pDSP1::DSP1\u03b1-MYC) in dsp1-1 alone recovered the defects of seedlings, but not pollen and seeds, while expression of DSP1\u03b2 (pDSP1::DSP1\u03b2-MYC) alone failed to rescue all of the developmental defects of dsp1-1 (Figs. 1 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig. S2F). However, pollen and embryo defects were completely rescued when both DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 were introduced into dsp1-1 (Fig. 1 E and F). These results demonstrate that DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 are both required for pollen and seed development and that DSP1\u03b1 but not DSP1\u03b2 is required for seedling development.DSP1\u03b2 Is Specifically Expressed in Pollen and Embryos. To understand how DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 act coordinately in Arabidopsis, we first evaluated their expression in various organs of WT. A semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that DSP1\u03b1 was expressed in all selected tissues, while DSP1\u03b2 was only detectable in flowers and developing seeds (Fig. 2A). To further examine their expression patterns, we generated stable \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporters fused with the genomic DNA of DSP1\u03b1 or DSP1\u03b2 driven by the native DSP1 promoter (pDSP1::GDSP1[\u03b1 or \u03b2]-GUS) (Fig. 2D). pDSP1::GDSP1\u03b2-GUS could generate two transcripts, DSP1\u03b2-GUS or DSP1\u03b1 (truncated)-GUS due to alternative splicing. However, DSP1\u03b1 (truncated)-GUS could not be translated into a functional GUS protein because it contains a reading frameshift at the start codon of GUS (SI Appendix, Fig. S2H). Thus, the GUS levels should reflect DSP1\u03b2 protein levels in the transgenic plants containing pDSP1::GDSP1\u03b2-GUS. DSP1\u03b2 was detected in pollen, the pollinated embryo sac, the radicle zone of the fully developed embryo, and in the young cotyledon (Fig. 2 C and D), while DSP1\u03b1-GUS was present in the whole seedling and embryo of transgenic plants. Interestingly, both DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 were absent from the ovules (Fig. 2C). These results agree with the essential role of DSP1\u03b2 in pollen and seed development and the critical functions of DSP1\u03b1 in various tissues except for female organs (8).Open in a separate windowFig. 2.Expression patterns of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2.

Because of its importance, we asked if DSP1\u03b2 is also present in additional eudicot plants, such as Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Glycine max, Cucumis sativus, and Nicotiana sylvestris, or monocot plants, such as Zea mays and Oryza sativa. Interestingly, we observed similar DSP1 third exon splicing variants by RT-PCR and sequencing in all examined eudicot plants but not in the monocot plants (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S1). Hence, this splicing pattern we observed here may be evolutionarily conserved among Eudicots.DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 Are Both Required for snRNA Biogenesis in Pollen. Next, we asked if both DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 are required for snRNA biogenesis. We examined the accumulation of snRNAs and presnRNAs in the pollens of WT, dsp1-1, and dsp1-1 harboring DSP1\u03b1, DSP1\u03b2, or DSP1\u03b1 +DSP1\u03b2. The expression of DSP1\u03b1 reduced the accumulation of presnRNAs and did not affect the accumulation snRNAs, while the expression of DSP1\u03b2 recovered snRNA levels accompanied with increased levels of presnRNAs (Fig. 3 A\u2013C). In addition, coexpression of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 recovered the accumulation of both presnRNAs and snRNAs (Fig. 3 A\u2013C). These results demonstrate that proper snRNA biogenesis in pollen requires both DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1.Open in a separate windowFig. 3.Both DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 are required for snRNA biosynthesis in pollens. (A and B) Accumulation of mature snRNAs detected by qRT-PCR (A) or Northern blot (B). (C) Accumulation of presnRNAs detected by qRT-PCR. PresnRNA and mature snRNA levels were normalized to ACT2 and compared with Col in qRT-PCR. Values are means of three biological replicates. Error bars indicate SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Student\u2019s t test). U6 was used as a loading control for Northern blot. (D) In vitro pre-U2.3-polyG 3\u2032-end processing by nuclear protein extracts. The black arrow indicates the input. The gray arrow indicates the mature snRNAs. The relative processing efficiency was shown under the band of mature U2.3 snRNA. The radioactive signals of mature U2.3 RNAs of various genotypes were normalized to the input and compared with those of Col to obtain relative processing efficiency of various genotypes, and the value of Col was set to 1.Next, we asked the function of DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 in snRNA 3\u2032 maturation using an in vitro processing assay (8). In this assay, an in vitro transcribed [32P] pre-U2.3-polyG RNA in which the poly-G was added to prevent 3\u2032 trimming was processed in protein extracts from anthers of various genotypes. The result showed that DSP1\u03b1 but not DSP1\u03b2 recovered the presnRNA cleavage efficiency in dsp1-1 (Fig. 3D), revealing that DSP1\u03b1 is required for efficient presnRNA 3\u2032 cleavage while DSP1\u03b2 likely has roles other than 3\u2032-end cleavage of presnRNAs.We also asked the role of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 in snRNA biogenesis in seedlings. In seedlings, DSP1\u03b1 but not DSP1\u03b2 rescued the presnRNA accumulation in dsp1-1 in which presnRNA abundance is elevated due to impaired snRNA 3\u2032 cleavage, and snRNAs levels were not changed (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A\u2013C). Moreover, overexpression of DSP1\u03b2 in seedlings of WT did not affect the accumulation of both presnRNAs and snRNAs (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 D and E) (8). These results together with the pollen specific expression of DSP1\u03b2 suggest that DSP1\u03b2 likely promotes snRNA accumulation in pollen. Indeed, we observed a higher accumulation of mature snRNAs in pollen relative to seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig. S4F). We also examined the impact of DSP1\u03b2 on the 3\u2032 processing of FCA. Like DSP1\u03b1, DSP1\u03b2 does not affect 3\u2032-end processing of premRNAs (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G).We further asked if DSP1 affects snRNA accumulation through modulating the stability of presnRNAs. We measured presnRNA half-lives after treating plants with cordycepin, an inhibitor of transcription. However, we did not observe obvious differences of presnRNA half-lives among Col, dsp1-1, dsp1-1+ DSP1\u03b1, and dsp1-1+ DSP1\u03b2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4H).DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 Compete for the Interaction with CSPF73-I. We sought to determine how DSP1\u03b2 acts in snRNA biogenesis. DSP1\u03b2 contains the first cluster of the ARM repeats (\u223c40 aa for each repeat) of DSP1\u03b1 (Fig. 4A) and localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Since ARM repeats are known to mediate protein\u2013protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions, we suspected that DSP1\u03b2 might compete with DSP1\u03b1 for its interaction partners (DNAs or proteins). We first asked if, like DSP1\u03b1, DSP1\u03b2 binds the snRNA loci. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that DSP1\u03b2 did not bind the U1a and U2.3 snRNA loci (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 A and B), indicating that DSP1\u03b2 may not compete with DSP1\u03b1 for DNA binding.Open in a separate windowFig. 4.DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 interact with CPSF73-I through the first ARM domain.

(F and G) BiFC (F) and co-IP (G) analyses of the DSP1\u03b1\u2206ARM1-CPSF73-I interaction. CPSF73-I was detected with antibodies recognizing CPSF73-I. (H and I) BiFC (H) and co-IP (I) analyses of DSP1\u03b2-CPSF73-I-Trs interactions. BiFC was performed in tobacco epidermal cells or protoplasts (C). Co-IP assays were performed using anti-MYC for IP.Next, we asked if DSP1\u03b2 could compete with DSP1\u03b1 for protein interaction. We first examined the interaction of DSP1\u03b2 with the DSP1\u03b1-interacting partners, Pol II, CPSF73-I, and DSP4. DSP1\u03b2 did not interact with Pol II and DSP4 in bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-IP assays. It also did not interact with DSP2 or DSP3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C and D). However, it did interact with CPSF73-I in both BiFC (Fig. 4C) and co-IP (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the first ARM domain of DSP1\u03b1 was responsible for DSP1-CPSF73-I interactions. Indeed, when the first ARM domain was removed (DSP1\u03b1\u2206ARM1) (Fig. 4E), DSP1\u03b1 failed to interact with CPSF73-I (Fig. 4 F and G). Next, we investigated the CPSF73-I protein domain responsible for DSP1 interactions. We tested three truncated versions of CPSF73-I: Tr1, Tr2, and Tr3, which contained only the lactamase, \u03b2-Casp, and C-terminal domains, respectively (Fig. 4E). Of the three truncated proteins, only Tr2 interacted with DSP1\u03b2 in BiFC and co-IP assays (Fig. 4 H and I). This indicated that the \u03b2-Casp domain is solely responsible for mediating the interaction between the CPSF73-I and the DSP1 variants.We further analyzed the effect of DSP1\u03b2 on the DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction. Co-IP assays showed that the DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction was dramatically reduced in the presence of DSP1\u03b2, while the DSP1\u03b1-DSP4 interaction was not affected (Fig. 5A). To qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the effect of DSP1\u03b2 on DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction in vivo, we performed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Because the fluorescence signals from full-length DSP1\u03b1-cyan fluorescent (CFPs) or CPSF73-I-yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) were weak and easily quenched, we used truncated proteins containing the protein-interaction domains for this assay. We cotransfected truncated DSP1\u03b1 (aa 1\u2013504) and CPSF73-I (aa 1\u2013473), tagged with CFP and YFP, respectively, into N. benthamiana cells. FRET confirmed that the interaction between DSP1\u03b1 and CPSF73-I was greatly reduced when DSP1\u03b2 was present (Fig. 5B). DSP3, which interacts with CPSF73-I (8), was also coexpressed in the FRET experiments as a control. DSP3 slightly enhanced the DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction, confirming the specificity of the competition between the AS variants.Open in a separate windowFig. 5.DSP1\u03b2 competes with DSP1\u03b1 for the interaction with CSPF73-I.

Error bars represent the SD. *P < 0.05 (Student\u2019s t test).DSP1\u03b2 Affects CPSF73-I/Pol II Occupancy at the Downstream of the snRNA Loci. The competition between DSP1 variants raised the possibility that DSP1\u03b2 may affect CPSF73-I activity. However, coexpression of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 did not affect presnRNA 3\u2032-end processing in vitro (Fig. 3D). Thus, we suspected that the competition between DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 might help the recycle CPSF73-I during snRNA 3\u2032 maturation, which occurs cotranscriptionally. In this scenario, the release of CPSF73-I from the snRNA loci should be affected by DSP1\u03b2 in pollen. We used microChIP to analyze the occupancy of CPSF73-I at snRNA loci. CPSF73-I occupancy at the promoter, coding, and 3\u2032-box regions of the snRNA loci was reduced in dsp1-1 relative to WT. Conversely, CPSF73-I occupancy increased at the 3\u2032-downstream (DS) region of snRNA loci (Fig. 6 A and B). Expression of DSP1\u03b1 partially recovered CPSF73-I occupancy at the promoter, coding, and 3\u2032 box but not at the DS region. Interestingly, DSP1\u03b2 completely recovered CPSF73-I occupancy at the DS region but had no or weak effects elsewhere (Fig. 6 A and B). Coexpression of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 completely recovered CPSF73-I occupancy at all tested regions of the snRNA loci (Fig. 6 A and B). We also analyzed the impact of DSP1\u03b2 and DSP1\u03b1 on Pol II occupancy at various regions of snRNA loci in pollen. The results mimicked the observation for CPSF73-I (Fig. 6 C and D). These results suggest that DSP1\u03b2 is required for the release of CPSF73-I and Pol II at the DS region of snRNA loci. In contrast with the observation in pollens, DSP1\u03b2 had no impact on CPSF73-I or Pol II occupancy at snRNA loci in seedlings (SI Appendix, Fig. S6), further confirming that DSP1\u03b2 acts specifically in pollen.Open in a separate windowFig. 6.DSP1\u03b2 reduces the occupancy of CPSF73-I and Pol II at the 3\u2032-downstream regions of the snRNA loci. (A\u2013D) Occupancy of CPSF73-I (A and B) or Pol II (C and D) at various sites of the U2.3 (A and C) or U1a (B and D) snRNA loci detected by microChIP. Pro: promoter; DS region of snRNAs. Values are means of three technical replicates. Error bars indicate SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Student\u2019s t test compared with dsp1-1 samples).DSP1\u03b2 Is Required for Transcription Termination of snRNAs. The effect of DSP1 variants on Pol II/CPSF73-I release from snRNA loci suggests that DSP1\u03b2 but not DSP1\u03b1 plays a positive role in snRNA transcription termination in pollen. We used a nuclear run on (NRO) assay to test this possibility. In this assay, we used U2.3 as a reporter. After NRO, the levels of snRNA transcripts were evaluated using probes targeting the coding/mature snRNAs (P1), 3\u2032-box (P2), and 3\u2032-downstream regions (P3 and P4 indicate read-through transcripts, Fig. 7A). Relative to WT, the levels of de novo read-through transcripts, which are transcribed far beyond the normal termination site for presnRNAs (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and Dataset S1), were increased in dsp1-1 and dsp1-1+DSP1\u03b1 but not in dsp1-1+DSP1\u03b2 (Fig. 7A). This indicates that DSP1\u03b2 but not DSP1\u03b1 promotes the termination of snRNA transcription. To further validate these results, we used a pre-U2m-GUS reporter where a mutation in the 3\u2032 box prevents cleavage at the 3\u2032 end, resulting in the accumulation of a read-through transcript, which can be translated into a functional GUS protein (8). GUS levels depend on the amount of read-through transcripts of pre-U2m-GUS. We detected a weak GUS signal in WT pollen where DSP1\u03b2 is expressed, suggesting that transcription is terminated efficiently at the 3\u2032 box of the reporter (Fig. 7 B and C). Read-through transcript levels were increased in dsp1-1 relative to WT (Fig. 7 B and C). Expression of DSP1\u03b2 but not DSP1\u03b1 recovered the transcript termination defect (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that DSP1\u03b2 is required for snRNA transcription termination.Open in a separate windowFig. 7.DSP1\u03b2 promotes the termination of snRNA transcription.

DiscussionAlternative splicing utilizes alternative splice sites to generate multiple mRNAs from a single genetic locus, increasing the biological diversity obtained from a limited number of genes (30\u201334). In plants, limited alternative splicing events have been studied in detail, partially due to that most splicing variants are degraded (30\u201332, 34, 35). In this study, we show DSP1\u03b2, a splicing variant of DSP1, is required for plant development and snRNA biogenesis. Despite that DSP1\u03b2 harbors a PTC, a signal triggering RNA degradation, it is translated into a truncated DSP1 protein. Intriguingly, DSP1\u03b2 promotes snRNA biogenesis through competing with DSP1\u03b1, the full-length DSP1 protein, for the interaction with CPSF73-I.The snRNA biogenesis defection in dsp1-1 cannot be recovered by either DSP1\u03b1 or DSP1\u03b2 alone, indicating the snRNA biogenesis requires the coordinated action of both variants. DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 act differently in snRNA biogenesis. DSP1\u03b1 functions as a component of the DSP1 complex to facilitate snRNA 3\u2032-end maturation (Fig. 3D), but DSP1\u03b2 is not required for presnRNA 3\u2032 cleavage. Instead, it seems to be a rate-determining factor for the accumulation of mature snRNAs in pollen, given the fact that the expression of DSP1\u03b2 but not DSP1\u03b1 is sufficient to recover the accumulation of mature snRNAs in the hypomorphic dsp1-1 mutant in which low levels of both variants can be generated. DSP1\u03b2 contains only the first ARM cluster of the DSP1\u03b1 protein. Unlike DSP1\u03b1, DSP1\u03b2 does not interact with Pol II, DSP4, or snRNA loci but interacts with CPSF73-I. When both variants are present, the DSP1\u03b1-CPSF73-I interaction is reduced, indicating that DSP1\u03b2 competes with DSP1\u03b1 for CPSF73-I (Fig. 8). When DSP1\u03b2 is lacking, the occupancy of both CPSF73-I and Pol II at the downstream of the 3\u2032 box of snRNA loci increased, and read-through transcripts from snRNA loci accumulated, despite the presence of DSP1\u03b1, suggesting a defection in transcription termination. These results reveal that the interaction of DSP1\u03b2 with CPSF73-I likely facilitates the release of CPSF73-I and Pol II after or during snRNA 3\u2032-end processing, which occurs cotranscriptionally. Hence, DSP1\u03b2 promotes the rapid recycle of the DSP1 complex and Pol II and enhances transcription and processing and thereby increases snRNA accumulation in pollens (Fig. 8B), relative to the seedling where DSP1\u03b2 is not expressed (Fig. 8A). Agreeing with this model, we observed increased accumulation of unprocessed presnRNAs in dsps1-1 harboring DSP1\u03b2 (Fig. 3C) due to increased transcription and reduced efficiency of snRNA processing (low levels of DSP1\u03b1). In this model, the function of DSP1\u03b2 resembles that of the negative elongation factor (NELF) in mammals. NELF interacts with INT, promotes the 3\u2032-end cleavage of presnRNAs, and facilitates Pol II/INT9 recycling from the downstream of 3\u2032-box snRNA loci and snRNA transcription termination (46, 47). Because plants lack NELF, a novel mechanism involving AS of DSP1 is likely evolved to facilitate snRNA transcription termination.Open in a separate windowFig. 8.Model for the function of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 in snRNA biosynthesis. (A) snRNA biogenesis in the tissues containing only DSP1\u03b1. \u201cX\u201d indicates the absence of DSP1\u03b2 in tissues. (B) snRNA biogenesis in the tissues expressing both DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2. \u201c?\u201d indicates unknown components. DSP1\u03b1 functions as a component of the DSP1 complex for snRNA 3\u2032-end maturation. DSP1\u03b2 facilitates the release of CPSF73-I and Pol II by competitively binding CPSF73-I at the 3\u2032 end of the snRNA loci. Consequently, DSP1\u03b2 promotes the rapid cycle of the DSP1 complex and snRNA transcription. The coordinate action between DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 results in higher accumulation of snRNAs in pollen.Splicing variants are induced by various intrinsic and extrinsic signals to cope with environmental stress or developmental cues (38\u201344). DSP1\u03b2 appears to be a tissue or development-specific splicing variant, which facilitates the production of mature snRNAs to meet the requirements of rapid cell division in pollen and embryos. The production of DSP1\u03b2 is likely controlled by specific splicing factors, whose function or presence is modulated by endogenous developmental signals. DSP1\u03b2 may require additional machinery for its function (Fig. 8) since its overexpression does not affect snRNA biogenesis in seedlings. Alternatively, DSP1\u03b2 could function only when the transcription rate of snRNA is high, requiring the rapid recycling of the DSP1 complex and the release of Pol II for preventing transcription read-through.DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 may act coordinately in the development of pollen and embryos through, at least, three nonmutually exclusive ways. First, they may contribute to pollen and embryo developments through promoting snRNA biogenesis as snRNAs are essential for splicing (48). Several reports have shown that abnormal snRNA accumulation can cause developmental defects (26, 28, 49). However, the reduction in snRNA accumulation alone cannot fully explain dsp1-1 phenotypes because DSP1\u03b2 recovers snRNA levels but does not rescue the growth defects. Second, they may contribute to development through preventing 3\u2032-extended transcription from downstream of the snRNA loci. These 3\u2032-read-through transcripts can be translated into functional proteins (13\u201315). When generated undesirably, these proteins can be toxic to plants. However, inconsistent with this notion, expression of DSP1\u03b2 removes most of the read-through transcripts but cannot rescue the developmental defects of dsp1-1. Third, DSP1\u03b1 or DSP1\u03b2 may affect other biological processes. In mammals, INT also affects transcription termination of mRNAs, biogenesis of some viral-derived miRNAs and enhancer RNAs, and dynein localization at the nuclear envelope (50\u201355). DSP1 variants may be involved in other RNA metabolism processes.In conclusion, the identification of DSP1\u03b2 as a regulator of snRNA biogenesis reveals a novel mechanism controlling snRNA accumulation in specific organs through alternative splicing. These results extend the known regulatory mechanisms controlling snRNA accumulation at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (16, 29, 46, 56, 57) and add complexity to the regulation of splicing. We also observed similar DSP1 splicing patterns in additional eudicot plants but not in monocots, suggesting that the snRNA regulation mechanism we identified here maybe evolved after the divergence between monocots and eudicots. Future research should identify the process or signals that specifically control the alternative splicing of DSP1 and expand the knowledge on the mechanisms through which it functions. Materials and MethodsPlant Materials. The T-DNA insertion mutant dsp1-1 (SALK_036641) (8) in the Col genetic background was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center (https://abrc.osu.edu).Plasmid Construction. The 2.25 kb promoter region of DSP1 was cloned into pMD18T using XbaI/BamHI restriction sites. The ORFs of DSP1\u03b1 and DSP1\u03b2 were, subsequently, inserted downstream of the DSP1 promoter using BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites. The full pDSP1::DSP1\u03b1/DSP1\u03b2 regions were cloned into pGWB433 to generate the pDSP1::DSP1\u03b1/DSP1\u03b2-GUS vectors. pDSP1:DSP1\u03b2 was cloned into pGWB17 to generate the pDSP1::DSP1\u03b2-MYC vector. The CDS of DSP1\u03b2 was fused with the HA tag and cloned into pEarleygate103 to generate the 35S::HA-DSP1\u03b2-GFP vector. For BiFC assays, pairs of genes were cloned into pEarleyGate201-YC and pEarleyGate202-YN to generate C-terminal YFP and nonfluorescent YFP fusion vectors, respectively. The CDS of DSP1\u03b2 was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 to generate the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DSP1\u03b2. Purified GST-DSP1\u03b2 was used as an antigen to produce the polyclonal anti-DSP1\u03b1/\u03b2 antibody in rabbit. The antibody was generated with the Proteintech Group method, which produces a mix of antibodies recognizing DSP1a/DSP1\u03b2, GST, or proteins tagged with GST. To avoid the influence of anti-GST in related experiments, the anti-GSTs were removed with GST-coupling Sepharose beads from the antibody mixture. The primers used for plasmid construction are listed in SI Appendix, Table S2.Histochemical GUS Staining. Seedling or influorescence tissues were collected directly into the GUS staining buffer. Anthers and embryos were dissected from flowers and immature seeds, respectively, under a binocular microscope. After incubation overnight in the staining buffer at 37 \u00b0C, the tissues were transferred into 70% ethanol to remove chlorophyll. Three independent WT plants were transformed with pU2::pre-U2m-GUS and crossed into dsp1-1, dsp1-1+DSP1a, dsp1-1+DSP1\u03b2, and dsp1-1+DSP1a+DSP1\u03b2, parallelly. GUS expression was examined in anthers and embryos.Pollen Observation. Alexander staining was performed as previously described (8). Pollen grain ultrastructures were observed using a TEM according to Pu et al. (2019) (10). Briefly, anthers were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in Epon812, and cut to 80 nm sections with a diamond knife. The sections were collected onto a grid for further staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. After washing, the sections were observed with a TEM (JEOL, Japan).U2.3 presnRNA In Vitro Processing Assay. presnRNA-polyG RNA was generated with in vitro transcription by the T7 RNA polymerase, followed by purification in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 5 M urea. The RNA was labeled with [32P] at the 5\u2032 end using the T4 polynucleotide kinase. Then, it was incubated for 60 min with 1 \u03bcg of a nuclear protein extract obtained from anthers of various genotypes as described before (8, 58). Final RNA products were extracted and resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels containing 5 M urea. The products of the presnRNA processing assay were detected using a PhosphorImager.ChIP Assay. ChIP assays were performed as described before (8). Anti-RPB2 (Abcam) antibodies were used for Pol II IP. The CPSF73-I specific antibody used in the ChiP assay was raised with the C-terminal domain as the antigen. The enrichment of the targets relative to the input was measured by real-time PCR in three biological replicates.Co-IP Assay. For the Co-IP assay, a mixture of Agrobacterium containing different combinations of vectors was infiltrated into the leaves of N. benthamiana. After 2 d, the leaf pieces were collected and used for IP assays as described before (8). The anti-MYC (Abcam) antibody was used for IP. Final IPed proteins were analyzed by Western blot.FRET Assay. The truncated versions of DSP1\u03b1 (aa 1\u2013504) and CPSF73-I (aa 1\u2013473), containing the domains for protein interaction, were used for the FRET assay in cotransfected N. benthamiana cells. CFP, YFP, and FRET channel signals were obtained by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV3000). The FRET channel images were analyzed using the CellSens Dimension software. Mean normalized FRET data were calculated following NFRET norms (59).NRO Assay. NRO followed the protocol described by Cuello et al. (1999) (13) with modifications. Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to different sites of the U2.3 gene (SI Appendix, Table S2) were denatured, transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-dot filter (Bio-red), and then fixed with ultraviolet. Then, 20 \u03bcg of nuclei extracted from anthers of each genotype were incubated with 7 \u03bcL of [\u03b1-32P] UTP. After hybridization, nitrocellulose was washed three times in 1\u00d7 SSE containing 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate. The hybridization signal was detected using a PhosphorImager. Probes complementary to 5S ribosomal RNA and U6 snRNA were used parallelly in the NRO assay as loading controls.
