Once patients require mechanical ventilation (MV), the temporal change in gas exchange and its relation to clinical outcome is poorly described. We investigated whether gas exchange over the first 5 days of MV is associated with mortality and ventilator-free days at 28 days in COVID-19. Methods: In a cohort of 294 COVID-19 patients, we used data during the first 5 days of MV to calculate 4 daily respiratory scores: PaO2/FiO2 (P/F), oxygenation index (OI), ventilatory ratio (VR), and Murray lung injury score. The association between these scores at early (days 1-3) and late (days 4-5) time points with mortality was evaluated using logistic regression, adjusted for demographics. Correlation with ventilator-free days was assessed (Spearman rank-order coefficients). Results: Overall mortality was 47.6%. Nonsurvivors were older (P < .0001), more male (P = .029), with more preexisting cardiopulmonary disease compared to survivors. Mean PaO2 and PaCO2 were similar during this timeframe. However, by days 4 to 5 values for all airway pressures and FiO2 had diverged, trending lower in survivors and higher in nonsurvivors. The most substantial between-group difference was the temporal change in OI, improving 15% in survivors and worsening 11% in nonsurvivors (P < .05). The adjusted mortality OR was significant for age (1.819, P = .001), OI at days 4 to 5 (2.26, P = .002), and OI percent change (1.90, P = .02). The number of ventilator-free days correlated significantly with late VR (-0.166, P < .05), early and late OI (-0.216, P < .01; -0.278, P < .01, respectively) and early and late P/F (0.158, P < .05; 0.283, P < .01, respectively). Conclusion: Nonsurvivors of COVID-19 needed increasing intensity of MV to sustain gas exchange over the first 5 days, unlike survivors.

Addressing this challenge will require a better understanding of the\nfactors that predict poor clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated COVID-19\npatients.The severity of hypoxemia, expressed as the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F)\nratio is widely used to stratify ARDS into mild, moderate, and severe categories\naccording to the Berlin definition.5 There is conflicting evidence regarding whether these categories reliably\npredict ARDS mortality.6-8 ARDS due to\nCOVID-19 appears to have atypical features compared to other causes of ARDS. In\nCOVID-19 disease, it is commonly observed that the severity of hypoxemia progresses\nto ARDS in an unusually slow fashion over several days. Some authors have observed\nan atypical ARDS presentation in a subset of COVID-19 patients with relatively\npreserved lung mechanics, while others have reported surprisingly little dyspnea in\nassociation with marked hypoxemia.9,10 The postulated mechanisms\nbehind such atypical features are subjects of dispute. In view of this, it is\nunclear whether temporal trends in gas exchange in COVID-19 are predictive of\noutcome.The goal of this study was to investigate whether temporal trends in gas exchange\nparameters over the initial days of MV are associated with mortality and\nventilator-free days (VFDs) in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. We\nspecifically tested the association of these clinical outcomes with the temporal\nchanges in PaO2 /FiO2%/ratio (P/F), oxygenation index (OI),\nventilatory ratio (VR), and the Murray lung injury score (MLIS). MethodsStudy PopulationThis retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board with an\nexemption for informed consent. Our study followed the Strengthening of\nReporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines\nfrom cross-sectional studies.11 Data came from Stony Brook University Hospital Emergency Department (ED)\nCOVID-19 Persons Under Investigation Registry from February 7, 2020, to June 30,\n2020. The study population included all adults (>18 years) treated with MV in\nthe hospital ICUs with a confirmed positive real-time polymerase chain reaction\ntest for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Patients were excluded if\nthey expired in the ED, were still hospitalized at the time of data analysis\nover 2 months after ED admission for this cohort, or had received MV for <1\nday. The study sample size was 294 patients (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Flowchart of patient population included in this study. Two hundred\nninety four patients were included in the final sample. The terms alive\nand dead refer to the patient\u2019s status at time data collection was\nfinalized, 60 days after all 294 patients had entered the study\nperiod.Outcome MeasuresThe study outcomes were in-hospital mortality and VFDs in the first 28 days after\nintubation. Patients were considered survivors if they were discharged alive\nfrom the hospital at the time of data analysis. Any patient who died within the\n28 days or remained on MV for over 28 days received a 0 for VFD.Independent VariablesDemographics, major comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory values were\ntabulated at ED admission. The earliest arterial blood gas (ABG) values on each\nof the first 5 days of MV and the closest corresponding ventilator parameters\nwere recorded, including the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2%),\nmean airway pressure (MAP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory\nrate (RR), tidal volume (TV), and dynamic peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). ABG\nvariables included pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and partial\npressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). After 5 days of MV, ABG data is\nobtained only intermittently at our institution, limiting our ability to analyze\ngas exchange for a more prolonged period.We calculated the multivariable MLIS with a modified radiographic scoring method,\nused in a prior study of these registry patients,12 as follows: 3 thoracic radiologists scored the geographical extent of\nparenchymal lung infiltrates or consolidations in each lung separately on a 0-4\nscale (0\u2009=\u2009no involvement, 1\u2009=\u2009<25%, 2\u2009=\u200926%-50%, 3\u2009=\u200951%-75%, 4\u2009=\u2009>75%\ninvolvement). For each patient, the mean scores for the right and left lung were\nadded together, divided by 2, and rounded to the nearest integer.13 Kappa scores for this method revealed an acceptable degree of\ninterobserver agreement. It differs only slightly from the 4-quadrant system\nused in the classical Murray score.13Calculated gas exchange scores were as follows14,15: VR\u2009=\u2009RR*TV*PaCO2/predicted body weight*100*37.5.OI\u2009=\u2009FiO2*MAP/PaO2.The mean value of each score (MLIS, VR, OI, and P/F ratio) during days 1\nto 3 and days 4 to 5 of MV were calculated separately, and referred to as early\nand late time points, respectively, as described in Results section.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS v26 (IBM, Armonk) and SAS v9.4 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary). Group comparisons of categorical variables in frequencies and\npercentages were performed using the \u03c72 test or Fisher exact test.\nGroup comparison of continuous variables in medians and interquartile ranges\n(IQR) used the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. Ventilation parameters were\ncompared between survivors and nonsurvivors for the first 5 days on MV using\nrepeated analysis of variance. The temporal differences in clinical variables\nbetween survivor and nonsurvivor groups were compared using a\nt-test. The associations between clinical variables and\nmortality were evaluated using logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs). We\ntested for collinearity between variables using the variance inflation factor.\nStandardized ORs were estimated in order to compare the associations of clinical\nvariables with different units. Logistic regressions were adjusted for age,\ngender, and the presence of 2 comorbidities, hypertension (HTN) and coronary\nartery disease (CAD). Finally, Spearman rank-order correlations were estimated\nbetween VFDs and clinical variables. For all analyses, a P\nvalue of <.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ResultsMortality OutcomesThe final sample size consisted of 294 COVID-19 positive patients receiving MV.\nMortality was 47.6%. Table\n1 shows the demographics, comorbidity, vital signs, ABG, and other\nlaboratory values at admission. Patients in the nonsurvivor group were older\n(P\u2009<\u2009.0001), more male (P\u2009=\u2009.029), and\nmore frequently had a history of CAD (P\u2009=\u2009.004), chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P\u2009=\u2009.042), and congestive\nheart failure (CHF) (P\u2009=\u2009.033) compared to the survivor group.\nThey also had slightly lower mean values for body temperature and\nhemoglobin-O2 saturation, and a slightly higher mean respiratory\nrate. Notable differences in laboratory values included higher serum levels of\nB-type natriuretic peptide, creatinine, and D-dimer among nonsurvivors, as shown\nin Table 1.Table 1.Demographics, Comorbidities, Vital Signs, and Laboratory Values of\nCOVID-19 Survivors and Nonsurvivors on MV.Patients, no.

DiscussionIn this cohort, COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, we explored the\nrelationship between mortality and gas exchange during the first 5 days of MV. The\nmajor findings are: After day 3 of MV, the FiO2 and airway pressures used in\nnonsurvivors began to increase relative to survivors, though the trend\nin PaO2 did not differ between groups. That is, compared to\nsurvivors, nonsurvivors required a substantially greater intensity of MV\nover time to sustain the same level of oxygenation. This is reflected in\nthe temporal trends in OI, which significantly improved in survivors and\nsignificantly worsened in nonsurvivors at the later time points (days 4\nand 5 of MV). The P/F ratio also improved more in survivors than in\nnonsurvivors; however, its discriminatory value was lower, since it\nimproved in both survivors and nonsurvivors and the magnitude of the\ndifference was small (15 points).The OI represents the \u201cpressure cost\u201d of oxygenation and is conceptually\na more robust index of gas exchange than the P/F ratio.7,16\nThe latter can be artifactually changed by raising or lowering mean\nairway pressure (by changing PEEP for example) to recruit or de-recruit\ndiseased lung units. The OI takes into account airway pressure and\nthereby reflects both the magnitude of O2 exchange and the\nintensity of ventilator support required to achieve it. It varies\ninversely with the P/F ratio; a higher OI value indicates worse gas\nexchange. Guidelines published by the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury\nConsensus Conference Group in 2015 strongly recommend using the OI\nrather than the P/F ratio as the primary metric of severity in pediatric ARDS.17 In pediatric literature on ARDS, a markedly elevated OI despite\noptimal MV is widely accepted as a poor prognostic marker and an\nindication to begin extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.18,19\nHowever, because of the extensive use of the P/F ratio in adult research\nin ARDS, many physicians have not transitioned to using this valuable\nand nuanced marker of gas exchange. OI is readily derived from data that\nis routinely charted in most electronic medical records.We observed that an elevated OI at the later time points was strongly\nassociated with mortality (OR 2.26) in the multivariable model, and\ncorrelated with fewer VFDs, at both the early and late time points.\nNotably, the OI did not change significantly between days 4 and 5, and\nthus served as a persisting marker of deteriorating gas exchange among\nnonsurvivors. We did not find that the P/F ratio was statistically\ncorrelated to mortality.Prior reports of ARDS in non-COVID patients have shown that OIs such as\nOI and P/F ratio are variably and only weakly associated with mortality,\nwith ORs ranging from 1.0 to 1.8, while clinical factors such as age,\norgan failure scores, and active malignancy are more strongly predictive\nof mortality.16,20,21 This supports the premise that death from\nnon-COVID-related ARDS is closely related to nonpulmonary organ failure,\nand not closely related to gas exchange failure per se.8,16,22,23\nIn contrast, a recent cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Michigan\nfound that pulmonary dysfunction itself was the primary cause of death\nin 56% of COVID-19 patients, compared to 22% of those with respiratory\nfailure of other causes.24 Along these same lines, a multivariate analysis of ventilated\nCOVID-19 patients in the Netherlands found that lower\nPaO2/FiO2 was associated with fewer VFDs by\nday 28.25 Our results confirm and extend these findings, showing that in\nCOVID-related respiratory failure, worsening OI after 3 days of MV is\nitself strongly and independently associated with higher mortality and\nfewer VFDs.Hypercapnia (high PaCO2) was substantially worse on day 1 of\nMV in nonsurvivors compared to survivors, even though minute ventilation\ndiffered by only 8% at that time point. The product of minute\nventilation and PaCO2 is the basis of the VR; it reflects the\nintensity of MV required to excrete CO2 in the lungs. A high\nVR represents either inefficient ventilation due to dead space, or high\nmetabolic production of CO2. In our exploratory analysis, we\ncompared VR between survivors and nonsurvivors on day 1 of MV. The VR\nwas worse among our nonsurvivors, though this did not reach statistical\nsignificance (OR 2.34, P\u2009=\u2009.17). Thus, we did not\ndemonstrate clear evidence of inefficient CO2 excretion among\nnonsurvivors compared to survivors. Prior investigators have found that\nVR and calculation of dead space by the Bohr-Enghoff equation are each\nindependently associated with mortality in patients with early ARDS,\nwith ORs ranging from 1.20 to 1.45.26,27 An elevated dead\nspace may occur in COVID-19 due to occlusion of lung capillaries by\nin-situ thrombosis resulting from a viral coagulopathy that is specific\nto SARS-CoV-2.28 Pathologic evidence of this process is seen in autopsy studies of\npatients dying of COVID-19, showing a high incidence of both lung\ncapillary microthrombi and large vessel pulmonary emboli.29,30\nThe initial hypercarbic acidosis among our nonsurvivors may simply be a\nsign that the onset of MV was inappropriately delayed. Alternatively, it\nmay indicate that the metabolic production of CO2 was greater\nin nonsurvivors. The data collected in our study does not allow us to\ndistinguish these potential causes of excess early hypercapnia in\nnonsurvivors.The MLIS showed no significant difference between early and late time\npoints for survivors and nonsurvivors. There was no significant\nassociation between MLIS and mortality at either the early or later time\npoints.Our observations suggest that day 4 of MV represents an inflection point in\ngas exchange among ventilated COVID-19 patients. A worsening OI at this point may\nprovide an early warning sign of poor outcomes. We stress that these retrospectively\nderived findings are exploratory in nature. Further work is required to determine if\nthe temporal change in OI can be incorporated in a predictive model of outcomes in\nsevere COVID-19 patients. LimitationsOur study had several limitations. First, this was a retrospective cohort study and\nas such potentially confounding factors may have been overlooked. To avoid\noverfitting the model, only a limited number of clinical variables were entered into\nthe logistic regression; it is possible that potentially relevant variables were not\nevaluated. We included 4 variables known to significantly impact mortality in\nCOVID-19: age, male gender, and the presence of hypertension or coronary disease.\nThese were the 4 variables that in our data showed the greatest individual ORs.\nSecond, a study of this size may have had insufficient power to detect real\ndifferences in the association of outcomes with VR or other parameters. Third, data\nwere obtained from a single hospital's COVID-19 database. We cannot be certain our\nresults will generalize to other hospital settings. ConclusionWe evaluated 4 commonly used scores of gas exchange and lung injury in COVID-19\npatients with ARDS over the first 5 days of MV. Nonsurvivors of COVID-19 needed\nincreasing airway pressures and FiO2 to sustain gas exchange. This is\nreflected in the OI which worsened in nonsurvivors and improved in survivors over\nthis timeframe. The temporal change in OI was the variable that most clearly\ndifferentiated survivors from nonsurvivors. A worsening OI after day 3 of MV may\nhave value as a marker of poor outcome in respiratory failure due to COVID-19.
