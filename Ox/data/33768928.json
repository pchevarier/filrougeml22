Chest X\u2010ray and RT\u2010PCR confirmed his COVID\u201019 diagnosis. This study recommends the early identification and management of COVID\u201019.Coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102), was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.\n1\n The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern regarding this global outbreak on 30 January 2020. Globally, there have been 5\u00a0796\u00a0257 confirmed cases and 362\u00a0483 deaths from COVID\u201019 reported to the WHO as of 9:37\u00a0AM CEST on 30 May 2020.\n2\n In Bangladesh, there have been approximately 52\u00a0000 confirmed cases of COVID\u201019 with about 700 deaths as of 4 June 2020. The SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus is primarily transmitted between humans through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of 75 465 COVID\u201019 cases in China failed to detect airborne transmission.\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n Early disease symptoms offer an opportunity for early detection.\n6\n, \n7\n Fast identification and accurate treatment have been critical to prevent the spread of infection.\n8\n, \n9\n At present, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR (qRT\u2010PCR) are used to detect SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. There are three genes expressed by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, including the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes\n10\n, \n11\n In Bangladesh, qRT\u2010PCR is used to detect early COVID\u201019. After a week, point\u2010of\u2010care test kits for antigen and antibodies are used to measure the protective level of plasma IgM and IgG antibodies. In this study, we reported a case of COVID\u201019 in a man with no travel history to COVID\u201019\u2013prone areas, yet he had the characteristic signs and symptoms of COVID\u201019. Chest X\u2010ray and qRT\u2010PCR confirmed his COVID\u201019 diagnosis. 2.\u2003CASE HISTORY AND EXAMINATIONOn 13 April 2020 at 11:30\u00a0AM, a 30\u2010year\u2010old man presented to a tertiary hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the signs and symptoms of COVID\u201019. He had dry cough, muscle pain, fever, headache, and shortness of breath. He was immediately admitted and recorded the vital signs of COVID\u201019, which are shown in Table\u00a01. He had no history of direct contact with any COVID\u201019\u2013positive individuals. On 14 April at 10:15\u00a0PM, his COVID\u201019 diagnosis was confirmed using an RT\u2010PCR nasal swab test (Table\u00a02). At 12:45\u00a0AM, he was moved to an isolated cabin and received supportive treatment. On 15 April at 9:45\u00a0PM, we received his complete blood count results, which did not identify leukocytopenia. Chest X\u2010ray, on the other hand, showed ground\u2010glass opacities in the center and lower right portion of his lung (Table\u00a02). This finding strongly indicated COVID\u201019. On 16 April at 10:30\u00a0AM, new nasal and throat swabs were tested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 by RT\u2010PCR, and the findings were positive. At 11:35\u00a0PM, he was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin, 500\u00a0mg), O2 inhalation, intravenous fluids, acetaminophen (500\u00a0mg), montelukast (10\u00a0mg), and fexofenadine (120\u00a0mg). After 3\u00a0days of treatment (19 April 2020), his fever and breathing improved, and his condition was stable for 72\u00a0hours. On 23 and 24 April, he was retested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA with two independent throat swabs; both were negative (Table\u00a02). On 25 April at 11:25\u00a0AM, he was discharged and recommended to follow the requirements to home quarantine for the next 14\u00a0days. During his 1 May 2020 follow\u2010up, it was recommended that he monitors his blood IgM and IgG against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Antibodies (IgM and IgG) were measured using a point\u2010of\u2010care test, which detected a protective level of IgG (Table\u00a02). The snapshot of COVID\u201019 is shown in Figure\u00a01.TABLE 1Vital signs of COVID\u201019 recorded on admissionVital signsResponseBody temperature (oF)102.7Blood pressure (mm\u00a0Hg)110/75Heart rate (beats/min)93Respiratory rate (breaths/min)18Oxygen saturation (%)86Sore throatMildRhinorrheaNDiarrheaNCoughModerateAnosmiaNChest pain and tightnessNMuscle painMildChillNOpen in a separate windowAbbreviations: N; none, mmHg; A millimeter of mercury.TABLE 2SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA detections by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionsDateRT\u2010PCRIgM/IgGX\u2010rayNasal swabThroat swabBloodChest14 April 2020PositiveGround\u2010glass darkness in the center and lower right of the lung15 April 202016 April 2020PositivePositive23 April 2020Negative24 April 2020Negative1 May 2020IgM\u2212/IgG+Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: Ggd; ground\u2010glass darkness; IgG, immunoglobulin G; IgM, immunoglobulin M; RT\u2010PCR; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Snapshot of COVID\u201019 in a 30\u2010year\u2010old man 3.\u2003DISCUSSIONSevere COVID\u201019 illness begins after approximately 7\u00a0days after symptom onset. The most common symptoms of COVID\u201019 are fever, cough, tiredness, dyspnea, and diarrhea.\n12\n, \n13\n Severe COVID\u201019 dyspnea triggers progressive respiratory failure followed by severe hypoxemia. In addition, lymphopenia is a frequent symptom of severe COVID\u201019.\n14\n, \n15\n COVID\u201019 is diagnosed and monitored using qRT\u2010PCR, partial or complete viral genome sequencing, and plasma antibody\u2010level measurements. Early SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is detected by collecting, processing, and analyzing respiratory samples, such as nasopharyngeal aspirates, combined (nasal and oral) swab samples, sputum, tracheal lavage fluid, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.\n16\n RNA is isolated from respiratory samples and measured utilizing qRT\u2010PCR with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2013specific primers.\n17\n Within a week of COVID\u201019\u2013symptom onset, plasma IgM and IgG tests easily detect the infection. It showed that a patient had the protective amount of IgG within 14\u00a0days. Point\u2010of\u2010care tests can identify serum antibodies in 15\u00a0minutes and can determine the level of the infection.\n18\n Computed tomography is useful for both diagnosis and follow\u2010up. Currently, there is no proven successful treatment for COVID\u201019. Antiviral medications and respiratory treatment are the primary approaches used to cure the disease. In addition, while several therapies have been suggested, quarantine is the only method that seems to be successful. 4.\u2003CONCLUSIONThe most critical aspect of treatment in this case study was close observation of the patient's respiratory condition to assess whether a ventilator was necessary. The patient was recommended to quarantine at home for 2\u00a0weeks (14\u00a0days) with proper food management. This 2\u2010week period provides adequate time to determine whether or not they have been infected and are able to spread the infection to other citizens.
