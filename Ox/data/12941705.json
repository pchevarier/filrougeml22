The mature snRNAs are re-imported into the nucleus, where they function in the processing of pre-mRNA in the form of ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) (see Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2001). Efficient formation of snRNA precursors requires a 13\u201316 nucleotide (nt) cis-acting element named the 3\u2032 box, located 9\u201319 nucleotides downstream of the 3\u2032 end of the RNA-encoding region (Hernandez, 1985; Yuo et al., 1985; Hernandez and Lucito, 1988). A compatible pol II snRNA promoter is also required for proper 3\u2032 end formation of pre-snRNAs, highlighting the tight link between transcription and the function of the 3\u2032 box (Hernandez and Weiner, 1986; Neuman de Vegvar et al., 1986). Until now, it was unclear whether the 3\u2032 box acts as a transcription terminator or an RNA processing element. Transcription terminates close to the 3\u2032 box of the human U1 snRNA genes (Kunkel and Pederson, 1985; Cuello et al., 1999) and 3\u2032 elongated Xenopus U1 or U2 snRNAs containing the 3\u2032 box are not further processed after injection into Xenopus oocytes (Ciliberto et al., 1986), arguing in favour of a termination role for the 3\u2032 box. However, we have shown that transcription of the human U2 snRNA gene continues for \u223c800\u00a0nt beyond the 3\u2032 box, suggesting rather that it directs RNA processing (Cuello et al., 1999; Medlin et al., 2003). In this case, 3\u2032 end formation of vertebrate pre-snRNAs would resemble 3\u2032 end formation of mRNAs, which occurs by cleavage of a larger precursor (see Dominski and Marzluff, 1999; Wahle and R\u00fcegsegger, 1999). In addition, the first step of 3\u2032 end formation of pol II-transcribed yeast snRNAs occurs by cleavage (see Allmang et al., 1999a; Zhou et al., 1999; Morlando et al., 2002), although no sequence homologous to the 3\u2032 box is present.We have recently shown that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II plays a crucial role in linking transcription and 3\u2032 end formation of human snRNAs (Medlin et al., 2003), as has been shown for mRNAs. The CTD of mammalian pol II comprises 52 tandem repeats of the heptad YSPTSPS and participates in both transcription of protein-encoding genes and processing of the transcribed RNAs. Phosphorylation of the CTD is also required for efficient activation of capping, splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation (see Prelich, 2002; Proudfoot et al., 2002). In vivo, inhibition of CTD kinases dramatically reduces 3\u2032 box-dependent processing of pre-U2 snRNA, suggesting that the phosphorylated CTD also participates in this process (Medlin et al., 2003). We have therefore proposed that the CTD participates in the promoter dependence of pre-snRNA 3\u2032 end formation and that the phosphorylated CTD interacts with pre-snRNA-specific factor(s) to activate co-transcriptional 3\u2032 box-dependent RNA processing.However, a definitive demonstration that the 3\u2032 box directs RNA cleavage has been difficult to obtain. The low level of in vitro transcription obtained from pol II-dependent snRNA gene promoters has hampered studies using the coupled transcription/3\u2032 end formation system described by Gunderson et al. (1990) and no uncoupled 3\u2032 end formation system has been hitherto reported.We therefore undertook to develop a tractable in vitro system to investigate the function of the 3\u2032 box. After testing a wide range of conditions, we obtained accurate in vitro 3\u2032 end formation of synthetic RNA substrates containing the 3\u2032 box of the human U1 or U2 snRNA genes. Thus, the 3\u2032 box can direct RNA cleavage in the absence of transcription and is therefore a bona fide RNA processing element. Following partial purification of the processing activity, we can show that the phosphorylated form of the pol II CTD activates 3\u2032 box-dependent cleavage of the RNA in vitro. Furthermore, we find that sequences upstream from the 3\u2032 box in the U2 snRNA gene are required for accurate and efficient 3\u2032 end processing in vivo and in vitro. ResultsSynthetic RNAs containing the U1 3\u2032 box are correctly processed in vitroTo analyse the molecular mechanism of 3\u2032 end formation of snRNA precursors, we attempted to reproduce the in vivo event in vitro. Since our previous work suggests that the 3\u2032 box is likely to be an RNA processing element (Cuello et al., 1999; Medlin et al., 2003), we undertook to set up an in vitro system where no ongoing transcription occurs, using a synthetic RNA containing a 3\u2032 box as a substrate. Accordingly, we tested a range of synthetic RNAs, techniques for production of cell extract, incubation conditions and methods to analyse the products.The 3\u2032 box is sufficient to form the 3\u2032 end of pre-snRNA (Hernandez, 1985; Yuo et al., 1985) and is generally considered to be the major element directing this process. However, the 3\u2032 box tolerates some mutations or deletions with little or no effect on accuracy and efficiency of 3\u2032 end formation (Ach and Weiner, 1987), and even complete deletion of the 3\u2032 box does not always abolish 3\u2032 end formation when other endogenous snRNA gene sequences are present (Hernandez, 1985; Yuo et al., 1985; Cuello et al., 1999; Medlin et al., 2003). These observations indicate that other sequence(s) within snRNA genes can also direct 3\u2032 end formation of pre-snRNAs, albeit at a lower level. We therefore tested substrate RNAs where the U1 3\u2032 box follows a 152\u00a0base pair (bp) non-snRNA sequence. These were produced from modified versions of the G-less cassette-containing plasmids already described by Gunderson et al. (1990), in which the 3\u2032 box is the only snRNA gene sequence downstream of the promoter. In order to avoid a sharp transition to G-containing sequence just at the 3\u2032 box, we have added a few G residues to the sequence upstream (see Materials and methods). Transcription is directed by a modified human U1 promoter in vivo and by the SP6 promoter in vitro (Figure \u200b(Figure1A1A and B; U1 3\u2032 box) and correctly processed RNA encoded by these templates will be approximately the same size as pre-U1 RNA. Any RNA subject to 3\u2032 box-directed processing should not be further 3\u2032 end modified, since the required signals are not present (see Huang et al., 1997). To test whether the 3\u2032 box is functional in this context in vivo, we transfected the template with the U1 promoter into HeLa cells and analysed the products by RNase protection (Figure \u200b(Figure1A).1A). A major band mapping close to the expected size of processed RNA (see Hernandez, 1985; Patton and Wieben, 1987) represents \u223c80% of detected RNA (Figure \u200b(Figure1A,1A, lane 1, and C). The remainder corresponds to non-processed, readthrough RNA. Similar percentages of proper 3\u2032 end formation occur when the U1 3\u2032 box flanks either histone or globin gene-derived sequences of similar sizes (Ramamurthy et al., 1996). When the 3\u2032 box is absent, only readthrough RNA is detected (Figure \u200b(Figure1A,1A, lane 2). Importantly, transcription is abolished when the essential PSE element in the promoter is mutated (Figure \u200b(Figure1A,1A, lane 3). Thus, in this context the 3\u2032 box is necessary and sufficient for proper 3\u2032 end formation of RNA and similar synthetic RNAs are therefore legitimate substrates for in vitro processing reactions.Open in a separate windowFig. 1. Synthetic RNAs containing the U1 3\u2032 box are correctly processed in vitro.

The relative positions of the riboprobes and the sizes of the processed or readthrough products are noted under the scheme of each construct. The same riboprobe was used for RNase protection of U1 3\u2032 box RNA and P\u2013 RNA.

The RNA used and incubation with S100 is noted above the lanes. In lanes 2, 5, 7, 9 and 11, RNA was incubated in processing buffer with S100 replaced by buffer D.

The relative positions of the S1 probes and the sizes of the input or processed RNA are noted under the scheme of each construct. The in vivo synthesized U1 3\u2032 box RNA (lane 4) was the same RNA used in lane 1 in (A). The diagram on the left side of this and subsequent figures indicates the position of the 3\u2032 box in the input RNA. A G + A DNA ladder (lane 1) was produced from the S1 probe used to analyse U1 3\u2032 box RNA. For the asterisk, see the text. (C)\u00a0Diagram of 3\u2032 processing sites determined by analysis of in vitro (arrows above the sequence) or in vivo (arrows below the sequence) processed RNA in the presence or absence of the U1 3\u2032 box, with mut U1 3\u2032 box or with U1 3\u2032 box + G18 RNA. The size of the arrow is proportional to the quantity of the detected product. Shadowed letters represent the positions of the 3\u2032 end of human pre-U1 snRNAs produced in vivo (Hernandez, 1985; Patton and Wieben, 1987).It proved difficult to readily identify any properly processed RNA products after direct incubation of radiolabelled in vitro synthesized RNA with cell extracts, due to the appearance of a complex ladder of \u2018breakdown\u2019 products (data not shown). However, S1 mapping with a 3\u2032 labelled probe complementary to the synthetic RNA from 69\u00a0nt upstream to 13\u00a0nt downstream of the 3\u2032 box sequence (Figure \u200b(Figure1B)1B) gives a simpler picture, and generates relatively short products, allowing accurate mapping of the 3\u2032 end of the RNA. A range of extract preparation protocols (as described by Dignam et al., 1983; Shapiro et al., 1988; Dominski et al., 1995; or modifications of these) and incubation conditions, were tested. 3\u2032 box-dependent processing was finally detected after incubating RNA substrates with a HeLa cell S100 fraction produced by the protocol of Shapiro et al. (1988), in conditions similar to those used for 3\u2032 cleavage/polyadenylation of pre-mRNA in vitro (Moore and Sharp, 1985; Bienroth et al., 1993) (see Materials and methods). Some of the products detected after incubation of U1 3\u2032 box RNA with this S100 fraction end 3\u20135\u00a0nt upstream of the 3\u2032 box sequence (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lane 3, and C). These products are not detected when the RNA is incubated with buffer (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lanes 2 and 5) or when the 3\u2032 box is absent (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lane 6). Furthermore, the amount of these products is severely reduced when two mutations known to affect the function of the 3\u2032 box in vivo (Ach and Weiner, 1987) are introduced (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lanes 7 and 8, and C; mut U1 3\u2032 box).S1 analysis of U1 3\u2032 box RNA extracted from HeLa cells (Figure \u200b(Figure1A,1A, lane 1) maps the 3\u2032 ends produced in vivo to the same positions as these in vitro-produced RNAs: 3\u20135\u00a0nt upstream of the 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, compare lanes 3 and 4, and C). Importantly, the 3\u2032 ends of these \u2018correctly\u2019 processed RNAs map within the range of distance upstream of the 3\u2032 box observed for endogenous pre-U1 snRNA 3\u2032 ends (Hernandez, 1985; Patton and Wieben, 1987) (Figure \u200b(Figure11C).In order to address whether the longer products, detected only in vitro (e.g. Figure \u200bFigure1B,1B, lane 3), correspond to intermediates of the final 3\u2032 processed RNA or to non-specific degradation products from an unrelated activity, we tested the effect of adding a row of 18 G residues downstream of the 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lanes 11 and 12, and C; U1 3\u2032 box + G18). This increases the distance from the 3\u2032 box to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA and long stretches of G residues have been shown to impede exoribonucleases (Wang and Kiledjian, 2002). The majority of upstream cleavage sites are also detected in the absence of the 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, compare lanes 3 and 6, and C) and are shifted upstream of the stretch of G residues (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, compare lanes 10 and 12, and C), supporting the notion that they are the result of contaminating exonuclease activity. However, the product of the expected size is unaffected, suggesting that this is produced by an endonucleolytic event. The relatively strong bands mapping to the 5\u2032 edge of the 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lane 3, marked by an asterisk) are also unaffected (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, compare lanes 10 and 12) and could therefore be processing intermediates, although a smaller amount of the same bands is detected when U1 3\u2032 box RNA is incubated only with buffer (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lanes 2, 9 and 11). Intriguingly, only a few cleavage products map within the 3\u2032 box itself, giving the appearance of a \u2018footprint\u2019 (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lane 3, and C).These data show clearly that the 3\u2032 box can independently direct accurate 3\u2032 end RNA processing in vitro using cell extracts, indicating that it is a bona fide processing element. However, proper processing is relatively inefficient in vitro: in the experiment shown (Figure \u200b(Figure1B)1B) only 7% of the total input RNA has the same 3\u2032 ends as produced in vivo after incubation for 13\u00a0h (Figure \u200b(Figure1B,1B, lane 3). The 3\u2032 box itself appears to be refractory to cleavage, perhaps due to an unusual structure and/or protection by some of the proteins required for the processing reaction.3\u2032 box-dependent processing requires a divalent cationTo improve the efficiency of 3\u2032 box-dependent processing in vitro, we investigated the requirement for divalent cations (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). The efficiency of processing of U1 3\u2032 box RNA is similar in buffer containing Mn2+ or Mg2+ (lanes 2 and 3), but is inefficient in the presence of Zn2+, Ca2+ or EDTA (lanes 4\u20136). Interestingly, production of the larger digestion products mapping to the 5\u2032 end of the 3\u2032 box is less dependent on divalent cations. Optimum activity is observed in the presence of 3\u00a0mM Mn2+ and increasing the concentration of Mn2+ further does not improve activity (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B). No products of the expected size are produced in the absence of the 3\u2032 box, whatever the ion (Mn2+ or Mg2+) and concentration used (Figure \u200b(Figure22C).Open in a separate windowFig. 2. 3\u2032 box-dependent processing requires a divalent cation. (A)\u00a0S1 nuclease analysis of U1 3\u2032 box RNA incubated with S100 and different cations (lanes 2\u20135, 2\u00a0mM final concentration) or EDTA (lane 6, 5\u00a0mM final concentration), as noted above each lane. (B)\u00a0S1 nuclease analysis of U1 3\u2032 box RNA incubated with S100 in the presence of the concentration of Mn2+ (lanes 2\u20136) and Mg2+ (lanes 7\u201310) indicated in mM above each lane. The graph below represents the relative processing activity obtained in the presence of these concentrations of Mn2+ and Mg2+. The relative average activity of three independent experiments and standard deviation is calculated as a percentage of the processing activity obtained with 3\u00a0mM MnCl2 (maximum observed processing activity). (C)\u00a0S1 nuclease analysis of \u03943\u2032 box RNA incubated with S100 in the presence of the concentration of Mn2+ (lanes 2\u20136) and Mg2+ (lanes 7\u201310) indicated in mM above each lane. The hypothetical position of processed RNA (proc. position) is marked on the right.Divalent cations may be required for binding of factor(s) to RNA and/or as a catalytic co-factor (see Schoenberg and Cunningham, 1999). Importantly, the products mapping to the 5\u2032 end of the 3\u2032 box have a different requirement for divalent cations and processing must therefore occur in at least two distinct steps if these are precursors to the final, properly processed RNA.Partial purification of the 3\u2032 box-dependent processing activityTo achieve a higher level of 3\u2032 box-dependent processing, we attempted to purify and concentrate the factors responsible. The processing activity does not bind to either Heparin\u2013 or Q\u2013Sepharose at 0.1\u00a0M KCl but binds efficiently to SP\u2013Sepharose at this salt concentration and elutes between 0.3 and 0.4\u00a0M KCl. Active S100 was sequentially applied to Heparin\u2013, Q\u2013 and SP\u2013Sepharose, and SP-bound proteins eluted with steps of increasing KCl concentration (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). This procedure results in an \u223c600-fold purification of the processing activity (Table \u200b(TableII).Open in a separate windowFig. 3.

B-heparin (lane 2) and B-Q (lane 3) represent the proteins binding to heparin\u2013 and Q\u2013Sepharose, respectively.

The maximum was also increased by \u223c2-fold (Figure \u200b(Figure3B),3B), indicating that partial purification both increases the amount of processed RNA detected and speeds up the reaction. However, it appears that processed RNA is progressively degraded (possibly by exonucleases) after 2\u00a0h (Figure \u200b(Figure3B,3B, lanes 1\u20138). Thus, the amount of processed RNA detected results from a kinetic balance between the 3\u2032 processing activity and degradation. This degradation might result from, for example, 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exoribonuclease activity of the human exosome subcomplex present in HeLa cell S100 (Allmang et al., 1999b).In order to determine whether any known RNA cleavage factors are involved in 3\u2032 end formation of pre-snRNAs, we carried out western blot analysis on the various fractions with antibodies to subunits of several pre-mRNA cleavage/polyadenylation factors (Figure \u200b(Figure1C).1C). We also assayed the fractions for enrichment of hRNase III (Wu et al., 2000) and PM-Scl100 (Allmang et al., 1999b), since these are homologues of yeast RNAse III (Rnt1p and Pac1p) and Rrpb6p, respectively, that have been shown to participate in 3\u2032 processing of yeast pre-snRNAs, rRNAs or snoRNAs (see Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2001; Butler, 2002; Conrad and Rauhut, 2002) (Figure \u200b(Figure1C).1C). None of these factors is enriched in the most active SP 0.4\u00a0M KCl fraction, suggesting that one or more novel factors are required for 3\u2032 box-dependent processing.Our results demonstrate that it is possible to increase accurate processing by partial purification and suggest any overlap in the factors used for 3\u2032 end formation of vertebrate pre-snRNAs and those of vertebrate pre-mRNAs or of yeast pre-snRNAs is limited. The \u2018footprint\u2019 over the 3\u2032 box is still apparent after purification, suggesting that 3\u2032 box-binding proteins co-purify with the processing activity. Further characterization of the 3\u2032 processing activity was undertaken using the more efficient, partially purified fraction.The CTD of pol II activates 3\u2032 box-dependent processing of pre-snRNAs in vitroUsing the polymerase complementation system set up by Gerber et al. (1995) we have shown that the CTD of pol II is required for the function of the U2 3\u2032 box. In addition, treatment of cells with CTD kinase inhibitors prevents proper U2 snRNA 3\u2032 end formation. Accordingly, we suggested that phospho-CTD participates in pre-snRNA 3\u2032 end processing (Medlin et al., 2003). We have therefore investigated the role of the CTD and its phosphorylation status in the U1 3\u2032 box-dependent processing in vitro.First, we tested whether the CTD kinase inhibitor 8-(methylthio)-4,5-dihydrothieno[3\u2032,4\u2032:5,6]benzoisoxazole-6-carboxamide (KM05283) inhibits 3\u2032 end formation of transcripts from templates containing the U1 3\u2032 box, as we found for the U2 3\u2032 box (Medlin et al., 2003). HeLa cells transfected with the U1 3\u2032 box construct were treated for 4\u00a0h with KM05283 and the RNA was analysed by RNase protection (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). Treatment causes an increase in readthrough from 25% in the untreated cells to 65% in the treated cells (Figure \u200b(Figure4A,4A, lanes 1 and 2) indicating that 3\u2032 box function is inhibited. We also carried out western blot analysis on the active processing extracts with an antibody recognizing the N-terminus of the large subunit of pol II (Figure \u200b(Figure4B).4B). Both the IIo (hyperphosphorylated) and IIa (hypophosphorylated) isoforms of pol II are detected in the HeLa cell S100 fraction with a major proportion of pol IIa (Figure \u200b(Figure4B,4B, lane 1). The pol II present in the S100 does not bind readily to any of the resins used (Figure \u200b(Figure4B,4B, lanes 2\u20134), although a small amount of pol IIa is detected in the 0.3\u00a0M KCl SP\u2013Sepharose eluted fraction (Figure \u200b(Figure4B,4B, lane 5). Neither pol IIo or pol IIa is detected in the fractions eluted with 0.4 and 1\u00a0M KCl (Figure \u200b(Figure4B,4B, lanes 6 and 7).Open in a separate windowFig. 4.

The gel was loaded as described in Figure \u200bFigure3C.3C. (C)\u00a0GST\u2013CTD phosphorylated by incubation with S100. GST\u2013CTD (lane 1) was incubated for 4\u00a0h with S100 (lane 2). The size of protein markers is indicated in kDa on the left. (D)\u00a0S1 nuclease analysis of U1 3\u2032 box RNA incubated with the SP 0.4\u00a0M KCl fraction with addition of 10\u00a0ng of GST\u2013CTD (lane 2), GST\u2013CTDP (lane 3) or GST alone (lane 4).To determine the effect of the CTD on processing, GST\u2013CTD (with the CTD unphosphorylated or phosphorylated) was added to the in vitro processing reaction. We have used a fusion protein containing 29 heptapeptide repeats, since we have shown that 25 repeats is sufficient to allow a high level of processing in vivo (Medlin et al., 2003). Figure \u200bFigure4C4C shows a protein gel of the GST\u2013CTD before (lane 1) or after (lane 2) incubation with S100 to allow complete phosphorylation (see Materials and methods). To maximize the potential effect of the CTD on 3\u2032 processing activity we added one-quarter of the normal processing activity and incubated for only 1\u00a0h. Addition of non-phosphorylated CTD increases processing by \u223c2-fold (Figure \u200b(Figure4D,4D, compare lanes 2 and 4) and phospho-CTD by \u223c4-fold (Figure \u200b(Figure4D,4D, lane 3). These results indicate that the CTD activates processing and it is more efficient when phosphorylated, as was observed for pre-mRNA 3\u2032 cleavage in vitro (Hirose and Manley, 1998). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some phosphorylation of the CTD occurs during incubation. Addition of either form of CTD had no effect on the efficiency of processing using either S100 or the SP 0.3\u00a0M KCl fraction (data not shown), probably due to the presence of a saturating amount of pol II in these fractions. Addition of the CTD also activates production of the larger products, which may indicate that the activity of the \u2018contaminating\u2019 exonucleases is coupled to transcription by pol II in vivo. However, differential activation by phospho-CTD is specific for the reaction producing properly processed RNA (Figure \u200b(Figure4D,4D, compare lanes 2 and 3).Taken together, our data indicate that the CTD activates 3\u2032 box-dependent processing in vitro and this activity is further enhanced when the CTD is phosphorylated. This is consistent with our in vivo data showing that the CTD is involved in the 3\u2032 processing of pre-U2 snRNA and strongly supports our proposal that CTD kinase inhibitors affect pre-snRNA 3\u2032 end formation through inhibition of CTD phosphorylation (Medlin et al., 2003; Figure \u200bFigure44A).The activity of the U2 3\u2032 box is influenced by an upstream sequence in vivo and in vitroThe 3\u2032 boxes of the U1 and U2 genes are similar but not identical. In order to test whether these are interchangeable, we have replaced the U1 3\u2032 box with the U2 3\u2032 box in the U1 3\u2032 box template and tested processing in vivo and in vitro (Figure \u200b(Figure5).5). As noted above, accurate 3\u2032 end formation still occurs in some U2 gene constructs in the absence of the 3\u2032 box (Hernandez, 1985; Yuo et al., 1985; Cuello et al., 1999; Medlin et al., 2003), implicating other gene sequences in this process. In the U2/Globin construct used by Medlin et al. (2003), most of the RNA encoding sequences is replaced by \u03b2-globin gene sequences. However, a readily detectable amount of RNA with a proper 3\u2032 end is still produced in the absence of the 3\u2032 box (26% of the amount produced in the presence of the 3\u2032 box). This construct contains 53\u00a0bp of U2 gene sequence immediately upstream from the 3\u2032 box and we have tested this sequence (designated USE) alone or in conjunction with the U2 3\u2032 box for the ability to direct accurate processing in vivo and in vitro (USE and USE + U2 3\u2032 box, respectively; Figure \u200bFigure5).5). The U2 3\u2032 box, USE and USE + U2 3\u2032 box templates were transfected into HeLa cells and the RNA mapped by RNase protection (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). The U2 3\u2032 box alone directs 3\u2032 end formation at the same positions as the U1 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure5A,5A, compare lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the differences between them do not affect the position of processing sites. However, the 3\u2032 ends of endogenous pre-U2 snRNA map a few nts further upstream of the 3\u2032 box (Yuo et al., 1985; Figure \u200bFigure5C).5C). The 3\u2032 box and USE together direct 3\u2032 end formation to sites overlapping those mapped for endogenous pre-U2 snRNA (Yuo et al., 1985; Figure \u200bFigure5A,5A, lane 4, and C). 3\u2032 end formation is relatively inefficient in the presence of the USE alone, but occurs at the same site as in conjunction with U2 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure5A,5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that the signal for 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U2 snRNA is bipartite, with the USE acting as a positioning element.Open in a separate windowFig. 5. The activity of the U2 3\u2032 box is influenced by an upstream sequence element in vivo and in vitro. (A)\u00a0RNase protection of RNA from HeLa cells transfected with constructs containing either the U1 or U2 3\u2032 box, the U2 3\u2032 box and the USE or the USE. The positions of readthrough (RT), processed RNA (proc.; closed arrow for the 3\u2032 box-dependent processing site and open arrow for the USE-dependent processing site) and VAI transcripts (VAI) are indicated on the right.

The arrows at the right indicate the positions of processed products as described in (A). The relative positions of the S1 probes and the sizes of the input or processed RNA are noted under the scheme of each construct.

The size of the arrow is proportional to the quantity of the detected product. Shadowed letters represent the positions of the 3\u2032 end of human pre-U2 snRNAs produced in vivo (Yuo et al., 1985). (D)\u00a0Computer-putative secondary structure of the USE predicted by mfold v. 3.1 (Mathews et al., 1999) with a \u0394G of \u201315\u00a0kcal. The U2 3\u2032 box position is indicated by a dashed box. The long arrows above the sequence represent nts included in the stem\u2013loop IV of mature U2 snRNA (Reddy et al., 1981) and the 3\u2032 terminal minihelix is in grey (Mougin et al., 2002). The processing sites observed in vivo and in vitro in the presence of the USE are indicated by short arrows.For in vitro analysis, synthetic RNA produced from these constructs was incubated with the SP 0.4\u00a0M KCl fraction and analysed by S1 mapping (Figure \u200b(Figure5B).5B). Approximately the same amount of U2 3\u2032 box RNA is processed as U1 3\u2032 box RNA (10% of the total input RNA) and a similar pattern of products is generated, apart from an extra cleavage within the U2 3\u2032 box (Figure \u200b(Figure5B,5B, compare lanes 1 and 3, and C). The shortest U2 3\u2032 box-specific products map 3\u20135\u00a0nt upstream of the 3\u2032 box and do not correspond to the expected 3\u2032 ends for pre-U2 snRNA (Yuo et al., 1985; Figure \u200bFigure5C).5C). In contrast, RNA containing both the USE and the U2 3\u2032 box is very efficiently processed in vitro (68% of the total input RNA) to products with the same 3\u2032 ends produced in vivo and as mapped for endogenous pre-U2 snRNA (Figure \u200b(Figure5B,5B, compare lanes 5 and 6, and C). The same 3\u2032 ends are produced when the USE is present although processing is less efficient (12% of the total input RNA) (Figure \u200b(Figure5B,5B, lane 8, and C) indicating that the two elements work synergically in vitro.The USE contains the 3\u2032 half of stem\u2013loop IV of U2 snRNA (Reddy et al., 1981), which has already been implicated in 3\u2032 end formation of precursors. Indeed, deletion of this region affects 3\u2032 end formation of human U2 snRNA precursors synthesized in Xenopus oocytes (Yuo et al., 1985). The USE also contains the 3\u2032 terminal minihelix recently identified in the pre-U2 snRNA structure and suggested to play a role in 3\u2032 end formation of pre-U2 snRNA (Mougin et al., 2002). Interestingly, a computer-putative secondary structure of the USE contains the minihelix with the processing sites located within an unpaired bulge (Figure \u200b(Figure55D).These results show that it is possible to obtain very efficient and accurate 3\u2032 box-dependent RNA processing in vitro using a partially purified processing activity, but only when the U2 USE is present upstream of the U2 3\u2032 box. Furthermore, the secondary structure of the USE may be critical to ensure the accuracy and/or efficiency of cleavage. DiscussionThe 3\u2032 end of vertebrate snRNAs is produced in several distinct steps. First, a precursor with a 3\u2032 extension of up to 20\u00a0nt is produced and this is a specific substrate for exonucleolytic trimming to generate the mature 3\u2032 end (see Huang et al., 1997). The 3\u2032 box, first described as a conserved element by Mattaj and Zeller (1983), plays a key role in production of the precursor (Hernandez, 1985; Yuo et al., 1985). However, it has been difficult to determine whether the 3\u2032 box directs production of the precursor by transcription termination or RNA processing. Our demonstration here that the 3\u2032 box of either the U1 or U2 gene can direct 3\u2032 end processing of a non-snRNA-derived RNA in vitro indicates that this element is a bona fide RNA processing element that can function autonomously. Thus, the primary 3\u2032 ends of all vertebrate RNAs synthesized by pol II are produced by RNA processing directed by a cis-acting element(s) rather than by termination.Why was 3\u2032 box-dependent processing difficult to detect in vitro?The type of template used, the method of extract production and the incubation conditions all proved critical to detection of the processing activity. For example, in our initial experiments, substrate RNAs containing mainly wild-type snRNA sequences were rapidly degraded (data not shown). This might explain why this is the first demonstration of 3\u2032 box-dependent processing in vitro. Although the U1 3\u2032 box-dependent processing is accurate, the reaction is relatively inefficient in unpurified extract, requiring long incubation times. Thus, processing factors may not be effectively extracted from the cells and/or may be very labile. Alternatively, inhibitors and/or non-specific nucleases may interfere with the reaction. Relevant to this, we find that the processed RNA is turned over relatively rapidly even after the processing activity is partially purified (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). It is therefore possible that the RNA substrate containing relatively few G residues is more resistant to turnover than others we tried. Processing may also be inefficient because it is uncoupled from transcription. Coupling of processing and transcription appears to be obligatory in vivo since RNA containing the 3\u2032 box is not processed when injected into oocytes (Ciliberto et al., 1986) and readthrough RNAs are not processed to the mature form when transcription is blocked (Lobo and Marzluff, 1987). In addition, efficient recognition of the 3\u2032 box is dependent on initiation of transcription from an snRNA promoter (Hernandez and Weiner, 1986; Neuman de Vegvar et al., 1986), and the CTD of pol II is required (Medlin et al., 2003). In accordance with this, we find that the CTD activates 3\u2032 end formation in vitro. Moreover, phosphorylation of the CTD is required for full activation, supporting our proposal that kinase inhibitors (e.g. DRB and KM05283) exert their effect on 3\u2032 processing through inhibition of CTD phosphorylation (Medlin et al., 2003). Thus, the phospho-CTD is likely to play a key role in coupling initiation with processing and may interact specifically with processing factor(s).Both in vivo and in vitro, the U2 3\u2032 box directs 3\u2032 end formation a few nucleotides closer to the 3\u2032 box than observed for endogenous pre-U2 snRNA. In contrast, the U2 USE alone directs production of 3\u2032 ends mapping at the expected sites. Together, these elements act synergically to constitute a strong processing signal directing in vitro 3\u2032 end formation at the same sites seen in the endogenous U2 snRNA gene transcripts. The USE appears to help position cleavage and/or stabilize processed RNA both in HeLa cells and in vitro, and the secondary structure of this element may be functionally important. No sequence similar to the U2 USE is present in the U1 gene and the U1 3\u2032 box alone is sufficient for accurate processing. In addition, very little properly processed RNA is detected from U1 templates when the 3\u2032 box is deleted (Hernandez, 1985) suggesting that a USE-like sequence is not present in the U1 gene.3\u2032 processing of vertebrate pol II transcripts: variations on a theme?We favour the notion, supported by the results presented in Figure \u200bFigure1B,1B, that pre-snRNA 3\u2032 ends are produced by a 3\u2032 box-dependent endonuclease, in analogy to pre-mRNA 3\u2032 processing. We failed to detect a 3\u2032 cleavage product after incubation of radiolabelled USE + U2 3\u2032 box RNA with the active SP 0.4\u00a0M KCl processing fraction although the correctly processed 5\u2032 product is readily detected (unpublished observations). However, this may be due to rapid degradation of the uncapped 3\u2032 cleavage product. The structure of the bipartite processing element of the U2 gene, with the USE upstream and the 3\u2032 box downstream of the cleavage site, is reminiscent of the 3\u2032 end processing signals found in mRNA genes. The cleavage/polyadenylation factors CstF and CPSF individually interact weakly with processing signals on either side of the cleavage site but these interactions increase when both factors are present (see Wahle and R\u00fcegsegger, 1999; Proudfoot et al., 2002). In addition, both factors may be required to define the cleavage site. Similarly, in formation of the 3\u2032 end of histone mRNA, SLBP interacts with the stem\u2013loop structure upstream of the cleavage site to stabilize association of U7 snRNP with the purine-rich downstream element to allow accurate and efficient processing (see Dominski and Marzluff, 1999). The USE and U2 3\u2032 box may both be contacted directly by processing factors in a similar fashion to ensure accurate and efficient processing of snRNA gene transcripts, and the \u2018footprint\u2019 over the 3\u2032 box may be due to protection from digestion by an interacting protein(s).Interestingly, in common with our in vitro processing activity, the yeast RNase III homologues (Pac1p and Rnt1p) require divalent cations for activity (Rotondo and Frendewey, 1996; Lamontagne and Elela, 2001), while 3\u2032 end cleavage of pre-mRNAs does not (Moore and Sharp, 1985; Gick et al., 1986). However, Rnt1p recognizes specific stem\u2013loop structure within the 3\u2032 extension of yeast pre-snRNAs (see Conrad and Rauhut, 2002) and the 3\u2032 box or USE sequences do not correspond to any known RNase III target sequences. In addition, neither the human RNase III homologue (hRNase III; Wu et al., 2000) nor the human Rrpb6p homologue (PM-Scl100; Allmang et al., 1999b) is enriched in our most active SP 0.4\u00a0M KCl processing fraction, arguing against a common mechanism for formation of the 3\u2032 ends of human and yeast pre-snRNAs. We also failed to find evidence for a significant overlap of human pre-mRNAs cleavage/polyadenylation and pre-snRNAs processing factors.Connecting transcription and 3\u2032 processing ofpre-snRNAsThis demonstration that the 3\u2032 ends of pre-snRNAs are produced by 3\u2032 box-dependent RNA processing that is activated by phospho-CTD supports our earlier model for the link between transcription and 3\u2032 end formation (summarized in Figure \u200bFigure6).6). The promoters of pol II-transcribed snRNA genes are characterized by a PSE sequence recognized by the snRNA gene-specific factor PTF/PBP/SNAPc (see Hernandez, 2001). It is therefore possible that promoter-specific processing involves interactions, direct or indirect, between PTF and a processing factor(s) at initiation. Subsequent phosphorylation of the CTD could allow the processing factors to interact instead with the transcribing RNA polymerase, facilitating their delivery to newly synthesized RNA containing the 3\u2032 box. In addition, our in vitro experiments indicate that phospho-CTD acts as a processing co-factor to promote the functional association between factors and RNA and/or activate directly the cleavage. Thus, initiation of transcription and 3\u2032 end processing are coupled through the CTD in pre-snRNA as in pre-mRNA genes, but involve different cis-acting elements and trans-acting processing factor. Additional elements upstream of the 3\u2032 box may ensure the accuracy of the cleavage reaction by interacting with the 3\u2032 end-processing machinery.Open in a separate windowFig. 6. How promoter-dependent association of processing factor(s) with the phosphorylated CTD might activate 3\u2032 box-dependent RNA processing. (1) A snRNA-specific 3\u2032 processing factor(s) interacts with snRNA gene promoter-specific factors (e.g. PTF) before recruitment of pol II. (2) The processing factor(s) associate with the CTD after phosphorylation (by e.g. CDK7) and travel with the polymerase until transcription of the 3\u2032 box. (3) Factors are downloaded to interact with the RNA and to promote cleavage upstream of the 3\u2032 box. (4) In U2 snRNA gene transcripts, the additional USE adopts a secondary structure that allows interaction with factor(s) to reposition the cleavage site and/or stabilize the cleavage product. Materials and methodsDNA constructsThe U1 3\u2032 box construct containing a modified human U1 promoter was prepared by PCR from the pSG611 construct (Gunderson et al., 1990), which corresponds to human U1 promoter fused to a G-less cassette. In the U1 3\u2032 box template, the DSE sequence is replaced by an inverted repeat of ATTTGCAT 23\u00a0bp upstream of the PSE, the five Cs located between +184 and +188 are replaced by six Cs, the A at +182 and the G at +189 are replaced by a T and A respectively, bases +171, +174, +180 and +183 were replaced by Gs and the sequence between +86 to +131 is replaced by CCTT. The final construct was cloned into pUC19 using the EcoRI and HindIII sites. In the \u03943\u2032 box template (Figure \u200b(Figure1A)1A) the sequence corresponding to the U1 3\u2032 box-GTTTCAAAAGTAGA is deleted. The P\u2013 construct (Figure \u200b(Figure1A)1A) was constructed in the same way as the U1 3\u2032 box construct using pSGCCTT (Gunderson et al., 1990) as the PCR template. In the mut U1 3\u2032 box template, the 3\u2032 box is mutated in GTTTCAAAAGTCGG and in the U1 3\u2032 box + G18 template, 18 G residues were introduced downstream of the 3\u2032 box. The U2 3\u2032 box construct (Figure \u200b(Figure5A)5A) was prepared from the U1 3\u2032 box construct by PCR to replace the U1 3\u2032 box sequence with the U2 3\u2032 box-GTTTCCTAAAAGTAGA. In the USE + U2 3\u2032 box and USE constructs, 59\u00a0bp of the U2 3\u2032 box or \u03943\u2032 box templates are replaced by the 53\u00a0bp upstream the 3\u2032 box in the U2 gene and a BamHI site.The EcoRI\u2013HindIII fragments were cloned into pGEM4 to make riboprobes for U1 3\u2032 box, \u03943\u2032 box and U2 3\u2032 box RNA (Figures \u200b(Figures1A1A and \u200band5A).5A). To synthesize riboprobes for USE + U2 3\u2032 box and USE RNA (Figure \u200b(Figure5A),5A), the StuI\u2013HindIII fragments were subcloned into pGEM4. To produce synthetic RNA, the promoter region in the pGEM4 U1 3\u2032 box, \u03943\u2032 box, mut U1 3\u2032 box, U1 3\u2032 box+G18, U2 3\u2032 box, USE + U2 3\u2032 box and USE constructs was deleted using the EcoRI site in the vector and the BglII site 7\u00a0bp upstream from the U1 transcription start site.In vitro RNA synthesis and in vitro processingCapped RNA used as substrate for the in vitro processing reaction was synthesized from the HindIII-linearized DNA templates by SP6 in the presence of a 7-methyl-G cap analogue (Amersham). After synthesis, RNA substrates were purified from a 6% polyacrylamide\u20138\u00a0M urea gel, phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated.HeLa cell S100 extract was prepared according to Shapiro et al. (1988), dialysed overnight against 20\u00a0vol. of buffer D (Dignam et al., 1983), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C in small aliquots. Processing reactions were usually carried out with 0.1\u00a0pmol RNA in 25\u00a0\u00b5l containing 50% of HeLa cell S100 or purified fraction with a final concentration of 10\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7.9, 50\u00a0mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 20\u00a0mM creatine phosphate, 3\u00a0mM MnCl2, 2.5% PVA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 1\u00a0mM ATP and 20\u00a0ng/\u00b5l tRNA. Reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 13\u00a0h (Figures \u200b(Figures1B1B and \u200band2),2), 7\u00a0h (Figure \u200b(Figure3A)3A) or 2\u00a0h (Figure \u200b(Figure5B),5B), and stopped by adding 125\u00a0\u00b5l of stop solution (0.5% SDS, 0.3\u00a0M NaOAc, 50\u00a0\u00b5g tRNA, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). RNA was extracted twice by phenol/chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. RNA was then annealed overnight at 47\u00b0C to the S1 probe and S1-digested at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. The products were analysed on 6% polyacrylamide\u20138\u00a0M urea gel and signals were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The amount of processed product is expressed as a percentage of the total input RNA. To prepare S1 probes (Figures \u200b(Figures1B1B and \u200band5B),5B), an EarI\u2013PvuII fragment of each construct in pGEM4 was 3\u2032 end-filled with radiolabelled [\u03b1-32P]dGTP and purified on a 6% polyacrylamide\u20138\u00a0M urea gel.For the purification shown in Table \u200bTableI,I, 9.5\u00a0mg of HeLa cell S100 was loaded onto 0.5\u00a0ml Heparin\u2013Sepharose resin at 0.1\u00a0M KCl. The unbound fraction was loaded onto 0.3\u00a0ml Q\u2013Sepharose resin and the unbound fraction from this step was loaded onto 0.3\u00a0ml SP\u2013Sepharose resin. The bound proteins were step-eluted with 0.2\u20131\u00a0M KCl (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). Proteins bound to Heparin\u2013 and Q\u2013Sepharose were eluted with 1\u00a0M KCl. The processing activity was quantitated as above after S1 analysis of U1 3\u2032 box RNA incubated with S100 or purified fractions and the protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay.Transfections and steady state RNA analysisTransfections of HeLa cells and subsequent RNA extractions were carried out as described previously (Medlin et al., 2003). Steady state RNA was analysed by RNase protection as outlined in Cuello et al. (1999). Riboprobes were made by T7 after digestion with StuI that cuts 39\u00a0bp upstream from the start of the U1 3\u2032 box, \u03943\u2032 box and U2 3\u2032 box inserts or with EcoRI that cuts 76\u00a0bp upstream of the USE and USE + U2 3\u2032 box inserts.For the experiment shown in Figure \u200bFigure4A,4A, HeLa cells were treated for 4\u00a0h with 100\u00a0\u00b5M of the kinase inhibitor KM05283 before harvesting cells as described by Medlin et al. (2003).Production and phosphorylation of GST\u2013CTDThe construct encoding 29 heptapeptide repeats fused to GST was a kind gift from Sasha Akoulitchev. The GST\u2013CTD fusion protein was expressed as described by McCracken et al. (1997). In vitro phosphorylation of GST\u2013CTD was performed as previously described (Hirose and Manley, 1998) with modifications: 100\u00a0\u00b5l of S100 fraction was incubated with 2\u00a0\u00b5g of GST\u2013CTD for 4\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C in processing buffer.Western blottingWestern blotting (Figure \u200b(Figure4B)4B) was carried out as outlined by Medlin et al. (2003). Anti-CPSF 73, -CPSF 30, -CFI 68 and -CFI 25 were kindly provided by Professor Walter Keller and were used as indicated by de Vries et al. (2000). Anti-PM-Scl100 (see Allmang et al., 1999b) was a gift of Reinout Raijmakers and Ger Pruijn. Anti-CPSF 160 (Santa Cruz), -CstF 64 (Santa Cruz) and -CstF 50 (ProteinTech Group) were used diluted at 1/500. Anti-SR domain peptide of hRNAse III (Biocarta) was used as described by Wu et al. (2000). AcknowledgementsWe thank Alice Taylor for technical support and Sam Gunderson for the U1/G-less constructs.
