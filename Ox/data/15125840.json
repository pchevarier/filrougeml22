{"title": "Involvement of transcription termination factor 2 in mitotic repression of transcription elongation", "pubDate": "2004", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/s1097-2765(04)00234-5", "PMID": "15125840", "abstract": "All nuclear transcription is interrupted during mitosis. We examined the role of human TTF2, an RNA polymerase (Pol) I and II termination factor, in mitotic repression of transcription elongation. We find that TTF2 levels rise in the cytoplasm in S and G2 and at the onset of mitosis TTF2 translocates into the nucleus. Consistent with a role in termination of all transcription, TTF2 is the only ATP-dependent termination activity associated with Pol II transcription elongation complexes, is largely unaffected by template position, and is impervious to the phosphorylation state of the polymerase. Cells in which TTF2 levels are knocked down showed dramatic retention of Ser2 phosphorylated Pol II on mitotic chromosomes and an increase in chromosome segregation defects.", "author": [{"author": "Yan Jiang", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jiang+Y&cauthor_id=15125840"}, {"author": "Mingyi Liu", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Liu+M&cauthor_id=15125840"}, {"author": "Charlotte A Spencer", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Spencer+CA&cauthor_id=15125840"}, {"author": "David H Price", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Price+DH&cauthor_id=15125840"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["15125840", "32848739", "30901332", "29402919", "28977633", "28760969", "27716820", "26527278", "26204128", "24634214", "23919563", "23699407", "23110726", "22771989", "22701796", "22483619", "22244331", "19705064", "19570979", "19491928", "19409997", "19250187", "19234518", "18832375", "18615590", "17709395", "17606639", "17291483", "16819507", "16738128", "16598041", "15998810"], "body": ""}
