One method for PEEP titration is a PEEP/FiO2 table that prioritizes support for arterial oxygenation.

Future trials should focus on identifying individuals who respond to higher PEEP with recruitment and on clinically important outcomes (e.g., mortality).Keywords: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), mechanical ventilation In their landmark 1967 description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Ashbaugh and colleagues noted the benefit of applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for improving arterial oxygenation in five of their patients (1). Two years later, they reported that continuous positive pressure breathing with PEEP levels of 7\u201310 cm H2O improved arterial oxygenation and reduced pulmonary edema in 14 patients with ARDS (2). Early clinical practices were guided by this and other case reports in which PEEP was used to improve arterial oxygenation and reduce FiO2. However, intensive care physicians and physiologists soon recognized the potential adverse effects of PEEP, including barotrauma and circulatory depression. In the 50 years since the first report of ARDS, numerous approaches to setting PEEP have evolved. The recognition of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the potential role that PEEP plays in mitigating VILI shifted the goals of PEEP from improving arterial oxygenation to preventing VILI. This review examines the physiologic rationale and evidence for the various approaches to setting PEEP. Mechanisms of VILIMechanical ventilation causes VILI by applying excessive force to the lung parenchyma. It was recognized in early clinical practices that high airway pressures and tidal volumes could cause gross macroscopic injury, such as pneumothorax or pneumatoceles (3). Subsequent studies in experimental models demonstrated that high inspiratory pressures and volumes could cause alveolar overdistention, which results in inflammation, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and hyaline membranes (3\u20136). Moreover, pulmonary inflammation resulting from injurious ventilation can cause cellular damage in other organs, suggesting that VILI may contribute to multiorgan failure (\u201cbiotrauma\u201d) (7).VILI may also occur from ventilation at low end-expiratory lung volumes (Figure 1). At low lung volume, unstable lung units may open with inspiration and collapse with expiration. This can impair surfactant function and cause stress at points of opening and closing in small airways and alveoli (8). Large differences in lung unit inflation (\u201cinhomogeneities\u201d) at the margins between aerated and atelectatic alveoli can significantly amplify lung stress (9). Some small airways may fill with fluid or foam at low lung volumes (10), preferentially distributing tidal ventilation to aerated lung regions and resulting in regional overdistention. Moreover, liquid bridges in small airways may break under pressure during inspiration and reform during expiration. The high surface tension forces involved with such cyclic breaking and reforming can damage the epithelium of involved airways. Lung derecruitment at low lung volumes also reduces the volume of lung available for tidal ventilation, which increases stress and strain in the ventilated \u201cbaby lung.\u201d (11) The significance of this latter mechanism is supported by experimental and clinical observations that suggest that lung injury primarily occurs within the ventilated lung regions (6, 12).Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury.

Beneficial Effects of PEEPAshbaugh and colleagues initially hypothesized that PEEP ameliorated hypoxemia by counteracting alveolar collapse resulting from inadequate surfactant function (1, 13). Subsequent studies confirmed that PEEP improves arterial hypoxemia primarily by recruiting collapsed lungs and thereby reducing intrapulmonary shunt (14). Numerous studies in experimental models have demonstrated that PEEP can mitigate VILI by keeping some alveoli open that would otherwise become atelectatic or flooded at end-expiration (recruitment) (4, 8, 15, 16). This prevents possible injury resulting from cyclic lung opening and closing (17). It also increases the number of aerated alveoli participating in tidal ventilation, reducing tidal lung stress and strain, which is reflected by improved lung compliance (18, 19). Promoting more homogeneous ventilation could also reduce the stress and injury at the margins between aerated and collapsed lung tissue (9, 20). Harmful Effects of PEEPAlthough low levels of PEEP can improve cardiac output (21), above a certain threshold level of pressure, PEEP may reduce cardiac output (22, 23). PEEP increases pleural pressure, elevating right atrial pressure and reducing the pressure gradient for venous return (22, 24, 25). Diminished venous return decreases right and left ventricular preload, causing decreased cardiac output. PEEP may also increase pulmonary vascular resistance by narrowing or occluding alveolar septal vessels, which are surrounded by alveolar pressure, even when using low tidal volumes (26). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance elevates right ventricular afterload, which may further reduce cardiac output (27, 28). PEEP can also increase alveolar dead space by increasing the volume of lung in which alveolar pressure exceeds pulmonary capillary pressure (21).The hemodynamic consequences of PEEP are often overtly apparent at the bedside, whereas its adverse effects on the lung parenchyma may be more insidious. PEEP may also contribute to VILI by increasing lung stress and strain. The application of PEEP may result in predominant alveolar recruitment, predominant alveolar overdistention, or a combination of both recruitment and overdistention. If increases in PEEP fail to adequately recruit collapsed alveoli to participate in tidal ventilation, both dynamic and end-inspiratory lung stress will increase. The resulting alveolar overdistention may propagate lung inflammation and injury, similar to the effects of excess tidal volume. The net effect of PEEP on recruitment, overdistention, and hemodynamics will depend on the level of PEEP that is applied and the size of the associated tidal volume. Consequently, lung recruitability is a crucial determinant of the effect of PEEP on the injured lung (17, 29). Assessing the Effect of PEEP on Lung RecruitmentImportance of Lung RecruitmentBecause of these mechanistic considerations, the ratio of benefit to harm from PEEP depends on the amount of lung that can be recruited by raising PEEP, which varies widely among patients with ARDS (30). Increases in PEEP will raise total end-inspiratory lung stress in both high and low recruiters. However, in patients with greater recruitability, much of the increase in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) with PEEP arises from opening of collapsed lung units. This reduces cyclic lung collapse and reopening. It also reduces dynamic strain in aerated lung units due to an increase in aerated volume available for tidal volume distribution. In contrast, in patients with low recruitability, PEEP causes additional distention of already aerated lung tissue, which could lead to overdistention injury, without a concomitant decrease in dynamic strain (17). Thus, an assessment of an individual\u2019s potential for recruitment could allow for the personalization of PEEP titration to improve the chances for benefit rather than harm. In support of this hypothesis, a secondary analysis of two trials of higher PEEP strategies versus lower PEEP strategies found that the oxygenation response after increases in PEEP, a marker (albeit imperfect) of lung recruitment, predicted lower mortality. Patients with greater improvements in oxygenation were less likely to die compared with patients with little or no improvement in oxygenation with PEEP (31). This finding provided tentative clinical evidence that higher PEEP levels are of benefit when lung recruitment is achieved. Conversely, applying higher PEEP in the absence of lung recruitment was associated with worse outcomes. The lung recruitment hypothesis ultimately requires prospective confirmation in a randomized trial comparing the impact of higher PEEP versus lower PEEP in patients with and without lung recruitability (32). However, such trials would require a practical and feasible means of assessing lung recruitability at the bedside.Techniques for Monitoring Lung RecruitmentThe volume of derecruited lung is correlated with intrapulmonary shunt, and improvements in arterial oxygenation with increased PEEP therefore often reflect lung recruitment (30, 33\u201335). However, arterial oxygenation is also influenced by other factors affected by PEEP (i.e., cardiac output), so the correlation is imperfect. A seminal study of lung recruitment in patients with ARDS found that a combination of physiologic variables (PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u2009150 at a PEEP of 5 cm H2O, a decrease in dead space, and an increase in respiratory system compliance [CRS] with an increase in PEEP to 15 cm H2O) predicted a higher percentage of potentially recruitable lung (30).Computed tomographic (CT) scanning can define regions of lung tissue with different voxel densities, which are interpreted to indicate tissue compartments that are well-aerated, poorly aerated, and nonaerated (30). By comparing CT images at different PEEP levels, the amount of lung tissue that is recruited at a higher PEEP in relation to the baseline lung volume can be estimated. This approach may be a scientifically rigorous method for assessing recruitment in clinical research, but it is probably too cumbersome, costly, and risky for use in usual care.Helium dilution or nitrogen washout techniques have been used to measure changes in EELV at different PEEP levels (36\u201338). The increase in EELV from a lower to a higher PEEP level is first estimated from the product of the change in PEEP and the CRS measured at the lower PEEP level. If the change in EELV measured by helium dilution or nitrogen washout exceeds the predicted change in EELV, the difference is presumed to be from recruitment. Lung recruitability can be assessed in a similar fashion using electrical impedance tomography, which permits real-time visualization of changes in the distribution of pulmonary ventilation as PEEP is adjusted. Comparison of actual and predicted increases in lung impedance after an increase in PEEP permit estimates of recruited lung volume (39).A third method for assessing recruitability, which can also be conducted at the bedside, requires construction of airway pressure\u2013volume curves during tidal ventilation at different PEEP levels. After a pressure\u2013volume curve is established at a given PEEP level, the airway is opened to atmospheric pressure for a prolonged exhalation to FRC. Measurements of the exhaled volumes at different PEEP levels to FRC allow curves to be plotted on the same axes, with the origin at FRC and an airway pressure of zero. The amount of recruitment that occurs when PEEP is raised from the lower to the higher PEEP level is assumed to be the difference in volume between the two curves at a given airway pressure (Figure 2) (37, 40).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Example of pressure\u2013volume (P\u2013V) curves from a representative patient at two different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels (dark\nblue line, PEEP of 5 cm H2O and pink line, PEEP 14 cm H2O). P\u2013V curves are plotted on the same volume axis. The vertical solid line indicates end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) measured using a nitrogen washout/washin technique. The dashed lines indicate volume expired from PEEP to zero end-expiratory pressure (PEEP-vol 1 and PEEP-vol 2). Recmes is the measured recruitment induced by the increase in PEEP from 5 to 14 cm H2O. Recestim is the predicted recruitment derived from the change in EELV minus the minimum predicted increase in lung volume based on compliance and the increment in PEEP. Gray inset is a representation of Recestim. Reprinted with permission from Reference 37.Estimates of recruitability from pressure\u2013volume curves and from helium dilution are strongly correlated with each other, but both are poorly correlated with estimates of recruitability obtained from CT scanning (40). This may be attributable to the fact that CT measures the opening of previously collapsed lung units, whereas techniques based on respiratory mechanics measure the volume of gas entering newly recruited lung units together with previously open units (41). In addition, methods that use measurements of EELV, such as CT or gas dilution, allow recruited lung volume to be calculated as a percentage of the baseline lung volume. The multiple pressure\u2013volume curve method does not allow for this reference, which limits the interpretation of the amount of recruited lung volume. Approaches to Setting PEEP at the BedsideBalancing Risks from Higher FiO2 with Higher PEEPEarlier clinical practices were guided by the observation that, in most individuals with ARDS, arterial oxygenation goals could be achieved by applying PEEP levels of 5 to 12 cm H2O with FiO2 levels \u22640.7 (1, 2). This approach attempted to balance potential harms from alveolar overdistention and circulatory depression due to high PEEP with concerns about oxygen toxicity (42, 43), but clinicians attempted to strike this balance in many different ways. Some preferred to raise FiO2 to high levels before raising PEEP above 5 cm H2O, whereas others raised PEEP to high levels before raising FiO2 above 0.50. In the National Institutes of Health ARDS Network tidal volume trial, PEEP and FiO2 were adjusted in discrete steps according to a table of PEEP and FiO2 combinations (Table 1) (44). This table was developed in 1995 and represented a compromise among clinicians\u2019 approaches at a time when there was little consideration for the potential protective effect of PEEP against VILI. In light of growing appreciation for this important issue, the ARDS Network subsequently designed another PEEP/FiO2 table that used PEEP levels an average of 6 cm H2O higher than those that resulted from the use of the original table (Table 1) (45). The Canadian Critical Care Clinical Trials Group also developed a similar higher PEEP/FiO2 table. In two randomized clinical trials that compared the lower and higher PEEP/FiO2 tables, mean arterial oxygenation increased in the higher PEEP groups, which suggested that there was greater recruitment with higher PEEPs (45, 46). However, the oxygenation response to increased PEEP varied widely between individual patients (31).Table 1.Comparison of Lower and Higher PEEP/FiO2 Combination TablesLower PEEP/FiO2 Combination*FiO20.30.40.40.50.50.60.70.70.70.80.90.90.91.0PEEP, cm H2O558810101012141414161818\u201324Open in a separate windowHigher PEEP/FiO2 Combination\u2020FiO20.30.30.40.40.50.50.50.60.70.80.80.91.0\u00a0PEEP, cm H2O12141416161820202020222222\u201324\u00a0Open in a separate windowDefinition of abbreviation: PEEP\u2009=\u2009positive end-expiratory pressure.*Reference 44.\u2020Reference 45.The use of PEEP/FiO2 tables is advantageous in that they are readily implemented in routine clinical practice. However, they do not always suit clinical circumstances because some patients with severe hypoxemia have little or no improvement in oxygenation with higher PEEP. According to the table, to achieve acceptable arterial oxygenation in these patients, a higher PEEP must be applied before a higher FiO2 can be used. PEEP/FiO2 tables function well to increase average PEEP levels applied across patient populations, but do not necessarily guarantee optimal PEEP in individual patients.Opening the Lung while Avoiding OverdistentionIn another randomized clinical trial, PEEP was increased in a higher PEEP study group until the inspiratory plateau pressure approached 28\u201330 cm H2O (47). This approach aimed to balance the potential beneficial effects of greater recruitment with the potential deleterious effects of higher PEEP on end-inspiratory lung stress and circulatory function. The higher PEEP strategy was compared with a \u201cminimal distention\u201d strategy that used PEEP levels of 5\u20139 cm H2O. Similar to the other large trials of higher PEEP, this study did not show a significant difference in mortality, although the higher PEEP strategy was associated with greater ventilator-free and organ failure\u2013free days. Again, this strategy may not always arrive at optimal PEEP in individual patients. For example, a patient with mild ARDS and relatively little recruitable lung may have low baseline plateau pressures and would receive relatively high levels of PEEP, whereas a patient with more severe hypoxemia resulting from significant but potentially recruitable atelectasis will have a higher baseline plateau pressure and receive relatively lower PEEP levels.Optimizing ComplianceSuter and colleagues originally proposed setting PEEP to maximize oxygen delivery (cardiac output multiplied by arterial oxygen content). In 15 patients with acute respiratory failure, maximum oxygen transport was attained at the PEEP associated with the highest static CRS (21). Subsequent studies also suggested that PEEP titration guided by CRS was associated with improvements in organ function and oxygenation (48, 49). However, these small, randomized trials were not adequately powered to assess mortality differences between groups. In addition, cyclic opening and collapse of lung units with tidal insufflation might cause an increase in measured tidal compliance not related to the PEEP-induced end-expiratory recruitment, which might confound the assessment of the effect of changing PEEP (34).Driving PressureDriving pressure is the difference between airway inspiratory plateau pressure and PEEP. This pressure gradient is a mathematical function of the tidal volume and the CRS (driving pressure\u2009=\u2009Vt/CRS). Because CRS is directly related to the size of the lung participating in ventilation (i.e., the number of recruited lung units), driving pressure reflects the size of tidal volume in relation to the aerated lung volume. This may better reflect dynamic pulmonary stress and strain during mechanical ventilation. Because PEEP ideally minimizes dynamic stress and strain by recruiting lung units to participate in ventilation, driving pressure is an attractive physiological target for PEEP titration.A recent meta-analysis of more than 3,000 patients enrolled in clinical trials of lung-protective ventilation strategies demonstrated that driving pressure was a strong predictor of mortality, with higher driving pressures associated with higher mortality (50). Measuring driving pressure at different PEEP levels could be a practical way of assessing the balance between overdistention and opening\u2013closing during tidal ventilation. With constant tidal volume, if PEEP is raised and driving pressure decreases, the CRS has decreased, suggesting that the higher PEEP caused lung recruitment. In contrast, if PEEP is raised and driving pressure increases, CRS has decreased, suggesting that higher PEEP caused overdistention of the aerated lung. Thus, adjusting PEEP to minimize driving pressure may permit a personalized approach to minimize VILI. However, at a constant tidal volume, titrating PEEP to minimize driving pressure is equivalent to titrating PEEP to maximize CRS. Thus, this strategy may be similarly limited by observed increases in tidal compliance that are not secondary to recruitment. To obtain valid estimates of driving pressure, patients must be relaxed during pauses at end-inspiration. However, no specialized equipment is required to record and analyze airway pressure, and all modern ventilators readily permit these measurements. Prospective trials must be conducted to determine if titrating PEEP to reduce driving pressure can improve important clinical outcomes such as mortality.Titration Based on Pressure\u2013Volume CurvesAmato and colleagues constructed respiratory system pressure\u2013volume curves in patients with ARDS and set PEEP near the lower end of the middle, linear portion of the curve where the compliance is high, the so-called \u201cinflection point,\u201d to prevent VILI from alveolar opening and collapse at low airway pressures (51, 52). Airway pressures above the inflection point on the pressure\u2013volume curve are associated with a large gain in lung volume. Thus, this point was believed to indicate the pressure at which a large number of alveoli were recruited (Figure 3). There was a significant reduction in mortality in a lung-protective ventilation group in which PEEP was set with this approach compared with a conventional ventilation group in which PEEPs were approximately 6\u20138 cm H2O lower. However, this higher PEEP strategy was combined with the use of lower tidal volumes in the lung-protective group, an intervention subsequently shown to reduce mortality apart from any effect of PEEP (44). Therefore, it is uncertain whether the use of higher PEEP significantly contributed to the improved outcomes in that trial.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Sample inspiratory static pressure\u2013volume curve of the respiratory system showing two inflection points (PFLEX).

Larger gray shaded triangle represents the calculated compliance with a high tidal volume. Reprinted with permission from Reference 51.There are important limitations to using pressure\u2013volume curves to set PEEP. Neuromuscular blockade or heavy sedation is required to avoid the effects of respiratory muscle activity (53). The inspiratory limb of the pressure\u2013volume curve is different from the expiratory limb, and tidal breathing probably occurs somewhere between the two curves, depending on the level of PEEP. In some patients, a lower inflection point cannot be identified. Furthermore, although substantial recruitment occurs over the lower portion of the curve, additional recruitment occurs at intermediate and even higher pressures and volumes (34). In light of these limitations, static pressure\u2013volume curves are not used for clinical practice at present.Stress IndexWith a constant inspiratory flow (square waveform), the shape of the airway pressure\u2013time relationship reflects changes in CRS during inspiration. The stress index is a coefficient that describes the rate of change in the slope of the pressure\u2013time curve during tidal inspiration (54). If the slope of the pressure\u2013time relationship increases during inspiration (stress index >1), the respiratory system becomes less compliant, perhaps from overdistention of the lungs. A decreasing slope of the pressure\u2013time curve during inspiration suggests that the system is becoming more compliant (stress index <1), perhaps from recruitment of alveoli that were atelectatic at end-expiration. PEEP can be adjusted to a level at which the stress index equals 1, indicating that the slope of the pressure\u2013time relationship changes minimally during inspiration. This suggests neither overdistention nor recruitment during inspiration or some balance between these two injurious forces (55). In 15 patients with predominantly lobar consolidation as opposed to diffuse opacifications, Grasso and colleagues compared the PEEP obtained using the ARDS Network lower PEEP/FiO2 table with a strategy that adjusted PEEP according to the stress index (56). In every patient, PEEP was lower when it was adjusted according to the stress index. The lower levels of PEEP based on the stress index might have reflected baseline overdistention due to the patients having lobar consolidations and thus a lower likelihood of recruitment with PEEP. These lower PEEP settings were associated with higher CRS, lower concentrations of inflammatory mediators in plasma, lower PaCO2, and no significant change in arterial oxygenation. However, this approach requires specialized monitoring equipment to record and analyze the pressure\u2013time relationship, which limits its adoption in clinical practice at present.Estimating Transpulmonary PressureMany lung protective strategies, including the National Institutes of Health ARDS Network lower tidal volume protocol, monitor airway pressures to avoid VILI. However, airway pressure is not always a reliable reflection of true lung stress. Conditions that increase chest wall elastance (e.g., edema, kyphoscoliosis, or abdominal hypertension) or shift the pressure\u2013volume curve of the respiratory system or the chest wall to the right (e.g., obesity) will elevate airway pressure without an increase in lung stress (Figure 4). Consequently, clinicians may underestimate the PEEP required to achieve adequate lung recruitment because of concerns about high airway plateau pressures. Moreover, during exhalation, some lung regions, especially dependent areas, may collapse even with moderate levels of PEEP if pleural pressure is elevated (57). Transpulmonary pressure (PL) is the pressure gradient from the airway to the pleural space (58, 59). It more accurately reflects the stress on the lung parenchyma, independent of the chest wall. For example, if end-inspiratory PL remains within tolerable limits, it may be reasonable to consider exceeding conventional airway plateau pressure limits. Monitoring end-expiratory PL may also help to identify PEEP levels required to prevent cyclic alveolar collapse.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.Airway (Paw), esophageal (Pes), and transpulmonary (PL) pressure waveforms in three different clinical circumstances. The resulting PL is similar for all three patients; however, the Paw and Pes are different. The Pes, as an estimate of pleural pressure, varies based on the contribution of the chest wall. Reprinted with permission from Reference 60. ARDS\u2009=\u2009acute respiratory distress syndrome.The major challenge to using PL to guide ventilator management is finding an accurate and practical method to estimate pleural pressure. Esophageal manometry is the most feasible means of obtaining such estimates. To measure esophageal pressure, an air- or liquid-filled catheter is positioned in the lower third of the esophagus (58, 60). Esophageal pressure is believed to represent average pleural pressure in upright, healthy individuals (61, 62). However, in supine, mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, esophageal pressure rises by a variable amount because of dorsal shift of mediastinal contents and cephalad movement of the diaphragm. There is some controversy regarding the best method for using esophageal pressure to calculate PL. Some investigators suggest using the absolute value of esophageal pressure (\u201cdirect measure\u201d) with or without a correction factor to account for the weight of mediastinum and abdominal contents (63, 64). Others investigators use the tidal change in esophageal pressure to partition lung and chest wall elastance, which can then be used to derive PL (\u201celastance-derived\u201d) (65). Not surprisingly, the recommended PEEP levels obtained from the methods of estimating PL differ substantially (66). Finally, it is not clear that a single value of esophageal pressure measured near the left lower lobe, even if it accurately reflects pleural pressure in that vicinity, can be used to represent average pleural pressure for all aspects of the lungs (60, 67).PL measurements have been used to titrate PEEP in patients with ARDS in a number of different ways. In a small study of patients with severe hypoxemia due to H1N1 influenza\u2013associated ARDS, PEEP was increased until the maximum tolerable end-inspiratory, elastance-derived PL was attained to prevent overdistention (68). With this approach, approximately half of the patients experienced sufficient improvements in arterial oxygenation to be managed without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and none of these patients died. Talmor and colleagues titrated PEEP to maintain a positive end-expiratory PL (directly measured) to keep airways open at end-expiration and prevent tidal recruitment\u2013derecruitment. In a randomized trial that compared this strategy to the ARDS Network lower PEEP/FiO2 table, patients in the PL-guided group had substantial improvements in arterial oxygenation (57). The trial was not powered to compare mortality between the two groups, but there was a trend toward lower mortality in the PL-guided group.PEEP Guided by ImagingAn important cause of lung collapse during expiration in ARDS is from increased lung weight that compresses dependent lung regions (69, 70). CT scans allow regional analyses of compressive forces of lung weight at different vertical levels. The CT-derived PEEP is the sum of the superimposed pressures operating on the most dependent lung regions and the force necessary to expand the chest wall based on the chest wall elastance (71). Therefore, the CT-derived PEEP will hypothetically estimate the pressure necessary to keep the lung open, and it should in theory be related to the amount of recruitable lung. However, in a small study, CT scan\u2013derived PEEP was unrelated to lung recruitability, and similar levels of PEEP were suggested in mild, moderate, and severe ARDS (71). Based on these results and the burdensome nature of performing serial CT scans in critically ill patients, it is unlikely that CT-derived PEEP will be useful in tailoring PEEP to individual patients in the clinical setting.Lung ultrasound has been proposed as a practical bedside imaging alternative to CT scan to assess lung recruitment in response to PEEP. Improvement in an ultrasound re-aeration score significantly correlated with lung recruitment as measured by the pressure\u2013volume curve method and with increases in arterial oxygenation (72). Ultrasound, however, cannot assess alveolar overdistention.Electrical impedance tomography, as mentioned earlier, is an imaging technique that has been used to titrate PEEP (73, 74). This technique permits concomitant monitoring of pulmonary blood flow distribution, ventilation\u2013perfusion matching, and can detect pneumothorax. Although it holds promise, it has not yet been widely disseminated. Comparisons of Different PEEP StrategiesThe three largest clinical trials of approaches to setting PEEP to date were comparisons of uniform higher PEEP strategies versus lower PEEP strategies. None showed significant differences in mortality between the study groups (45\u201347). One possible reason for the lack of significant difference in mortality between study groups was that there was no attempt to identify patients who would respond to increases in PEEP with lung recruitment. Beneficial effects of higher PEEP in patients with substantial recruitability might have been counteracted by detrimental effects in patients with low recruitability, leading to an overall null result (32). This theory was supported by a subsequent individual patient data meta-analysis that found that PEEP improved survival in patients with moderate or severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2\u2009\u2264\u2009200 mm Hg), who presumably had more recruitable lung (75). It also suggested that ventilation with higher PEEP might increase mortality in patients with mild ARDS.Chiumello and colleagues tested four different bedside PEEP titration methods to identify the method that would best provide levels of PEEP in proportion to lung recruitability and severity of ARDS (76). PEEP titration strategies included the open lung approach limited by plateau pressure (47), stress index (77), PL (57), and an oxygenation strategy using a higher PEEP/FiO2 table (46). The PEEP/FiO2 table was the only strategy that consistently provided higher PEEP levels in patients with severe ARDS and greater recruitability, and provided lower PEEP levels in patients with mild ARDS and less recruitability. A secondary analysis of the data from two of the three clinical trials of higher PEEP further demonstrated that patients whose PaO2/FiO2 ratios increased with higher PEEP had lower mortality (31). This improvement in oxygenation might have represented recruitment in response to PEEP. Assessing oxygenation response to higher PEEP might allow identification of patients more likely to benefit from a higher PEEP strategy for clinical management or recruitment in future clinical trials.In a recent study, PEEP was set during a decremental PEEP maneuver to maximize CRS. This was associated with significantly improved arterial oxygenation and lower driving pressures compared with patients whose PEEP was set according to the ARDS Network lower PEEP/FiO2 table, but mortality was not significantly reduced (78). Studies comparing CRS compliance, oxygenation strategies, and PL also demonstrated physiological benefits in titrating PEEP to maximal CRS during a decremental PEEP trial (48, 49). Other comparison studies demonstrated improvements in oxygenation or lung stress with a variety of other bedside methods that targeted esophageal pressure, the stress index, or dead space (49, 57, 79). At this time, however, no trials comparing important clinical outcomes, such as mortality or ventilator-free days, have demonstrated a benefit from any of these approaches. ConclusionsSince the original description of ARDS, PEEP remains a mainstay of the ventilatory management of ARDS. Yet, the optimal approach to PEEP titration has not yet been firmly established. It is plausible that customizing PEEP will not result in any improvement in clinically meaningful outcomes. From this perspective, the use of a PEEP/FiO2 table or arbitrarily chosen levels of PEEP that maintain acceptable oxygenation levels may be entirely adequate. However, in our opinion, in addition to supporting arterial oxygenation, PEEP should also be applied with the goal of reducing VILI. In personal practice, based on current knowledge, PEEP is initially set using either the higher or lower PEEP/FiO2 table (45, 46). For patients with moderate to severe ARDS, PEEP is then further individually titrated to optimize compliance and minimize driving pressure. PL measurements are not routinely used to guide PEEP, although one author sometimes uses such measurements to confirm that the application of high PEEP levels does not result in excess end-inspiratory lung stress (plateau PL\u2009>\u200920 cm H2O).Future studies are required to better understand different physiological surrogate endpoints (oxygenation, lung stress, PL, etc.) for PEEP titration to improve patient outcomes. The development of feasible and valid methods of quantifying lung recruitability and overdistention at the bedside is a high priority. Future trials must focus on selecting patients with the highest likelihood of accruing benefit from PEEP while excluding those at risk of harm. The unresolved problem of PEEP management offers important opportunities for the development of personalized mechanical ventilation.
