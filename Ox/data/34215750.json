These cytosine (dC) derivatives give rise to an additional information layer that controls transcriptional activity4. The mdC-oxidation products hmdC, fdC, and cadC are generated by ten eleven translocation enzymes (Tet1-3), which are themselves \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)- and oxygen-dependent dioxygenases (Fig.\u00a01a). They decarboxylate \u03b1KG to generate an active site-bound Fe(IV)-oxo species that ultimately performs the oxidation5. Accumulating evidence suggests that mdC and hmdC directly affect transcriptional activity6. In contrast, fdC and cadC are considered as nucleobases that are exchanged with dC7. This exchange enables active demethylation that allows the system to switch between transcriptional states. While fdC and cadC are only present in trace amounts in differentiated cells, mdC and hmdC are detectable in all tissues8. Among all tissues, hmdC levels are by far the highest in brain9,10, and in particular found in synapse-related genes of neurons11. This correlates with high Tet expression levels in neurons12, further suggesting that dynamic oxidation-dependent active DNA demethylation is an essential prerequisite for neuronal plasticity13,14. The question of how neuronal nuclei are supplied with the required amounts of \u03b1KG is an unsolved question that couples mdC-oxidation chemistry in the genome to metabolism.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Tet enzyme kinetics.a Illustration of \u03b1KG and O2-dependent mdC-oxidation to hmdC and further on to fdC and cadC by Tet enzymes, with hmdC being the main oxidation product.

A.U. arbitrary units, m/z mass to charge ratio. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\u03b1KG is mainly generated in mitochondria as a key intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle15. The \u03b1KG levels outside the mitochondria vary substantially between cell types16,17. In differentiating cells this concentration was shown to be about 15\u2009\u00b5M and the \u03b1KG availability was able to be linked to Tet activity with elevated \u03b1KG concentrations providing higher hmdC levels16,18. This indicates that \u03b1KG supply is indeed a Tet-activity limiting factor16,18,19. The principle that co-substrate availability in the nucleus determines the activity of epigenetic enzymes was already established in recent years for other epigenetic marks. Histone acetylation, for example, depends on acetyl-CoA. In neuronal nuclei, acetyl-coA is produced on-site by the acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus20. In proliferating cells, acetyl-CoA is produced by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is shuttled from mitochondria into the nucleus21. This moonlighting of mitochondrial and cytosolic protein echoforms into the nucleus is a new principle that establishes the nucleus as a biosynthetically active entity22 controlled by metabolic fluctuations that can differ substantially within the cell23. Here we show that neuronal Tet3 redirects the mitochondrial enzyme Gdh into the nucleus to establish an intranuclear production of \u03b1KG from NAD+ and glutamate. ResultsTet3 enzyme kineticsAll three Tet paralogues have functions in a neuronal context14,24,25, but only the Tet3\u2212/\u2212 phenotype is neonatal lethal in mice26,27. In humans, TET3 deficiencies were further recently linked to intellectual disabilities and growth retardation28. In order to compare the global expression levels of all three Tet enzymes in murine brain, a western blot was performed and the Tet expression levels in brain were compared to the levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which are known to have high Tet1, but low Tet3 levels3. The data depicted in Fig.\u00a01b confirm that in accordance with literature12, Tet3 is compared to Tet1 the dominantly expressed paralogue in brain. We next studied the affinity of Tet3 for \u03b1KG; again in comparison to Tet1 for which the enzyme kinetics were already studied in detail3,29. We expressed the catalytic domains of Tet1 and Tet3 as N-terminal GFP-fusion constructs (GFP-Tet1cd and GFP-Tet3cd) in HEK293T cells and purified the proteins with anti-GFP nanobody-coated magnetic beads (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). For the assay, we adjusted the amounts of added protein based on the GFP fluorescence. The bead-attached proteins were then used to oxidize a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide substrate containing one central mdC base with increasing amounts of \u03b1KG (Fig.\u00a01c). The DNA was subsequently purified and the conversion of mdC to the three oxidation products hmdC, fdC, and cadC was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and quantified on the nucleoside level by UHPLC triple quadrupole (UHPLC-QQQ) mass spectrometry (MS). The MALDI data revealed that GFP-Tet3cd requires an approximately 20-fold higher \u03b1KG concentration than GFP-Tet1cd to reach a similar oxidation yield (Fig.\u00a01c). Our UHPLC-QQQ-MS data revealed a Michaelis constant (Km) of 39\u2009\u00b5M \u03b1KG for GFP-Tet1cd, which is slightly lower than the previously reported Km for Tet129. For GFP-Tet3cd, the measured Km was almost twofold higher at 73\u2009\u00b5M \u03b1KG with a maximal conversion rate (vmax) only 15% compared to GFP-Tet1cd for (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). In summary, the data suggest that Tet3, which is the dominantly expressed Tet paralogue in brain, has a particularly low affinity for \u03b1KG.Gdh produces \u03b1KG co-substrate for Tet3 directly in neuronal nucleiIn order to search for Tet3 interaction partners that could provide \u03b1KG, we next performed an affinity-based proteomics study with nuclear lysate from whole murine brain. Prior to the study, we confirmed that the lysates showed specific enrichment of nuclear proteins (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c). For the initial co-immunoprecipitation (coIP), we overexpressed murine full-length Tet3 lacking the CXXC domain, which is the prevalent isoform in neuronal tissue30, as an N-terminal GFP-fusion construct (GFP-Tet3) in HEK293T cells. The protein was then immobilized again on anti-GFP nanobody-coated beads (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d, e) and the beads were used as fishing baits for interacting proteins (Fig.\u00a02a). Unfused GFP purified from the same source served as a negative control. By this approach we aimed to overcome the potential problem of antibody specificity, which may occur if two different antibodies\u2014one for the actual coIP and one for the control coIP\u2014are used. The samples were analyzed using label-free quantitative\u00a0mass spectrometry (LFQ-MS)31. The statistical analysis of the data confirmed that the method provided highly reproducible datasets. The obtained data showed a high correlation within the replicates as determined by the Pearson correlation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). Particularly informative was the enrichment of O-linked-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine-transferase (Ogt) (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). Because Ogt is a well-known Tet3 interactor32\u201334, this finding was a first validation of the method. A search for other enriched proteins uncovered the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh), which catalyzes the NAD+-dependent conversion of glutamate into \u03b1KG (Fig.\u00a02c), as a Tet3 interactor (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). Gdh is a key component of carbohydrate, amino acid, neurotransmitter and oxidative energy metabolism35,36 and typically localizes to mitochondria37. The discovery of Gdh as a Tet3 interactor in nuclear lysate suggests an additional nuclear localization of Gdh.Open in a separate windowFig. 2Interaction of Tet3 with Gdh in neurons.a Experimental set-up for Tet3-enriched coIP. b Volcano plot after Tet3-enriched coIP in nuclear brain lysate of adult mice (n\u2009=\u20094 biologically independent sample preparations).

Nuclei (blue) were stained with Hoechst and NeuN staining indicates neuronal nuclei. Scale bar is 5\u2009\u00b5m. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Given the very high glutamate concentration in neurons, ranging from 5 to 10\u2009mM23, an on-site biosynthesis of \u03b1KG from glutamate by nuclear Gdh would establish a direct local co-substrate supply chain for Tet3. Gdh is a bidirectional enzyme that can also consume \u03b1KG. For this to occur, however, Gdh requires low glutamate concentrations and especially high levels of ammonium, which are known to be toxic for neurons38,39. To address the enzyme directionality, we measured the \u03b1KG-to-glutamate ratio by NMR-based metabolomics40 in hippocampus. We found that the glutamate levels are least 50 times higher than those for \u03b1KG (Fig.\u00a02c). This finding in combination with the low ammonium levels in neurons39 suggests that Gdh is operating in neuronal nuclei in the direction of \u03b1KG production, which is in line with previous reports about the function of Gdh in rat brain41.To substantiate the suspected interaction of Tet3 with Gdh, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Tet3 from nuclear brain lysate and analyzed the interaction partners by western blotting. The interaction of Tet3 with Ogt served again as a positive control. Importantly, Gdh was successfully pulled down in Tet3-endogenous coIP (Fig.\u00a02d), confirming the result obtained by Tet3-enriched coIP. To further validate the interaction of Tet3 and Gdh in situ, we next performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA), which provides a signal only when the two investigated proteins are within a 40\u2009nm distance42. For the study, we used coronal brain slices and antibodies that were validated before the experiment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03 and ref. 43). Indeed, the Tet3/Gdh-PLA provided positive signals in hippocampal neurons (Fig.\u00a02e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a), further supporting a close proximity of Tet3 and Gdh in neuronal nuclei.Gdh is transported with its MTS into neuronal nucleiGdh is known to be highly expressed in brain, which has high hmdC and Tet3 levels, as well as in liver, which has in contrast very low hmdC and Tet3 levels in a non-fasting state9,12,41,44. We investigated if the differences regarding the hmdC levels correlate with a different Gdh distribution. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we indeed found an exclusive mitochondrial localization for Gdh in hepatocytes. A specific Gdh signal in the nuclei of hepatocytes could not be detected and we failed to detect Tet3 (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). In granule neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, however, we detected only very little Gdh in mitochondria. In contrast, Gdh was dominantly present in the nucleus. Tet3 was also detected with the expected nuclear localization (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). Altogether, these immunofluorescence data revealed that Gdh exists in two echoforms of which one is situated inside mitochondria, while a second form can be transferred to the nucleus in neurons.Open in a separate windowFig. 3Gdh localization in brain and liver and Tet3\u2009+\u2009Gdh interaction after ectopic co-expression in HEK293T cells.a Immunofluorescence staining of Tet3 and Gdh in murine hippocampus compared to liver.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Next, we investigated the question of how Gdh can moonlight22 into the nucleus. The gene Glud1 encodes Gdh including an N-terminal 53 amino acids long mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS), which is cleaved off after import into the mitochondria35,37. When we analyzed neuronal Gdh in different subcellular compartments by western blotting, we found in the cytosolic fraction only the long variant with MTS migrating above the 57\u2009kDa marker band, whereas in the organelle fraction only the short variant without MTS was detected (Fig.\u00a03b). For the nuclear fraction, we detected two Gdh signals, with the dominant signal being at ~61.3\u2009kDa and the weaker signal at ~55.9\u2009kDa corresponding to two Gdh echoforms with and without the MTS, respectively. The weak band below 57\u2009kDa that is detected in the nuclear fraction likely reflects some mitochondrial impurity, which is supported by a weak signal for CoxIV, which is a protein of the mitochondrial matrix. As the MTS is cleaved off after its import into mitochondria, detection of the short version in the organelle fraction was expected. The discovery of the long Gdh echoform in the nucleus suggests that the nuclear Gdh does not pass through the mitochondrion, but rather that it is directly transferred into the nucleus despite its MTS.The Gdh-Tet3 proximity increases Tet3 activityTo study how the proximity of Tet3 and Gdh influences Tet3 function, we performed a functional assay in HEK293T cells with ectopically co-expressed murine GFP-Tet3 and C-terminally FLAG-tagged murine Gdh (Gdh-FLAG). We first verified the interaction of GFP-Tet3 and Gdh-FLAG in HEK293T cells, again using a PLA with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG primary antibodies (Fig.\u00a03c). While in the negative control, where unfused GFP and Gdh-FLAG were co-expressed, no PLA signal was detectable, co-expression of GFP-Tet3 and Gdh-FLAG provided clear PLA signals, indicating that GFP-Tet3 and Gdh-FLAG were in close proximity in the nuclei of HEK293T cells. Next, we quantified the levels of hmdC, fdC, and cadC using our reported UHPLC-QQQ-MS method45 at 10, 24, and 48\u2009h post transfection in HEK293T cells that were either transfected with plasmids coding for GFP-Tet3 and Gdh-FLAG, or with the plasmid coding for GFP-Tet3 and an empty vector. In this model system, glutamate supply was guaranteed by the addition of 2\u2009mM of l-alanyl-glutamine to the medium. To correct for expression level differences of GFP-Tet3 between the samples, we normalized the hmdC, fdC, and cadC levels against the GFP signal (relative fluorescent unit (RFU)), which we determined using fluorescence-based flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). For all modifications at any timepoint, the GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG co-expressing HEK293T cells showed significantly higher Tet-product levels than the cells expressing GFP-Tet3 alone (Fig.\u00a03d). The largest difference was observed after 48\u2009h, indicating that under limited nutrient and therefore limited \u03b1KG availability, additional \u03b1KG supply by Gdh enhances the Tet3 activity substantially.To further investigate the stimulatory effect of Gdh activity on Tet3, we applied the previously published Gdh inhibitor R162 on the GFP-Tet3/Gdh-FLAG expressing cells. R162, which is a purpurin analog, was shown to be a highly specific Gdh inhibitor with an inhibition and a dissociation constant (Ki and Kd) of around 30\u2009\u00b5M and a good cell permeability due to its allyl group46. In the presence of R162, the hmdC levels dropped by 60% and the fdC levels dropped by 40% (Fig.\u00a03e). Application of R162 did not decrease Tet3 activity in the cells expressing only GFP-Tet3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b), indicating that the endogenous (human) GDH does not contribute to the \u03b1KG supply of ectopically expressed murine Tet3.In order to check how the proximity of Gdh and Tet3 influences Tet3 activity, we repeated the experiment with a Gdh-FLAG construct additionally containing a nuclear export sequence (Gdh-FLAG-NES), to prevent nuclear localization of Gdh (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). We co-expressed Gdh-FLAG-NES with GFP-Tet3 and measured the hmdC and fdC levels compared to the GFP-Tet3/Gdh-FLAG expressing HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours post transfection, the hmdC and fdC levels were significantly lower in the GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG-NES expressing cells (Fig.\u00a04a). In addition, we were not able to mimic the effect of Gdh on Tet3 by the addition of 4\u2009mM of cell-permeable dimethyl-\u03b1KG (DM-\u03b1KG) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d), suggesting that the direct supply of Tet3 with \u03b1KG by Gdh in proximity is indeed enhancing Tet3 activity.Open in a separate windowFig. 4Gdh localization and influence of Gdh on Tet enzymes, gene expression and metabolism during neuronal stimulation.a Comparison of hmdC and fdC levels in HEK293T (n\u2009=\u20095 biologically independent samples) expressing GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG or GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG-NES for 24\u2009h.

Interestingly, when Gdh-FLAG was co-expressed with GFP-Tet3, Gdh-FLAG localization was ~40% nuclear and 60% mitochondrial (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). GFP-Tet3 showed only the expected nuclear localization. In contrast, nuclear localization of Gdh-FLAG was abolished when it was co-expressed with GFP alone (Fig.\u00a04b), indicating that the Gdh import into the nucleus is Tet3-dependent. We noted, however, that the expression of Tet3 and Gdh from two different promoters provided much higher Gdh levels than Tet3, which compromised interpretation of the data. Therefore, we repeated the experiment with a bicistronic vector including a T2A sequence that allowed for equimolar expression of FLAG3-Tet3 and Gdh from the same promoter. Previous studies confirmed that ribosome skipping at the T2A is very efficient, so that only low amounts of fusion proteins are formed, and that this expression system does not change the localization of the expressed proteins47,48. Using this expression system, we first investigated the possible formation of Tet3-Gdh fusion proteins and found none by western blotting, whereas a forced Tet3-Gdh fusion protein using the bicistronic vector with a mutated T2A sequence (T2A\u0394GP), which prevents the ribosome skipping event, showed a clear band at the expected size (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b). The following ICC studies revealed that in the presence of Tet3, Gdh was efficiently transported to the nucleus and only minor amounts of Gdh were detected in mitochondria. By comparison, the endogenous human GDH was only located in the mitochondria (Fig.\u00a04c), which might explain why the application of R162 did not change the Tet3 activity in the just GFP-Tet3 expressing cells. The forced Tet3-Gdh fusion protein did not locate to the nucleus but remained in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). Altogether, the data support our model that the nuclear localization of Gdh requires the presence of Tet3 and suggests that Tet3 itself, or a complex of which Tet3 is part of, mediates transfer of Gdh into the nucleus.Neuronal depolarization leads to Gdh-dependent stimulation of Tet enzymesTo transfer these findings from the HEK293T model system into a more physiological context, we exposed acute mouse hippocampal slices to depolarizing conditions (25\u2009mM KCl), which simulate stimulation and induce neural activity49. After 6\u2009h, we quantified the hmdC levels and compared them to the hmdC levels of hippocampal slices that were kept in parallel in a physiological buffer solution. Constant neuronal depolarization led to significantly increased global hmdC levels. In the presence of the Gdh inhibitor R162, however, this hmdC increase could be fully suppressed (Fig.\u00a04d). Although off-target effects of the pharmacological small-molecule inhibitor R162 could not be\u00a0fully excluded, previous publications gave no such indication46. Importantly, application of R162 allowed us to influence Gdh activity on the protein level directly and immediately. In contrast, siRNA-based approaches to knock-down Gdh expression by initiating Gdh-mRNA degradation do not affect Gdh activity directly and require transfection of siRNA, which might have comprised the quality of the sensible acute hippocampal slices.As a reversed approach, we applied UK5099, which acts as an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and as a stimulator of Gdh50. In this experimental set-up, a further increase in the hmdC levels after stimulation was observed (Fig.\u00a03d). These data suggest that Gdh is indeed involved in Tet-dependent hmdC generation upon neuronal activation.Quantification of \u03b1KG in the hippocampal slices before and after depolarization supported this interpretation. We detected a strong increase of the \u03b1KG concentration and an increase of the \u03b1KG/succinate ratio under depolarizing conditions. In the presence of the Gdh inhibitor R162, however, the \u03b1KG amount dropped significantly, while the \u03b1KG/succinate levels were back at the basal level (Fig.\u00a04e). These data suggest that a substantial amount of the \u03b1KG increase during neural activity is caused by the action of Gdh.We wanted to explore whether the metabolic stimulation of Tet-activity affects the expression levels of important neuronal genes. Neuronal stimulation is known to affect the DNA methylation status of several genes that modulate the response of the neuron toward present and future stimuli13,14. Among those genes, the neuronal PAS-domain containing protein 4 (Npas4) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) play a pivotal role in synaptic homeostasis, learning and memory formation51,52. We used RT-qPCR to quantify the expression of Npas4 and Bdnf and observed for both genes reduced transcription during neuronal stimulation upon addition of R162 (Fig.\u00a04f).It is known that spatial organization of the nucleus has a direct impact on gene expression and that localization of a gene at the nuclear laminar is associated with gene silencing, whereas proximity to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is linked to active gene expression53. Therefore, the gene-activating interaction of Tet3 and Gdh would be expected to proceed at the NPC. We noticed that a high number of Tet3 + Gdh-PLA signals in the hippocampus derived from the nuclear periphery (Fig.\u00a02e). To test for the hypothesis that the interaction between Tet3 and Gdh happens at the NPC, we investigated the individual interactions of Tet3 and Gdh with the NPC by PLA. Indeed, in both cases, we obtained PLA signals supporting that the Tet3/Gdh complex is localized close to the NPC (Fig.\u00a04g). In addition, proteomic analysis of a Tet3-coIP in nuclear brain lysate showed enrichment of several RNA-processing proteins like Fus (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b), which is a DNA/RNA-binding protein that is important for pre-mRNA binding and transport and has distinct functions in neuronal homeostasis54. However, how the interaction of Tet3 and Gdh is organized within the nucleus and how this spatial organization is specifically linked to gene expression, needs to be addressed in future studies.Altogether, our data support the idea that the interplay between nuclear Gdh for the NAD+-dependent manufacturing of \u03b1KG and Tet3 is a hinge that allows metabolism to influence active demethylation processes in neurons. The mechanisms how the interaction of Tet3 and Gdh is regulated and whether Tet3 and Gdh interact indirectly or directly, potentially as part of a larger complex requires further investigation. DiscussionGdh is responsible for the NAD+-dependent deamination of glutamate to \u03b1KG. Although it is known to be a mitochondrial enzyme and is expressed with an MTS, Gdh is reported to have an additional nuclear localization in neural contexts35,37,55. Our data confirm that neuronal Gdh has indeed a split spatial distribution with a substantial fraction of the protein being redirected to the nucleus, probably before entering the mitochondria. In neurons, glutamate is one of the most abundant metabolites making it in this respect an ideal starting material for the generation of large amounts of \u03b1KG. Our data suggest that one of the functions of Gdh in the nucleus is to supply Tet3 with \u03b1KG, thereby regulating Tet3-activity. Given that \u03b1KG is involved in many epigenetic processes and energy metabolism in general15, elevating the effective \u03b1KG molarity solely in the presence of Tet3 is an elegant way to avoid globally changing \u03b1KG levels, which could produce various side effects. This puts Gdh in line with other mitochondrial proteins, such as the PDC or enzymes of the TCA cycle that can be also translocated to the nucleus for controlled intranuclear metabolite biosynthesis and consequently metabolic regulation of gene expression by changing histone modifications21,56. Our data expand this coupling between metabolism and epigenetics to the Tet-dependent oxidation of mdC to hmdC and likely further on to fdC and cadC. Since Gdh requires NAD+ for the conversion of glutamate into \u03b1KG, these oxidation reactions are seemingly associated with the NAD+ levels in the nucleus. NAD+ is an essential small-molecule cofactor that is biosynthesized in a compartmentalized manner by different nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) in the nucleus (NMNAT-1), in the cytoplasm (NMNAT-2) and in mitochondria (NMNAT-3)57. It was recently shown that the nuclear NAD+ levels fluctuate depending on the metabolic state of the cell and it was suggested that the compartmentalized NAD+ biosynthesis plays a key role in controlling transcriptional processes58. Although we are far from understanding how a shift in energy and NAD+ metabolism leads to the controlled activation of specific genes, our data suggest that nuclear localized Gdh for the NAD+-dependent on-site biosynthesis of \u03b1KG to steer Tet3 activity, can be an important contributor and regulator.

DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich D6546) or RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich R0883), containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen 10500-064), 1% (v/v) l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich G8541), and 1% (v/v) penicillin\u2013streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich P0781), were used as growing medium. When reaching a confluence of 70\u201380%, the cells were routinely passaged. Cells were tested at least once in 2 months for Mycoplasma contamination using Mycoplasma Detection Kit (JenaBioscience PP-401L).Transfection of HEK293T cellsTransfection of HEK293T cells for high protein expression The transfection was performed in four p150 petri dishes (Sarstedt 83.3903.300). Five to six million cells per p150 were seeded in 25\u2009mL of medium. After seeding, the cells were incubated for 24\u2009h to reach a confluence of 40\u201380%. Ten micrograms of expression plasmid DNA and 30\u2009\u00b5L of the transfection reagent jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfection VWR 114-15) were used as described by the manufacturer. Four hours and 28\u2009h after transfection the medium was changed, and sodium butyrate (final conc. 4\u2009mM) was added. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and immediately used for protein extract preparation.Transfection of HEK293T cells for ICC The transfection was performed in 15\u2009\u00b5\u2014slide eight-well plates (ibidi 80826). A total of 2\u20133\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were seeded per well in 200\u2009\u00b5L of medium. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were transfected using 150\u2009ng of DNA per expression plasmid, 0.5\u2009\u00b5L of jetPRIME, and 15\u2009\u00b5L of jetPRIME buffer. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed once with PBS supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2 (PBS+, Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline, Sigma-Aldrich D8662) and immunofluorescence staining was performed.In case of the bicistronic vector construct, cells were transfected with 200\u2009ng plasmid DNA. 4\u2009h after transfection, expression was induced by doxycycline (1\u2009\u00b5g/mL final concentration) and 24\u2009h after induction, cells were washed once with PBS+ and ICC was performed.Transfection of HEK293T cells for UHPLC-QQQ-MS The transfection was performed in six-well plates (Sarstedt 83.3920.300). A total of 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were seeded per well in 3\u2009mL of RPMI medium. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were transfected using 1.5\u2009\u00b5g of DNA per expression plasmid (combination of GFP-Tet3 and one of the Glud1 expression plasmids), 4\u2009\u00b5L of jetPRIME, and 150\u2009\u00b5L of jetPRIME buffer. In case of GFP-Tet3 only expressing cells, 1.5\u2009\u00b5g of pESG-iba45 were co-transfected to keep the amount of transfected DNA constant. Six hours after transfection, the medium was changed and 10, 24, and 48\u2009h after transfection, the cells were harvested and washed once with 1\u2009mL of ice-cold PBS. Hundred microliters were used for GFP signal quantification of living cells using FACS (BD LSRFortessa; FSC 130\u2009V, SSC 300\u2009V, GFP 370\u2009V\u2009log, 10,000 events per measurement), the rest was lysed and gDNA was isolated and analyzed by UHPLC-QQQ-MS as described previously using the Agilent 6400 Series Triple Quadrupole LC/MS System with the associated MassHunter Workstation Acquisition software and MassHunter Quantitative Analysis software45. The hmdC/dN values were subsequently divided by the mean GFP signal to obtain hmdC/(dN*RFU).When cells were fed with 4\u2009mM DM-\u03b1KG, DM-\u03b1KG was added with the medium change 6\u2009h after transfection.Protein extract preparationProtein extract preparation from transfected HEK293T cells The harvested HEK293T cells and the resulting lysate were kept on ice during the preparation at\u00a0all time. Per eight million cells, 1\u2009mL of RIPA buffer (10\u2009mM Tris (pH\u2009=\u20097.5), 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 % (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate), supplemented with 2.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 100\u2009U/mL benzonase (Merck Millipore 70746-3) and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, Roche 05056489001) on the day of preparation was used for the lysis. Cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer and lysed for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C on a tube rotator. Afterward, the lysate was centrifuged (10,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 15\u2009min, 4\u2009\u00b0C) and the supernatant containing the proteins was transferred into a new tube. To enrich GFP-tagged proteins, the lysate was immediately incubated with GFP Nano-Traps either on agarose beads (Chromotek gta-20, for in vitro activity assay) or on magnetic agarose beads (Chromotek gtma-20).Protein extract preparations from murine brain Protein extracts from whole murine brain (Mus musculus, C57-BL6/J wild type, both genders, 110 days old; Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany), including separation into the organelle, the cytosolic, and the nuclear fraction, were prepared according to a previously published protocol61. The nuclear extract was then treated with 25\u2009U/mL benzonase for 30\u2009min on ice and subsequently centrifuged (21,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g, 15\u2009min, 4\u2009\u00b0C). The supernatant containing the nuclear lysate was transferred to a new tube. A Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad 5000006) was performed according to the manufacturer\u00b4s instructions to determine the protein concentration. To check whether the nuclear fraction showed specific enrichment for nuclear proteins in comparison to the combined organelle/cytosolic fraction and was not heavily contaminated with proteins from other compartments, a western blot against histone H3 (nuclear) and cytochrome c (mitochondrial) was performed. The western blot confirmed the specific enrichment of nuclear proteins in the nuclear fraction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c).Protein extracts from mESC and HEK293T Protein extracts from mESC J1 wt, mESC TET TKO (primed for 96\u2009h according to a previously published protocol62), and HEK293T were prepared as previously described63.In vitro activity assayFor the in vitro activity assay on GFP Nano-Trap on agarose beads, GFP-Tet1cd or GFP-Tet3cd bound to the trap was used. The proteins were ectopically expressed in HEK293T (per in vitro assay 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009P150 culture dishes for GFP-Tet1cd, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009P150 culture dishes for GFP-Tet3cd) and the resulting protein extracts were incubated for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C on a tube rotator with 140\u2009\u00b5L of GFP Nano-Traps on agarose beads per extract. Afterwards, the beads were washed twice with coIP wash buffer 1 (10\u2009mM HEPES pH = 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA), twice with coIP wash buffer 2 (10\u2009mM HEPES pH\u2009=\u20097.5, 1\u2009M NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA) and twice with coIP wash buffer 1. The fluorescence of the GFP-tagged proteins bound to the GFP Nano-Trap was checked on a Tecan Plate Reader (Tecan GENios Pro, fluorescence intensity excitation 400\u2009nm, emission 535\u2009nm) and per reaction, the amount of Nano-Trap was adjusted that the fluorescence signal was 25,000 per reaction. Per assay, seven reactions in TET reaction buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH\u2009=\u20097.5, 100\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM Vitamin C, 1.2\u2009mM ATP, 2.5\u2009mM DTT, 0.1\u2009mM Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 6\u2009\u00d7\u2009H2O) with different concentrations of \u03b1KG (0\u2009\u00b5M; 10\u2009\u00b5M; 50\u2009\u00b5M; 100\u2009\u00b5M; 250\u2009\u00b5M; 500\u2009\u00b5M; 1000\u2009\u00b5M) and 4\u2009\u00b5M of DNA oligonucleotide (5\u2032-TTTTG[mdC]GGTTG-3\u2032) were set up in 50\u2009\u00b5L reaction volume/sample. The samples were incubated at 35\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h under shaking. For MALDI-TOF measurements, 1\u2009\u00b5L of the reaction supernatant was desalted on a 0.025\u2009\u00b5m \u00f8 VSWP filter membrane against ddH2O for at least one hour, co-crystallized in a 3-hydroxypicolinic acid matrix (HPA) and mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex II in a m/z range of 1500\u20136000. Spectra were normalized to the recorded maximum intensity. For each condition (GFP-Tet1cd or GFP-Tet3cd, defined \u03b1KG concentration) three independent experiments were set up and MALDI-TOF spectra recorded. Afterward, the mean was calculated. The area under the curve was calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.0 or higher) for mdC in the m/z range 3373.5\u20133389.0 and 3397.5\u20133404.5 (Na+ peak), hmdC and fdC in the m/z range 3389.0\u20133397.5 and cadC in the m/z range 3404.5\u20133410.To determine the \u03b1KG concentration where half-maximal conversion rate is achieved, DNA oligonucleotides were purified after the assay using the Oligo Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research D4061). Fifty picomoles of the DNA oligonucleotide were digested and analyzed by UHPLC-QQQ-MS according to a previously published protocol45. As isotopologues D3-mdC, D2-15N2-hmdC, 15N2-fdC, 15N2-cadC (10 pmol each), and 13C10-15N2-dT (120 pmol) were spiked in per 50\u2009\u00b5L sample. The absolute amounts [pmol] of hmdC, fdC, cadC were calculated and normalized to the absolute amount of dT. As for the conversion to hmdC one molecule of \u03b1KG is needed, for the conversion to fdC two molecules and for the conversion to cadC three molecules, the conversion rate was calculated as (n(hmdC)+2*n(fdC)+3*n(cadC))/n(dT).Tet3-enriched coIPTwenty microliters of magnetic anti-GFP beads (Chromotek gtma-20) were washed three times with GFP wash buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA) and then incubated for 15\u2009min on ice with nuclear extract of GFP-Tet3 overexpressing HEK293T cells. To ensure the saturation of the beads with the GFP-fusion construct, different amounts of lysate were tested and monitored using a Tecan Reader. The GFP-Tet3 loaded beads were then washed twice with coIP wash buffer 1, twice with coIP wash buffer 2 and twice with lysis buffer C (20\u2009mM HEPES pH\u2009=\u20097.5, 420\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol). The GFP-Tet3 beads were subsequently incubated with 200\u2009\u00b5g of nuclear brain extract for 15\u2009min on ice. Following, they were washed twice with GFP wash buffer (10\u2009mM Tris pH\u2009=\u20097.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5\u2009mM EDTA). To elute the bound proteins, 50\u2009\u00b5l of 200\u2009mM glycine pH 2.5 were added and the solution was vortexed for 30\u2009s. To gain more yield, the elution step was repeated. For the negative control, the same procedure was followed using GFP instead of GFP-Tet3.Tet3-endogenous coIPCoIP of endogenous Tet3 was performed using nuclear brain extract. Five hundred micrograms of nuclear brain extract, 2\u2009\u00b5g of antibody, and 20\u2009\u00b5L of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher 10003D) were used per replicate. Anti-goat IgG was used for the negative control, which was performed with the same amounts.The nuclear brain extract was incubated with the antibody for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C on a tube rotator and the Dynabeads Protein G were washed three times with GFP wash buffer. Afterward, the Dynabeads were added to the lysate, PBS was added to a final volume of 500\u2009\u00b5L and the suspension was incubated for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C on a tube rotator. After incubation, the beads were washed three times 10\u2009min with coIP wash buffer 1. Last, proteins were eluted with 50\u2009\u00b5L of SDS loading buffer (50\u2009mM Tris pH 6.8, 100\u2009mM DTT, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue) for 10\u2009min at 70\u2009\u00b0C.LC\u2013MS/MS analysisSamples for the mass spectrometer were reduced by the addition of 100\u2009mM TCEP and subsequent incubation for 1\u2009h at 60\u2009\u00b0C on a shaker at 650\u2009rpm. They were then alkylated by adding 200\u2009mM iodoacetamide and incubating for 30\u2009min at room temperature in the dark. Following, the samples were digested with 0.5\u2009\u00b5g trypsin (Promega V5113) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 16\u2009h. Afterward, they were incubated for 5\u2009min at 100\u2009\u00b0C, and subsequently 1\u2009mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride was added. StageTips were utilized to purify the samples for MS64.The samples were analyzed with an UltiMate 3000 nano liquid chromatography system (Dionex, Fisher Scientific) attached to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific). They were desalted and concentrated on a \u00b5-precolumn cartridge (PepMap100, C18, 5\u2009\u00b5M, 100\u2009\u00c5, size 300\u2009\u00b5m i.d. \u00d7 5\u2009mm) and further processed on a custom-made analytical column (ReproSil-Pur, C18, 3\u2009\u00b5M, 120\u2009\u00c5, packed into a 75\u2009\u00b5m i.d. \u00d7 150\u2009mm and 8\u2009\u00b5m picotip emitter).The samples were processed via a 127\u2009min multi-step analytical separation at a flow rate of 300\u2009nL/min. The gradient with percentages of solvent B was programmed as follows:1% for 1\u2009min; 1\u20134% over 1\u2009min; 4\u201324% over 100\u2009min; 24\u201360% over 8\u2009min; 60\u201385% over 2\u2009min; 85% for 5\u2009min; 85\u20131% over 2\u2009min; 1% for 8\u2009min.Mass spectrometric analysis was done with a full mass scan in the mass range between m/z 300 and 1700 at a resolution of 60,000. Following this survey scan, five scans were performed using the ion trap mass analyzer at a normal resolution setting and wideband CID fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 35. Signals with an unrecognized charge state or a charge state of 1 were not picked for fragmentation. To avoid supersampling of the peptides, an exclusion list was implemented with the following settings: after 2 measurements in 30\u2009s, the peptide was excluded for 90\u2009s.LFQ data processingThe MaxQuant65 software (version 1.5.0.25) was used for LFQ. Quantification was performed with four biological replicates for Tet3-enriched coIP. GFP alone (four biological replicates) served here as control. The Andromeda search engine was used in combination with Uniprot databases (Mus musculus). A maximum of two missed cleavage sites was allowed. The main search peptide tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as static modification. Variable modifications were Acetyl (Protein N-term) and Oxidation (M). The LFQ algorithm was applied with default settings. The option \u201cmatch between runs\u201d was also used. The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE66 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD004518.LFQ data were analyzed with the Perseus software (version 1.5.0.9). The LFQ intensities were log transformed and only proteins identified in at least three samples were retained. As one of the GFP control quadruplicates contained only 64 proteins instead of >400, this replicate was removed from the dataset. Gene ontology analyses were performed with the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7).Western blottingSamples were loaded on a 4\u201315% precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and MagicMark XP Standard (Thermo Fisher LC5603) and Blue Prestained Protein Standard, Broad Range (11\u2013190\u2009kDa) (New England Biolabs P7706S) or Color-coded Prestained Protein Marker, Broad Range (11\u2013250\u2009kDa) (New England Biolabs 14208) were used as protein standards. The gel was run at constant 150\u2009V for 60\u2009min in SDS running buffer (25\u2009mM Tris, 192\u2009mM glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). For blotting, we used a PVDF blotting membrane (GE Healthcare Amersham Hybond P0.45 PVDF membrane 10600023) and pre-cooled Towbin blotting buffer (25\u2009mM Tris, 192\u2009mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.038% (w/v) SDS). The membrane was activated for 1\u2009min in methanol, washed with water, and equilibrated for additional 1\u2009min in Towbin blotting buffer; the Whatman gel blotting papers (Sigma-Aldrich WHA 10426981) were equilibrated for 15\u2009min in Towbin buffer and the precast gel was equilibrated for 5\u2009min in Towbin buffer after the run. Western blotting (tank (wet) electro transfer) was performed at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009h at constant 35\u2009V. After blotting, the PVDF membrane was blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature using 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T (20\u2009mM Tris pH\u2009=\u20097.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20). The primary antibodies were diluted in 5\u2009mL of 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T. The blocking suspension was discarded, and the diluted primary antibodies were added for 12\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C and shaking. After incubation, the primary antibodies were discarded, and the membrane was washed three times 10\u2009min with TBS-T. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% (w/v) milk powder in TBS-T and added for 1\u2009h at room temperature under shaking. In case of Tet3-endogenous coIP samples, TidyBlot HRP-conjugated Western blot detection reagent (Bio-Rad STAR209P) was used instead of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies if the primary antibody against the potential interactor was produced in rabbit to avoid detection of the antibody fragments from the coIP. Afterward, the membrane was washed two times with TBS-T and one time with TBS (TBS-T without Tween-20) before SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific 34077) was used for imaging. Western blots were imaged using Amersham Imager 680 (auto exposure mode).IHCAll steps were performed in a humidity chamber and at room temperature when not otherwise specified. Twelve micrometers thick coronar cryo-sections of snap-frozen adult mouse brain and liver were incubated (if applicable) with MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Invitrogen {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"M22426\",\"term_id\":\"197107\",\"term_text\":\"M22426\"}}M22426) before fixation. Cryo-sections were fixed on slides using 4% paraformaldehyde (4% PFA, Thermo Scientific 28908) in 0.1\u2009M phosphate-buffered solution, pH 7.4 (0.1\u2009M PB). After three times washing with 0.1\u2009M PB, the slices were permeabilized and blocked for 30\u2009min using 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5% (v/v) blocking reagent CB (Chemiblocker, Merck Millipore 2170) in 0.1\u2009M PB. The primary antibodies were diluted in 0.1\u2009M PB, containing 5% (v/v) CB and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and applied for 12\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. For the negative controls, no primary antibodies were added. After incubation, slices were washed three times with 0.1\u2009M PB containing 2% (v/v) CB. For secondary detection, the fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.1\u2009M PB, containing 3% (v/v) CB and applied the antibodies for 1\u2009h in the dark, followed by three times washing with 0.1\u2009M PB. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5\u2009\u00b5g/mL), which was applied for 10\u2009min in the dark, followed by one washing step with 0.1\u2009M PB. After mounting (Mountant Permafluor Thermo Scientific TA-030-FM), the slices were analyzed using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope with the associated LAS X software (Leica, Wetzlar).ICCICC experiments were performed as IHC experiments, but instead of 0.1\u2009M PB PBS+ was used. When ICC of transfected HEK293T cells was analyzed, Image J (version 2.0.0) was used.PLAFor the PLA experiments, Duolink InSitu Orange Starter Kit (Sigma-Aldrich DUO92102 and DUO92106) was used. Until the application of primary antibodies, the procedure followed the IHC and ICC procedures described above. PLA probes without primary antibodies served as a negative control. After incubation with primary antibodies, slices/cells were washed once with 0.1\u2009M PB/PBS+. The following steps were carried out as described by the manufacturer with modifications after the last washing step as described in the manual with 0.01 wash buffer B. Before staining of cell nuclei and mounting, slices/cells were washed with 0.1\u2009M PB/PBS+. Where applicable, Alexa488-NeuN antibody was applied for 2\u2009h in 2% (v/v) CB in 0.1\u2009M PB and slices were washed afterwards three times with 0.1\u2009M PB. However, Alexa488-NeuN application impaired the intensity of the PLA signal. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (5\u2009\u00b5g/mL), which was applied for 10\u2009min in the dark, followed by one washing step with 0.1\u2009M PB/PBS+. After mounting (Mountant Permafluor Thermo Scientific TA-030-FM), the slices were analyzed using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar).Isolation of genomic DNA (gDNA), RNA, and UHPLC-QQQ-MSIsolation of gDNA, RNA, and UHPLC-QQQ-MS experiments were performed according to a previously published protocol45.Synthesis of the Gdh inhibitor R162Synthesis of the inhibitor R162 was done according to the literature67,68. Prior to use for the cell culture, the compound was purified via preparative HPLC (Nucleosil VP 250/10 C18 column Macherey Nagel, 100% MeCN for 10\u2009min).Depolarization of hippocampal neurons followed by UHPLC-QQQ-MS analysisAnimals Four- to five-week-old C57-BL6/J (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) wild-type mice of both genders were used.Hippocampal slices Acute transverse hippocampal slices (400 \u03bcm thick) were prepared as described previously69,70. In brief, the brain was removed, the hippocampi of each hemisphere were dissected and cut using a MX-TS tissue slicer (Siskiyou Cooperation, OR). The slices were collected in an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) physiological solution (118\u2009mM NaCl, 3\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM NaH2PO4, 25\u2009mM NaHCO3, 10\u2009mM glucose, 1.5\u2009mM CaCl2, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) DMSO) at 37\u2009\u00b0C until the hippocampi of all replicates were cut. Then the slices were distributed to three different conditions: oxygenated physiological solution, oxygenated 25\u2009mM KCl solution (118\u2009mM NaCl, 25\u2009mM KCl, 1\u2009mM NaH2PO4, 25\u2009mM NaHCO3, 10\u2009mM Glucose, 1.5\u2009mM CaCl2, 1\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) DMSO) and oxygenated 25\u2009mM KCl solution supplemented with 20\u2009\u00b5M inhibitor R162 or 40\u2009\u00b5M UK5099 (Sigma-Aldrich PZ0160-5MG). Six to ten slices were pooled for each replicate. After 6\u2009h incubation time, the slices were transferred into reaction tubes, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until use. Isolation of gDNA, subsequent digest of gDNA, and analysis by UHPLC-QQQ-MS were performed according to a previously published protocol45.We excluded mice from further analysis (hmdC quantification and gene expression) when Npas4 expression was not upregulated in the depolarized hippocampal slices compared to the unstimulated control (one mouse out of eight for R162 experiment and two mice out of eight for UK5099 experiment) as this is an indicator that stimulation did not work, and the slices might be damaged.RT-qPCRFor cDNA synthesis, the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific K1621) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. One hundred ninety nanograms of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific) using PowerUpTM SYBRTM Green qPCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific A25742). CT values of each sample were determined in technical duplicates by the StepOneTM Software (Applied Biosystems Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the fast cycle protocol. The relative expression levels of target genes were then quantified from seven biological replicates (n\u2009=\u20097) according to Pfaffl et al.71,72.The primers for RT-qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01 and the following primers have been published previously:Npas4 (mouse)73Bdnf total (mouse)74MetabolomicsPre-weighed frozen hippocampal tissues from six mice (n\u2009=\u20096) per condition (physiological solution, 25\u2009mM KCl, 25\u2009mM KCl + R162) were homogenized using a bullet blender and five 1.4\u2009mm stainless steel beads in a mixture of 1.05\u2009ml ice-cold methanol/chloroform 1:2 (v/v). Following sonication of supernatants for 1\u2009min, an additional 0.7\u2009ml mixture of chloroform/LC grade water, 1:1 (v/v) were added, samples were vortexed for 20\u2009s and incubated on wet ice for 30\u2009min. Extracts were then centrifuged for 5\u2009min at 16,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g and 4\u2009\u00b0C and 0.6\u2009ml from the upper aqueous phase were collected and dried under nitrogen gas. For NMR measurements, the dried extracts were dissolved in 0.25\u2009ml 0.15\u2009M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in deuterated water containing 0.04\u2009mM sodium trimethylsilylpropionate-d4 (TSP) as internal standard. One 1D proton NMR was collected for each sample in a 14.1\u2009T Bruker Avance II NMR under standardized conditions as described in Kostidis et al., 201740. The NMR buffer was degassed, and NMR tubes were flushed with nitrogen to prevent oxidation. Metabolites were quantified in Chenomx NMR suit 8.4 (Chenomx Inc, Canada) and concentrations were corrected according to the tissue mass per sample. One mouse was completely excluded from further analysis as one sample out of the three conditions was lost during the sample preparation.Statistics and ReproducibilityDetails about the statistical analysis Statistical analysis, except for LFQ data processing as described above, was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.0 or higher) and only measurements from biological independent samples were considered.Figure 3d:For each biologically independent sample, hmdC/dN, fdC/dN, and cadC/dN values were normalized to the GFP signal to balance different Tet3 expression levels between the GFP-Tet3 and the GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG expressing cells, resulting in hmdC/(dN*RFU), fdC/(dN*RFU) and cadC/(dN*RFU). Samples were grouped (columns: Group A GFP-Tet3, Group B GFP-Tet3 + Gdh-FLAG; rows: 10, 24, 48 h post transfection; n\u2009=\u20093 biologically independent samples for each condition). For analysis, multiple t-tests (one per row, all of them two-sided) were chosen with individual variances between the rows.
