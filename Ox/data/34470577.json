{"title": "hnRNPH1-MTR4 complex-mediated regulation of NEAT1v2 stability is critical for IL8 expression", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1080/15476286.2021.1971439", "PMID": "34470577", "abstract": "Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are localized in the nucleus and play important roles in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and antiviral response. Yet, it remains unclear how some nuclear lncRNAs are turned over. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) controls expression levels of NEAT1v2, a lncRNA involved in the formation of nuclear paraspeckles. hnRNPH1 associates, in an RNA-independent manner, with the RNA helicase MTR4/MTREX, an essential co-factor of the nuclear ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. hnRNPH1 localizes in nuclear speckles and depletion of hnRNPH1 enhances NEAT1v2-mediated expression of the IL8 mRNA, encoding a cytokine involved in the innate immune response. Taken together, our results indicate that the hnRNPH1-MTR4 linkage regulates IL8 expression through the degradation of NEAT1v2 RNA.", "author": [{"author": "Tanzina Tanu", "affiliation": ["Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."], "href": "/?term=Tanu+T&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Kenzui Taniue", "affiliation": ["Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."], "href": "/?term=Taniue+K&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Katsutoshi Imamura", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."], "href": "/?term=Imamura+K&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Rena Onoguchi-Mizutani", "affiliation": ["Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."], "href": "/?term=Onoguchi-Mizutani+R&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Han Han", "affiliation": ["Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."], "href": "/?term=Han+H&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Torben Heick Jensen", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark."], "href": "/?term=Jensen+TH&cauthor_id=34470577"}, {"author": "Nobuyoshi Akimitsu", "affiliation": ["Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."], "href": "/?term=Akimitsu+N&cauthor_id=34470577"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["34470577", "35008922"], "body": ""}
