We report here that SIRT3 responds dynamically to both exercise and nutritional signals in skeletal muscle to coordinate downstream molecular responses. We show that exercise training increases SIRT3 expression as well as associated CREB phosphorylation and PGC-1alpha up-regulation. Furthermore, we show that SIRT3 is more highly expressed in slow oxidative type I soleus muscle compared to fast type II extensor digitorum longus or gastrocnemius muscles. Additionally, we find that SIRT3 protein levels in skeletal muscle are sensitive to diet, for SIRT3 expression increases by fasting and caloric restriction, yet it is decreased by high-fat diet. Interestingly, the caloric restriction regimen also leads to phospho-activation of AMPK in muscle. Conversely in SIRT3 knockout mice, we find that the phosphorylation of both AMPK and CREB and the expression of PGC-1alpha are down regulated, suggesting that these key cellular factors may be important components of SIRT3-mediated biological signals in vivo.", "author": [{"author": "Orsolya M Palacios", "affiliation": ["USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA."], "href": "/?term=Palacios+OM&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Juan J Carmona", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Carmona+JJ&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Shaday Michan", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Michan+S&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Ke Yun Chen", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Chen+KY&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Yasuko Manabe", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Manabe+Y&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Jack Lee Ward 3rd", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ward+JL+3rd&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Laurie J Goodyear", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Goodyear+LJ&cauthor_id=20157566"}, {"author": "Qiang Tong", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Tong+Q&cauthor_id=20157566"}], "refPMID": ["16079181", "15128440", "17079682", "17447894", "18363549", "18215119", "18243090", "16959573", "19410549", "15653680", "12374852", "12186850", "17923681", "16788062", "18710944", "18781224", "18794531", "18680753", "17059877", "15676284", "17003781", "17889652", "15922648", "12006582", "16511594", "17018837", "10412986", "12181572", "18662766", "11701451", "12444247", "17609368", "16054041", "14511394", "14614828", "12829626", "10891387", "9124333", "12546677", "17513699", "17253964", "15734680", "17900900", "17141505", "16790548", "19343720", "14712665", "18477450", "19262508", "15236799", "15574588", "16203737", "18063805", "12764228", "11557984", "17347648", "19197138", "19370020", "18782868", "19031335", "18716044", "19241369", "9560157", "19333382"], "citedInPMID": ["20157566", "35145250", "35111364", "34927079", "34836000", "34685718", "34675216", "34466690", "34417576", "34368393", "34307407", "34233766", "34095262", "33812060", "33806509", "33744652", "33670751", "33546195", "33467601", "33264618", "33228041", "33191653", "32900951", "32850822", "32812928", "32722320", "32281286", "32127290", "32059421", "31970155", "31866862", "31781563", "31474877", "31447696", "31273946", "31227962", "31207144", "31163574", "31130874", "31118897", "31116256", "31076465", "31060926", "31037127", "30837897", "30629044", "30574122", "30526767", "30360430", "30301195", "30132870", "30131726", "30090057", "30072092", "29976853", "29942262", "29849892", "29728917", "29727194", "29643974", "29634313", "29607218", "29589261", "29561771", "29405707", "29324783", "29321682", "29238464", "29086496", "29072685", "29036909", "28944303", "28911171", "28900532", "28804120", "28400503", "28368421", "28008317", "27902456", "27882448", "27825999", "27686535", "27619151", "27604398", "27126807", "27125278", "27076782", "27007507", "26928655", "26838314", "26823952", "26813102", "26698917", "26607973", "26525455", "26359086", "26358839", "26341783", "26269447", "26064858", "26025548", "25993470", "25979234", "25915406", "25871545", "25853572", "25852572", "25830094", "25759382", "25738461", "25670830", "25555707", "25548801", "25545135", "25490091", "25489948", "25395096", "25225604", "25192254", "25133775", "25132912", "25092577", "24969917", "24966184", "24877878", "24748594", "24726383", "24616566", "24611611", "24559845", "24454908", "24425766", "24382869", "24363305", "24338337", "24263979", "24258614", "24192814", "24178296", "24167500", "24050258", "24046746", "24039710", "24037427", "24020003", "23997790", "23888142", "23835326", "23767918", "23762877", "23661364", "23604553", "23505614", "23454760", "23437220", "23233333", "23197187", "23168278", "23153280", "23086951", "23024761", "23024708", "22978553", "22885100", "22819776", "22811431", "22749020", "22681576", "22672615", "22653216", "22645641", "22643536", "22536229", "22436696", "22396207", "22395773", "22388573", "22229339", "22203837", "22119802", "22085885", "22081942", "22067656", "21985785", "21906315", "21901160", "21879450", "21841070", "21840382", "21788651", "21755522", "21706162", "21614150", "21539480", "21475674", "21388966", "21224864", "21212461", "20863707", "20685942", "20677216", "20078221", "20000467"], "body": " Abstract\n                     SIRT3 is a member of the sirtuin family\n                        of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, which is localized to the\n                        mitochondria and is enriched in kidney, brown adipose tissue, heart, and\n                        other metabolically active tissues.

The seven mammalian sirtuins\n                        (SIRT1-7) sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are localized\n                        differentially within the cell and have a variety of functions [1,2]. SIRT1 is the most extensively studied member of the family and\n                        regulates diverse biological processes ranging from DNA repair and genome\n                        stability to glucose and lipid homeostasis [3,4]. Although three specific sirtuins, SIRT3-5, are found in the\n                        mitochondria [5,6], not much is known about their function in vivo [7]. SIRT4 has been shown to regulate amino acid-stimulated insulin\n                        secretion by targeting glutamate\n                        dehydrogenase [8], and it was recently demonstrated that SIRT5 participates in the\n                        urea cycle [9]. Among the mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3 possesses the most\n                        robust deacetylase activity [10-12]. Indeed, significantly higher levels of mitochondrial\n                        protein acetylation were detected in the livers of SIRT3-null mice, compared to\n                        those of SIRT4 or SIRT5 knockout animals [13]. However,\n                        little is known about the physiological role of SIRT3 despite the fact that a\n                        number of SIRT3 substrates and co-precipitating proteins have been identified:\n                        acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 [14], Ku70 [15], FOXO3a [16], subunit 9\n                        of mitochondrial Complex I(NDUFA9) [17], glutamate\n                        dehydrogenase [13,18] and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 [18].\n                    \n            SIRT3 has been linked to longevity in men [19,20] and aberrant expression of this sirtuin correlates with\n                        node-positive breast cancer in clinical biopsies from women [21]\u2014suggesting\n                        that SIRT3 serves as an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in human\n                        health/aging and disease, affecting men and women in unique ways. In human\n                        cells, we have shown that SIRT3, along with SIRT4, is required for\n                        Nampt-mediated cell survival after genotoxic stress, wherein maintenance of\n                        mitochondrial NAD+ levels inhibits apoptosis [22]. Previously\n                        we also reported in murine brown adipose tissue that the RNA level of SIRT3\n                        increases by cold exposure and caloric restriction (CR) and that constitutive\n                        expression of SIRT3, in brown pre-adipocytes, stimulates downstream\n                        CREB-mediated expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and other\n                        mitochondrial-related genes [10]. In this\n                        study, we investigated the physiological conditions that regulate SIRT3 in\n                        skeletal muscle, a metabolically active organ vital for insulin-mediated\n                        glucose disposal and lipid catabolism. Notably, skeletal muscle strongly\n                        influences whole-body lipid metabolism, as lipid catabolism provides up to 70%\n                        of the energy usage for resting muscle [23]. In this\n                        tissue, the balance between fatty acid availability and fatty acid oxidation\n                        rates plays an important role in regulating insulin responses, and\n                        intramuscular fatty acid metabolites like diacylglycerol may cause insulin\n                        resistance [24]. Therefore, studying the role of molecular factors and\n                        pathways acting in muscle under various dietary and environmental conditions\n                        will be critical for better understanding metabolism, health, and disease.\n                    \n            In skeletal muscle, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\n                        gamma coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), a nuclear receptor co-activator, plays\n                        multiple roles in metabolic regulation [25,26]. It stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis [27], induces muscle fiber-type switch, and increases oxidative\n                        capacity in skeletal muscle cells [28]. In addition to transcriptional activation by CREB [29], it has been shown that\n                        AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also increases\n                        PGC-1\u03b1 expression [30,31] and\n                        activates it by direct phosphorylation [32]. AMPK is also a key molecular sensor and regulator of\n                        muscle metabolism.\n                    \n            AMPK is a ubiquitous heterotrimeric\n                        serine/threonine protein kinase, which functions as a fuel sensor in many\n                        tissues, including skeletal muscle [33]. AMPK is allosterically activated by AMP and by phosphorylation\n                        at Thr172 in the catalytic \u03b1-subunit, mainly by\n                        an upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1 [34,35]. Importantly, AMPK is stimulated by cellular stresses that\n                        deplete ATP and elevate AMP, such as diet restriction/hypoglycemia [36], exercise [37], and muscular contraction [38]. Activated AMPK stimulates ATP-generating catabolic pathways,\n                        such as cellular glucose uptake and fatty acid \u03b1-oxidation.\n                        AMPK activation also represses ATP-consuming processes, such as lipogenesis, to\n                        restore intracellular energy balance [33,39].\n                    \n            Our work seeks to further\n                        elucidate the role of sirtuins within health and disease, with particular focus\n                        on muscle tissue in this study. We report here that expression of SIRT3 in skeletal\n                        muscle is sensitive to various signals from both diet and exercise, leading to\n                        downstream activation of AMPK and up-regulation of PGC-1\u03b1. SIRT3 is therefore a potential\n                        key regulator of skeletal muscle biology, responding to important environmental\n                        cues and activating cellular factors in vivo.\n                    \n             ResultsSIRT3 is regulated in\n                            skeletal muscle by exercise\n                            training \n                        We first assayed the SIRT3 expression\n                            profile in vivo to compare the whole-body distribution of SIRT3,\n                            specifically across muscles to tissues like adipose and kidney, where SIRT3 has\n                            been previously described. As predicted,\n                            the SIRT3 tissue distribution pattern mirrors that of SIRT3 mRNA [11]. Indeed,\n                            SIRT3 exhibits high expression in important metabolically active tissues like\n                            kidney, brown fat, liver, and brain (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). When comparing expression\n                            across muscle samples, we noticed that SIRT3 protein levels were higher in the\n                            slow-twitch soleus muscle compared to the fast-twitch muscles like extensor\n                            digitorum longus and gastrocnemius, in agreement with higher mitochondrial\n                            content and the oxidative feature of the soleus muscle.\n                        \n                Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Tissue distribution of SIRT3 protein.\n                                            The SIRT3\n                                                protein is abundantly expressed in the brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver,\n                                                kidney, heart, brain, and soleus muscle, but very low in white adipose\n                                                tissue (WAT), the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL), or the\n                                                gastrocnemius muscle (Gastro). For each sample, 50 \u03bcg of protein was\n                                                loaded into a 10% acrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to a\n                                                nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed using an anti-SIRT3 serum\n                                                or an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody. Blots were quantified with ImageQuant and\n                                                SIRT3/actin ratios are provided; since gastrocnemius (Gastro) has the\n                                                lowest SIRT3 expression in vivo, normalization (l.0) was set with\n                                                respect to this tissue.\n                                        \n                        To study the role of SIRT3 in muscle\n                            within the context of exercise biology, we next tested if SIRT3 protein levels\n                            were sensitive to an established voluntary exercise protocol [40]. Using a\n                            specific anti-mouse SIRT3 polyclonal antibody, we found that SIRT3 protein increased selectively in triceps, the muscle\n                            that undergoes training in the wheel-caged system, but not in cardiac muscle\n                            samples from those same animals (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). In contrast to SIRT3, exercise\n                            training failed to alter SIRT1 protein levels in triceps (data not shown). The\n                            specificity of our antibody for detecting the endogenous ~28kDa SIRT3 protein\n                            was confirmed by using SIRT3 knockout tissue lysates (Supplemental Figure \u200bFigure1).\n1).\n                            Notably, induction of SIRT3 in skeletal muscle was higher in female mice when\n                            compared to that of male littermates (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B). In agreement with this\n                            up-regulation, we also observed increased SIRT3 levels in the gastrocnemius\n                            muscle of rats exercised on a treadmill-based exercise paradigm [41]\n                            (Supplemental Figure \u200bFigure2).2). Even one week of treadmill training was sufficient to\n                            increase SIRT3 protein amount (Supplemental Figure \u200bFigure2B).2B). The up-regulation of\n                            SIRT3 (Figure \u200b(Figure2B)2B) correlated with enhanced downstream phosphorylation of CREB\n                            at Ser133 (Figure \u200b(Figure2C)2C) and PGC-1\u03b1 induction (Figure \u200b(Figure2D).2D). Lastly,\n                            citrate synthase activity, a mitochondrial marker for exercise training, was\n                            significantly higher in trained muscles than in the respective sedentary\n                            control group (Figure \u200b(Figure2E).2E). Collectively, these data suggest that the up-regulation\n                            of SIRT3 by exercise is an important and conserved molecular consequence of\n                            training.\n                        \n                Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Skeletal muscle-specific induction of SIRT3 and associated factors in exercise-trained mice.

Thus we\n                            hypothesized that perhaps SIRT3 expression in muscles is also sensitive to\n                            nutritional signals, especially given how different muscles contain various\n                            levels of SIRT3 (Figure \u200b(Figure1)1) and vary inherently with respect to\n                            energetic/metabolic potential. To test this hypothesis, we measured the SIRT3\n                            levels in leg muscles of mice in either CR or ad libitum (AL) cohorts\n                            after twelve months. CR is an effective\n                            environmental method known to extend lifespan in a number of model organisms,\n                            from yeast and nematodes to rodents, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms by\n                            which this pathway acts in vivo remain largely unknown [42].\n                        \n                Here we\n                            found that the CR diet significantly increased levels of SIRT3 protein in\n                            skeletal muscle, compared to the AL control diet (Figure \u200b(Figure3A).3A). In addition,\n                            twenty four hours of fasting was sufficient to induce the muscle expression of\n                            SIRT3 (Figure \u200b(Figure3B).3B). Conversely, SIRT3 protein level was significantly decreased\n                            following three months of energy-dense, high-fat feeding (Figure \u200b(Figure3C),\n3C),\n                            indicating that the SIRT3 expression in muscle fluctuates in response to\n                            dietary nutrient uptake. We next measured the effect of CR on AMPK\u2014an enzyme\n                            whose activity is dependent on changes in metabolic/energetic potential [30,31].\n                        \n                Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Diet-sensitive expression of SIRT3 and AMPK in muscle tissue.(A) Mice\n                                            were fed NIH-31 standard feed ad libitum or NIH-31/NIA-fortified\n                                            diet (Harlan Teklad) with a daily food allotment of 60% of the control mice\n                                            to establish caloric restriction (CR); twelve months after the onset of CR,\n                                            tissues were harvested to examine SIRT3 expression. (B) Mice were\n                                            deprived of food for 24 hours, and SIRT3 level in EDL muscle was determined\n                                            by Western blot analysis.

In\n                            nematodes, for example, it has recently been shown that AMPK is critical for\n                            mediating key downstream biological effects that enable lifespan extension by\n                            caloric/dietary restriction [43]. Our data here\n                            show that AMPK is hyper-phospho-activated at Thr172\n                            of its catalytic \u03b1-subunit, which was quantified and\n                            determined to be three to four times higher than the AL control diet\n                            (Figure \u200b(Figure3D).3D). Together these data provided novel connections between caloric\n                            intake, SIRT3 and AMPK that merit more analysis.\n                        \n                Loss of SIRT3 significantly\n                            impacts activation of AMPK, CREB and PGC-1\u03b1 expression\n                        We next tested if\n                            the lack of SIRT3 would impact AMPK and other\n                            related factors like CREB and/or PGC-1\u03b1 in skeletal muscle. Consistent\n                            with our previous data, we found that SIRT3-null animals had 50% lower levels\n                            of AMPK phosphorylation compared to the wild-type littermate control group\n                            (Figure \u200b(Figure4A).4A). In our exercise model (Figure \u200b(Figure2A-D),2A-D), SIRT3 up-regulation enhanced downstream activation of CREB and\n                            PGC-1\u03b1. Accordingly, in\n                            the SIRT3-null mice, activating phosphorylation of CREB at Ser122 was also\n                            reduced (Figure \u200b(Figure4B),4B), which correlated with lowered transcriptional activation\n                            of pgc-1\u03b1 (Figure \u200b(Figure4C).4C). This result is consistent with previously published data,\n                            which show that both AMPK and CREB activate pgc-1\u03b1\n                            expression in vivo [29].\n                        \n                Open in a separate windowFigure 4.SIRT3-deficient mice have lower phosphorylation levels of AMPK and CREB, as well as decreased PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA. \n                                        (A) AMPK T-172 phosphorylation and AMPK total protein in\n                                        the EDL muscles of the male wild-type mice or mice with heterozygous\n                                        or homozygous SIRT3 gene deficiency were determined by Western\n                                        blot analysis.

SIRT3 protein level is\n                        decreased by high-fat feeding, while it is increased by short-term fasting\n                        (24-hour) or long-term nutrient deprivation (12-month CR) and exercise\n                        training. In this study we also show that loss of SIRT3 significantly inhibits\n                        AMPK and CREB phosphorylation, which decreases PGC-1\u03b1 transcriptional expression in muscle. Consequently, we propose a new\n                        model in which SIRT3 leads to potential downstream changes in response to\n                        important environmental signals (Figure \u200b(Figure5).5).  This model suggests that SIRT3 levels may respond to various\n                        nutritional/energetic and physiological challenges by regulating muscle energy\n                        homeostasis via factors like AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1.\n                    \n            Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Schematic diagram of potential SIRT3 action in the skeletal myocyte. Collectively,\n                                        our data support a working model in which SIRT3 responds dynamically to\n                                        various nutritional and physiological signals to potentially impact muscle\n                                        energy homeostasis via AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1. Since AMPK can also phosphorylate and activate\n                                        CREB [52], SIRT3 may activate CREB directly or through AMPK. Given its\n                                        dynamic role, SIRT3 action within the skeletal muscle cells may serve as an\n                                        important diagnostic and therapeutic target for impacting human health and\n                                        disease.\n                                \n                    Given our study, it will be interesting to test\n                        whether SIRT3-null animals show any defects under certain environmental\n                        challenges. Despite the hyper-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins in SIRT3\n                        knockout mice, the significance of these biochemical changes is unclear. A\n                        recent study of SIRT3-deficient mice by another group did not find defects in\n                        basal metabolism nor adaptive thermogenesis, while the mice were housed in\n                        standard dietary/sedentary conditions [13]. Similarly,\n                        we found normal treadmill performance in SIRT3 knockout mice while under\n                        standard housing (unpublished observations). Upon challenge with various\n                        environmental signals, however, these animals may respond differently.\n                        Accordingly, we are actively testing how challenges by CR/fasting/high-fat diet\n                        and exercise may affect the SIRT3-null mice and alter key downstream cellular\n                        factors in muscle cells.\n                    \n            The mechanism(s) by which\n                        different environmental variables modulate SIRT3 and activate AMPK in muscle (and other tissues that highly express SIRT3) remains\n                        to be fully elucidated. For example,\n                        activation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (AceCS2) by SIRT3 [44,45] may elevate the AMP/ATP ratio\n                        and consequently activate AMPK. Alternatively, a recent proteomics-based\n                        approach has identified many novel SIRT3-interacting partners in human cells,\n                        including the ATP synthase (mitochondrial F1 complex) alpha/beta subunits and\n                        the ubiquinol-cytochrome\n                        c reductase hinge protein, UQCRH [46]. Since\n                        these proteins (together with NDUFA9 [17]) serve as critical components of\n                        the ATP-generating machinery in cells, SIRT3 may also potentially modulate the\n                        AMP/ATP ratio via these factors to activate AMPK. Moreover, we too have\n                        purified additional putative SIRT3-binding proteins from HeLa cells (using a related\n                        cross-linking/immunoaffinity purification method [47]), which include mitochondrial\n                        acetoacetyl CoA thiolase (also referred to as \u03b1-ketothiolase), malate dehydrogenase, thioredoxin\n                        2 (Trx-2), Hsp60, and lactate dehydrogenase (unpublished data). Since some of\n                        these enzymes are important regulators of muscle energy homeostasis, our data\n                        further substantiate that SIRT3 may modulate ATP/energy levels via key\n                        targets to activate AMPK. It is intriguing to note that a study of an\n                        independent line of SIRT3-knockout mice indicated that the ATP level is\n                        significantly reduced in several tissues [17], although the effect of SIRT3\n                        deficiency on muscle ATP level has not been reported.\n                    \n            Interestingly, it has also\n                        been shown that activation of AMPK, upon glucose nutrient restriction of muscle\n                        stem cells, causes an increase in the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio,\n                        consistent with a positive feedback loop needed for prolonged SIRT1 activation [48], as may occur in our SIRT3 model and merits testing. Indeed a\n                        second in vitro study independently validates a similar NAD+/NADH\n                        model via AMPK [49]. Strikingly, AMPK activation (as occurs with CR) may also result in\n                        lifespan extension [50-52], and future study will reveal if SIRT3 is involved in this\n                        process. It is known that activated AMPK\n                        directly phosphorylates PGC-1\u03b1[32] and CREB [53]\u2014and that\n                        both AMPK and CREB are involved in the transactivation of PGC-1a [54,55].\n                        Lastly, both SIRT3 and SIRT1 promote mitochondrial\n                        biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation via PGC-1\u03b1 but in different ways. SIRT3 promotes PGC-1\u03b1 expression while SIRT1 activates PGC-1\u03b1 by direct deacetylation [56]. However, we have found that exercise training regulates SIRT3\n                        but not SIRT1 expression in muscle. At present, it remains to be considered how\n                        these two key sirtuin enzymes may work cooperatively within certain tissues in\n                        response to environmental signals.\n                    \n            Furthermore, it is important to consider\n                        that a phenotype may be tissue-specific, especially if SIRT3 has different\n                        biological roles in the body. For example, in the rennin-angiotensin system,\n                        which plays a key role in the pathophysiology of cardiac and renal disease in\n                        humans, targeted disruption of the angiotensin receptor (Agtr1a\n                        gene in mice) yields animals with less cardiac and vascular injury, prolonged\n                        lifespan, increased number of mitochondria, and dramatic up-regulation of SIRT3\n                        in kidney tissue\u2014a possible site of SIRT3 action that may contribute, at least\n                        in part, to the phenotype that is observed [57]. Another\n                        interesting place of molecular action is in brown adipose tissue (BAT), in\n                        which SIRT3 has been previously shown to respond dynamically to CR and regulate\n                        fat cell physiology via PGC-1\u03b1 [10]. With the\n                        recent discovery of BAT in humans (reviewed in [58]), there are\n                        now new opportunities to explore the role of SIRT3 in diabetes and obesity\n                        research [59]. Moreover,\n                        after intense swimming, it has been reported that the expression of SIRT3 and\n                        PGC-1\u03b1 increases in white blood cells to activate the\n                        antioxidant response [60]. Lastly, in\n                        human skeletal muscle, it has been reported that SIRT3 and PGC-1\u03b1 expression decline with age and correlate with a sedentary proteomic\n                        profile found in people with decreased metabolic output [61]. With\n                        exercise, however, these authors observed that the effect is reversed.\n                        Collectively, these data suggest that SIRT3 function is perhaps varied\n                        throughout the body and specialized to meet the unique metabolic/energetic\n                        capacities found within various tissues, particularly in response to\n                        environmental cues.\n                    \n            Thus it will be interesting\n                        to test whether inducible tissue-specific SIRT3-null mice show global metabolic\n                        defects from exercise and/or diet regimens in various parts of the body,\n                        especially with aging. This inducible genetic approach will also allow us to\n                        bypass potential compensatory effects resulting from the lack of SIRT3 during\n                        development. Additionally, a mouse model with increased SIRT3 over-expression\n                        in muscle (and/or other specific tissues) will also be a valuable tool for\n                        further elucidating the biological role(s) of this sirtuin in vivo. All\n                        of this work will be important as we fight against aging and associated\n                        disorders ranging from type 2 diabetes (and other metabolic diseases) to breast\n                        cancer, in which expression of SIRT3 is aberrant. Therefore, small-molecule activators of SIRT3, currently in\n                        development and testing [62], may provide novel and key therapeutic routes for the treatment\n                        of a variety of common diseases, perhaps by mimicking the beneficial molecular\n                        effects of exercise and/or caloric restriction in vivo.\n                    \n             Experimental procedures\nAnimals,\n                                diet and exercise.\n                 Ethics statement: Protocols\n                        for animal use were in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional\n                        Animal Care and Use Committees of Baylor College of Medicine and the Joslin\n                        Diabetes Center and the National Institutes of Health. For the caloric\n                        restriction experiment, C57BL/6 male mice were singly caged. At 8 weeks of age,\n                        control mice were fed ad libitum with NIH-31 standard diet (Harlan\n                        Teklad), while food consumption was measured daily. Caloric restricted mice\n                        were fed with NIH-31/NIA-fortified diet (Harlan Teklad) with a daily food\n                        allotment of 90%, 70% and then 60% of the amount consumed by the control\n                        mice\u2014at the first, second, and third week, respectively. From then on, daily\n                        food allotment stabilized at 60% of ad libitum food intake for the\n                        caloric restricted mice. 12 months later, mice were dissected to collect\n                        tissues for analysis. For the fasting experiment, food was removed from 3\n                        months old C57BL/6 male mice at 6pm for 24 hours. For the high-fat diet feeding\n                        experiment, 8-week-old male mice were fed a control diet or a 35% fat-enriched\n                        chow (BioServ) for three months. Various tissueswere also\n                        harvested from mice fed the control diet to examine SIRT3 gene expression by\n                        Western blot analysis at the termination of the study. For the\n                        exercise study [40], 7-week-old\n                        male and female FVB/NJ mice were wheel-cage trained for 6 weeks and fed PicoLab\n                        Mouse Diet 20 (LabDiet/Purina). In brief, mice were housed in individual cages\n                        with or without rodent running wheels (Nalgene,\n                        Rochester, NY) and the animals could exercise voluntarily during a 6-week\n                        training period. At the end of the 6 weeks, mice were euthanized, triceps\n                        muscles were removed and subsequently analyzed for SIRT3, CREB,\n                        phospho-CREB/Ser122, and PGC-1\u03b1 protein expression [10]. Citrate synthase activity was\n                        measured as a mitochondrial marker post-exercise training from triceps samples,\n                        as described previously [40].\n                    \n            Sirt3\n                    -knockout\n                                mice.\n                 Mice in which the Sirt3 gene\n                        (Accession: {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NM_022433\",\"term_id\":\"188035864\",\"term_text\":\"NM_022433\"}}NM_022433) was targeted by gene trapping were obtained from the\n                        Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine (Houston, TX, USA). Briefly, these mice\n                        were created by generating embryonic stem (ES) cells (Omnibank No. OST341297) with a retroviral promoter trap that\n                        functionally inactivates one alleleof the Sirt3 gene, as\n                        described previously [63]. Sequenceanalysis indicated that retroviral insertion occurred in the intron\n                        preceding coding exon 2 (Supplemental Figure \u200bFigure1).1). Targeted 129/SvEvBrd embryonic\n                        stem cells were injected into C57BL/6 albino blastocysts. The chimeras\n                        (129/SvEvBrd) were then crossed with C57BL/6 albinos to produce the\n                        heterozygotes. Heterozygotes were then mated and the offspring were genotyped\n                        using PCR, containing two primers flanking the trapping cassette insertion site\n                        TG0003-5' (ATCTCGCAGATAGGCTATCAGC) and TG0003-3'\n                        (AACCACGTAACCTTACCCAAGG), as well as a third primer LTR\n                        rev, a reverse primer located at the 5' end of the trapping cassette\n                        (ATAAACCCTCTTGCAG TTGCATC). Primer pair TG0003-5' and TG0003-3' amplify\n                        a 336bp fragment from the wild-type allele, while primer pair TG0003-5' and LTR\n                        rev amplify a 160bp fragment from the knockout allele.\n                    \n            \nAntibodies and Western blots.\n                 The\n                        antibodies used for Western blot analysis included: anti-mouse SIRT3 serum\n                        raised against the C-terminus (DLMQRERGKLD GQDR, Genemed Synthesis, Inc.)\n                        and used for the tissue distribution and high-fat diet analyses; anti-mouse and\n                        anti-rat SIRT3 serum was also developed against the C-terminal regions of each\n                        respective protein (Covance), and the anti-mouse serum was validated for\n                        specificity using brown fat, cardiac tissue, and soleus muscle from SIRT3\n                        knockout mice (Supplemental Fig. 1), then used for analyzing the exercise\n                        samples.
