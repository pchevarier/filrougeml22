{"title": "A synthetic small molecule stalls pre-mRNA splicing by promoting an early-stage U2AF2-RNA complex", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.chembiol.2021.02.007", "PMID": "33689684", "abstract": "Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing is an emerging Achilles heel of cancers and myelodysplasias. To expand the currently limited portfolio of small-molecule drug leads, we screened for chemical modulators of the U2AF complex, which nucleates spliceosome assembly and is mutated in myelodysplasias. A hit compound specifically enhances RNA binding by a U2AF2 subunit. Remarkably, the compound inhibits splicing of representative substrates and stalls spliceosome assembly at the stage of U2AF function. Computational docking, together with structure-guided mutagenesis, indicates that the compound bridges the tandem U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs via hydrophobic and electrostatic moieties. Cells expressing a cancer-associated U2AF1 mutant are preferentially killed by treatment with the compound. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of trapping early spliceosome assembly as an effective pharmacological means to manipulate pre-mRNA splicing. By extension, we suggest that stabilizing assembly intermediates may offer a useful approach for small-molecule inhibition of macromolecular machines.", "author": [{"author": "Rakesh Chatrikhi", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14620, USA."], "href": "/?term=Chatrikhi+R&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Callen F Feeney", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14620, USA."], "href": "/?term=Feeney+CF&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Mary J Pulvino", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14620, USA."], "href": "/?term=Pulvino+MJ&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Georgios Alachouzos", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."], "href": "/?term=Alachouzos+G&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Andrew J MacRae", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology and Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA."], "href": "/?term=MacRae+AJ&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Zackary Falls", "affiliation": ["Department of Medical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA."], "href": "/?term=Falls+Z&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Sumit Rai", "affiliation": ["Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02114, USA."], "href": "/?term=Rai+S&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "William W Brennessel", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."], "href": "/?term=Brennessel+WW&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Jermaine L Jenkins", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14620, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jenkins+JL&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Matthew J Walter", "affiliation": ["Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA."], "href": "/?term=Walter+MJ&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Timothy A Graubert", "affiliation": ["Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02114, USA."], "href": "/?term=Graubert+TA&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Ram Samudrala", "affiliation": ["Department of Medical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA."], "href": "/?term=Samudrala+R&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Melissa S Jurica", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology and Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jurica+MS&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Alison J Frontier", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627, USA."], "href": "/?term=Frontier+AJ&cauthor_id=33689684"}, {"author": "Clara L Kielkopf", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Center for RNA Biology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.
