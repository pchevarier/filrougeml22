{"title": "Expression and distribution of trihydrophobin 1 in postnatal developing mouse testis", "pubDate": "2006", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s11010-006-9231-6", "PMID": "16786193", "abstract": "The human trihydrophobin 1 (TH1) is a highly conserved and widely expressed protein. It is clear that TH1 serves as a new specific negative regulator of A-Raf kinase. In this study, we found that TH1 associated with A-Raf in mouse testis by using coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Then we characterized the gene expression of TH1 in mouse testis and analyzed the changes of TH1 protein during postnatal development. The protein expression of TH1 in mouse testis was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining. Strong signals were detected in the seminiferous tubules and the distribution patterns varied with the different ages of postnatal mouse testis. TH1 was distributed in spermatocytes and Sertoli cells at 2 weeks postnatal, and was abundant in spermatogonia at 8 weeks postnatal. Leydig cells were positive to TH1 throughout testicular development. A high expression of TH1 in both Leydig cells and mouse Leydig tumor cells (mLTC-1cells) was found to be concentrated in the cytoplasm. The colocalization of TH1 and A-Raf in mLTC-1 cells or in adult testis was also observable.", "author": [{"author": "Xiaoying Guan", "affiliation": ["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."], "href": "/?term=Guan+X&cauthor_id=16786193"}, {"author": "Jie Liu", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Liu+J&cauthor_id=16786193"}, {"author": "Fei Ding", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ding+F&cauthor_id=16786193"}, {"author": "Jianxin Gu", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Gu+J&cauthor_id=16786193"}, {"author": "Xiaosong Gu", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Gu+X&cauthor_id=16786193"}], "refPMID": ["14638631", "15051942", "874003", "12791857", "15342491", "12612062", "10199401", "10768864", "1690378", "4369719", "11030415", "8455932", "15956026", "8622887", "8020955", "7671309", "8507475", "6301963", "9674997", "2026122", "12495214", "11952167", "7862085", "3803444", "14684750"], "citedInPMID": ["16786193"], "body": ""}
