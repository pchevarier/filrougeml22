Methods: PRoVENT-COVID is a national, retrospective observational study, performed at 22 ICUs in the Netherlands, including COVID-19 patients under invasive ventilation for ARDS. Dynamic \u0394P and MP were calculated at fixed time points during the first 4 calendar days of ventilation. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality.

A significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each increment in \u0394P (HR 1.04, 95% CrI 1.01-1.07) and in MP (HR 1.12, 95% CrI 1.01-1.36).

Conclusion: Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of ventilation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an association with increased risk of 28-day mortality. Limiting exposure to high \u0394P or MP has the potential to improve survival in these patients.

Worldwide, healthcare workers are faced with surges of infected patients who need hospitalization and eventually admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) because of need for invasive ventilation. The care of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u221219) patients receiving ventilation is challenging and the outcomes are poor (2). Mortality rates as high as 50% have been reported in invasively ventilated COVID\u221219 patients that develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2).Different ventilation strategies have been studied in the setting of acute respiratory failure, and evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the use of ventilation with a low tidal volume (VT) and a low plateau pressure to decrease the risk of ventilator\u2013induced lung injury (VILI) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (3\u20135). There is increasing interest in limiting exposure to driving pressure (\u0394P) and mechanical power (MP) in invasively ventilated patients (6\u20138). \u0394P, the pressure applied by the ventilator to support the delivery of tidal volume, (7) is a surrogate for cyclic lung strain (9). MP, a parameter that combines several ventilatory variables, including respiratory rate (RR), VT, flow and \u0394P, represents the amount of energy transferred from the ventilator to the respiratory system (8, 10). Associations of \u0394P and MP with outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation is well described (7, 8, 11\u201319).A potential limitation of earlier studies is the inclusion of patients with spontaneous efforts during ventilation (18, 20). Even if appropriately adjusted for resistance, flow, and chest wall elastance, any estimate of these variables during spontaneous efforts would reflect both the ventilator's contribution and respiratory muscle activity, and thus would not represent the total energy imparted during inflation (20). Also, mechanical ventilation is a dynamic process, and thus far only one investigation studied the cumulative effect of \u0394P and MP beyond baseline (12). To date, there have been no studies that assessed the impact of intensity of ventilation on outcome of COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS. To ascertain the effect of time\u2013varying exposure to different levels of \u0394P and MP on 28\u2013day mortality in COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS, we conducted a secondary analysis of a national multicenter investigation, named the \u201cPRactive of VENTilation in COVID\u221219\u201d (PRoVENT\u2013COVID) study. Our objectives were to estimate the effects of different levels of \u0394P and MP over the first 4 days of ventilation on 28\u2013day mortality in COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS, and whether there was a cumulative effect of exposure over time. We hypothesized that intensity of ventilation has an association with mortality in patients with COVID\u221219 ARDS, in a similar way as has been described in patients with ARDS from another cause. MethodsStudy Design and ParticipantsThis is a preplanned secondary analysis of the \u201cPractice of VENTilation in COVID\u221219\u201d (PRoVENT\u2013COVID) study, an investigator\u2013initiated, multicenter, observational cohort study in patients with COVID\u221219 ARDS undertaken at 22 ICUs during the first 3 months of the pandemic in the Netherlands (21\u201323). The protocol of the PRoVENT\u2013COVID study was prepublished, (21) and the statistical analysis plan for the current analysis, finalized before assessing the database, is available online (22). The institutional review boards of each participating center approved the study protocol, and need for individual patient informed consent was waived based on the observational nature of the study. Study sites were recruited through direct contact by members of the steering committee of the PRoVENT\u2013COVID study. Study coordinators contacted the local doctors, trained and helped the data collectors, and monitored the study according to the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice\u2013guidelines. Integrity and timely completion of data collection was ensured by the study coordinators.Consecutive patients aged 18 yr or older were eligible for participation if they were admitted to one of the participating ICUs and had received invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID\u221219 ARDS. The PRoVENT\u2013COVID study itself had no exclusion criteria\u2014for the current analysis we excluded patients if they had spontaneous breathing activity in more than half the observations, or when life status was unknown at day 28.Procedures and OutcomeDemographics and data regarding premorbid diseases and home medication were collected at baseline. In the first hour of invasive ventilation, and every 8 h thereafter at fixed time points ventilator settings and parameters were collected up to day 4. Since plateau pressure was not recorded in the current study, all measurements of dynamic \u0394P were calculated as peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) minus positive end\u2013expiratory pressure. Dynamic MP was calculated as 0.098 * RR * VT * [Ppeak \u2013 (0.5 \u00d7 dynamic \u0394P)]. Both variables were calculated only considering moments without evidence of spontaneous breathing (additional information in eMethods in Supplementary Information). The Berlin definition for ARDS was used for classification of severity as mild, moderate and severe (24).The primary outcome was 28\u2013day mortality. In secondary analyses, we investigated whether the strength of association between intensity of ventilation and 28\u2013day mortality changed over time. In addition, we quantified the effect of cumulative response, and we examined whether ARDS severity class changed the effects of time\u2013varying \u0394P and MP on 28\u2013day mortality.Analysis PlanFor the final assessment, patients receiving ventilation without evidence of spontaneous breathing at less than 50% of the available timepoints were identified and deselected (Supplementary Information\neMethods). Continuous variables were reported as median (25th \u2013 75th percentile) and compared with Wilcoxon rank\u2013sum tests, and categorical variables as number and percentage, and compared with Fisher exact tests. The following variables were considered for adjustment in all models described below: age, gender, body mass index, PaO2 to FiO2 ratio, plasma creatinine, medical history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active hematological neoplasia and/or active solid tumor, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, use of a vasopressor or inotropes, fluid balance, arterial pH, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. These baseline covariates were selected according to clinical relevance and as used in previous study (23). Finally, all continuous variables were standardized to interpret their effect on outcome in standard deviation units.To estimate the association of subject\u2013specific longitudinal profiles of either \u0394P and MP with 28\u2013day mortality, we used Bayesian joint models with shared random effects and adjusted for the covariates described above (25, 26). The repeated values of \u0394P and MP (a maximum of 13 measurements) were included as time\u2013varying exposure variables. Natural cubic splines were used in both the fixed\u2013effects and random\u2013effects models to account for the non-linearity of the longitudinal exposure profiles. To investigate whether the association between \u0394P and MP and 28\u2013day mortality changed over time, p\u2013splines were included in an interaction term and presented in time\u2013varying plots. Estimation of Bayesian joint model was done considering 28,000 iterations, 3,000 adapt, 3,000 burn\u2013in, and 50 of thinning. Model diagnostics were done by visual inspection of the diagnostic plots. These results were presented as hazard ratios with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrI).To further expand the findings of the original model, 3 additional analyses were performed. First, the model described above was expanded to a multivariate joint model. In addition to the baseline covariates, the following time\u2013varying covariates were included: daily use of prone positioning and daily use of inotropes or vasopressors. Second, the calculation of dynamic \u0394P and MP were further restricted to moments when a neuromuscular blocking agent was administered, thereby decreasing the chance of including moments at which a patient was having spontaneous breathing activity. Third, patients with missing data in their 28\u2013day vital status were not excluded but assessed in 2 different scenarios: i. best\u2013case scenario (these patients were all considered alive at day 28); and ii. worst\u2013case scenario (these patients were all considered to have died before or at day 28).Three sensitivity analyses were added. First, to quantify the effect of cumulative exposure, we estimate the association between the percentage of moments with high \u0394P and MP and 28\u2013day mortality. The cut\u2013off used to determine high \u0394P was 15 cm H2O; the cut\u2013off used for high MP was 17 J/min (7, 8, 12, 27). Second, we investigated the relationship between cumulative dose and 28\u2013day mortality using the area under the \u0394P and MP time curve above the thresholds described above divided by the number of hours of exposure, as a measure of dose. Using this definition, 1 cm H2O or 1 J/min of dose describes that a patient's average \u0394P and MP were 1 cmH2O or 1 J/min per mL/cm H2O above the thresholds described for the duration of the exposure window. Third, we investigated the impact of time\u2013weighted average \u0394P and MP calculated as the area under the \u0394P and MP time curve divided by the number of hours of exposure. For these 3 exposures, the impact on outcome was assessed using (shared\u2013frailty) Cox proportional hazard models adjusted by the covariates described above.The models were reassessed in a subgroup analysis according to ARDS severity at baseline (24). The models were repeated, considering an interaction between \u0394P and MP and ARDS severity at baseline. The amount of missing data is <3% for the variables of interest, as shown in the Appendix (Supplementary Information Table 1). For the final models, missing data in covariates were imputed by the median due to the low number of missing, and in the repeated measurements of \u0394P and MP over the days a linear imputation was used (Supplementary Information Figure 1). All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and a p < 0.05 was considered significant. P values for the Bayesian models were calculated as the tail probabilities using the formula 2 x min{P(\u03b8 > 0), P(\u03b8 <0)}, with \u03b8 denoting the corresponding regression coefficient from the survival submodel. ResultsFrom March 1, 2020, through June 1, 2020, 31 ICUs were invited for participation in the PRoVENT\u2013COVID study, and 22 met inclusion criteria. A total of 1,340 individuals were screened. Of the 1,122 invasively ventilated COVID\u221219 patients, 734 (66.6%) were included in the current analysis (Supplementary Information Figure 2). Reasons for exclusion were evidence for presence of spontaneous breathing activity in more than 50% of available timepoints of data collection (n = 368), and unknown life status at day 28 (n = 20). Demographic characteristics and ventilation characteristics are presented in Table 1. The patients had a median age of 65 yr [IQR 57\u201372] and 194 (26%) of them were women. 8.9% of the patients had mild ARDS, and 57.8% and 33.4% moderate or severe ARDS, respectively. The most prevalent premorbid conditions were hypertension and diabetes. 29.2% of the patients died within the first 28 days of follow\u2013up. Additional clinical outcomes and use of rescue therapies are presented in the Appendix (Supplementary Information Table 2).Table 1Baseline patient characteristics and outcomes.Participants\n(n = 734)Age, years65 (57\u201372)Male gender\u2013no (%)540 (73.6)Body mass index, kg/m227.8 (25.4\u201331.1)Transferred under invasive ventilation109 (14.9)Days between intubation and admission0.0 (0.0\u20130.0)Use of non\u2013invasive ventilation prior to intubation\u2013no (%)66/661 (10.0)Duration of non\u2013invasive ventilation, hours6 (2\u201314)Chest CT scan performed\u2013no (%)254/715 (35.5)Lung parenchyma affected\u2013no (%)0%9/254 (3.5)25%77/254 (30.3)50%80/254 (31.5)75%71/254 (28.0)100%17/254 (6.7)Chest X\u2013ray performed\u2013no (%)397/455 (87.3)Quadrants affected\u2013no (%)128/395 (7.1)297/395 (24.6)3117/395 (29.6)4153/395 (38.7)Severity of ARDS\u2013no (%)Mild65 (8.9)Moderate424 (57.8)Severe245 (33.4)Co\u2013existing disorders\u2013no (%)Hypertension247 (33.7)Heart failure27 (3.7)Diabetes163 (22.2)Chronic kidney disease29 (4.0)Baseline creatinine, \u03bcmol/L*78 (62\u2013100)Liver cirrhosis2 (0.3)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease62 (8.4)Active hematological neoplasia9 (1.2)Active solid neoplasia21 (2.9)Neuromuscular disease3 (0.4)Immunosuppression15 (2.0)Previous medication\u2013no (%)Systemic steroids28 (3.8)Inhalation steroids83 (11.3)Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor126 (17.2)Angiotensin II receptor blocker81 (11.0)Beta\u2013blockers131 (17.8)Insulin46 (6.3)Metformin116 (15.8)Statins217 (29.6)Calcium channel blockers137 (18.7)Vital signs at day 01Heart rate, bpm**84 (74\u201398)Mean arterial pressure, mmHg**80 (73\u201388)Laboratory tests at day 01pH**7.36 (7.30\u20137.41)Worst PaO2/FiO2, mmHg***117 (91\u2013154)PaCO2, mmHg**45 (39\u201351)Lactate mmol/L**1.2 (0.9\u20131.5)Organ support at day 01\u2013no (%)Continuous sedation703/732 (96.0)Inotropic or vasopressor574/732 (78.4)Vasopressor573/732 (78.3)Inotropic37/732 (5.1)Fluid balance, mL****637 (77\u20131445)Urine output, mL****675 (360\u20131116)Ventilation support at day 01Assisted ventilation\u2013no (%)a185/731 (25.3)Volume controlled125/731 (17.1)Pressure controlled421/731 (57.6)Pressure support12/731 (1.6)Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation68/731 (9.3)Airway pressure release ventilation3/731 (0.4)INTELLiVENT-ASV12/731 (1.6)Other90/731 (12.3)Tidal volume, mL/kg PBW**b6.3 (5.9\u20137.0)Tidal volume \u2264 8 mL/kg PBW609 (95.9)PEEP, cmH2O**b13 (12\u201315)Peak pressure, cmH2O**b27 (24\u201330)Driving pressure, cmH2O**b14 (12\u201316)Driving pressure > 15 cmH2O206/640 (32.2)Mechanical power, J/min**b18.9 (15.7\u201322.8)Mechanical power > 17 J/min381/640 (59.5)Dynamic compliance, mL/cmH2O**b32 (27\u201340)Total respiratory rate, mpm**b22 (20\u201324)Set respiratory rate, mpm**b22 (20\u201324)Minute ventilation, L/min**b9.5 (8.4\u201311.0)FiO2**0.60 (0.50\u20130.70)etCO2, mmHg**37 (32\u201342)Rescue therapy at day 01\u2013no (%)Prone positioning225/719 (31.3)Duration, hours8 (4\u201312)Recruitment maneuver15/590 (2.5)ECMOUse of NMBA212/731 (29.0)Hours of use of use0 (0\u20138)Clinical outcome28\u2013day mortality214 (29.2)Open in a separate window\nData are median (quartile 25%\u2013quartile 75%) or No (%).

Top panels (A, B): mean daily values of \u0394P and MP according to a maximum of four measurements in the day of start of ventilation and three measurements in the next days. Bottom panels (C, D): \u0394P and MP per time point of assessment. Circles are means and error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Both variables were calculated using only measurements without spontaneous breathing activity. P values from a mixed-effect model with time as fixed effect (as continuous variable) and patients as random effect to account for repeated measurements.In the first 4 calendar days of ventilation, and after adjusting for confounders, both a high time\u2013varying \u0394P (HR, 1.04 [95% CrI, 1.01\u20131.07]) and a high time\u2013varying MP (HR, 1.12 [95% CrI, 1.01\u20131.36]) had an association with increased risk of 28\u2013day mortality (Table 2). The strength of the association of \u0394P as well as of MP with 28\u2013day mortality decreased slightly over the first 4 days (Figure 2). As shown in the Appendix, the effect of time\u2013varying \u0394P was more pronounced in patients with ARDS classified as severe (Supplementary Information Figure 3). The full multivariable model is reported in Supplementary Information Table 3.

(A), Time-varying \u0394P, and (B) time-varying MP. Time-varying hazard ratio obtained from a Bayesian joint model estimating the association between \u0394P and MP and 28-day mortality, including p-splines in an interaction term. The strength of the association decreased over time. All models were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, PaO2 to FiO2 ratio, plasma creatinine, medical history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active hematological neoplasia and/or active solid tumor, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, use of a vasopressor or inotropes, fluid balance, arterial pH, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Natural cubic splines were used in both the fixed-effects and random-effects models to account for the nonlinearity of the longitudinal exposure profiles.The number and percentage of measurements per patient with \u0394P > 15 cm H2O and MP > 17 J/min in the first 4 days of ventilation are shown in the Appendix (Supplementary Information Figure 4). A higher percentage of measurements with \u0394P > 15 cm H2O (HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.03\u20132.51] p = 0.037) or with MP > 17 J/min (HR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.44\u20134.07] p < 0.001) had an association with increased risk of 28\u2013day mortality (Figure 3).

(B, E): Association between cumulative dose of \u0394P > 15 cmH2O and MP > 17 J/min and 28-day mortality. Cumulative dose calculated as area under the \u0394P and MP time curve above the thresholds described above divided by the number of hours of exposure, as a measure of dose. Using this definition, 1 cmH2O or 1 J/min of dose describes that a patient's average \u0394P or MP was 1 cmH2O or 1 J/min above the thresholds described for the duration of the exposure window, respectively. (C,F) Association between time-weighted average \u0394P and MP and 28-day mortality. Time-weighted average calculated as the area under the \u0394P and MP time curve divided by the number of hours of exposure. All models were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, PaO2 to FiO2 ratio, plasma creatinine, medical history of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active hematological neoplasia and/or active solid tumor, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, use of a vasopressor or inotropes, fluid balance, arterial pH, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Dashed lines and gray areas represent hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for increasing values the variable analyzed as a continuous variable and centralized in the mean of each variable. \u0394P is driving pressure and MP is mechanical power.Time\u2013weighted average and cumulative dose of \u0394P and MP are shown in the Appendix (Supplementary Information Figure 5). Cumulative dose of \u0394P > 15 cm H2O (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05\u20131.14]; p < 0.001) and MP > 17 J/min (HR, 1.06 [1.03\u20131.09]; p < 0.001) had an association with increased risk of 28\u2013day mortality (Figure 3). In accordance, time\u2013weighted average \u0394P (HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.03\u20131.09]; p < 0.001) and time\u2013weighted average MP (HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02\u20131.06]; p < 0.001) also had an association with an increased risk on 28\u2013day mortality. DiscussionThe findings of this observational study assessing the impact of time\u2013varying \u0394P and MP on 28\u2013day mortality in invasively ventilated COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS, can be summarized as follows: (1) exposure to both higher \u0394P and higher MP during the first 4 calendar days of ventilation had associations with increased risk of 28\u2013day mortality in joint models; and (2) a higher cumulative exposure to \u0394P > 15 cm H2O or MP > 17 J/min over the first 4 days of ventilation had associations with increased risk for 28\u2013day mortality. These findings support the suggestion that limiting the intensity of ventilation in COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS by using strategies that result in a lower \u0394P or MP could improve patient outcome, alike what has been suggested in patients with ARDS from another origin.The findings of our study are in line with previous investigations of \u0394P and MP in patients with ARDS from another cause than COVID\u221219. Indeed, in patients with ARDS from another origin, a higher \u0394P and higher MP at baseline have been shown to have an association with increased mortality (7\u201310, 12\u201316). A recent study showed the adverse effect of exposure to higher cumulative doses of \u0394P and MP over the duration of ventilation in critically ill patients receiving ventilation due to respiratory failure (12). We also found that a high time\u2013varying \u0394P and MP, and a higher cumulative exposure to harmful levels of \u0394P and MP have an association with increased 28\u2013day mortality, and as in the previous study these effects were more pronounced in patients with more severe forms of ARDS at baseline.Considering all the available evidence, monitoring intensity of ventilation seems an attractive approach, both in patients with ARDS due to COVID\u221219 and in patients with ARDS from another origin. Yet, it remains uncertain whether the found association only reflects the relationship between respiratory system compliance and patient outcome. It is also uncertain whether measures to lower the intensity will result in better outcomes. Nevertheless, our results, corrected for baseline covariates and time\u2013varying confounding, could represent a causal effect. Thus, ventilation strategies aiming to lower the intensity of ventilation need to be studied, preferably in randomized clinical trials.The present cohort of COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS is comparable to other COVID\u221219 cohorts in relation to baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes (28\u201331). Key variables of ventilation management, like VT, RR and \u0394P were comparable to what was described in previous studies in patients with COVID\u221219, and in line with recommendations for lung\u2013protective ventilation in patients with ARDS (28\u201331). MP in our cohort was lower than what was reported in one study in COVID\u221219 patients, (30) suggesting a better adoption of lung\u2013protective ventilation in our study.Our study has strengths. We restricted the analysis to patients who were without spontaneous breathing activity for the majority of time, and \u0394P and MP was only calculated for the moments a patient was passive. Calculation \u0394P and MP in the presence of spontaneous breathing is not yet validated. For the main analyses we used joint models, which allows the examination of the effect of a time\u2013varying, endogenous covariate on a time\u2013to\u2013event outcome, accounting for non\u2013random dropouts due to death during follow\u2013up.Our study also has limitations. First, our study was conducted very early in the local outbreak, and anti\u2013inflammatory strategies, like steroids and other treatments such as anti\u2013IL\u22126, were not yet extensively used. We did not collect data regarding the use of steroids or other anti\u2013inflammatory drugs. Also, we did not collect D\u2013dimer levels and other laboratory tests that may have predictive value, as these were not yet routinely performed so early in the local outbreak. However, the variables used for adjustment are in line with previous studies assessing the impact of \u0394P and MP in patients receiving ventilation (12, 14, 15). Our models used several important clinical variables. Of note, we only had measurements of dynamic airway \u0394P as plateau or transpulmonary pressures were not routinely connected. Airway \u0394P does correlate with transpulmonary \u0394P, but it represents a surrogate, which might be affected by other factors. However, recent data suggested that this calculation is reliable (32). Also, we could not adjust for all possible yet unmeasured confounders and due to the observational nature, no causal relationship can be inferred or determined. A high incidence of thromboembolic complications has been found in the present study, which is in line with other reports on COVID\u221219 patients (33). Pulmonary embolism could cause an increase in dead space, as such affecting the intensity of ventilation. Another limitation is that participating centers did not all use the same disease severity score. Indeed, some centers reported either APACHE II or APACHE IV scores, others used the SAPS II, and some only SOFA scores. These scores cannot be used interchangeably. However, several baseline covariates were used in our models, representing all organ systems, several supportive treatments and pre\u2013existing comorbidities. The mortality rate in our study is lower than that reported in one recent cohort of COVID\u221219 patients, (2) but higher than in other reports (34, 35). It remains to be determined whether the associations found here are also present in cohorts with other mortality rates. In addition, the models used had some limitations. All baseline covariates were assumed to be measured without error. The joint models assume the correct specification of random effect structure, and all interdependencies between longitudinal and time\u2013to\u2013event outcomes should be explained by the latent, subject\u2013specific random effects structure. Also, there is a risk of residual confounding. ConclusionsIn conclusion, in this cohort of COVID\u221219 patients with ARDS, exposure to higher \u0394P or MP, or to a higher cumulative exposure to a \u0394P > 15 cm H2O or a MP > 17 J/min over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation had associations with increased risk for 28\u2013day mortality. To ascertain a causal relationship between \u0394P and MP with mortality, randomized clinical trials are needed.
