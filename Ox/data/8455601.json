Liao, L. Kretzner, B. S\u00e9raphin, and M. Rosbash, Genes Dev. 4:1766-1774, 1990). To examine the contribution of these regions to U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) activity, a competitor U1 gene, encoding a nonfunctional U1 snRNA molecule, was introduced into a number of strains carrying a U1 snRNA gene with loop II or yeast core mutations. The presence of the nonfunctional U1 gene lowered the growth rate of these mutant strains but not wild-type strains, consistent with the notion that mutant U1 RNAs are less active than wild-type U1 snRNAs. A detailed analysis of the U1 snRNA levels and half-lives in a number of merodiploid strains suggests that these mutant U1 snRNAs interact with U1 snRNP proteins less well than do their wild-type counterparts. Competition for protein factors during snRNP assembly could account for a number of previous observations in both yeast and mammalian cells.", "author": [{"author": "F Stutz", "affiliation": ["Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02254."], "href": "/?term=Stutz+F&cauthor_id=8455601"}, {"author": "X C Liao", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Liao+XC&cauthor_id=8455601"}, {"author": "M Rosbash", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Rosbash+M&cauthor_id=8455601"}], "refPMID": ["4557193", "1754372", "375221", "6760197", "2578319", "3888403", "2411548", "2944599", "2440584", "3306922", "2962858", "3371356", "3043665", "3056718", "2744461", "2684770", "2136774", "2405391", "2560754", "2560755", "2138978", "2143105", "2208274", "2147421", "1826349", "353511"], "citedInPMID": ["8455601", "34476547", "23755256", "10022888", "9570323", "8861964", "8196608", "7816623"], "body": ""}
