This paper exploits fission yeast CTD mutants in which single coding cues (or combinations of cues) are subtracted from all consensus heptads to gauge the roles of the Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7 phosphoacceptors in gene expression. Transcriptome profiling revealed distinctive signatures for the CTD phosphoacceptors that were verified by cell-based activity assays. The results highlight (i) the role of Tyr1 and Ser2 in repressing the iron uptake regulon and (ii) the distinctive roles of Thr4 and Ser7 in the phosphate starvation response, whereby Thr4 facilitates and Ser7 represses the induction of Pho1 acid phosphatase.Keywords: iron homeostasis, phosphate homeostasis, transcription profiling AbstractThe primary structure and phosphorylation pattern of the tandem Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 repeats of the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) comprise an informational code that coordinates transcription, chromatin modification, and RNA processing. To gauge the contributions of individual CTD coding \u201cletters\u201d to gene expression, we analyzed the poly(A)+ transcriptomes of fission yeast mutants that lack each of the four inessential CTD phosphoacceptors: Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7.

The majority of the protein-coding RNAs affected in Y1F cells were coordinately affected by S2A, suggesting that Tyr1-Ser2 constitutes a two-letter code \u201cword.\u201d Y1F and S2A elicited increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake (Frp1, Fip1, Fio1, Str3, Str1, Sib1), without affecting the expression of the genes that repress the iron regulon, implying that Tyr1-Ser2 transduces a repressive signal. Y1F and S2A cells had increased levels of ferric reductase activity and were hypersensitive to phleomycin, indicative of elevated intracellular iron. The T4A and S7A mutations had opposing effects on the phosphate response pathway. T4A reduced the expression of two genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate acquisition (the Pho1 acid phosphatase and the phosphate transporter SPBC8E4.01c), without affecting the expression of known genes that regulate the phosphate response pathway, whereas S7A increased pho1+ expression. These results highlight specific cellular gene expression programs that are responsive to distinct CTD cues. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the Rpb1 subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) consists of tandemly repeated heptapeptides of consensus sequence Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7. The inherently plastic CTD structure is modulated by phosphorylation of the Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5, and Ser7 residues and by cis\u2013trans isomerization of the prolines (1, 2). With as many as 128n potential CTD primary structures (where n is the number of heptads), the CTD provides information about the state of the transcription machinery\u2014a CTD code\u2014that is \u201cread\u201d by CTD receptor proteins that control transcription, modify chromatin structure, and catalyze or regulate mRNA capping, splicing, and polyadenylation (1, 2).Basic informational rules that govern the CTD code have been elucidated by genetically manipulating the composition and structure of the Rpb1 CTD in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (3\u20137). By introducing alanines and conservative mutations in lieu of Tyr1, Ser2, Pro3, Thr4, Ser5, Pro6, and Ser7 of every consensus heptad of a fully functional Rpb1 CTD array (comprising 14 consensus heptad repeats linked to the body of Rpb1 by a \u201crump\u201d consisting of four degenerate heptads), we determined that: (i) Tyr1, Pro3, Ser5, and Pro6 are essential for viability, by the criterion that alanine substitution is lethal, whereas Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7 are not essential; and (ii) Y1F, S2A\u2022S7A and T4A\u2022S7A mutants are viable, signifying that phenylalanine is functional in lieu of Tyr1 and that Ser5 is the only strictly essential phosphorylation site in fission yeast (6).Further interrogation of the grammar and punctuation of the CTD code established that: (i) all essential coding letters and \u201cwords\u201d are encompassed within a diheptad repeat; (ii) the minimal fission yeast CTD coding unit is a decapeptide Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7Y1S2P3 and the spacing between coding units is flexible; (iii) Tyr1 must be present in consecutive heptads and proper spacing between consecutive tyrosines is important for CTD function; (iv) Pro3, Ser5, and Pro6 need not be present in adjacent heptads; and (v) Ser5(P)-Pro6 comprises an essential two-letter code word that is read chiefly by the mRNA capping apparatus (7). Querying how perturbations of CTD primary structure affect CTD serine phosphorylation patterns in vivo, as gauged by Rpb1 reactivity with phosphospecific antibodies, showed that Ser2 phosphorylation does not rely on Ser5, Pro6, Ser7, or Thr4, whereas Ser5 phosphorylation does not depend on Ser2, Thr4, or Ser7.The fact that four of the five phosphoacceptor coding letters of the CTD heptad are not essential in fission yeast raises important questions as to whether and how these phosphate marks impact gene expression, the extreme situations being that absence of a particular CTD-PO4 mark has little or no effect or that loss of a coding cue does exert significant effects, albeit on the expression of genes that are not essential under the laboratory conditions surveyed. The latter scenario applies to the Ser2 coding letter, insofar as a heterothallic haploid fission yeast rpb1-S2A mutant can grow vegetatively, but is unable to mate with heterothallic WT cells of either mating type, i.e., S2A is sterile. Sterility results from the inability of S2A cells to induce expression of the Ste11 transcription factor that triggers the meiotic sexual differentiation pathway (5, 6, 8). Microarray analyses of the transcriptome of S2A cells vs. WT highlighted \u22651.5-fold changes in the expression level of many meiotically regulated genes (5, 9). The Ser2 requirement for transcription during sexual differentiation was bypassed by subtracting Ser7, suggesting that imbalance in the phosphorylation array, not absence of a CTD-PO4 cue, underlies a CTD-associated pathology (6).In the present study, we apply high-throughput RNA sequencing methods (RNA-seq) to gauge globally the impact of the loss of each of the four inessential CTD phosphoacceptors on gene expression. By comparing the poly(A)+ transcriptomes of four fission yeast mutants, rpb1-Y1F, -S2A, -T4A, and -S7A, we illuminate how individual letters of the Pol II CTD code affect the expression of distinct sets of genes. Validation of selected transcriptional programs by functional tests identified Tyr1 and Ser2 as a two-letter coding word that governs an iron-uptake regulon (10) and Thr4 and Ser7 as components of the phosphate response pathway that regulates Pho1 expression. ResultsRNA-Seq Analysis of rpb1-CTD Mutants. RNA-seq affords a detailed strand-specific annotated map of the protein-coding and noncoding fission yeast transcripts vs. their genomic DNA loci (11\u201313). Here we performed RNA-seq on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from cells expressing Rpb1 with CTDs composed of the rump plus 14 consensus YSPTSPS heptads or an identical number of Y1F, S2A, T4A, or S7A mutant heptads (6). We also analyzed CTD double mutants Y1F\u2022S7A, S2A\u2022S7A, and T4A\u2022S7A. cDNAs obtained from two nonsimultaneous biological replicates (using RNA from cells grown to midlog phase at 30 \u00b0C) were sequenced for each strain. In all of the datasets, \u223c90% of the reads were mapped to unique genomic loci (Fig. S1), and expression levels were highly reproducible between biological replicates (Fig. S2). As an internal control, we queried the cDNA sequences encoding the Rpb1 CTD itself and found that between 99.7% and 100% of the CTD mRNA reads were correct with respect to the WT or relevant mutant CTD, with the rare exceptions corresponding to other CTD variants that were bar-coded in the pooled sequence run (Fig. S1). A cutoff of plus or minus twofold change in normalized transcript read level and a corrected P value of <0.05 were the criteria applied to derive lists of differentially expressed annotated loci for each rpb1-CTD single-mutant vs. the WT CTD strain.The results are presented as heat maps for the ensemble of significantly changing protein-coding and noncoding RNAs (Fig. S3) and as four separate Venn diagrams in Fig. 1, showing protein-coding transcripts that were down-regulated (Fig. 1A) or up-regulated (Fig. 1B) and noncoding transcripts that were down-regulated (Fig. 1C) or up-regulated (Fig. 1D) in the Y1F, S2A, T4A, and S7A strains. There was a clear hierarchy of CTD mutational effects on the number of annotated coding plus noncoding RNAs dysregulated, whereby S2A (n = 481) had greater impact than Y1F (n = 107) or S7A (n = 97) and T4A (n = 15) had only scant effects on gene expression. Of the 5,133 annotated protein-coding transcripts in fission yeast, 157 (3.1%) were down-regulated in S2A; 54 (1.1%) in Y1F; 25 (0.5%) in S7A; and only 4 (0.08%) in T4A. To the extent that the at least twofold decrement in individual transcript levels in these mutant strains reflects a contribution of the missing CTD coding letter or phosphorylation mark for achieving normal levels of transcription or processing of the affected mRNAs, these results are remarkable for how few fission yeast genes rely on these CTD cues. However, the modest effects of the rpb1-CTD Y1F, T4A, and S7A mutations on mRNA levels were in keeping with the fact that these strains grow as well as WT cells in YES medium at 30 \u00b0C (6). The S2A strain, in which more mRNAs are down-regulated, grows slightly slower than WT at 30 \u00b0C; this is the case even when the length of the CTD S2A array appended to the rump is increased from 14 to 25 heptads (Fig. S4).Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Effect of CTD mutations on the fission yeast transcriptome. Four Venn diagrams specify the numbers of protein-coding (A and B) and noncoding (C and D) poly(A)+ transcripts that were significantly down-regulated by at least twofold (A and C) or significantly up-regulated by at least twofold (B and D) in the indicated rpb1-CTD strains relative to WT strain.Even fewer protein-coding transcripts were up-regulated in response to CTD mutations: 70 (1.4%) in S2A; 33 (0.6%) in S7A; 17 (0.3%) in Y1F; and 3 (0.06%) in T4A. We surmise that the pertinent CTD coding letters or phosphorylation marks negatively regulate the transcription or processing of a limited set of fission yeast mRNAs.The situation was quite different with respect to the effect of CTD mutations on the noncoding poly(A)+ transcriptome, whereby S2A elicited up-regulation of 203 (11%) of the 1,889 annotated noncoding RNAs. By contrast, 19, 11, and 0 noncoding RNAs were up-regulated in Y1F, S7A, and T4A cells, respectively (Fig. 1D). These findings implicate the Ser2 hydroxyl and/or the Ser2-PO4 mark as a negative regulator of noncoding RNA biogenesis. Relatively few noncoding RNAs were down-regulated in the CTD mutants: 51 (2.7%) in S2A; 28 (1.5%) in S7A; 17 (0.9%) in Y1F; and 8 (0.4%) in T4A (Fig. 1C).RNAs Dysregulated by Y1F Are Coordinately Dysregulated by S2A. From this point forward, we will focus our analysis on the extent to which the CTD mutations exert their effects on distinct vs. overlapping sets of RNAs, as a means of gleaning clues to the syntax of the CTD code. The rationale is that, if mutations in two coding letters coordinately affect the expression of a common set of genes, the two letters might well comprise a coding word read by proteins that control expression of the shared target gene set. Inspection of the Venn diagrams in Fig. 1 highlights a consistent overlap pattern, whereby the majority of the RNAs that were dysregulated by Y1F were coordinately dysregulated by S2A. For example, 32 of the 54 protein-coding RNAs down-regulated in Y1F cells were also repressed in S2A cells (P < 5.8 \u00d7 10\u221236, hypergeometric test). The shared target set for Y1F and S2A down-regulation (Fig. S5, Upper) is rich in genes encoding enzymes of nucleotide, sugar, and amino acid metabolism. Similarly, 9 of the 17 noncoding RNAs down-regulated by Y1F were also down-regulated by S2A (P < 7.6 \u00d7 10\u221211; Fig. 1).The coregulation theme extends to the RNAs that increase in response to CTD mutations. Ten of the 17 protein-coding RNAs that were up-regulated by Y1F were coordinately up-regulated by S2A (P < 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221215). The shared set for up-regulation (Fig. S5, Lower) comprises mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron uptake and/or regulated by iron (Str3, Frp1, Fip1, Fio1, Str1, Srx1) and proteins induced during meiosis (Ppk31, Mde5, Mug136, Meu14). Seventeen of the 19 noncoding RNAs up-regulated by Y1F were also up-regulated by S2A (P < 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221217). No comparable extent of overlap was evident for any other pair of CTD mutants. These results suggest that Tyr1 and Ser2 are a two-letter CTD coding word that governs the expression of a discrete subset of fission yeast genes.Tyr1 and Ser2 Transduce Repression of an Iron Uptake Regulon. Fission yeast has a finely tuned system of iron homeostasis entailing regulated expression of genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake (10). Key players are the cell surface ferric reductase Frp1 that converts extracellular ferric ion to ferrous ion, which is then transported across the cell membrane by the oxidase\u2013permease complex composed of Fio1 and Fip1 proteins. A parallel pathway of iron acquisition entails the action of a ferrochrome siderophore, synthesized by Sib1 and Sib2, and cell surface siderophore transporters Str1, Str2, and Str3. The mRNAs encoding Frp1, Fio1, Fip1, Str1, and Str3 were all up-regulated in the Y1F strain versus the isogenic WT strain, by 16-fold, 15-fold, 14-fold, 10-fold, and 98-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). These five RNAs were also up-regulated in S2A cells, as was the RNA encoding Sib1. Moreover, the mRNAs encoding Frp1, Fip1, Fio1, Str3, and Str1 were up-regulated in the CTD double-mutants Y1F\u2022S7A and S2A\u2022S7A (Fig. 2), fortifying the inference that CTD coding letters Tyr1 and Ser2 act to down-regulate iron uptake genes. The RNA-seq results were verified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-qPCR analyses, which showed that the levels of mRNAs encoding Fio1, Fip1, and Frp1 were up-regulated in the Y1F, S2A, Y1F\u2022S7A, and S2A\u2022S7A mutants, but not in the S7A mutant (Fig. S6 A\u2013C).Open in a separate windowFig. 2.CTD mutations Y1F and S2A derepress an iron uptake regulon. The expression levels (reads per kilobase per million reads; RPKM) of genes involved in iron uptake and utilization are shown for the biological replicates of each of the strains specified. The log2 fold changes vs. WT are denoted below the expression levels. Values meeting the dual cutoff criteria of at least twofold change and P < 0.05 are highlighted in brackets in plain font. Values of at least twofold change with P > 0.05 are italicized and in brackets. Other log2 fold change values not meeting either criterion are in plain font. The genes derepressed by CTD mutations are listed above the spacer row shaded gray. The transcriptional regulatory genes that repress the iron regulon are listed below the spacer row.The GATA-family transcription factor Fep1 represses expression of the aforementioned iron uptake genes under iron-replete growth conditions (10, 14). Fep1 binds in an iron-dependent manner to a GATA sequence element [5\u2032-ATC(A/T)GATA(A/T)] in the regulatory regions upstream of the repressible iron uptake genes. Additional iron/Fep1-regulated genes identified by expression profiling with DNA microarrays include those encoding sulfiredoxin Srx1, Fe\u2013S cluster assembly protein Isu1, and heme utilization protein Shu1 (15). The Srx1 mRNA was up-regulated in Y1F, S2A, Y1F\u2022S7A, and S2A\u2022S7A cells (Fig. 2). The Shu1 and Isu1 transcripts were up-regulated in Y1F\u2022S7A and S2A\u2022S7A cells (Fig. 2). (They were also up-regulated in Y1F cells, albeit not at the P value cutoff of 0.05). Thus, the loss of the Tyr1 and Ser2 CTD cues specifically derepresses the regulon governed by Fep1.A trivial explanation for this derepression would be that Y1F and S2A down-regulate the expression of the proteins that repress the iron regulon. These include, in addition to Fep1, the corepressors Tup11 and Tup12 (10, 14). However, this scenario was vitiated by the findings that the Fep1, Tup11, and Tup12 mRNA levels, gauged by RNA-seq, were not affected significantly by the Y1F, S2A, Y1F\u2022S7A, or S2A\u2022S7A mutations (Fig. 2). RT-qPCR analysis verified that the level of mRNA encoding the transcriptional repressor Fep1 was unaffected by these CTD mutations (Fig. S6D). Another possibility would be that Y1F and S2A prompt overexpression of a factor that derepresses the iron regulon, e.g., by negatively regulating Fep1. Grx4 is implicated as a negative regulator of Fep1 (10), but Grx4 expression was not affected significantly in Y1F, S2A, Y1F\u2022S7A, or S2A\u2022S7A cells (Fig. 2). Therefore, we infer that the CTD Tyr1-Ser2 coding word is needed to transduce a repressive signal from Fep1 to the transcription apparatus.Y1F and S2A Affect Iron Homeostasis. If the derepression of the iron regulon at the mRNA level is physiologically important, we would expect to see increased activity of Fep1 regulated proteins in cells bearing the Y1F and S2A CTD mutations. We assayed ferric reductase Frp1 activity by overlaying cells grown on iron-replete medium with agar containing the ferric reductase substrate triphenyltetrazolium chloride, which is reduced by cell surface-associated Frp1 to yield a red pigmented product (14). This assay distinguished the pale WT, S7A, and T4A colonies from the red Y1F, Y1F\u2022S7A, and S2A\u2022S7A colonies (Fig. 3, Right). The S2A strain grew more slowly under these conditions, and hence there were fewer cells on the plate, but it was still apparent that the S2A cells generated red pigment. Thus, the effect of CTD mutations on the activity of the Frp1 enzyme in vivo correlated with the mRNA levels gauged by RNA-seq.Open in a separate windowFig. 3.Y1F and S2A derepress ferric reductase and sensitize to phleomycin. (Left) Phleomycin sensitivity. Midlog phase cultures of the indicated strains grown in yeast extract with supplements (YES) broth at 30 \u00b0C were adjusted to 6 \u00d7 104 cells/mL and aliquots (5 \u00b5L) of serial twofold dilutions were spotted on YES agar medium with no addition (control) or containing 10 \u00b5g/mL phleomycin. The plates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C and photographed after 3 d (control) or 4 d (phleomycin). (Right) Ferric reductase activity. Cells as specified were spotted on YES agar medium containing 50 \u00b5g/mL FeCl3 and grown for 2 d at 30 \u00b0C. The colonies were overlaid with 1% Bacto agar containing 0.1% TTC and 0.067 M phosphate (pH 7). The plate was photographed after incubation for 45 min at 22 \u00b0C.We surveyed the effects of the CTD mutations on the sensitivity of fission yeast to phleomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acids in the presence of iron and oxygen. Derepression of the Fep1-regulated iron uptake regulon causes hypersensitivity to phleomycin toxicity (14) by virtue of increasing the available intracellular iron. The salient findings were that Y1F, S2A, Y1F\u2022S7A, and S2A\u2022S7A strains failed to grow in the presence of 10 \u00b5g/mL phleomycin, a concentration of drug that did not prevent growth of the WT, S7A, and T4A strains (Fig. 3, Left). We conclude from these experiments that CTD Tyr1 and Ser2 are critical informational cues for proper iron homeostasis in fission yeast.Thr4 and Ser7 Govern Expression of Acid Phosphatase Pho1 and Pho1 Induction by Phosphate Starvation. Although the T4A CTD mutation resulted in decreased expression of merely four mRNAs, two of them encode proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis: the secreted acid phosphatase Pho1 and the inorganic phosphate transporter SPBC8E4.01c. The fission yeast phosphate transporter and Pho1 are encoded by adjacent cooriented genes on chromosome II. The Pho1 and phosphate transporter mRNAs were down-regulated by 7.5-fold and fourfold, respectively, in T4A cells and by twofold and 2.7-fold, respectively, in the S2A mutant (Fig. 4A). By contrast, Pho1 was up-regulated twofold in response to the S7A mutation (Fig. 4A). An instructive finding was that Pho1 was down-regulated 12-fold in the T4A\u2022S7A double mutant (Fig. 4A), signifying that the decrement in expression caused by loss of the Thr4 cue was dominant over the gain seen with S7A. The phosphate transporter mRNA was also down-regulated in T4A\u2022S7A cells (Fig. 4A).Open in a separate windowFig. 4.CTD mutations affect expression of acid phosphatase Pho1. (A) Changes in transcript levels for pho1+ and SPBC8E4.01c are shown for the indicated CTD mutant compared with WT cells. (B) Detection of acid phosphatase activity. Exponentially growing cultures of the indicated strains were adjusted to A600 of 0.1 and aliquots (3 \u00b5L) of serial fivefold dilutions were spotted on YES agar or PMG agar medium. After growth for 3 d at 30 \u00b0C, the colonies were overlaid with 1% Bacto agar containing 0.015% \u03b1-naphthyl phosphate and 0.15% Fast Blue Salt in 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.2). The plates were photographed after incubation for 5 min at 22 \u00b0C. (C) Induction of acid phosphatase activity after phosphate starvation. Aliquots of exponentially growing cultures in YES medium were harvested, the cells were washed in water and adjusted to A600 of \u223c0.3 in PMG medium (with 5 \u00b5g/mL thiamine), either with 15.5 mM phosphate (+) or without phosphate (\u2212) to induce Pho1. After incubation for 3 h at 30 \u00b0C, cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in water to attain an A600 of 1.25. To quantify acid phosphatase activity, reaction mixtures (200 \u00b5L) containing 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.2), 10 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 A600 unit of cells were incubated for 5 min at 30 \u00b0C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 mL of 1 M sodium carbonate, the cells were removed by centrifugation, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 410 nm was measured. Acid phosphatase activity is expressed as the ratio of A410 (p-nitrophenol production) to A600 (cells). Each datum in the bar graph is the average of three assays by using cells from three independent cultures \u00b1 SEM.The RNA-seq findings that pho1 mRNA was down-regulated in T4A and T4A\u2022S7A cells and up-regulated in S7A cells were verified by two independent methods: RT-qPCR (Fig. S7D) and primer extension (Fig. S7 A and B). Reverse transcriptase extension of a 32P-labeled DNA primer complementary to nucleotides +33 to +51 of the pho1 ORF revealed a unique product of identical length (\u223c100 nt) in each of the yeast strains, albeit differing in abundance relative to an internal act1 primer extension control (Fig. S7A). By analyzing the pho1 primer extension product in parallel with a chain-terminated sequencing ladder generated by DNA polymerase-catalyzed extension of the same 32P-labeled primer annealed to a pho1 DNA template (Fig. S7C), we mapped the transcription start site to the G position 51 nt upstream of the pho1 AUG start codon.To gauge the effect of the CTD mutations on acid phosphatase activity, we plated serial dilutions of cells on pombe minimal glutamate (PMG) agar medium (which contains 15.5 mM inorganic phosphate), allowed the colonies to attain comparable cell densities, and then overlaid the plate with phosphatase substrate \u03b1-naphthyl phosphate, Fast Blue Salt B stain, and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.2). The secreted acid phosphatase causes formation of a red pigment and relative color intensity provides a semiquantitative assay of Pho1 activity (16). The T4A and T4A\u2022S7A colonies were clearly paler than the WT, whereas the S7A colonies were more red than the WT (Fig. 4B), signifying that the amount of active phosphatase was regulated down or up by CTD mutations in step with the levels of pho1 mRNA. Similar trends in phosphatase staining were seen when the yeast colonies were grown on YES agar medium (which contains \u223c2 mM phosphate), albeit with a higher basal level of phosphatase activity (Fig. 4B). We surmise that the variations in phosphatase activity reflect effects on Pho1 abundance, insofar as the RNA-seq analysis showed that the level of mRNA encoding a second fission yeast phosphatase Pho4 was unaffected by the CTD mutations (Fig. S8).The RNA-seq analysis was performed on yeast cells grown in the presence of phosphate. To determine the impact of the CTD mutations on the induction of Pho1 under conditions of phosphate starvation, cells grown in YES medium were washed and then incubated for 3 h in synthetic medium containing 15.5 mM phosphate, or in medium lacking exogenous phosphate to elicit the starvation response. Acid phosphatase activity was quantified in a solution assay by incubating suspensions of equal numbers of the phosphate-replete or phosphate-starved cells for 5 min with p-nitrophenylphosphate and scoring colorimetrically the formation of p-nitrophenol. The basal phosphatase activity of WT cells was increased sixfold by phosphate starvation (Fig. 4C). Whereas the basal phosphatase activity of T4A cells was fivefold lower than WT, the basal activity of S7A cells was ninefold higher than WT. T4A cells responded to phosphate starvation, but the level of induced phosphatase activity was only half that of WT cells. The constitutively high level of phosphatase activity in S7A cells was increased further during phosphate starvation, to a level twofold higher than in starved WT cells (Fig. 4C). The superinduction of Pho1 activity by S7A was effaced completely in the T4A\u2022S7A strain, which displayed the same diminished basal and induced phosphatase activities seen in the T4A single mutant (Fig. 4C). We conclude that the Thr4 mark normally exerts a positive influence on the phosphate response, whereas the Ser7 mark exerts a strong repressive effect.Pho1 and phosphate transporter expression are induced in response to phosphate starvation via the action of the Zn-finger transcription factor Pho7 (17, 18). The protein kinase Csk1 is a negative regulator of Pho1 and phosphate transporter expression, insofar as both are constitutively induced in csk1\u2206 cells. The fact that constitutive expression of Pho1 is abolished in a csk1\u2206 pho7\u2206 double mutant implies that Pho7 is essential for Pho1 transcription and acts downstream of Csk1 (17, 18). The RNA-seq data indicate that the decrements in Pho1 and phosphate transporter expression in T4A and T4A\u2022S7A cells are not a consequence of decreased expression of the positive regulator Pho7 or increased expression of the negative regulator Csk1, because pho1 and csk1 mRNA levels were not affected significantly by the CTD mutations (Fig. S8).The in vivo chromogenic colony assay indicated that csk1\u2206 cells with a WT CTD elaborated increased phosphatase activity compared with csk1+ cells (Fig. 4B). Quantitative assay of acid phosphatase showed that basal of csk1\u2206 cells was eightfold higher than csk1+ cells (Fig. 4C). The increase in basal Pho1 activity was attenuated in a csk1\u2206 T4A strain, as was the induction by phosphate starvation (Fig. 4C), suggesting that Csk1 acts upstream of the CTD in modulating the phosphate response.It is worth noting that the T4A and T4A\u2022S7A mutations did not significantly affect expression of the SPBC1271.09 gene that encodes a glycerophosphodiester transporter (Fig. S8), even though SPBC1271.09 is part of the phosphate response and coordinately regulated with Pho1 and the phosphate transporter by Pho7 and Csk1 (19). On the contrary, SPBC1271.09 was up-regulated along with Pho1 by the S7A mutation (Fig. S8). These findings highlight the selective impact of T4A and T4A\u2022S7A on expression of the tandemly arranged phosphate transporter and acid phosphatase genes.S7A Up-Regulates the Expression of Many Meiotic Genes. The S7A CTD mutation resulted in the up-regulation of 33 protein-coding mRNAs; 16 of these transcripts encode proteins with known roles in fission yeast meiosis or are RNAs known to be up-regulated during meiosis (Fig. S9), accounting for their naming as meiosis up-regulated genes (Mug) or Mei4-dependent (Mde) genes (20\u201322). Mei4 is a meiosis-specific forkhead transcription factor that up-regulates the expression of multiple meiotic genes, either during sexual differentiation and sporulation or when Mei4 is ectopically expressed in vegetative cells (20\u201322); these include the genes encoding Spo6, Spn5, Spn6, Mfr1, Ght5, Mde3, Mde7, Mde1, Mei2, Mug130, Mug136, Mug147, and SPBC725.10 that were up-regulated in vegetative S7A cells. Because mei4 was itself up-regulated by S7A, it is likely that Mei4 drives the observed up-regulation of several of its target genes in S7A cells. Our results implicate the CTD Ser7 mark as a negative influence on the expression of Mei4 and other meiotic genes.The up-regulation elicited by S7A was largely effaced in the Y1F\u2022S7A and T4A\u2022S7A double mutants (Venn diagrams in Fig. S10). Whereas the majority of mRNAs up-regulated in Y1F cells remained up-regulated in Y1F\u2022S7A cells (11 of 17), this was not the case for the set of mRNAs up-regulated by S7A, of which only 6 of 33 were up-regulated in Y1F\u2022S7A cells. Similarly, 2 of 3 mRNAs up-regulated by T4A remained up-regulated in T4A\u2022S7A cells, but only 8 of 33 mRNAs up-regulated by S7A were up-regulated in T4A\u2022S7A cells (Fig. S10). With respect to the 16 meiotic genes up-regulated by S7A, 11 and 12 were not up-regulated in the Y1F\u2022S7A and T4A\u2022S7A mutants, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological output of a CTD coding letter may be contingent on the state of neighboring coding cues. This point is underscored by the observations that the Y1F\u2022S7A and T4A\u2022S7A double mutations elicited up-regulation of distinctive sets of coding mRNAs that were not up-regulated by the component single mutations (Fig. S10). DiscussionThe CTD code is deeply rooted in eukaryal biology, yet its complexity and output can vary among taxa. The trend, albeit oversimplified, is that the number of heptad repeats comprising the CTD, the minimal number of repeats required for viability, and the prevalence of nonconsensus coding letters increases as one moves up the evolutionary ladder from unicellular to multicellular eukarya, as a means to accommodate and orchestrate the actions of increasing numbers of CTD receptors that regulate gene expression (1, 2). It is reasonable to posit a core CTD code that governs events common to most eukarya; for example, the essential function of the Ser5-PO4\u2013Pro6 coding word in recruiting mRNA capping enzymes to the Pol II elongation complex, which is conserved in budding yeast, fission yeast, and mammals, notwithstanding major differences in genetic and physical organization of the capping apparatus in these taxa (6, 7, 19, 23, 24). The code is plastic (by virtue of the 128 potential structures each heptad can adopt), and can easily expand its functional capacity as new receptors emerge to read the code letters and words. Accordingly, the necessity for specific CTD cues and their impact on cellular gene expression may differ among taxa. The Ser2, Thr4, Ser7, and Tyr1 hydroxyl groups are inessential for vegetative growth of fission yeast (6). In metazoa, Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7 are critical for cell viability and/or specific steps of transcription or RNA processing, e.g., because these coding cues are recognized by components of the processing machinery, some of which are unique to metazoa (25\u201327).The homogeneous primary structure of the fission yeast CTD and the availability of viable rpb1 mutants in which single coding cues (or combinations of cues) are subtracted from all the consensus heptads makes for an attractive experimental system to survey the roles of the Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7 phosphoacceptors in gene expression. As reported here, it was remarkable how few mRNAs were significantly dysregulated at least twofold by the CTD mutations S2A, Y1F, S7A, and T4A, which affected only 4.4%, 1.4%, 1.2%, and 0.14% of the annotated fission yeast protein-coding RNAs, respectively. We note that the method of RNA-seq analysis used here, whereby equal amounts of RNA from different fission yeast strains are subjected to high-throughput sequencing, assumes that the fission yeast strains analyzed produce similar levels of RNA per cell; we cannot exclude the possibility that a CTD mutation might elicit a global increase or decrement in the steady-state levels of all, or most, RNAs per yeast cell, an issue that has been discussed in relation to gene expression analyses in metazoan cells (28). Nonetheless, the analysis is highly instructive with respect to the selective effect of CTD mutations.RNA-seq revealed distinctive gene expression signatures for the CTD phosphoacceptors that were verified by cell-based activity assays. Two examples stand out. First, our studies highlight the role of Tyr1 and Ser2 in repressing the expression of multiple unlinked genes involved in iron uptake that comprise a Fep1-repressed regulon. Although the molecular details remain to be elucidated, we speculate that Fep1 bound to DNA flanking the target gene promoters might interact, through its C-terminal repressor domain (10) or corepressors bound to the repressor domain, with the Pol II CTD to exert a gene-specific repressive effect on transcription (or cotranscriptional RNA processing) and that this interaction depends on Tyr1 and Ser2.Second, we implicated Thr4 as an activator of the expression of two adjacent genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis: a phosphate transporter and the acid phosphatase Pho1. The CTD T4A mutation coordinately reduced pho1 RNA and Pho1 activity at the cell surface. T4A blunted the increase in Pho1 activity that resulted from elimination of the repressive kinase Csk1, thereby placing Thr4 downstream of Csk1, perhaps acting in tandem with the transcriptional activator Pho7. However, the observation that an unlinked third Pho7-responsive gene in the phosphate pathway was not down-regulated by T4A raises the prospect that a particular feature of the transporter-phosphatase locus dictates its reliance on the Thr4 CTD cue. The CTD Ser7 residue was found to exert a negative effect on Pho1 expression, whereby S7A coordinately increased pho1 RNA and Pho1 activity; when S7A was combined with T4A, the latter held sway and Pho1 was down-regulated.In conclusion, the marriage of CTD genetics and transcriptome profiling provides unique insights to the output of the CTD code, especially by Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7. That said, we cannot at present distinguish whether the narrow but specific gene expression dyscrasias elicited by CTD mutations Y1F, T4A, and S7A reflect the lack of phosphorylation of Tyr1, Thr4, or Ser7 or, rather, interference with phosphorylation-independent functions of the respective hydroxyl groups. Making this distinction will be contingent on identifying and genetically controlling the protein kinases responsible for Tyr1, Thr4, and Ser7 phosphorylation in fission yeast, an area that is presently tabula rasa. MethodsThe isogenic heterothallic S. pombe rpb1-CTD strains studied herein express Rpb1 variants in which 14 consensus YSPTSPS WT heptad repeats or 14 heptad repeats with single amino acid substitutions (Y1F, S2A, T4A, S7A) or double substitutions (Y1F\u2022S7A, S2A\u2022S7A, T4A\u2022S7A) in each of the heptads are appended to amino acid 1577 of Rpb1 (6). The mating type, determined by crossing with tester strains, is h\u2212 for all strains studied, except for the sterile S2A mutant, which is h+ (as determined by diagnostic PCR using mat1-P\u2013 and mat1-M\u2013specific primers). RNA was isolated from yeast cells grown in liquid culture in YES medium at 30 \u00b0C to an A600 of 0.4\u20130.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted by using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. The integrity and quantity of total RNA was gauged with an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA by using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit. A TruSeq stranded total RNA sample preparation kit was used for subsequent steps of poly(A)+ RNA fragmentation, strand-specific cDNA synthesis, indexing, and amplification. Indexed libraries were normalized and pooled (n = 8 samples per lane) for paired-end sequencing performed by using an Illumina HiSeq2000/1000 system. Paired-end reads of length 51 bases originating from each sample were aligned with Bowtie 0.12.7 (29) to the S. pombe genome sequence (Ensembl S. pombe, Build EF1, version 13) as well as to its corresponding exon\u2013exon junction database (only the second part of the paired-end reads was considered). As many as three mismatches were allowed. Reads that matched multiple loci were removed from further analysis, and the resulting alignment files were processed to generate \u201cpile-ups\u201d against each chromosome. Differential expression between samples was determined using the DESeq Bioconductor package (30). A cutoff of plus or minus twofold change and corrected P value <0.05 were applied to derive a list of differentially expressed RNAs. The data analysis reported here was limited to the 7,022 annotated protein-coding and noncoding RNAs. Full details of the RNA-seq data processing and normalization of expression levels are provided in SI Methods.
