Originally, a fractionation method was used in which the cells were swollen with hypotonic buffer followed by homogenizing and density-based isolation of nuclei (Blobel and Potter, 1966; Jung et\u00a0al., 2000; Dignam et\u00a0al., 1983). Subsequently, to prepare the nuclear fraction more quickly and easily, methods began to be used in which the homogenization procedures were replaced by vortexing and/or the addition of detergents, such as NP-40, and the density-based isolation steps were often omitted (Andrews and Faller, 1991; Schreiber et\u00a0al., 1989; Maher, 1996). Another method is to apply digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (PM) (Liu and Fagotto, 2011; Thakar et\u00a0al., 2013; Kimura et\u00a0al., 2014). Digitonin is a specific detergent for cholesterol, which is abundant in the PM (Skipski et\u00a0al., 1965; Lange et\u00a0al., 1989; van Meer et\u00a0al., 2008), and has been used to generate semi-intact cells for nuclear transport assays (Adam et\u00a0al., 1990). In addition, there are currently many commercially available kits for extraction or isolation from organelles including nucleus. Although fractionation studies are becoming convenient with easy protocols, the loss of some nuclear proteins and contamination from other compartments cannot be overlooked in many cases.Basically, separating nuclear fractions from cytoplasmic fractions involves only two steps. The first step is to permeabilize the PMs and remove the cytoplasmic fractions. The second step involves breaking the nuclear envelope (NE) and eluting the nuclear fractions. Although this sounds very simple, three problems need to be solved. First, it is necessary to permeabilize the PM while keeping the NE intact. Most methods neglect these verifications, showing only defined nuclear marker proteins. Second, because most facilitated nuclear transport pathways are temperature-sensitive, excessively long incubations under low temperatures during fractionation procedures may cause the mislocalization of nuclear proteins (Richardson et\u00a0al., 1988; Ogawa and Imamoto, 2018). The third problem is leakage of small proteins through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Even when the NE is completely intact, soluble proteins smaller than approximately 60\u00a0kDa leak from the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes (G\u00f6rlich, 1998).In this study, we developed a new method for separating the nuclear soluble fraction from other cytoplasmic fractions much more precisely than those reported previously, overcoming the aforementioned three problems. First, we optimized the conditions, including the treatment temperature for the selective permeabilization of the PMs using digitonin. Second, we identified an inhibitor that prevented leakage of small proteins from the nucleus. Therefore, the loss of soluble and small proteins from the nuclear fractions was remarkably minimized compared to conventional methods. ResultsDigitonin permeabilizationMost facilitated nuclear transport pathways are temperature-sensitive. In fact, the localization of GFP-fused SV40T NLS (nuclear localization signal) stably expressed in HeLaS3 cells leaked from the nucleus to the cytoplasm depending on changes in temperature and incubation time (Figure\u00a0S1). Therefore, permeabilization of the PMs should be performed near physiological temperatures. To apply digitonin for permeabilization at a high cell density (1.25\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells/mL), we examined permeabilization efficiencies at various concentrations and temperatures when the treatment time was kept constant at 5\u00a0min.To determine the processing conditions effectively and assess the permeabilization conditions of individual cells, we used recombinant marker proteins, GFP-importin (Imp) \u03b2 and GST-mCherry (Figure\u00a01A). GST-mCherry is an inert molecule that is large enough to be excluded from the intact nucleus. However, the cytoplasm of suspended cells is very narrow and cytoplasmic signal of GST-mCherry tends to decrease compared with extracellular spaces by virtue of the large structures like organelles and cytoskeletons. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the permeabilization of the PM by means of only GST-mCherry. To improve this problem, we additionally used GFP-Imp \u03b2, which is a nuclear transport receptor that imports proteins bearing classical NLS by binding to adaptor molecules, the Imp \u03b1family, and can translocate on its own through the NPC via interaction with the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains (Kose et\u00a0al., 1997). As shown in Figure\u00a01B, when the PM was selectively permeabilized keeping the NE and NPCs intact (successful permeabilization), both markers entered the cell, and only GFP-Imp \u03b2 localized at NPCs and the nucleoplasm, whereas GST-mCherry localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. In cases of insufficient permeabilization of the PM, both markers were excluded from the cell. Conversely, excessive or over permeabilization caused damage to both the PM and the NE, resulting in both markers entering the nucleus. Thus, the combination of GST-mCherry and GFP-Imp \u03b2 enables to clearly determine the individual cell conditions.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Selective permeabilization of the plasma membranes with digitonin(A) Illustration of the digitonin treatment procedure. The cells were resuspended in digitonin solution and incubated for 5\u00a0min. After washing, the cells were mixed with recombinant marker proteins.(B) The cells treated with digitonin solution were classified as insufficiently, successfully, or over-permeabilized cells according to the penetration of marker proteins into cells and their nuclei. Scale bars\u00a0= 10\u00a0\u03bcm.(C) HeLaS3 suspension-cultured cells were treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solution at various temperatures as indicated.(E) hTERT-RPE1, A549, MCF7, and U2OS cells were trypsinized and treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solution at 25\u00b0C.(D and F) The ratios of successfully, insufficiently, and over-permeabilized cells in (C and E) were calculated. Error bars indicate means \u00b1 SD.The scale bars in (C and E)\u00a0= 50\u00a0\u03bcm. The values at the top and bottom of (D and F) show the ratios of successfully permeabilized cells and total cell numbers for each assay condition, respectively. These assays were independently repeated three times.We examined the permeabilization efficiencies in HeLaS3 cells at various concentrations and temperatures (Figure\u00a0S2). Under ice-cold conditions, by digitonin treatments at concentrations of more than 150\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, the PMs of almost all cells were selectively permeabilized (Figures S2A and S2C). In contrast, at 25\u00b0C, the PMs were selectively permeabilized even at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Figures S2B and S2D). This indicates that temperature, in addition to the digitonin concentration, is an important determinant of selective permeabilization efficiency. This increase in efficiency was demonstrated in the range of 10\u00b0C \u201337\u00b0C (Figures 1C and 1D). Permeabilizations at near physiological temperatures have the advantage of preventing localization changes when the temperature drops (Figure\u00a0S1). Next, we examined the permeabilization efficiencies of some other human cell lines (hTERT-RPE1, A549, MCF7, and U2OS) using 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin at 25\u00b0C (Figures 1E and 1F). The PMs of all cell lines were selectively permeabilized at an efficiency of over 85%. Thus, permeabilization of PMs with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solution at 25\u00b0C can be applied to various cell lines.Inhibition of leakage of GFP through NPCsAs mentioned above, the selected digitonin treatment condition achieved extraction of the cytoplasmic fraction keeping the NE intact with high efficiencies. However, even when the NE was intact, nuclear proteins partially leaked through the NPCs. To completely confine nuclear proteins in the nucleus until nuclear extraction, we focused on leakage of nuclear proteins through the NPCs. For instance, GFP, which is soluble and small enough to diffuse through the NPCs, localized throughout the live cells, but nuclear GFP in the digitonin-treated cells disappeared even though the nuclear entry of GST-mCherry was inhibited (Figure\u00a02A). Therefore, nuclear proteins capable of passing through the NPCs with no external input, such as diffusive proteins, were potentially lost as soon as the PM was permeabilized.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Inhibition of leakage of nuclear GFP(A) HeLaS3/GFP cells were incubated in transport buffer (TB), NP-40, or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Then, the cells were mixed with GST-mCherry.(B) Adherent HeLaS3 cells were stained with antibodies recognizing nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA).(C\u2013E and G) HeLaS3/GFP cells were treated with digitonin solutions supplemented with various concentrations of anti-NPC antibodies (C\u2013E) or biotinylated WGA (G) at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Then, the residual nuclear GFP intensities relative to those before treatment were plotted.(F) HeLaS3/GFP cells were treated with digitonin solutions supplemented with various concentrations of biotinylated WGA at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min.

The residual nuclear GFP intensities relative to those in intact cells were measured. White circles and bars show the values of individual experiments and the average values. These assays were repeated independently three times.(I) Adherent HeLaS3 cells were transiently transfected with GFP. Time-lapse imaging of GFP and Hoechst33342 was performed at 20\u00a0s intervals. Immediately after obtaining the first images (0 s), the cells were treated with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution.(J) Nuclear and cytoplasmic intensities of GFP relative to those before treatment were plotted. Red and blue lines and dotted lines show the nuclear and cytoplasmic intensities of cells indicated by red and blue arrowheads in (I), respectively.(K) At 5\u00a0min after treatment, nuclear GFP intensities relative to those before treatment were plotted. According to intensities before treatment, these were classified into seven groups. These assays were independently repeated four times, and 89 cell samples were analyzed in total.Scale bars in (A), (F), and (I)\u00a0= 20\u00a0\u03bcm and those in (B)\u00a0= 5\u00a0\u03bcm. The numbers in parentheses below the graph in (C-E, G, and H) show the total cell numbers. Error bars in (C-E, G, H and K) indicate means \u00b1 SD.To prevent this leakage, we sought an inhibitor of NPC passages to supplement the digitonin solution by plugging NPCs. First, we focused on antibodies against NPCs because some antibodies against nucleoporins inhibit active nuclear transport (Featherstone et\u00a0al., 1988; Pandey et\u00a0al., 1994; Steggerda et\u00a0al., 2000). We tested three antibodies: mAb414 and QE5, which are antibodies targeting FG repeats of nucleoporins, and RL2, which recognizes proteins modified by O-linked GlcNAc, including many nucleoporins (Figure\u00a02B). HeLaS3 cells stably expressing GFP (HeLaS3/GFP) were treated with digitonin solution supplemented with these antibodies, and nuclear GFP intensities were measured after the treatments. However, these antibodies had no effect on leakage of nuclear GFP (Figures 2C\u20132E).Next, we tested a GlcNAc-specific lectin, namely, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). WGA inhibits the nuclear transport of macromolecules (Finlay et\u00a0al., 1987; Yoneda et\u00a0al., 1987) by binding to many nucleoporins modified with O-linked GlcNAc (Li and Kohler, 2014), and fluorescently labeled WGA can stain NPCs (Figure\u00a02B). Although it was originally thought that WGA selectively inhibits the facilitated transport of macromolecules (Finlay et\u00a0al., 1987; Yoneda et\u00a0al., 1987), Mohr et\u00a0al. showed that the inhibitory effect correlates with the size of the NPC-passing molecule (Mohr et\u00a0al., 2009). As shown in Figures 2F and 2G, permeabilization supplemented with WGA confined GFP in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner, and with the addition of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of WGA, the effect reached a plateau. In addition, we tested several lectins. The inhibitory effect of succinylated WGA (s-WGA), which binds GlcNAc more specifically (Monsigny et\u00a0al., 1979), was slightly lower than that of unmodified WGA (Figure\u00a02H). Sambucus nigra lectin (SNL) and concanavalin A (ConA), which have been reported to inhibit nuclear transport (Emig et\u00a0al., 1995; Finlay et\u00a0al., 1987), did not affect GFP leakage (Figures S3A and S3B). We also examined the effects of lectins on passive diffusions of various molecular weight dextrans (10\u201370kDa) through the NPCs using digitonin-permeabilized cells incubated with lectins (Figures S3C\u2013S3G). Whereas 40 and 70\u00a0kDa dextrans did not enter into the nucleus regardless of the addition of lectins, nuclear entry of 10 and 20\u00a0kDa dextrans were most suppressed by WGA. In addition, we also examined the leakage of 20\u00a0kDa dextran from the nucleus (Figures S3I andS3J). After incubation of digitonin-permeabilized cells with 20\u00a0kDa FITC-dextran, WGA was added. After removal of extracellular FITC-dextran, the residual nuclear FITC-dextran was measured. As a result, WGA indeed delayed the leakage of nuclear FITC-dextran. Therefore, in our assay conditions, we conclude that WGA is the best inhibitor for leakages of nuclear proteins.Furthermore, we performed time-lapse imaging to examine extent of nuclear GFP retained after treatment with digitonin solution supplemented with WGA (digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution) among that of the nuclear GFP before treatment. Adherent HeLaS3 cells transiently expressing GFP were permeabilized with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution (Figure\u00a02I). Although the cytoplasmic GFP in most of the cells disappeared immediately after the addition of digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, more than half of the nuclear GFP remained for much longer periods (Figure\u00a02J). Remarkably, the ratios of nuclear GFP retained after treatment were almost the same irrespective of the expression levels (Figures 2J and 2K). Therefore, WGA supplementation was effective in maintaining nuclear GFP in the nucleus, irrespective of its abundance in a living cell.Effect of WGA on the composition of the nuclear fractionNext, we investigated whether the components of the nuclear soluble fractions obtained by treatment with digitonin alone or with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution differed. Because the addition of detergents may cause insoluble nuclear proteins to be eluted, two freezing and thawing cycles were performed to break the NE and extract the nuclear soluble fractions from cells with permeabilized PM. As shown in Figure\u00a03A, GST-mCherry penetrated the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells after freeze-thaw cycles. In addition, the nuclear GFP retained in the cells with permeabilized PM with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution disappeared after freeze-thaw cycles.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Effect of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on trapping the small nuclear proteins in the nucleus(A) After treatment with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, HeLaS3/GFP cells were frozen and thawed twice. Then, the cells were mixed with GST-mCherry, and the permeabilities of the NEs were observed. Scale bar\u00a0= 20\u00a0\u03bcm.(B) A flowchart of sample preparation for the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteome. After harvesting 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3 cells, these were mixed with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. After washing with transport buffer, the cells were resuspended in PBS(\u2212) and frozen and thawed twice. After centrifugation, the supernatants were labeled with iTRAQ.(C) A volcano plot of differences of abundances between nuclear soluble fractions extracted with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution. A two-sample t test with false discovery rate <0.05 was applied. All proteomic measurements were performed three times. Red and blue dots show protein expressions increased or decreased by 20% or more, respectively. Among them, filled and empty circles indicate protein expression changes that are significant (p\u00a0< 0.05) and not significant (p > 0.05), respectively. Protein names of all detected transport factors and nucleoporins are shown in the plots.(D) Differences of abundances relative to molecular weights were re-plotted. Red and blue points show protein expressions increased or decreased by 20% or more, respectively. Among them, filled and white circles indicate protein expression changes that are significant (p\u00a0< 0.05) and not significant (p > 0.05), respectively. The list shows all protein expressions that significantly increased or decreased by 20% or more.For the proteome analysis of the nuclear soluble fractions, we prepared samples as shown in Figure\u00a03B. After 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3 cells were treated with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, the cells were resuspended in PBS(\u2212) and frozen and thawed twice, followed by centrifugation. After removal of biotinylated WGA by binding to streptavidin beads, the nuclear soluble fractions obtained with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution compared to that with digitonin solution were analyzed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative mass spectrometry analysis (Figure\u00a03C and Table S1) (Ross et\u00a0al., 2004; Zieske, 2006). In total, 1,566 proteins were identified in all three independent experiments, of which 50 and 15 increased and decreased significantly by more than 20%, respectively (p\u00a0< 0.05). The proteins reduced by more than 20% included four nucleoporins (Nup54, Nup88, Nup93, and Nup160), which have been reported to be O-GlcNAcylated (Wang et\u00a0al., 2010; Li and Kohler, 2014). These were probably removed or concentrated in the insoluble fractions by binding to biotinylated WGA trapped by streptavidin beads. Because levels of nuclear transport receptors, such as Imp \u03b2, and other transport factors did not decrease and some even increased, the supplementation of WGA appeared to have few adverse effects on the components of the nuclear soluble fraction. Next, we analyzed the relationships between the changes in nuclear abundance and their molecular weights (Figure\u00a03D). The supplementation of WGA remarkably concentrated proteins smaller than approximately 50\u00a0kDa in the nuclear soluble fraction. In contrast, the proteins whose levels decreased were independent of their molecular weight. These results indicated that WGA supplementation contributed to the preservation of small nuclear proteins in the nucleus of cells with permeabilized PM.Comparison with commercially available kitsNext, we compared immunofluorescence images and biochemical fractionations using commercially available kits (Fujifilm Wako and Thermo Scientific) and our methods (Figures 4A and 4B). In our methods, after treatment with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, the supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. After two freeze-thaw cycles of the cells with permeabilized PM followed by centrifugation, the supernatants and pellets were used as the nuclear soluble and insoluble fractions, respectively. \u03b1-Tubulin and RanBP1, which were localized to the cytoplasm, were well separated into cytoplasmic fractions through all methods. As in the immunofluorescence images of GAPDH, partial nuclear localization was reflected in the nuclear soluble fractions only in our two methods using digitonin.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation using commercial kits(A, B, and G) Adherent HeLaS3 cells were stained with DAPI and antibodies against various proteins. The images of GFP show the cells transiently transfected with the EGFP expression plasmid. Scale bar\u00a0= 20\u00a0\u03bcm. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionations of HeLaS3/GFP cells were performed using four methods, namely, two commercial fractionation kits, fractionation methods using digitonin and digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solutions. Proteins in each fraction were detected using western blotting. \u201cCyto,\u201d\u201cNuc,\u201d and \u201cPpt\u201d show cytoplasmic, nuclear, and insoluble fractions, respectively. Numbers on the left side of the bands show marker positions (kDa). Bar graphs show the ratios of fractions enriched with each protein in these four methods.(C\u2013F) After treatment with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, HeLaS3 cells were washed quickly. Then, the cells were fixed at various time points as indicated and stained with DAPI and antibody against each protein. In the case of GFP in (F), HeLa/GFP cells were used.Among the nuclear proteins, we examined those with different dynamic characteristics. In our two methods, lamin A/C and histone H3, which are less dynamic nuclear proteins, were predominantly concentrated in pellet fractions. In contrast on using the two commercial kits, these proteins were eluted in the nuclear fractions in addition to the pellet fractions. Similarly, in our method, a modestly dynamic protein, RCC1, which binds to chromatin and is sensitive to Triton X-100 and high concentrations of NaCl (Ohtsubo et\u00a0al., 1989; Chatterjee and Paschal, 2015), was mainly concentrated in the pellet fractions, whereas using the commercial kits, most was eluted into the nuclear fractions. These results imply that some detergents or high concentrations of cations included in the commercial kits interfered with binding to the intranuclear structures. Surprisingly, PCNA and RanBP3, which are more dynamic and soluble nuclear proteins, were concentrated in the nuclear soluble fractions in our two methods, whereas they were lost in the nuclear fractions and leaked into the cytoplasmic fractions when using the two commercial kits. These results indicate that the elution processes of the cytoplasmic fractions of the two commercial kits are somewhat imprecise, causing damage to the integrity of the NE and/or NPCs.Additionally, we also checked cytoskeleton, ER, Golgi apparatus, and NPC proteins (Figure\u00a0S4). In our two methods, as with the intermediate filament Vimentin, Calnexin and RCAS1, which are integral proteins of ER and Golgi respectively, were concentrated in pellet fractions. However, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is a soluble protein localized in the lumen of ER, was detected in the nuclear soluble fractions. This may be caused by the disruption of ER membrane in addition to the NE by the freeze-thaw process for the extraction of the nuclear soluble fractions. WGA supplementation concentrated Nup62 and Nup214, which have been reported to be O-GlcNAcylated (Wang et\u00a0al., 2010; Li and Kohler, 2014), into the pellet fractions whereas Nup153 and Nup358 were less affected.Small proteins confined to the nucleusNext, we examined the degree of endogenous small proteins confined to the nucleus. HeLaS3 cells were first treated with digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, and then, the cells were incubated on ice for various times. The cells at each incubation time were stained with antibodies against profilin 1 (PFN1; 15\u00a0kDa), thioredoxin (TXN; 12\u00a0kDa), or Ran (24\u00a0kDa), which were detected using proteomic analysis (Figure\u00a03). WGA supplementation remarkably inhibited their leakage from the nucleus (Figures 4C\u20134F). However, unlike larger soluble proteins, such as RanBP3 (55\u00a0kDa) (Figures S5A and S5B), whose nuclear leakage was not considerably affected by the presence of WGA, long incubations of TXN and GFP caused gradual leakage from the nucleus (Figures 4D, 4F, S3D, and S3F). Therefore, in cases focusing on small proteins, the washing procedures after digitonin treatment should be quick. Similarly to Figures 4A and 4B, we compared these small proteins in the fractions prepared using our methods and commercially available kits (Figure\u00a04G). As a result, all proteins in the nuclear soluble fractions were detected only in our method using digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution.Furthermore, to clarify whether the effect of WGA on the leakage of small proteins from the nucleus is caused by the inhibition of facilitated nuclear transport or passive diffusion, we compared the localizations of several small proteins under energy-depleted or nuclear export-inhibited conditions. Under the energy-depleted condition by glucose-free medium supplemented with 2-deoxyglucose and sodium azide (2DG\u00a0+ Az), Ran was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus as previously reported (Cushman et\u00a0al., 2004) (Figure\u00a0S4D upper left images). Similar to the immunofluorescence images, Ran in the nuclear soluble fraction prepared using digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution decreased (Figure\u00a0S4D lower left images). On the other hand, in the cells treated with Leptomycin B (LMB), which inhibits Exportin1 (CRM1)-dependent nuclear export, RanBP1 accumulated in the nucleus as previously reported (Plafker and Macara, 2000) (Figure\u00a0S4D upper right images). With or without the supplementation of WGA, RanBP1 increased in the nuclear soluble fractions of LMB-treated cells (Figure\u00a0S4D lower right images).Next, we examined five small proteins, PFN1, TXN, Biliverdin Reductase B (BLVRB; 22kDa), Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding Protein 1 (HINT1; 14\u00a0kDa), and Acid Phosphatase 1 (ACP1; 18\u00a0kDa), which were detected using proteomic analysis (Figure\u00a03). As shown in Figure\u00a0S4E upper images, the localizations of all these proteins were little affected by energy-depletion or inhibition of active nuclear export whereas only the localization of TXN under energy-depleted condition was slightly biased from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. These results imply that partial presences of these proteins in the nucleus were mainly due to passive diffusion through the NPCs rather than facilitated transport. As shown in Figure\u00a0S4E lower images, the nuclear soluble fraction prepared using digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution contained these small proteins more than that using digitonin solution. Therefore, the supplementation of WGA indeed contributes to the inhibition of the leakage of small proteins from the nucleus. DiscussionHere, we demonstrated digitonin-based selective permeabilization of the PM with high efficiencies near the physiological temperature range and inhibition of small nuclear protein leakage from the nucleus during fractionation. Because our methods do not use detergents other than digitonin, which has low extraction efficacy (Michelsen and von Hagen, 2009), nuclear fraction from using our methods is assumed to contain only soluble nuclear proteins with high purity (Figure\u00a04B). However, as shown in Figures 3C, 3D, and S4C, some glycosylated proteins were affected by WGA. Therefore, when focusing on glycosylated proteins, WGA supplementation should be carefully determined. We could not identify antibodies that inhibited leakage of nuclear GFP (Figures 2C\u20132E). This may be because the binding of the antibody to the NPCs was extremely slow to prevent leakage of nuclear GFP or the antibody was too large to completely occlude the NPCs. Smaller antibodies, such as nanobodies targeting nucleoporins, may be used as inhibitors for leakages (Pleiner et\u00a0al., 2015, 2018).As shown in Figure\u00a03, WGA supplementation enriched only 50 of 1,556 identified proteins into the nuclear soluble fraction, most of which were smaller than 50kDa. Previous nuclear proteome analysis including small nuclear proteins using manually dissected nuclei of Xenopus oocytes showed that the distinct composition of the nucleus and the cytoplasm is primarily maintained by retention of proteins in large complexes (W\u00fchr et\u00a0al., 2015). Because we only identified relatively abundant proteins, deeper proteomic analyses or further fractionation processes may be needed to identify nuclear translocations of less abundant proteins such as transcription factors. In Figures 4C\u20134F and S5, we showed that small proteins slowly leak from the nucleus of the cells permeabilized with digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution. On the other hand, in Figure\u00a0S3J, 20kDa FITC-dextran in the nucleus treated with WGA leaked faster. This difference may reflect the fact that endogenous small proteins weakly associate with large complexes in the nucleus.Biochemical nuclear fractionation is a significant step in the investigation of intranuclear protein function. However, limitations of the commercially available fractionation kits have been pointed out in several studies (Murray et\u00a0al., 2009; Liu and Fagotto, 2011). Indeed, we showed that relatively soluble nuclear proteins, namely, PCNA and RanBP3, were lost from the nuclear fractions when using the commercial kits. Nuclear soluble fractions probably contain proteins that statistically interact with core functional molecular complexes or structures, such as transcriptional complexes and chromatin. These dynamic proteins may delicately modulate well-known basic functions to realize precise regulations depending on their environments or cell states. Our methods are helpful for the identification and functional analysis of soluble nuclear proteins, which are becoming more important for detailed nuclear functions.Limitations of the studyAlthough the newly developed method yields a more complete nuclear soluble proteome than conventional methods, it still loses some degree of the low-molecular-weight proteins and some glycoproteins contained in the nuclear fraction.

HeLaS3 cells stably expressing GFP or GFP-SV NLS (Ogawa and Imamoto, 2018) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL G418 at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in non-coated dishes. HeLaS3 cells in adherent culture conditions, human telomerase immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cell (hTERT-RPE1), lung epithelial cell (A549), breast cancer cell (MCF7), and osteosarcoma cell (U2OS) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in tissue culture dishes.DNA plasmids GFP-human Imp \u03b2 was generated by inserting the BamHI-XhoI fragment into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6P-2/hGFP vector (Yokoya et\u00a0al., 1999). GST-mCherry was generated by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-6p-1 (GE Healthcare). For transfection, the BamHI\u2013EcoRI fragment of SV NLS (PKKKRKV; Kalderon et\u00a0al., 1984) was inserted into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (6086-1; TaKaRa Bio Inc.).Recombinant protein expression and purification Transformation of Escherichia coli expression vectors, protein expression, bacterial cell lysis, and protein purification of GFP-Imp \u03b2 and GST-mCherry were performed as described previously (Imamoto et\u00a0al., 1995; Miyamoto et\u00a0al., 2002; Ogawa and Imamoto, 2018). Plasmids for recombinant proteins were transformed into the E.\u00a0coli BL21 strain. After culture at 37\u00b0C for 4\u20136 h, recombinant proteins were expressed by the addition of 0.1\u00a0mM of IPTG to the culture at 18\u00b0C overnight. The bacterial pellets were suspended in lysis buffer [50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) 500\u00a0mM NaCl, and 1\u00a0mM EDTA (pH 8.0)] and lysed by freezing, thawing, and sonication. After centrifugation at 20,000\u00a0rpm, the supernatants were mixed with glutathione sepharose (17-0756-05; GE Healthcare) for GST-GFP-Imp \u03b2 and GST-mCherry. GST-mCherry was eluted by the addition of 10\u00a0mM of reduced glutathione in PBS(-). GFP-Imp \u03b2 was purified by cleaving the N-terminal GST tag using PreScission protease (27084301; GE Healthcare) at 80\u00a0U/mL beads.Preparation of digitonin solutions Digitonin (300410; Calbiochem, Merck) was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 20\u00a0mg/mL and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. To prepare the digitonin solution, the digitonin stock solution was mixed in transport buffer [TB; 20\u00a0mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 110\u00a0mM potassium acetate, 2\u00a0mM magnesium acetate, 5\u00a0mM sodium acetate, and 2\u00a0mM EGTA-NaOH (pH 7.3), protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (complete, EDTA-free, 11873580001; Merck) at a concentration of 1 tablet per 50\u00a0mL]. To prepare a digitonin solution supplemented with WGA (digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution) or succinylated WGA, 5\u00a0mg/mL biotinylated WGA solution (B-1025-5; VECTOR LABORATORIES) or 5\u00a0mg/mL biotinylated succinylated WGA solution (B-1025S-5; VECTOR LABORATORIES) was mixed in 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solution.Antibodies The antibodies used in this study were as follows: mAb414 (Davis and Blobel, 1986) (902902; BioLegend) at 1:500 for IF, QE5 (Pant\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 1994) (ab24700; Abcam) at 1:100 for IF, RL2 (Holt et\u00a0al., 1987; Snow et\u00a0al., 1987) (NB300-524; Novus biologicals) at 1:200 for IF, mouse anti-GAPDH (sc-32233; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, mouse anti-\u03b1-tubulin (T9026; Merck) at 1:500 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, goat anti-RanBP1 (ab17034; Abcam) at 1:200 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, mouse anti-Lamin A/C (sc-7292; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 for both IF and WB, rabbit anti-Histone H3 (ab1791; Abcam) at 1:200 for IF and 1:5000 for WB, goat anti-RCC1 (sc-1162; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 for both IF and WB, mouse anti-PCNA (610665; BD Biosciences) at 1:2000 for WB, mouse anti-PCNA (sc-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:50 for IF, rabbit anti-RanBP3 (NB100-74647; Novus biologicals) at 1:100 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, mouse anti- profilin 1 (PFN1) (67390-1-Ig; Proteintech) at 1:100 for IF and 1:2000 for WB, rabbit anti- thioredoxin (TXN) (14999-1-AP; Proteintech) at 1:50 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, rabbit anti-Calnexin (2679; Cell Signaling TECHNOLOGY) at 1:1000 for WB, rabbit anti-PDI (3501; Cell Signaling TECHNOLOGY) at 1:1000 for WB, rabbit anti-RCAS1 (12290; Cell Signaling TECHNOLOGY) at 1:1000 for WB, rabbit anti-HINT1 (10717-1-AP; Proteintech) at 1:100 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, mouse anti-ACP1 (sc-390190; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, mouse anti-BLVRB (sc-373692; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:50 for IF and 1:1000 for WB, and mouse anti-Ran (610341; BD Biosciences) at 1:500 for IF and 1:1000 for WB.

In suspension culture conditions, the cells grown in 100mm dishes were transferred into 50ml tubes. After counting the number of cells, the cells were transferred to 15mL tubes and centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5min, then the supernatants were aspirated followed by the addition of TB pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C using a water bath to adjust the cell density to 1.25\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells/mL. The cell pellet was resuspended using voltex mixer at top speed for 5sec. In adherent culture conditions, the cells grown in 100mm dishes were washed with 10ml of 0.5mM EDTA in PBS(-) pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C. After the addition of 1mL of trypsin solution (0.05% Trypsin, 0.5mM EDTA in PBS(-)), the dishes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5min. Immediately after the cells were resuspended by gentle pipetting, 10mL of medium pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C were added, and the cell suspensions were transferred into 15mL tubes. After counting the number of cells, the 15mL tubes were centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5min, and the supernatants were aspirated followed by the addition of TB pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C to adjust the cell density to 1.25\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells/mL. For 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells, 800\u00a0\u03bcL of the cell suspension was transferred into a 1.5-mL test tube. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1min and removal of the supernatant, the cells were resuspended by gentle pipetting in 800\u00a0\u03bcL of the digitonin solution pre-warmed at the indicated temperature using a block incubator and incubated for 5\u00a0min, inverting the tube every 1\u00a0min to maintain homogeneity. After the cells were briefly centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 1min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended by gentle pipetting in 1\u00a0mL of ice-cold TB. Permeabilizations of both PM and NE in Figures 2A and2G were performed using NP-40 in TB. Similar to the digitonin treatments, the cells were incubated with ice-cold 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL NP-40 in TB for 5\u00a0min.Determinations of digitonin permeabilization efficiencies The cells permeabilized under each condition were resuspended in TB containing 2% BSA, GST-mCherry (2.5\u03bcM), and GFP-Imp (0.25\u00a0\u03bcM) at room temperature. Then, the cells were applied to 8-well chambered cover glasses and imaged using an inverted confocal microscope. PM integrity was determined by the presence of GST-mCherry and GFP-Imp \u03b2 in the cells. The integrity of NE and NPCs was determined based on whether only GFP-Imp \u03b2 entered the nucleus and GST-mCherry was excluded from the nucleus.Time-lapse imaging of GFP For GFP imaging in Figures 2I\u20132K, HeLaS3 cells in adherent culture conditions were grown on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes for one day. The pEGFP-C1 plasmid was transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (301425; QIAGEN). At one- or two-days post-transfection, Hoechst33342 (H3570; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and then the cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After removal of the medium, 1\u00a0mL of TB at ambient temperature was added and time-lapse imaging at 20 sec intervals was performed at room temperature. After the first images of GFP and Hoechst33342 were obtained, 1\u00a0mL of 80\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin in TB supplemented with 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL biotinylated WGA was added.Immunofluorescence and WGA staining HeLaS3 cells in adherent culture conditions were grown on PLL-coated cover glass in a 12-well plate for two days. After removal of the supernatants, the cells were fixed with 1\u00a0mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(-) at 37\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. After the buffer was removed, 1mL of PBS(-) at ambient temperature was added. After removal of the buffer, 1\u00a0mL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS(-) was added, and the samples were incubated for 5min at room temperature. After removal of the buffer, 1\u00a0mL of PBS(-) at ambient temperature was added. After removal of the buffer, 1\u00a0mL of 3% skim milk in PBS(-) was added, and the samples were incubated for 1-2h at room temperature. Incubations with primary antibodies were performed in 3% skim milk in PBS(-) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS(-) at ambient temperature three times, incubations with secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies were performed in 3% skim milk in PBS(-) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The cells for staining with anti-PCNA antibody were fixed with 100% methanol at \u221230\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. After washing with PBS(-), the cells were incubated with 3% BSA in PBS(-) for 2 hours at room temperature. Incubation with anti-PCNA antibody was performed in 3% BSA in PBS(-) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS three times, incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies was performed in 3% BSA in PBS(-) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBS(-), all samples were incubated in PBS(-) containing DAPI (340-07971; DOJINDO) at a concentration of 500\u00a0ng/mL for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The samples were then mounted with ProLong diamond antifade mounting medium ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"P36961\",\"term_id\":\"547831\",\"term_text\":\"P36961\"}}P36961; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For staining with WGA, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS(-) at 37\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. After washing with PBS(-), the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS(-) for 5\u00a0min. Then, the cells were incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL WGA-Alexa Fluor594 ({\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"W11262\",\"term_id\":\"1285567\",\"term_text\":\"W11262\"}}W11262; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS(-) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with PBS(-), the sample was mounted with ProLong diamond antifade mounting medium.Sample preparation for iTRAQ First, 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3 cells in the suspension culture conditions were centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, and the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellets were mixed by gentle pipetting with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of TB pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellets were mixed by gentle pipetting with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin with or without 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of biotinylated WGA at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellets were resuspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold TB, and centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec. After the supernatant was aspirated, the cells were resuspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcL ice-cold PBS(-) supplemented with protease inhibitors. To check permeabilization as a result of each experimental condition, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of the cell suspension was mixed with 10\u00a0\u03bcL of 5\u00a0\u03bcM GST-mCherry and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM GFP-Imp \u03b2 and the resulting mixture was observed using confocal microscopy. The permeabilized cells were frozen and thawed twice using liquid nitrogen and a block incubator set at 25\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 21,500 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatants were collected as nuclear soluble fractions. In addition, 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 intact cells in PBS(-) were frozen and thawed twice. After centrifugation at 21,500 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was collected as a whole soluble fraction. Then, 80\u00a0\u03bcL of streptavidin magnetic beads (DB11205; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed twice with PBS(-) and mixed with a whole soluble fraction and nuclear soluble fractions obtained with and without biotinylated WGA for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C and the beads were then removed. Next, all three fractions were quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225; Thermo Fisher Scientific).iTRAQ labeling First, 90\u00a0\u03bcg of each fraction was adjusted to 200\u00a0\u03bcL with PBS(-) and labeled using the iTRAQ Reagent multiplex kit (4352135; SCIEX) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then, the fractions were mixed with 100% acetone pre-chilled at \u221230\u00b0C and incubated at \u221230\u00b0C for 4 hours. After centrifugation at 2,200 \u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was removed. Then, the precipitates were dissolved in 20\u00a0\u03bcL of dissolution buffer and mixed with 1\u00a0\u03bcL denaturant and 2\u00a0\u03bcL reducing reagent followed by incubation at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour. Then, the fractions were mixed with 1\u00a0\u03bcL of cysteine blocking reagent and incubated for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. Next, the fractions were trypsinized using 10\u00a0\u03bcg of tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (4370282; SCIEX) at 37\u00b0C for 16 hours. Three out of four iTRAQ reagents (114 [4352137; SCIEX], 115 [4352153; SCIEX], 116 [4352154; SCIEX], and 117 [4352155; SCIEX]) were mixed with 70\u00a0\u03bcL of ethanol. Then, each fraction was mixed with one of the iTRAQ reagents and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 hour. After sufficient chilling on ice, all fractions were mixed into one sample. These fractionations and labeling were repeated, and three independent samples were prepared.Peptide analysis using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS The peptides were subjected to LC (EASY-nLC 1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a nanospray ion source in positive mode. LC was performed on a NANO-HPLC capillary column C18 (75\u00a0\u03bcm \u00d7 150\u00a0mm, 3\u00a0\u03bcm particle size, Nikkyo Technos) at 45\u00b0C. The peptides were eluted with a 100\u00a0min 0\u201330% acetonitrile gradient and a subsequent 20\u00a0min 30\u201365% gradient in the presence of 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The Q Exactive-MS was operated in the top-10 data-dependent scan mode. The parameters for the Q Exactive operation were as follows: spray voltage, 2.3 kV; capillary temperature, 275\u00b0C; mass range (m/z), 350\u20131800; and normalized collision energy, 28%. Raw data were acquired using Xcalibur software.Protein identification and quantitation The MS and MS/MS data were searched against the SwissProt database (2019_01) using Proteome Discoverer ver. 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with MASCOT search engine software ver. 2.6.0 (Matrix Science). The search parameters were as follows: taxonomy, Homo sapiens; enzyme, trypsin; static modifications, methylthio (Cys), iTRAQ 4plex (N-Terminus), and iTRAQ 4plex (Lys); dynamic modifications, oxidation (Met) and iTRAQ 4plex (Tyr); precursor mass tolerance,\u00a0\u00b1 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance,\u00a0\u00b1 20 mDa; maximum missed cleavages, two; and quantitation, iTRAQ 4plex. Proteins were considered identified when their false discovery rates were less than 5%. The total amount of each sample was normalized to the total peptide amount using Proteome Discoverer ver. 2.2.Fractionations and sample preparations for SDS-PAGE First, 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3/GFP (Figure\u00a04) or wildtype HeLaS3 (Figure\u00a0S4) cells in the suspension culture conditions were centrifuged at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, and the supernatant was aspirated. The cell pellets were mixed by gentle pipetting with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of TB pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, the supernatant was aspirated. For nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionations using digitonin or digitonin\u00a0+ WGA solution, the cell pellets were mixed by gentle pipetting with 800\u00a0\u03bcL of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin with or without 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of biotinylated WGA at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, the supernatants were collected. The cell pellets were resuspended by gentle pipetting in 400\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold TB. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 gfor 30sec, the supernatants were collected. The cell pellets were resuspended by gentle pipetting in 400\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold TB. After centrifugation at 2,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30sec, the supernatants were collected again. All supernatants (\u223c1600\u00a0\u03bcL) were used as the cytoplasmic fractions. The cell pellets were resuspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcL of ice-cold PBS(-) supplemented with protease inhibitors and frozen and thawed twice using liquid nitrogen and a block incubator set at 25\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 21,500 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatants and the final insoluble fractions were used as nuclear soluble fractions and pellet fractions, respectively. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionations in Figure\u00a04 were performed using two commercial kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells. Briefly, the fractionation from 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3/GFP cells using LysoPure Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extractor Kit (295-73901; FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals) was performed with 500\u00a0\u03bcL of nuclear fractionation buffer and 250\u00a0\u03bcL of nuclear extraction buffer. The fractionation from 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3/GFP cells using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (78833; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed with 51000\u00a0\u03bcL of CER I, 55\u00a0\u03bcL of CER II, and 500\u00a0\u03bcL of NER. Final pellets of all methods were resolved in 1\u00d7 sample buffer via sonication and used as pellet fractions. All fractions except for the pellet fractions were precipitated using four times the volume of pre-chilled acetone at \u221230\u00b0C for 4 hours. After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, the pellets were resolved in 1\u00d7 sample buffer for SDS-PAGE.Analysis of the nuclear translocation of FITC-dextran For experiments of the diffusive entry of FITC-dextran into the nucleus (Figures S3C\u2013S3G), 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 HeLaS3 cells in the suspension culture conditions were treated with 800\u03bcl of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solutions supplemented with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Hoechst3342 at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. After wash with ice-cold TB, the permeabilized cells were divided evenly into 4 tubes. Then, the cells were incubated with either 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL WGA, s-WGA, SNL or ConA on ice for 10min. Immediately after the cells were mixed with 1\u03bcM FITC-dextran, the cell suspension was placed on a multi-well glass-bottom plate (155411PK; Thermo Fisher Scientific) set on the inverted confocal microscope stage. Between\u00a03min and 4min after the addition of FITC-dextran, the samples were imaged.Analysis of the leakage of FITC-dextran from the nucleus For experiments of the leakage of FITC-dextran from the nucleus (Figures S3I\u2013S3J), 3\u00a0\u00d7 105 HeLaS3 cells in adherent culture conditions were grown on PLL-coated 35-mm glass-bottom dishes for 30-40 hours. After wash with 1\u00a0mL of TB at ambient temperature, the cells were treated with 2\u00a0ml of 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL digitonin solution supplemented with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Hoechst3342 at ambient temperature for 5\u00a0min. After removal of the supernatant, the cells were washed with 2\u00a0mL of TB at ambient temperature. Then, the cells were incubated with 1ml TB supplemented with 10\u00a0\u03bcM 20\u00a0kDa FITC-dextran and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Hoechst3342 at ambient temperature for 5\u00a0min. Then, 5\u00a0mg/mL biotinylated WGA was added at a final concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and incubated for 10\u00a0min. After removal of the supernatant, the dish was set on the inverted confocal microscope stage. Immediately after the addition of 2\u00a0mL TB at ambient temperature, time-lapse imaging at 30 sec intervals was performed at room temperature.Energy depletion and nuclear export inhibition For energy depletion experiments in Figures S4D and S4E, HeLaS3 cells were washed with PBS pre-wormed at 37\u00b0C, and incubated in glucose-free DMEM (09891-25; Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10\u00a0mM sodium azide (195-11092; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical), 6\u00a0mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose (10722-11; Nacalai Tesque), 10\u00a0mM Hepes-NaOH (pH7.3) and 10 % FBS for 1h. For nuclear export inhibition experiments, Leptomycin\u00a0B (431050; Calbiochem, Merck) was added into the culture medium at final concentration of 10ng/mL, and the cell were incubated for 1 hour.Fluorescence microscopy Confocal imaging was performed at room temperature using an FV1200 microscope equipped with a Multi-Alkali photomultiplier tube detector (Olympus). Imaging of GFP/Alexa488 and mCherry/Alexa594 in Figures 1, \u200b,2B,2B, and S2 were obtained using an oil-immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO60XO, 60\u00d7 1.42 NA [Olympus]; immersion oil, n\u00a0= 1.516; pinhole, 95\u00a0\u03bcm [Figure\u00a04], 110\u00a0\u03bcm [Figures 1 and S2] and 105\u00a0\u03bcm [Figure\u00a02B]). Imaging of DAPI/Hoechst33342, Alexa488/GFP/FITC, and mCherry was performed using an oil-immersion objective lens (PLAPON60XO, 60\u00d7 1.42 NA [Olympus]; immersion oil, n\u00a0= 1.516; pinhole, 95\u00a0\u03bcm [Figures 2I, \u200bI,4,4, S1, S3, S4D and S4E] and 105\u00a0\u03bcm [Figure\u00a03A]). All confocal imaging acquisitions were performed using FV10-ASW (4.02; Olympus). Time-lapse imaging shown in Figures 2I\u20132K, S3I, and S3J was performed in one-shot mode with a Z-drift compensator (IX3-ZDC [Olympus]).Quantification and statistical analysisAll analyses of fluorescence-based localization were performed using the image analysis software, ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). A series of single-channel images did not undergo any imaging operations but were set at the same contrast. Only images of mCherry channel in Figure\u00a03A were individually adjusted to roughly same intensities because images of GST-mCherry after freeze-thaw were somewhat brighter than those before treatments. All statistical analyses and graph drawing were performed using Excel (2013; Microsoft) and Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). After subtracting the background intensities, all nuclear and cytoplasmic GFP intensities were calculated. In Figure\u00a04, the band intensities of western blotting were measured using ImageJ software. After subtracting the background, the proportion of band intensity of each fraction was calculated and converted into a band graph using Excel.
