{"title": "Antisense oligonucleotide technology can be used to investigate a circular but not linear RNA-mediated function for its encoded gene locus", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s11427-020-1743-8", "PMID": "32815066", "abstract": "As a class of powerful molecular tool, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are not only broadly used in protein and RNA biology, but also a highly selective therapeutic strategy for many diseases. Although the concept that ASO reagents only reduce expression of the targeted gene in a post-transcriptional manner has long been established, the effect and mechanism of ASO reagents on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription are largely unknown. This raised question is particularly important for the appropriate use of ASOs and the valid interpretation of ASO-mediated experiments. In this study, our results show that linear RNA ASO attenuates transcription of nascent transcripts by inducing premature transcription termination which is combinatorially controlled by Integrator, exosome, and Rat1 in Drosophila. However, circular RNA (circRNA) ASO transfection does not affect transcription activity of the encoded gene. These data suggest that the ASO technique can be applied to study a circRNA-mediated but not linear RNA-mediated function for its encoded gene locus.", "author": [{"author": "Zhenxing Song", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Song+Z&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Ruirui Jia", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Jia+R&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Mingfeng Tang", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Tang+M&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Fei Xia", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Xia+F&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Haiyang Xu", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Xu+H&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Zhengguo Li", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China."], "href": "/?term=Li+Z&cauthor_id=32815066"}, {"author": "Chuan Huang", "affiliation": ["School of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. chuanhuang@cqu.edu.cn.", "Center of Plant Functional Genomics, Institute of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China. chuanhuang@cqu.edu.cn."], "href": "/?term=Huang+C&cauthor_id=32815066"}], "refPMID": ["23792564", "16239144", "25882383", "9115264", "22483619", "21925386", "16700890", "27047251", "29101586", "28192393", "29928511", "31809743", "22289350", "27288447", "20407428", "23241633", "18802435", "19239894", "27694840", "32206104", "29773557", "26177684", "27462427", "31636958", "22726834", "28735898", "31924447", "26308897", "31924448", "25664725", "30526278", "29174924", "28663102", "24145798", "17028158", "21851223", "20007866", "21368223", "27427483", "29192260", "30737432", "22392217", "8917506", "29632207", "31016534", "31530651", "22980978", "27571848", "29655315", "14960586", "31269210", "26220997", "22386318", "27105038", "31754456", "31636956"], "citedInPMID": ["32815066", "34745938", "34489400", "34385309", "34107019", "33898883", "33408778"], "body": ""}
