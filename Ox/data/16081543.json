BPV-1-induced fibropapillomas in cattle consist of proliferating populations of both squamous epithelial cells and dermal fibroblasts. The BPV-1 transformation of rodent cells in tissue culture has provided a robust assay to define the viral genes involved in cellular transformation and to dissect the molecular mechanisms of virus-mediated transformation (1, 2). BPV-1-transformed mouse cells are anchorage-independent and are tumorigenic in nude mice. Interest in the transformation function of the papillomaviruses stems largely from the association of some of the human papillomaviruses, such as HPV16 and HPV18, with human cancers, most notably human cervical cancer (3).Genetic analyses have mapped the transforming activities of BPV-1 to three viral genes: E5, E6, and E7 (4). The E5 gene encodes a hydrophobic membrane protein of 44 aa that binds and dimerizes the platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor, stimulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and inducing cellular proliferation (5\u20137). E5 also binds the 16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar H(+)\u2013ATPase complex (8, 9), and has been reported to decrease cell surface expression of MHC class I by causing its retention within the cell (10). The BPV-1 E6 gene encodes an oncoprotein of 137 aa that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and binds a number of cellular proteins, including ERC-55, paxillin, the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP, and the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 (11\u201315). Studies with BPV-1 E6 mutants have revealed a strong correlation between E6 binding to the focal adhesion protein paxillin and its transformation capacity (12). Either E5 or E6 alone is sufficient to transform cells, and mutation of either in the context of the BPV-1 genome decreases its transforming activity (5, 16).The role of BPV-1 E7 in cellular transformation has been less well studied. The E7 gene encodes a 127-aa zinc-binding protein that potentates the transforming activities of other BPV-1 oncogenes. By itself, BPV-1 E7 does not induce focus formation or anchorage independence, but enhances the transformation activity of BPV-1 E5 and BPV-1 E6 (17). When BPV-1 E7 is coexpressed with either E5 or E6, it synergizes with these oncogenes to boost transformation efficiency 4- to 10-fold (17). Mutations in the E7 gene also significantly decrease transformation in the context of the full BPV-1 genome (18, 19).In contrast to BPV-1 E7, the E7 proteins encoded by cancer-associated, high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have been well characterized. Of the many interacting proteins identified for HPV E7, the most prominent include members of the retinoblastoma (pRB) tumor suppressor family. HPV E7 binds and inactivates pRB and the related p107 and p130 \u201cpocket proteins,\u201d thereby releasing the E2F transcription factor and promoting S phase progression (20). However, BPV-1 E7 is <20% identical to HPV E7 proteins, and lacks the LXCXE motif that mediates the binding of the HPV E7 proteins to the pRB family of proteins (20). Thus, BPV-1 E7-mediated transformation likely involves mechanisms that do not require direct binding to pRB.No cellular targets of BPV-1 E7 have yet been identified. Therefore, we set out to identify cellular proteins associated with BPV-1 E7 to gain insight into possible mechanisms by which BPV-1 E7 contributes to the transformed phenotype. Using the proteomic approach of tandem affinity purification (TAP), we have identified p600 as a E7-interacting protein, and show that the ability of E7 to bind p600 correlated with its transforming ability. Materials and MethodsCells. Monolayer cultures of murine C127 cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (GIBCO/BRL) containing 10% FBS and supplemented with penicillin (10 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml).Cloning and Expression of BPV-1 E7. BPV-1 E7 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the retroviral expression vectors pOZ-C and pOZ-N (21), which placed the E7 protein in frame with either a C-terminal FLAG/hemagglutinin (HA) tag or an N-terminal FLAG/HA tag, respectively. These vectors express a bicistronic mRNA encoding the FLAG/HA-E7 protein and the interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 as a surface marker. By using standard transfection and retroviral production procedures, pOZ-E7-C (plasmid 5087) and pOZ-E7-N (plasmid 5088) were used to generate C127 cells stably expressing FLAG/HA tagged E7. The transduced subpopulation was purified by repeated cycles of affinity cell sorting for the interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 surface marker (21). BPV-1 E7 was also cloned into pOZ without an epitope tag (plasmid 5089), and stable cells lines were created as described above. Targeted mutations in E7 were generated by PCR and cloned in pOZ-C, and stable cell lines were created as described above. These include deletion of amino acids 5\u20139 (E7-C \u03945\u20139, plasmid 5090), deletion of amino acids 90\u201394 (E7-C \u039490\u201394, plasmid 5091), and a proline-to-alanine substitution at residue 5 (E7-C P5A, plasmid 5092). All E7 vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. For expression of BPV-1 E6, cells were transduced with a retrovirus generated by using pBabe-puro-E6, kindly provided by J. J. Chen (University of Massachusetts, Worcester) (22). Cells expressing E6 were selected for by passage in 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin.Purification of BPV-1 E7-Associated Protein Complexes. Cytoplasmic extracts from cells expressing E7-C and control C127 cells were prepared as described (23). Briefly, 1 \u00d7 109 adherent cells were scraped in medium, collected by centrifugation at 650 \u00d7 g for 11 min at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS, and spun again. Cell pellets were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.3/10 mM KCl/5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/1.5 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitors) and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 350 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were lysed by the addition of one pellet volume of hypotonic buffer and dounce homogenization by using a tight pestle. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 834 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected, and glycerol added to a final concentration of 20%. The cytoplasmic extract was dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.3/60 mM KCl/0.2 mM EDTA/10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol/1.5 mM MgCl2/20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. After dialysis, extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and stored at -80\u00b0C until use.E7-protein complexes were isolated from cytoplasmic extracts by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-HA antibody according to established procedures (21). Briefly, cytoplasmic extracts were precleared by incubation with protein-A and protein-G conjugated agarose beads (Invitrogen). Extracts were then incubated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody conjugated agarose (Sigma, A2220) overnight, and beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0/100 mM KCl/5 mM MgCl2/0.2 mM EDTA/10% glycerol/0.1% Tween/5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors). E7-protein complexes were eluted from beads by competitive elution using 50 \u03bcg/ml FLAG peptide dissolved in wash buffer. E7 protein complexes were then further purified by incubation with anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma, A2095) for 4 h, and beads were washed extensively with wash buffer. E7 protein complexes were eluted from beads by competitive elution using 50 \u03bcg/ml HA peptide dissolved in wash buffer. Purified proteins were analyzed on NuPAGE Tris-Bis 4\u201312% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) run in 1\u00d7 Mops buffer, and visualized with Colloidal Coomassie blue staining. Bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry at the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility (Boston).Anchorage-Independent Growth Assays. Thirty-five-millimeter dishes were prepared with a bottom layer of 0.5% Noble agar (Difco), DMEM, and 10% FBS, and a top layer of 0.3% Noble agar, DMEM, and 10% FBS seeded with cells (either 5 \u00d7 102 or 1 \u00d7 103 cells) (19). Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, and colony formation was quantified after 14 days.Generation of BPV E7 Antibody. E7 was cloned into pGEX6P and expressed with a GST fusion protein at its N terminus in BL21(DE3) bacteria. Bacteria were lysed following manufacturer's directions, and GST-E7 protein was purified by using glutathione resin. Purified GST-E7 was resolved by SDS/PAGE, visualized by copper staining, excised from the gel, and used to generate polyclonal rabbit antiserum (Strategic Biosolutions, Newark, DE).Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting. Cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100/50 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, pH 8.0/150 mM NaCl/1 mM EDTA, plus protease inhibitors) at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C, and soluble lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with FLAG lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gels run in 1\u00d7 Mops bufferAfter SDS/PAGE analysis, proteins were transferred to poly-(vinylidene difluoride) and probed with specific antibodies to detect the protein of interest. E7 was detected by using a rabbit polyclonal anti-E7 antibody diluted 1:500; FLAG/HA-tagged E7 was detected by using anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Diagnostics) diluted 1:500; p600 was detected by using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1,000, and actin was detected with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:100,000. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Knockdown of p600 by RNA Interference (RNAi). The RNAi expression vector pSilencer-hygro (Ambion) was used to knockdown p600 protein by using the target sequence 5\u2032-GCAGTACGAGCCATTCTAC-3\u2032 (plasmid 5092). By standard transfection and retroviral production procedures, retroviruses were used to generate C127 cells stably expressing p600 RNAi or the control RNAi (provided by Ambion), and cells were selected in the presence of hygromycin. To analyze levels of p600, cells were lysed directly in protein sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. ResultsExpression and Transformation Activity of Tagged BPV-1 E7 Proteins. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of BPV-1 E7-mediated transformation, we chose to identify cellular proteins that complex with BPV-1 E7. Using TAP, a proteomic approach, BPV-1 E7 was tagged with two affinity tags (in this case, the FLAG and HA epitopes) and stably expressed in C127 mouse cells, which are commonly used to analyze BPV-1 transformation functions.These tagged BPV-1 E7 genes as well as untagged E7 were cloned into a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-derived expression vector under the control of the retroviral LTR promoter. Two TAP constructs were generated with the tandem FLAG/HA epitope tag located at either the N terminus of the E7 protein (termed E7-N) or the C terminus (E7-C). Cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing a bicistronic mRNA encoding the E7 constructs and an IL2R-surface marker. E7-expressing cells were selected by multiple rounds of affinity cell sorting using an antibody against the IL2R surface marker. Stable expression of tagged-E7 proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Cells stably expressing E7-N, E7-C, or untagged E7 protein were lysed and E7-complexes were immunoprecipitated by using an anti-FLAG antibody (for E7-N and E7-C) or an anti-E7 antibody (for untagged E7) and detected by immunoblot using anti-BPV-1-E7 antibody (Fig. 1A).Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Transformation assay of FLAG/HA-tagged and untagged BPV-1 E7. (A) Mouse C127 cells were transduced with retrovirus expressing BPV-1 E7 with a FLAG/HA epitope tag at either the C terminus (E7-C) or N terminus (E7-N), or with no tag (E7). Cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated by using either an anti-FLAG antibody (Left) or an anti-BPV-1 E7 antibody (Right). Proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and probed by immunoblotting using the anti-E7 antibody. (B) Cells were assayed for anchorage-independent growth with transduced BPV-1 oncogenes: C127 control cells, cells expressing BPV-1 E7 alone, BPV-1 E6 alone, E6 and E7, E6 and C-terminal FLAG/HA-tagged E7 (E7-C), and E6 and N-terminal FLAG/HA-tagged E7 (E7-N). Cells were suspended in 0.3% Noble agar, DMEM, and 10% FBS and grown for 14 days. Representative fields are shown at \u00d710 magnification. For further details, see Table 1.To determine whether the FLAG/HA tag adversely affected the transformation function of BPV-1 E7, cells stably expressing BPV-1 E6 and either untagged E7 or tagged E7 were assayed for anchorage-independent growth. BPV-1 E7 has been previously shown to enhance growth of anchorage-independent colonies induced by BPV-1 E6 (17\u201319). As anticipated, untagged E7 reproducibly enhanced E6-mediated transformation as evidenced by an increase in both the size and the number of colonies when compared to cells expressing E6 alone (Fig. 1B and Table 1). E7-C retained the ability to enhance E6-mediated transformation, whereas E7-N was nonfunctional in this assay. C127 cells expressing either no viral oncogenes or BPV-1 E7 alone did not form colonies in soft agar. Therefore, we concluded that the FLAG/HA tag fused at the C terminus did not alter the transforming activity of E7, whereas the FLAG/HA tag fused to the N terminus impaired its transformation function. Thus, we used the functional E7-C fusion protein in subsequent experiments to identify E7-interacting proteins that might be related to its transformation activity.Table 1.Cells assayed for anchorage-independent growth with transduced BPV-1 oncogenes Colony formation \n Expt. 1  Expt. 2  Expt. 3  C127  0  0  0  E7  0  0  0  E6  10  14  13  E6 + E7  66  77  79  E6 + E7-C  96  113  101  E6 + E7-N  15  12  12 Open in a separate windowCells (5 \u00d7 102) were plated in duplicate as described in Fig. 1B, and the number of anchorage-independent colonies were counted after 14 days and averaged. Results from three separate experiments are shown.Purification of BPV-1 E7 Interacting Proteins: Identification of p600. E7-C was observed by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence to be expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of transduced cells (data not shown); therefore, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells stably expressing E7-C, as well as control C127 cells. Protein complexes containing E7-C were immuno-purified under native, nondenaturing conditions by using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads, washed extensively, and eluted from the antibody-conjugated beads via competitive elution using FLAG peptide. Protein complexes were further immuno-purified by using anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads, washed extensively, and eluted from antibody-conjugated beads by using HA peptide. Proteins were then resolved by SDS/PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 2). A number of proteins were present after the two rounds of immuno-affinity purification from E7-C-expressing cells, whereas no protein bands were detectable from control C127 cells. Protein bands were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Proteins identified included BPV-1 E7, actin, and \u03b2-tubulin. Mass spectrometry analysis of three bands migrating above the 160-kDa marker revealed that they were fragments of the mouse homolog of the human p600 protein (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AF348492\",\"term_id\":\"19070471\",\"term_text\":\"AF348492\"}}AF348492, Entrez GeneID 23352). The mass values obtained from the three bands by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry matched 32 peptides from C-terminal half of p600. These three protein bands most likely represent protein fragments generated by proteolysis that occurred during purification. We show below that E7 coimmunoprecipitates with a single band migrating at \u2248600 kDa that most likely represents the full-length p600 protein.Open in a separate windowFig. 2.Purification of BPV-1 E7-associated proteins. Protein extracts were prepared under nondenaturing conditions from cells expressing E7-C or C127 control cells. Proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose, and protein complexes were eluted by using FLAG peptide. Proteins were further purified by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose, and protein complexes were eluted by using HA peptide. Samples were then resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel, and bands were visualized by Colloidal Coomassie blue staining. Arrows indicate proteins bands excised and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.p600 was first identified from HeLa cells as a protein that associates with the retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor protein (Y.N., unpublished data). The human version of p600 is predicted to be 5,183 aa, whereas the murine version is predicted to be 5,405 aa (GenBank accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"XM_355528\",\"term_id\":\"63517294\",\"term_text\":\"XM_355528\"}}XM_355528). p600 has been observed both in the nucleus (at the mitotic spindle, nuclear envelope, and nucleolus) and in the cytoplasm (punctuate throughout the cytoplasm, as well as concentrated at the leading edge of cell protrusions) (Y.N., unpublished data). p600 has been hypothesized to play multiple roles in the cell, including activating integrin-mediated cell survival pathways via signaling thought the cytoskeleton, and as a chromatin scaffold. Knockdown of p600 with RNAi sensitizes cells to anoikis, an apoptotic pathway induced by cell detachment or serum starvation.BPV-1 E7 and p600 Associate in Vivo. To further characterize the E7-p600 protein complex, we performed coimmunoprecipitations using more stringent lysis and washing conditions (see Materials and Methods). Protein extracts were prepared from C127 control cells, cells expressing the E7-C fusion protein, or the E7-N fusion protein. Proteins complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 3 Left). Indeed, immunoblotting for p600 showed that a single band migrating above the 183-kDa marker coimmunoprecipitated from cells expressing the functional E7-C fusion protein, but not from cells expressing nonfunctional E7-N fusion protein or control cells. The presence of BPV-1 E6 did not adversely affect the interaction between p600 and E7-C, although there did appear to be more protein bands detected by the p600 antibody. Actin and \u03b2-tubulin were not detected in these E7-immunoprecipitates as evaluated by immunoblotting, suggesting that actin and \u03b2-tubulin are not required for the association of E7 and p600 (data not shown). In the reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation with the anti-p600 antibody co-precipitated BPV-1 E7 (Fig. 3 Right). Taken together, these results identify p600 as a bona fide BPV-1 E7-interacting protein.Open in a separate windowFig. 3.Coimmunoprecipitation of BPV-1 E7 and p600. (Left) Cells stably expressing the tagged-E7 and/or E6 proteins and control C127 cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG antibody. Proteins complexes were resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel, and probed by immunoblotting with anti-p600 antibody (Upper) or anti-HA antibody (Lower). (Right) Cells stably expressing E7-C and control C127 cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-p600 antibody. Proteins complexes were resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel, and probed by immunoblotting with anti-p600 antibody (Upper) or anti-HA antibody (Lower).BPV-1 E7 Amino Acids 5\u20139 Are Required for Interaction with p600 and for Enhancement of E6-Mediated Transformation. It is interesting to note that the E7-p600 interaction correlated with the ability of E7 to transform cells, because E7-C interacted with p600 and stimulated anchorage-independence, whereas E7-N did not interact with p600 and was unable to stimulate anchorage independence. To further investigate this correlation, we generated a series of E7 mutants and tested them for their ability to interact with p600 and to stimulate anchorage independence.BPV-1 E7 shares extensive homology with the E7 proteins encoded by other ungulate papillomaviruses, including deer papillomavirus (DPV) and elk papillomavirus (EPV) (Fig. 4). Like BPV-1, these viruses also readily transform rodent cells in tissue culture (24, 25). Interestingly, the E7 protein encoded by ungulate papillomaviruses lack the conical LXCXE pRb-binding domain found in the HPV E7 proteins, suggesting that ungulate papillomaviruses may not need to engage pRB and the related pocket proteins as part of their life cycle (26). Indeed, it is worth noting that the TAP analysis of BPV-1 E7-associated proteins did not identify pRB, p107, p130, or any known pRB-associated proteins. Assuming that p600 is a conserved target among the papillomavirus E7 proteins and could play a role in transformation by those E7 proteins that are oncogenic, we compared the BPV-1 E7 protein with the other ungulate papillomavirus E7 homologs, and to HPV16 E7, to determine whether there were any conserved domains. The first 16 aa of HPV E7, referred to as conserved region 1 (CR1), have been shown to be important in papillomavirus-induced transformation (27, 28). This region is also somewhat conserved in BPV-1 E7 and the other ungulate E7 proteins. CR1 was initially characterized in the E1A oncoprotein of adenovirus as a region required for cellular transformation, and is also conserved in simian virus 40 large T antigen. The presence of CR1 in oncoproteins of divergent DNA tumor viruses suggests a conserved mechanism involved in cellular transformation. At the time of this study with BPV-1 E7, Huh et al. (29) showed that HPV16 E7 also complexed p600 and that an HPV16 E7 mutant deleted of amino acids 6\u201310 (which align with BPV-1 E7 amino acids 5\u20139) abolished p600 binding. Therefore, we generated the analogous mutation in BPV-1 E7 (\u03945\u20139) and several other mutants to assay p600 binding and transformation.Open in a separate windowFig. 4.Sequence alignment of papillomavirus E7 proteins. The E7 proteins from ungulate papillomavirus, including BPV-1, deer papillomavirus-1 (DPV-1), and elk papillomavirus-1 (EPV-1), were aligned by using the CLUSTALW algorithm. These three viruses share the ability to transform rodent cells. BPV-1 E7 mutants generated include deletion of amino acids 5\u20139 (E7-C \u03945\u20139, boxed), proline-to-alaninie substitution at reside 5(E7-C P5A), and deletion of amino acids 90\u201394 (E7-C \u039490\u201394, boxed). The HPV16 E7 protein is also shown.BPV-1 E7 mutants with a C-terminal FLAG/HA tag were expressed in C127 cells, and co-immunoprecipitations were performed to assess binding to p600. Deletion of amino acids 5\u20139 (E7-C \u03945\u20139) abolished the ability of E7 to interact with p600 (Fig. 5). Two other E7 mutants, a 5-aa deletion of amino acids 90\u201394 (E7-C \u039490\u201394) and a proline-to-alanine substitution at amino acid residue 5 (E7-C P5A), retained their ability to bind p600. These E7 mutants were then tested for their ability to enhance E6-mediated anchorage-independence. Both E7-C \u039490\u201394 and E7-C P5A, which could bind p600, were transformation competent, whereas E7-C \u03945\u20139, which did not interact with p600, did not stimulate anchorage-independent growth (Table 2). These data further support the hypothesis that the interaction of BPV-1 E7 with p600 is important for E7 transformation activity.Open in a separate windowFig. 5.The N terminal region of BPV-1 E7 mediates p600 binding. C127 cells were generated that stably express BPV-1 E6 and E7-C or mutants of E7-C: E7-C \u03945\u20139, E7-C P5A, and E7-C \u039490\u201394. Cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG antibody. Proteins resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel, and probed by immunoblotting with anti-p600 antibody (Upper) or anti-HA antibody (Lower).

Results are shown from three separate experiments.Knockdown of p600 Protein Levels Reduces Transformation of BPV-1 E6- and E6/E7-Expressing Cells. To gain insight into the role of p600 in papillomavirus-induced transformation, RNAi was used to reduce p600 protein levels, and cells assayed for anchorage-independence in the absence or presence of E7. If the role of BPV-1 E7 in transformation were the abrogation of p600 function, then one would expect p600 knockdown to mimic E7 expression. On the other hand, if E7 functioned by stimulating p600 function or if its function were somehow mediated through p600, then one would expect the p600 knockdown to negatively affect the ability of E7 to enhance transformation.We used a functional p600 RNAi that has already been shown to effectively reduce p600 protein levels (Y.N., unpublished results). We confirmed that p600 protein levels were reduced compared to the levels detected in cells expressing the control RNAi (Fig. 6). Cells were then tested for anchorage-independent growth. In cells expressing either BPV-1 E6 alone or E6 and E7 together, knock-down of p600 levels reduced the number of soft agar colonies \u22485- to 10-fold compared to cells expressing a control RNAi (Table 3). These data indicate that E7 does not function by abrogating the function of p600, but rather suggests that p600 is important for BPV-1 cellular transformation phenotype in either the presence or absence of BPV-1 E7. As such, p600 functions more as a necessary component of an oncogenic pathway rather than the product of a tumor suppressor gene.Open in a separate windowFig. 6.Knockdown of p600 reduces transformation. C127 cells stably expressing BPV-1 E7 and/or E6 proteins were transfected with the siRNAi expression vector pSilencer-hygro, containing either an RNAi targeting the p600 gene or a control RNAi. Transduced cells were selected by using antibiotic resistance. Total protein extracts were prepared from cells, proteins resolved on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel, and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-p600 antibody (Upper) or anti-actin antibody (Lower).

Cells were plated in duplicate, and the number of anchorage-independent colonies were counted after 14 days and averaged. Results are shown from three separate experiments. DiscussionWe have identified p600 as a binding partner of the BPV-1 E7 oncoprotein. The interaction between p600 and E7 correlates with the ability of E7 to enhance E6-mediated transformation. Specifically, BPV-1 E7 mutants or tagged proteins that are unable to complex with p600 (E7-C \u03945\u20139 and E7-N) were deficient in their transformation activities, whereas BPV-1 E7 proteins capable of associating with p600 (E7-C, E7-C \u039490\u201394, and E7-C P5A) were able to stimulate E6-dependent anchorage independence. The significance of the p600/E7 association in papillomavirus-induced transformation is further underscored by the observation by Huh et al. (29) that HPV16 E7 also interacts with p600, and that its interaction with p600 is mediated by the conserved CR1 domain that is conserved among all papillomaviruses. This region in HPV16 E7 has been implicated in its transformation capability (27, 28), but no cellular targets that bind to this region had yet been identified. Together, these studies strongly implicate a role for p600 in the life cycle of the papillomaviruses and suggest that the full transformation functions of the papillomavirus E7 proteins depends on an interaction with p600. That said, it should be noted that binding p600, per se, does not appear to be sufficient to mediate transformation because the E7 proteins of the \u201clow risk\u201d HPVs, for which no transforming activity has been described, also bind p600 (29).Functional data alluding to the role of p600 in mammalian cells comes from RNAi knockdown experiments, which result in an up-regulation of proapoptotic factors and an increase in apoptosis in the absence of serum or under conditions of anchorage-independent growth (Y.N., unpublished results). This detachment-induced apoptosis, known as anoikis, is an essential and conserved mechanism found in multicellular organisms that functions to prevent the abnormal detachment of cells in the host (30, 31). Anoikis signaling mechanisms are varied, and can initiate from cell attachment proteins such as integrins, transmitted along the actin/microtubule cytoskeleton, and lead to the release of proapoptotic factors such as Bmf. Because p600 has been hypothesized to play a role in apoptotic signaling due to loss of cell attachment, BPV-1 E7 through p600 may protect cells from apoptosis, thus leading to an increase in cell viably under conditions of anchorage-independent growth. This model is supported by the observation that BPV-1 E7 does not itself induce anchorage independence, but that it boosts transformation activity of other BPV-1 oncoproteins. In conjunction with that fact, the BPV-1 E6 oncoprotein induces disruption of actin filaments and interacts with cytoskeleton signal transduction pathways by binding to paxillin (12\u201314). BPV-1 E7 then might function by suppressing the apoptotic signals stimulated by E6-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement and/or proliferation signals during BPV-mediated transformation. It is of interest to note that, although p600 has been observed by immunofluorescence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of mammalian cells, E7-C was observed by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence to be expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm (data not shown), suggesting that E7 may act through the cytoplasmic subpopulation of p600.Homologs of p600 have been characterized in other multicellular organisms. Mutations in the Drosophila homolog of p600, Calossin/CalO/pushover, show a defect in male fertility, chromosome segregation, and synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (32, 33). Both p600 and CalO bind calmodulin, possibly playing a role in calcium influx in cells (34). Mutations in the Arabidopsis homolog of p600, BIG, suggests that it plays a role in polar auxin transport (35). All p600 family members also contain a putative zinc finger similar to the N-recognin domain, a recognition component of the N-end rule pathway involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of proteins through interaction with their N terminus. Because of the colossal size of p600 and its homologs (all containing >5,000 amino acids), p600 likely plays multiple roles within the cell and may indeed serve as a molecular scaffold. Further studies on p600 and its homologs will most likely reveal a conserved and essential role in both plants and animals.In sum, these studies define an interaction between the BPV-1 E7 oncoprotein and a cellular target, in this case p600. We have shown that the transformation activity of E7 correlates with its ability to bind p600. The mechanism by which E7 contributes to cellular transformation continues to be enigmatic, because p600 has only recently been recognized and its full array of functions are still being determined. Historically, DNA tumor virus oncoproteins have served as valuable tools for identifying cellular proteins and pathways that play critical roles in proliferation, signal transduction, apoptosis, and other cellular processes relevant to transformation. It seems likely that the papillomavirus E7 proteins might similarly prove invaluable to studies on p600 and dissecting its function in regulating cellular anoikis and transformation.
