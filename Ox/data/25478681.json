Objectives:                       To evaluate the association of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality with initial tidal volume and with tidal volume change over time.                  Methods:                       Multivariable, time-varying Cox regression analysis of a multisite, prospective study of 482 patients with ARDS with 11,558 twice-daily tidal volume assessments (evaluated in milliliter per kilogram of predicted body weight [PBW]) and daily assessment of other mortality predictors.                  Measurements and main results:                       An increase of 1 ml/kg PBW in initial tidal volume was associated with a 23% increase in ICU mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.44; P = 0.008). Moreover, a 1 ml/kg PBW increase in subsequent tidal volumes compared with the initial tidal volume was associated with a 15% increase in mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29; P = 0.019). Compared with a prototypical patient receiving 8 days with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg PBW, the absolute increase in ICU mortality (95% CI) of receiving 10 and 8 ml/kg PBW, respectively, across all 8 days was 7.2% (3.0-13.0%) and 2.7% (1.2-4.6%).

Timely recognition of ARDS and prompt adherence to low tidal volume\nventilation thereafter may be important for maximally reducing intensive\ncare unit mortality in patients with ARDS.Randomized trials and metaanalyses have shown that use of low\ntidal volumes reduces mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS) (1\u20134). However, as part of routine clinical care, patients may not\nconsistently receive this evidence-based therapy in part because of barriers in the\ntimely recognition of ARDS and in initiating and sustaining low tidal volume ventilator\nsettings thereafter (5\u201311). The potential harm of delayed initiation of\nlow tidal volume ventilation is not fully understood. Preclinical studies and randomized\ntrials support that higher tidal volumes, for periods as short as minutes to hours, may\nbe harmful (12\u201317). Despite this evidence, one prior study, using data from ARDS\nNetwork clinical trials, could not detect an association between hospital mortality and\ntidal volumes received in the initial 36- to 48-hour period after ARDS onset and before\nstudy enrollment (18). This prior\nstudy\u2019s finding may have been influenced by evaluating a select patient\npopulation who (1) were eligible and consenting for a clinical trial,\n(2) survived for 36\u201348 hours after ARDS onset before trial\nenrollment, and (3) were strictly managed with a low tidal volume\nventilation protocol after enrollment. Hence, using a multisite prospective cohort study\nof patients with ARDS receiving routine medical care, our objective was to evaluate the\nassociation of initial tidal volume and change in tidal volume over time, with mortality\nin the intensive care unit (ICU). MethodsOn a daily basis, we prospectively screened patients for\neligibility in this study, including detailed review of data in medical records and\nreview of chest radiograph to enroll 520 patients with ARDS from 13 medical,\nsurgical, and trauma ICUs at four teaching hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland. The\nARDS inclusion criteria for enrollment were mechanical ventilation,\nPaO2/Fio2\nratio less than 300, and meeting the American-European Consensus Conference criteria\n(1) that were in effect at the time of\nscreening for this study (2004\u20132007). ARDS onset was defined as the time at\nwhich a patient met all inclusion criteria. Consistent with the more recent Berlin\nconsensus meeting (19), we use the term\nARDS, rather than acute lung injury, throughout this report. Neurologic specialty\nICUs and patients with ARDS with primary neurologic disease or head trauma were not\neligible for this study. Because the study was designed to evaluate the association\nof critical illness and ICU care, in particular lung protective mechanical\nventilation, on patient\u2019s long-term mortality and functional outcomes (5, 20), the study had the following relevant exclusion criteria (Figure 1) at the onset of ARDS:\n(1) prior lung resection, (2) transfer from\nanother hospital with preexisting ARDS of greater than 24 hours duration,\n(3) mechanically ventilated for more than 5 days before ARDS\nonset, (4) a physician order limiting the use of life-support\ntherapies or preexisting comorbid illness with a life expectancy less than 6 months\n(e.g., metastatic cancer), (5) preexisting cognitive impairment or\ncommunication/language barriers, and (6) no fixed address.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Flow of patients through study. ARDS = acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome.Institutional review board approval was obtained from all participating sites with a\nwaiver of informed consent granted for abstraction of preexisting data from the\nmedical record. Written informed consent was obtained from survivors after they\nregained decision-making capacity (or from a proxy if a patient remained incapable\nof decision-making).Assessment of Primary Outcome: ICU SurvivalAt the study site hospitals, patients receiving\nmechanical ventilation were rarely transferred elsewhere within the hospital\n(e.g., a stepdown unit) or to another healthcare facility (e.g., a long-term\nacute care hospital). Hence, because of its temporal proximity to the primary\nexposure in this analysis, the primary outcome, selected a\npriori, was time to death in the ICU (in days) during\npatients\u2019 ICU admission for ARDS.Assessment of Primary Exposure: Tidal VolumeThe primary exposure was tidal volume received while\nmechanically ventilated, modeled as milliliter per kilogram of predicted body\nweight (PBW; calculated based on patient sex and height [2]). This time-varying exposure was recorded at 12-hour\nincrements over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation and partitioned\ninto two parts: the first available tidal volume after ARDS onset, and the\ntime-varying change in current tidal volume relative to this initial tidal\nvolume.Baseline and Time-Varying CovariatesOur analysis adjusted for 29 baseline and time-varying\ncovariates previously identified as potential confounders (5) and obtained from patients\u2019 medical records.\nBaseline variables included age, sex, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity\nindex (21), severity of illness within\n24 hours of ICU admission (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II\nscore [22]), ARDS risk factor (sepsis\nvs. other), ICU type (medical vs. surgical), patient location before ICU\nadmission (e.g., emergency department), year of study enrolment, and study site\nidentifier. Time-varying covariates were obtained either daily or twice-daily.\nDaily covariates included organ dysfunction (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment\nscore [23]), sedation and delirium\nstatus (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale [24] and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU [25], respectively), dose of systemic\ncorticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, and net fluid balance (total\nfluid input minus total fluid output). Twice-daily covariates represented\nmechanical ventilation parameters, including positive end-expiratory pressure,\nPaO2,\nFio2, arterial pH, actual respiratory\nrate, use of high-frequency oscillatory and airway pressure release ventilation\nmodes, and static compliance of the respiratory system (3).Statistical AnalysisDescriptive statistics summarized the baseline and\ntime-varying covariates for all subjects, with comparison between patient groups\nconducted using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. As\nper the original clinical trial (1), a\ntidal volume of less than or equal to 6.5 ml/kg PBW was used to define adherence\nto the low tidal volume goal of 6.0 ml/kg PBW. Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank\ntests were used for unadjusted analyses of patient survival. A multivariable Cox\nregression model was used to evaluate death as a function of the time-varying\ntidal volume (primary exposure), after accounting for the duration of mechanical\nventilation and the other 28 baseline and time-varying covariates as previously\ndescribed, with the time-varying covariates modeled as cumulative averages. A\npotential time-varying effect of tidal volume on ICU mortality over the duration\nof a patient\u2019s ICU stay was evaluated by including statistical\ninteraction of the primary exposure (as previously described) with time\n(measured in 12-h intervals). Statistical interaction between the two parts of\nthe primary exposure (i.e., initial tidal volume and change in current tidal\nvolume relative to initial tidal volume) was also evaluated. As a sensitivity\nanalysis, a Fine and Gray proportional subhazards regression model was fit,\ntreating ICU discharge as a competing risk. This sensitivity analysis was\nconducted to confirm appropriateness of the Cox regression analysis assumption\nof noninformative censoring of ICU discharge in evaluating the outcome of ICU\nmortality.We used standard statistical diagnostic procedures to evaluate the model. To\nassess the linearity assumption for continuous covariates, we plotted Martingale\nresiduals against covariate values using a nonparametric LOESS-smoother. For\neach covariate, we also assessed the proportional hazards assumption via\ngraphical displays of scaled Schoenfeld residuals and via performing individual\ntests of proportional hazards. We assessed the influence of individual\nobservations by comparing the relative change in the estimated regression\ncoefficients by deleting each observation, in turn, from the model, with no\nobservation demonstrating high influence.To illustrate the effects of the exposure-outcome relationship, the previously\ndescribed Cox regression model was used to estimate the absolute difference in\nthe cumulative risk of mortality at 8 days after ARDS onset, for a prototypical\npatient having median values for all continuous covariates and mode values for\nall binary covariates, with various profiles of tidal volume settings assumed\nduring the ICU stay.There were no missing data for patient-level characteristics. For the ventilator\nsetting data (i.e., positive end-expiratory pressure,\nPaO2/Fio2, and\nrespiratory rate), there were less than 0.2% missing for the cumulative averages\nused in the regression model. To impute the 10% missing data for plateau\npressure (used to calculate static compliance of the respiratory system [26]), we used multiple imputation (with\nfive imputed datasets), as previously described (5). As an a priori sensitivity analysis\nfor this imputation, we repeated all analyses using a subset of the entire\ndataset that excluded ventilator settings with missing plateau pressure\n(analysis of \u201ccomplete data\u201d). Statistical significance was\ndefined as a two-sided P less than 0.05. All statistical\nanalyses were completed using R statistical software (version 3.0.3) (Foundation\nfor Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, College\nStation, TX). ResultsOverall, prospective screening identified 754 patients\nmeeting inclusion criteria, of whom 234 met exclusion criteria (Figure 1). Consequently, 520 patients were enrolled in the\nstudy, of whom 38 were excluded from the analysis, 35 (7%) had no eligible\nventilator settings for this analysis (e.g., exclusive use of high-frequency\noscillation or airway pressure release ventilation), and 3 (<1%) had missing\ndata on height (required for calculating PBW for the primary exposure). Thus, 482\npatients, with 11,558 total ventilator settings, were available for analysis. For\nthe sensitivity analysis of complete data (see Methods), 482 patients with\n10,397 ventilator settings were available.Tables 1 and \u200band22 present patient characteristics and mechanical ventilation\ndata by initial tidal volume of less than or equal to 6.5 versus greater than 6.5\nml/kg PBW (n\u2009=\u2009154 [32%] vs. 328 [68%]) and by ICU mortality\nstatus. During their ICU stay, 169 (35%) of the 482 patients died. The entire 482\npatient cohort had a median (interquartile range) age of 53 (42\u201363) years and\nAcute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 27 (20\u201333), with\n56% male, 74% with sepsis as the primary ARDS risk factor, and 85% in a medical ICU\n(Table 1). Across all 11,558\ntwice-daily mechanical ventilator settings observed throughout the ICU stay for the\n482 patients, the median (interquartile range) positive end-expiratory pressure was\n5 (5\u201310) and tidal volume was 6.6 (5.9\u20138.0) ml/kg PBW (Table 2). More specifically, 328 (68%) of the\n482 patient cohort had an initial tidal volume greater than 6.5 ml/kg PBW, with 183\n(56%) of these 328 patients ever having a tidal volume of less than or equal to 6.5\nml/kg PBW thereafter and 23 (7%) of them having all subsequent tidal volumes less\nthan or equal to 6.5 ml/kg.

The numbers of patients with their first tidal\nvolume after ARDS onset of \u22646.5 and >6.5 ml/kg PBW,\nrespectively, were 154 and 328. The data represented by the\ndots and connecting line represent the\nproportion of patients with tidal volume \u22646.5 ml/kg PBW, calculated\nbased on the number of patients at that point in time that were alive and\nreceiving mechanical ventilation with a measurable tidal volume. In patients\nwith their first tidal volume >6.5 ml/kg, 17% had no change in tidal\nvolume or an increase in tidal volume over all subsequent mechanical\nventilator settings, whereas 39% had a decrease in the next ventilator\nsetting with 78% ever having a decrease in tidal volume over all subsequent\nmechanical ventilator settings. ARDS = acute respiratory distress\nsyndrome; PBW = predicted body weight.Unadjusted survival analysis of patients with their first tidal volume after ARDS\nonset of greater than 6.5 ml/kg PBW demonstrated that a subsequent decrease (vs.\nincrease) in tidal volume was associated with significantly improved survival\n(P\u2009=\u20090.008) that was not observed for\npatients with a first tidal volume of less than or equal to 6.5 ml/kg PBW\n(P\u2009=\u20090.446) (Figure 3). After adjusting for all covariates, an increase of 1 ml/kg\nPBW in initial tidal volume was associated with a 23% increase in the risk of ICU\nmortality (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.06\u20131.44;\nP\u2009=\u20090.008). Moreover, during the time after\nthe initial tidal volume setting, a 1 ml/kg PBW increase in tidal volume from the\ninitial setting was associated with a 15% increase in risk of ICU mortality (hazard\nratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.02\u20131.29;\nP\u2009=\u20090.019) (see Table E1 in the\nonline supplement for full model results). There were no significant statistical\ninteractions of the initial tidal volume with the change in current tidal volume\nrelative to initial tidal volume (see Table E2), or of these two\nprimary exposures variables with time (see Table E3). Sensitivity\nanalyses evaluating ICU discharge as a competing risk (see Table\nE4) and evaluating missing data imputation, as previously described\n(see Table E1), demonstrated results consistent with the\nprimary analysis.Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Kaplan-Meier survival curves for increase versus decrease in tidal volume\nfrom initial ventilator setting after ARDS onset. The numbers of patients\nwith their first tidal volume after ARDS onset \u22646.5 and >6.5\nml/kg PBW, respectively, were 154 and 328. For patients with first tidal\nvolume >6.5 ml/kg PBW, a subsequent decrease (vs. increase) in tidal\nvolume was associated with significant improvement in survival as\nillustrated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test\n(P\u2009=\u20090.008). For patients with first\ntidal volume \u22646.5 ml/kg PBW, a subsequent decrease (vs. increase) in\ntidal volume was not associated with a significant difference in survival\n(P\u2009=\u20090.446). ARDS = acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome; PBW = predicted body weight.The absolute risk difference in ICU mortality comparing various example profiles of\ninitial and subsequent tidal volume settings for a prototypical patient are\nsummarized in Table 3. Compared with a\nreference case of the prototypical patient receiving 8 days of mechanical\nventilation with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg PBW, there was an estimated absolute\nincrease in mortality (95% confidence interval) of 7.2% (3.0\u201313.0%) and 2.7%\n(1.2\u20134.6%) for receiving 10 and 8 ml/kg PBW tidal volume across all 8 days.\nIn tidal volume profiles with 4 days of 6 ml/kg PBW and 4 days of 10 ml/kg PBW, the\nestimated absolute increase in mortality was substantially greater when the 10 ml/kg\nPBW tidal volume was received in the first 4 days versus in the last 4 days of the\n8-day mechanical ventilation period at 4.8% (1.9\u20138.5%) versus 2.0%\n(0.6\u20133.9%) (Table 3).Table 3.Estimated Absolute Increase in Risk of ICU Mortality for Prototypical Patient\nRequiring 8 Days of Mechanical Ventilation*Case ScenarioEstimated Absolute\nIncrease in ICU Mortality (95% CI)Reference case with 6 ml/kg PBW tidal\nvolume throughout mechanical ventilation\u2003Case 0: 8 d of\ntidal volume = 6 ml/kg PBW*ReferenceCases with 10 ml/kg PBW tidal volume\nduring mechanical ventilation\u2003Case 1: 8 d of\ntidal volume = 10 ml/kg PBW*7.2%\n(3.0\u201313.0%)\u2003Case 2: 4 d of 10\nml/kg PBW, then 4 d of 6 ml/kg PBW4.8%\n(1.9\u20138.5%)\u2003Case 3: 2 d of 10\nml/kg PBW, then 6 d of 6 ml/kg PBW3.1%\n(0.8\u20136.0%)\u2003Case 4: 4 d of 6\nml/kg PBW, then 4 d of 10 ml/kg PBW2.0%\n(0.6\u20133.9%)Cases with 8 ml/kg PBW tidal volume\nduring mechanical ventilation\u2003Case 5: 8 d of\ntidal volume = 8 ml/kg PBW*2.7%\n(1.2\u20134.6%)\u2003Case 6: 4 d of 8\nml/kg PBW, then 4 d of 6 ml/kg PBW1.8%\n(0.7\u20133.1%)\u2003Case 7: 2 d of 8\nml/kg PBW, then 6 d of 6 ml/kg PBW1.2%\n(0.3\u20132.3%)\u2003Case 8: 4 d of 6\nml/kg PBW, then 4 d of 8 ml/kg PBW0.8%\n(0.3\u20131.5%)Open in a separate windowDefinition of abbreviations: CI = confidence\ninterval; ICU = intensive care unit; PBW = predicted body\nweight.*To illustrate the effects of the tidal volume (in milliliters per\nkilogram PBW) over time on ICU mortality, the time-varying multivariable\nCox regression model (as described in the Methods) was used to\nestimate the absolute difference in the cumulative risk of mortality at\n8 d after the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome, for a\nprototypical patient who had median values for all continuous covariates\nand mode values for all binary covariates, across various profiles of\ntidal volume settings during the ICU stay. Of patients with at least 8 d\nof mechanical ventilation within the study, 17%, 16%, and 2%,\nrespectively, had tidal volumes of \u22646.5, \u22657.5, and\n\u22659.5 ml/kg PBW for the first 8 d. DiscussionIn this multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with\nARDS, higher tidal volumes shortly after ARDS onset were associated with an even\ngreater risk of ICU mortality, compared with subsequent tidal volumes. Specifically,\nafter adjusting for other covariates potentially associated with ICU mortality, a 1\nml/kg PBW increase in initial tidal volume or in a subsequent tidal volume setting\nwas associated with a 23% and 15%, respectively, increase in the risk of ICU\nmortality. Thus, within the setting of routine clinical practice, timely adherence\nto the use of low tidal volumes for patients with ARDS is associated with improved\nsurvival.In other aspects of care for critically ill patients, such as receipt of antibiotics\nin septic shock, timely and appropriate initial therapy reduces hospital mortality\n(27, 28). With respect to ARDS, randomized trials and metaanalyses have shown\nthat use of low tidal volumes reduces mortality (1\u20134). Moreover, in a\nrandomized trial of abdominal surgery patients mechanically ventilated in the\noperating room for an average of 5.5 hours, reduced tidal volumes (along with\npositive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers) significantly decreased\nmajor postoperative complications (including acute respiratory failure requiring\nmechanical ventilation) and hospital length of stay (29). Similarly, our analysis demonstrated that earlier use of\nlow tidal volumes was associated with improved ICU survival. Such findings may be\nexplained by higher tidal volumes, even when used for only minutes to hours,\noverstretching alveoli, releasing inflammatory mediators systematically, and\nresulting in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction (12\u201317).A single prior study, using data from ARDS Network clinical trials, did not find an\nassociation of hospital mortality with higher tidal volumes in the 36 to 48 hours\npreceding strict protocolized implementation of low tidal volume ventilation (18). Differences in study design may explain\nthe discrepancy between our findings and the prior study. For instance, by\nevaluating patients enrolled in the ARDS Network trials, any patients dying after\nARDS onset, before enrollment, were excluded. Also, in the ARDS Network trials, all\npatients after enrollment were strictly managed with a low tidal volume protocol;\nhowever, in the usual care setting of our study, among those who did not have an\ninitial tidal volume less than or equal to 6.5 ml/kg PBW, 44% never received tidal\nvolumes less than or equal to 6.5 ml/kg PBW thereafter and only 7% always received\ntidal volumes less than or equal to 6.5 ml/kg PBW thereafter. Finally, there were\ndifferences in patient populations, with more stringent enrollment criteria\nexcluding sicker patients in the ARDS Network trials versus our prospective cohort\nstudy.The findings of this research draw attention to the need for early use of low tidal\nvolume ventilation. In our study, approximately two-thirds of patients with ARDS had\ntheir initial tidal volume above 6.5 ml/kg PBW. To facilitate early use of low tidal\nvolumes, timely recognition of ARDS is required along with communication of patient\ntidal volumes in terms of milliliter per kilogram PBW (7, 30). Moreover,\ngiven a high frequency of obesity, the calculation of tidal volume in milliliter per\nkilogram should be based on PBW, calculated using accurate height measurements\nrather an actual body weight. For mechanically ventilated patients, daily\nreevaluation for the onset of ARDS and the appropriateness of tidal volumes is\nimportant. Given the mortality benefit of low tidal volume ventilation and\nchallenges in timely recognition of ARDS, there may be benefit for all mechanically\nventilated patients of ICU-wide protocols that default to 6 ml/kg PBW, with a\nspecific physician order required for use of higher tidal volumes (6, 12, 31, 32). Such an approach may play a role in preventing the\ndevelopment of ARDS in mechanically ventilated patients in addition to reducing\nmortality in those with ARDS (12).\nMoreover, having better integration between electronic medical records and\nmechanical ventilators may allow for improved setting of tidal volumes or creating\nalerts to notify clinicians of potentially harmful ventilator settings (33).This study has potential limitations. First, this study was observational in design;\nhence, we cannot prove causation between the magnitude and timing of tidal volumes\nand ICU survival because there are both measured and unmeasured differences in\npatient groups with higher versus lower tidal volumes. However, a randomized trial\nevaluating delayed delivery of low tidal volume ventilation to patients with ARDS\nwould not be ethical to conduct. Moreover, causality is plausible given the\ndose-response effect observed in this study, along with the consistency of our\nfindings with both preclinical studies and randomized trials (12\u201317).\nSecond, missing data on plateau pressure (used to calculate static compliance of the\nrespiratory system [26]) have potential to\nbias study results; however, the primary analysis with multiple imputation of\nmissing data and a secondary analysis of complete data showed similar results, which\nis reassuring. Third, only teaching hospitals from a single city were included in\nthis research and there were exclusion criteria for patient enrollment which may\nlimit the generalizability of these findings. However, four hospitals with 13 ICUs\nwere included in the study, with substantial variability in routine medical care\ndelivered, and the eligibility criteria were relatively limited compared with prior\nrandomization controlled trials of low tidal volume ventilation, which aid in\ngeneralizability of our findings. Fourth, the data for this study are from\n2004\u20132007. Since this study period, clinical practices with respect to\nadherence to low tidal volume ventilation and other aspects of ICU care may have\nchanged and potentially modified these findings. However, the consistency of these\nresults to both older and more recent preclinical and clinical data (12\u201317, 29) may support their\ncontinued importance to clinical care for patients with ARDS. Fifth, this study only\ncollected ventilation data twice per day and did not capture instances in which\nthere were more frequent adjustments to tidal volume settings, which may have\nunderstated our characterization of adherence to low tidal volume ventilation.\nLastly, although a priori research has demonstrated the long-term\nsurvival benefit of lung protective ventilation (5), our current analysis evaluating the timing of low tidal volume\nventilation only focused on ICU mortality. Hence, future research should evaluate\nlong-term effects.In conclusion, in this multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with ARDS,\nhigher tidal volumes shortly after ARDS onset were associated with an even greater\nrisk of ICU mortality compared with subsequent tidal volumes. Hence, timely\nrecognition of ARDS and timely adherence to low tidal volume ventilation are\nimportant considerations for maximally improving survival for patients with\nARDS.
