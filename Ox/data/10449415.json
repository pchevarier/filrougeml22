{"title": "The crystal structure of the complex of replication protein A subunits RPA32 and RPA14 reveals a mechanism for single-stranded DNA binding", "pubDate": "1999", "PMCID": "PMC1171524", "DOI": "10.1093/emboj/18.16.4498", "PMID": "10449415", "abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryote single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), is a heterotrimer. The largest subunit, RPA70, which harbours the major DNA-binding activity, has two DNA-binding domains that each adopt an OB-fold. The complex of the two smaller subunits, RPA32 and RPA14, has weak DNA-binding activity but the mechanism of DNA binding is unknown. We have determined the crystal structure of the proteolytic core of RPA32 and RPA14, which consists of the central two-thirds of RPA32 and the entire RPA14 subunit. The structure revealed that RPA14 and the central part of RPA32 are structural homologues. Each subunit contains a central OB-fold domain, which also resembles the DNA-binding domains in RPA70; an N-terminal extension that interacts with the central OB-fold domain; and a C-terminal helix that mediate heterodimerization via a helix-helix interaction. The OB-fold of RPA32, but not RPA14, possesses additional similarity to the RPA70 DNA-binding domains, supporting a DNA-binding role for RPA32. The discovery of a third and fourth OB-fold in RPA suggests that the quaternary structure of SSBs, which in Bacteria and Archaea are also tetramers of OB-folds, is conserved in evolution. The structure also suggests a mechanism for RPA trimer formation.", "author": [{"author": "A Bochkarev", "affiliation": ["Department of Medical Genetics and Microbiology, University of Toronto, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8."], "href": "/?term=Bochkarev+A&cauthor_id=10449415"}, {"author": "E Bochkareva", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Bochkareva+E&cauthor_id=10449415"}, {"author": "L Frappier", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Frappier+L&cauthor_id=10449415"}, {"author": "A M Edwards", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Edwards+AM&cauthor_id=10449415"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["10449415", "34681076", "34420242", "34047822", "33916151", "33847949", "31289179", "30108742", "28074284", "27984589", "27690379", "27575340", "27131385", "27068393", "26520106", "26004442", "25542993", "25474071", "25400143", "25171654", "24764655", "24560558", "23605041", "23266556", "22976179", "22652765", "22244753", "22171270", "22167675", "22106294", "21950380", "21846830", "21772997", "20826342", "20515732", "20515430", "20436294", "20184389", "20157006", "20130019", "20008938", "19942684", "19884503", "19748362", "19605351", "19515845", "19244309", "19119139", "19047459", "19010961", "18515800", "18469000", "17673209", "17583916", "17182628", "17002295", "16533169", "16043636", "16006651", "15938632", "15096638", "15047856", "15007178", "14747526", "14520573", "12598368", "12509449", "12399495", "11927569", "11557822", "11481454", "11479296", "11160923", "11157767", "11139606", "11058099", "10773070", "10698952"], "body": " AbstractReplication protein A (RPA), the eukaryote single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), is a heterotrimer.
