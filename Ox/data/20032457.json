Ubiquitin-ubiquitin isopeptide linkages to each of the seven ubiquitin lysine residues (1) and, more recently, linear \u03b1-linked polyubiquitin (2) have been identified in vivo. Polyubiquitin species linked through Lys48 and Lys63 are the best understood. Lys48-linked polyubiquitin is thought to serve as the primary degradation signal of the cell (3), although Lys11 (4) and other (5) polyubiquitin linkages also can serve this function. Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains mediate nonproteolytic events that include some forms of the DNA damage response (6), NF-\u03baB signaling (7), ribosome function (8), and protein trafficking (9).Specifically linked polyubiquitin chains can determine distinct functional outputs; accordingly, cells possess factors that discriminate among the different types of polyubiquitin linkages. For example, hHR23A has a ubiquitin-associated domain that attains Lys48 linkage selectivity by binding to the region surrounding the Lys48\u2013Gly76 isopeptide bond (10). The RAP80 protein, which selectively binds to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and recruits the Brca1 protein to sites of DNA damage (11,\u201313), achieves its linkage selectivity via an alternative mechanism. In RAP80, the arrangement and spacing of two tandem ubiquitin-interacting motifs permit avid binding to the ubiquitin units in Lys63-linked but not Lys48-linked polyubiquitin (14).A large number of enzymes are also capable of selectively generating or cleaving specific types of polyubiquitin linkages. The Mms2/Ubc13 heterodimer, for instance, specifically generates Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains (15) necessary for the DNA damage response and NF-\u03baB signaling (16) pathways. Its selectivity derives from the positioning of two ubiquitin-binding sites that specifically align the Gly76 residue of one ubiquitin toward the Lys63 of another within the enzyme active site, such that isopeptide bond formation can occur (17). On the other hand, a DUB3 called Cyld specifically cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (18) and antagonizes signals propagated through the NF-\u03baB and Bcl-3 pathways (19,\u201321). The importance of Cyld-dependent deubiquitination is illustrated dramatically by patients with familial cylindromatosis who develop head and neck tumors due to inactivating mutations in this enzyme (22).We recently identified a four-subunit DUB complex called BRISC (Brcc36-containing isopeptidase complex, which also selectively cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (23). Unlike Cyld and other thiol protease-type DUBs, the catalytic subunit of BRISC, called Brcc36, is a member of a small family of DUBs called JAMM/MPN+ proteins, which are Zn2+-binding metalloproteases (24, 25). Brcc36 is also a component of a distinct complex that includes Brca1, Abraxas, and Rap80 and is recruited to sites of DNA damage following irradiation (11, 12).Here, we describe experiments performed to determine how BRISC achieves its remarkable selectivity for cleaving Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. Unexpectedly, we found that specificity of BRISC was not due to selective binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin; instead, selectivity must result from how the polyubiquitin chain is oriented at the Brcc36 active site. While these experiments were underway, the crystal structure of another Lys63-selective JAMM/MPN+ protein, Amsh-LP, was determined (26). Although the Amsh-LP JAMM/MPN+ domain contains two insertions that are absent from the Brcc36 JAMM/MPN+ domain, our results indicate that the Lys63 linkage preference of this family of DUBs derives from a similar mechanism whereby a high affinity interaction between the enzyme and the distal ubiquitin (i.e. the S1 ubiquitin) at the scissile bond of a di- or polyubiquitin substrate is required for cleavage. Moreover, we show that the BRISC complex is unable to release the proximal ubiquitin from a (poly)ubiquitin-protein conjugate and that Brcc36 and another subunit of the BRISC complex, Abro1, include a minimal DUB with Lys63-selective activity. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAssembly of Polyubiquitin Chains Polyubiquitin (polyUb) dimers and tetramers were made as described (27) using E2-25K or Ubc13/Mms2 to generate Lys48 or Lys63-linked chains, respectively.BRISC Purification from HeLa Cells BRISC was purified from HeLa S3 cells stably expressing Brcc36-FLAG-HA (23). Cells were generated according to published methods (28) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For the purification, 20 \u00d7 15-cm dishes of Brcc36-FLAG-HA cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 5 \u03bcg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 \u00d7 g to pellet insoluble material. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody-coupled beads (100 \u03bcl; Sigma) were equilibrated in the above buffer, added to the clarified lysate, and rotated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. The beads were washed with the above buffer, then with buffer lacking Triton X-100, and finally eluted three times with 100 \u03bcl of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to elute bound protein.Deubiquitination and Inhibition Assays PolyUb chains were radioiodinated using Na125I and chloramine T (29). All reactions contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, and stopped at the appropriate time (after 20 min, unless otherwise indicated) by the addition of Laemmli gel loading buffer. Assays typically contained 0.5 \u03bcm Lys63-linked or Lys48-linked diubiquitin. The BRISC concentration was determined by running known quantities of recombinant insect cell-expressed Brcc36 adjacent to several concentrations of the HeLa-derived BRISC on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Brcc36 antibody (Invitrogen). We then estimated the BRISC concentration by comparing the intensities of the signals from the blots. BRISC molecular mass was assumed to be 170 kDa, which is the sum of its four component polypeptides. The concentration of Lys63-Ub2 was varied in steady state kinetics experiments to determine Km and kcat values. In all reactions, less than 12% of the substrate was consumed. Following the reactions, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). The di- and mono-Ub bands were excised from the dried gel and counted on a gamma counter, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). In assays with L8C-containing mutant diubiquitin substrates, the substrates were pretreated for 10 min with 4 mm iodoacetic acid, which was then quenched with 5 mm DTT prior to the reactions.For the inhibition experiments, each reaction contained 1.5 \u03bcm radioiodinated Lys63-Ub2 and increasing amounts of unlabeled Lys63-Ub2 inhibitor (from 0.1 to 156 \u03bcm). Specifically, a \u201c2\u00d7\u201d mix was made for each inhibitor concentration, and then equal volumes of inhibitor and radiolabeled substrate were mixed to ensure that there were no dilution effects and that all reactions were volume-normalized. Reaction products were processed as above and the Ki values determined using Prism 5.Syntheses of 125I-Labeled E2-25K-(Lys48-linked)Ub4 and 125I-Labeled Ubc13-(Lys63-linked)Ub4 Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyUb tetramers were radioiodinated and conjugated to E2-25K or Ubc13, respectively, by autoubiquitination. First, 5 \u03bcm 125I-labeled Lys48-Ub4 was incubated with 15 \u03bcm E2-25K and 0.1 \u03bcm E1 for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT. To stop the reaction, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was added to a final concentration of 4 mm and incubated for 5 min. The NEM was then consumed by adding DTT to 5 mm. The proteins were exchanged into HDE buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and bound to Q-Sepharose, which was equilibrated with HDE buffer. E2-25K-(Lys48-linked)Ub4 conjugates bound to Q-Sepharose under these conditions, but free, unconjugated Lys48-Ub4 chains did not. The Q-Sepharose was then washed with HDE buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, and the E2-25K-(Lys48-linked)Ub4 conjugates were eluted with HDE buffer containing 300 mm NaCl.To generate 125I-Lys63-Ub4-Ubc13, 5 \u03bcm 125I-labeled Lys63-Ub4 was incubated with 15 \u03bcm Ubc13/Mms2-His6 heterodimer and 0.1 \u03bcm E1 for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm DTT. The reaction was stopped with 4 mm NEM, and then the NEM was quenched by the addition of 5 mm DTT. After this reaction, the bulk (\u223c95%) of the conjugated 125I- Lys63-Ub4 was in the form of 125I- Lys63-Ub4-Ubc13. To remove the small amount of 125I- Lys63-Ub4-Mms2-His6 conjugate that was formed, the mixture was diluted 10-fold into Ni2+-NTA binding buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin equilibrated in the same buffer. The unbound fraction, which specifically contained the 125I- Lys63-Ub4-Ubc13 conjugates, was collected, exchanged into HDE buffer, and separated from the unconjugated 125I- Lys63-Ub4 using Q-Sepharose, as described for 125I- Lys48-Ub4-E2-25K above.Expression of Recombinant BRISC We generated baculoviruses encoding the following: Brcc36-His6, HA-HSPC142, untagged Bre, and untagged Abro1. We did so by cloning the appropriate constructs into pFastBacDual (Invitrogen) and using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf21 insect cells were grown in suspension at 27 \u00b0C in Sf900 II SFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For protein production, we co-infected Sf21 cells (either 50 or 250 ml) with equivalent volumes of each baculovirus stock (from the third amplification cycle) and harvested cells after 3 days. The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 5 \u03bcg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 \u00d7 g to remove insoluble material. Soluble extracts were bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in the above buffer. The column was washed with the above buffer containing 60 mm imidazole and then eluted in the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 5 mm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. RESULTSKinetic Studies of BRISC Activity Previously, we identified a multisubunit deubiquitinating enzyme called BRISC from HeLa cell extracts that specifically cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (23). BRISC consists of four subunits, including Bre, Hspc142, Abro1, and Brcc36, which is a JAMM/MPN+ domain protein that provides the catalytic activity for the complex. We used an in vitro deubiquitination assay to measure the rate of BRISC-mediated polyubiquitin cleavage. The substrates in these reactions were Lys63- or Lys48-linked diubiquitin, which were assembled using the heterodimeric E2 enzyme Ubc13/Mms2 or E2-25K, respectively. Each substrate also contained an additional residue, Asp77, appended to the C terminus of the proximal ubiquitin unit as a part of the diubiquitin synthesis (27). As a source of BRISC, we performed an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation from HeLa cells stably expressing C-terminal FLAG and hemagglutinin-tagged Brcc36 (23) and recovered bound proteins via competitive elution with FLAG peptide. Consistent with our earlier study, the BRISC preparation cleaved Lys63-linked, but not Lys48-linked, diubiquitin in in vitro DUB assays using radiolabeled substrates (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1\u20136 with 7\u201312). Because Brcc36 is a JAMM/MPN+ isopeptidase that lacks the active site cysteine present in thiol protease DUBs (24, 25), BRISC was not significantly inhibited by ubiquitin aldehyde (Fig. 1A, lane 6) (30). The minor effect of ubiquitin aldehyde was likely due to competitive inhibition with the substrate (Fig. 1A, lane 6) (see below). Using this in vitro assay (in the absence of ubiquitin aldehyde), we determined the Km value for BRISC-mediated cleavage of Lys63-linked diubiquitin to be \u223c1.4 \u03bcm and the kcat to be \u223c135 min\u22121 (or \u223c2.2 s\u22121) (Fig. 1B).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1.Kinetics of BRISC-mediated diubiquitin disassembly. A, BRISC specifically cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. BRISC (5 nm) was incubated with radiolabeled Lys63-linked (lanes 1\u20136) or Lys48-linked (lanes 7\u201312) diubiquitin in the absence (lanes 1\u20135 and 7\u201311) or presence (lanes 6 and 12) of 1 \u03bcm ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal). Reactions proceeded for the indicated times and were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) and autoradiography. B, titration of Lys63-Ub2 (K63Ub2) with BRISC. Each assay contained 50 pm BRISC; the concentration of Lys63-Ub2 was varied as indicated. Note that in the diubiquitin synthesis Ub-Asp77 was incorporated as the proximal ubiquitin unit; see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d for additional details.BRISC Binds with Equal Affinity to Lys48- and Lys63-linked Polyubiquitin To determine whether the linkage specificity of BRISC was due to a preference for binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin over other linkage types, we performed in vitro deubiquitination assays in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled Lys63- or Lys48-linked diubiquitin. Surprisingly, both diubiquitin conjugates inhibited BRISC-mediated cleavage of the radiolabeled substrate with a Ki of \u223c7 \u03bcm (Fig. 2A), indicating that the cleavage specificity of BRISC is not due to preferential binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2.BRISC specificity is not due to preferential binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. A and B, BRISC binds equally to Lys63-linked and Lys48-linked diubiquitin. Competition experiments in which unlabeled Lys63-linked Ub2 (K63Ub2) (A) or Lys48-linked Ub2 (K48Ub2) (B) was titrated into cleavage reactions containing 50 pm BRISC and 1.5 \u03bcm 125I- Lys63-Ub2. C\u2013E, the bulk of the affinity of the BRISC-ubiquitin interaction is due to binding to the hydrophobic patch of a single ubiquitin. Experiments were performed as above except that unlabeled competitors were wild-type Ub-Gly76 (Ub G76) (C), Ub-Asp77 (Ub D77) (D), or Ub(I44A)-Asp77 (Ub I44A D77) (E).BRISC Binds to Mono- as Well as Polyubiquitin Next, we wanted to determine whether BRISC specifically bound to polyubiquitin or whether it could bind to monoubiquitin as well. Therefore, we titrated unlabeled monoubiquitin into the in vitro deubiquitination assay to see if it would inhibit BRISC activity. Monoubiquitin with a C-terminal Gly76 residue (i.e. lacking Asp77), which will be referred to as Ub-Gly76, inhibited BRISC-mediated deubiquitination with a Ki of \u223c1.1 \u03bcm (Fig. 2C), in close agreement with the observed diubiquitin Km value. Monoubiquitin containing the C-terminal Asp77 (Ub-Asp77), however, inhibited BRISC-mediated cleavage with a Ki of \u223c8.4 \u03bcm, indicating that the Asp77 extension reduced the affinity of ubiquitin for BRISC severalfold (Fig. 2D). Together, the inhibition data indicate that the cleavage specificity of BRISC is not due to a preference for binding to Lys63-linked chain and that BRISC has no preference for binding to di- versus monoubiquitin. In fact, the bulk of the affinity between enzyme and substrate could be accounted for by an interaction with a single ubiquitin. The orientation of the Lys63-linked isopeptide bond relative to the Brcc36 active site, and not selective binding to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin, must account for the cleavage specificity of BRISC.BRISC Recognizes the Ubiquitin Hydrophobic Patch Because monoubiquitin was sufficient to inhibit BRISC-mediated cleavage of Lys63-linked dimers, we tested whether the ubiquitin surface hydrophobic patch, which provides a binding site for most ubiquitin-interacting proteins (31), also serves as the BRISC interaction surface. To do this, we performed the Lys63-diubiquitin cleavage assay in the presence of Ub-Asp77 with an I44A mutation; this mutation within the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch is known to disrupt interactions between ubiquitin and most ubiquitin receptors (31, 32). Unlike wild-type ubiquitin, Ub(I44A)-Asp77 at concentrations as high as 300 mm did not detectably inhibit BRISC activity (Fig. 2E); this result indicates that the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch contributes the major BRISC interaction surface.BRISC-mediated Cleavage Requires Binding to the Distal Ubiquitin Hydrophobic Patch Next, we wanted to determine whether BRISC displayed a preference for binding to the hydrophobic patch of the proximal or distal subunit of the diubiquitin conjugate. This presented a technical challenge because Mms2/Ubc13, the heterodimeric E2 enzyme used to assemble our Lys63-linked diubiquitin substrates (15), is unable to conjugate the Ub(I44A) mutant to an acceptor ubiquitin (data not shown and see Ref. 33). To circumvent this problem, we mutated a different residue in the hydrophobic patch, Leu8 (31), to cysteine. We reasoned that if Mms2/Ub13 could assemble L8C-containing ubiquitin into Lys63-linked dimers, we could then alkylate this cysteine (the only one in the dimer) with iodoacetate, thereby introducing charge into the hydrophobic patch that should disrupt any interactions dependent on this surface. Mms2/Ubc13 efficiently utilized the L8C mutant ubiquitin in dimer synthesis, whether it was incorporated into the proximal or distal position (data not shown).When the L8C hydrophobic patch mutation was introduced into the proximal ubiquitin of the dimer, BRISC activity was unaffected (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1\u20134 with 5\u20138). However, when the mutation was introduced into the distal ubiquitin, BRISC activity was inhibited (Fig. 3A, lanes 9\u201312). Although iodoacetate was used in this experiment (to alkylate the Cys-8 residues in the two diubiquitin conjugates), the results were identical when it was omitted (data not shown), indicating that the distal ubiquitin L8C mutation was sufficient to prevent substrate cleavage. BRISC-mediated cleavage of Lys63-linked diubiquitin therefore requires an interaction between BRISC and the hydrophobic patch of the distal ubiquitin.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3.BRISC cleavage requires an interaction with the hydrophobic patch of the distal unit of a diubiquitin conjugate. A, the distal ubiquitin (Ub) hydrophobic patch is necessary for cleavage. BRISC (50 pm) was incubated with 125I-labeled wild-type Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63 Ub2) (lanes 1\u20134) or Lys63-linked diubiquitin with a proximal (lanes 6\u20138) or distal (lanes 9\u201312) L8C hydrophobic patch mutation. The diubiquitin substrates were treated with iodoacetate to alkylate the Cys8 residue prior to the reaction. Reaction mixtures were incubated for the indicated times, run on 15% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Shaded circles indicate the L8C-containing hydrophobic patch mutant unit. B and C, diubiquitin conjugates with proximal or distal hydrophobic patch mutations both bind to BRISC, but the Asp77 extension only affects binding when the distal ubiquitin is mutated. Competition experiments were performed as in Fig. 2, except that the unlabeled competitors were dimers with Ub(L8C) as the proximal (B) or distal (C) unit.BRISC Can Bind to the Proximal Ubiquitin but Cannot Cleave Lys63-Diubiquitin Bound in This Orientation Although BRISC could not cleave diubiquitin that contained an L8C mutation in the distal unit, it was possible that BRISC could still bind to it. To test this, we used the distal and the proximal L8C variants of Lys63-linked diubiquitin as inhibitors in in vitro deubiquitination assays. As with our other diubiquitin preparations, the L8C-containing dimers had the Asp77 C-terminal extension. The dimer with the L8C mutation in the proximal ubiquitin inhibited BRISC-mediated cleavage of radiolabeled Lys63-linked diubiquitin with a Ki of \u223c1.8 \u03bcm, very similar to the Km value in the BRISC cleavage reaction (Fig. 3B), whereas the dimer with the L8C mutation in the distal position inhibited with a Ki of \u223c10 \u03bcm (Fig. 3C).As with our experiments that compared Ub-Gly76 and Ub-Asp77 as inhibitors (Fig. 2, C and D), the difference in the Ki measurements between the proximal and distal L8C mutants was likely due to the effect of the Asp77 extension on the proximal units of the conjugates. When the distal hydrophobic patch is mutated, BRISC is \u201cforced\u201d to bind to the proximal hydrophobic patch, which must then align Asp77 toward the Brcc36 active site where it exerts its inhibitory effect on binding (Fig. 7; see \u201cDiscussion\u201d). From these experiments, we conclude that BRISC can bind to the hydrophobic patch of either subunit of a diubiquitin conjugate, although binding to the distal unit provides the only orientation that permits cleavage of the Lys63-linked isopeptide bond.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 7.Model showing how either ubiquitin unit in a dimer can bind to the high affinity binding site in BRISC. When the distal ubiquitin hydrophobic patch is mutated (L8C), BRISC can only bind to the hydrophobic patch of the proximal ubiquitin. In this configuration, the Asp77 extension on the C terminus of the proximal ubiquitin weakens binding. When the proximal ubiquitin hydrophobic patch is mutated, only the distal ubiquitin binds to the high affinity site in BRISC, leaving the Asp77 extension in a position that has no effect on binding.BRISC Cleaves Substrate-linked Polyubiquitin but Spares the Isopeptide Bond Directly Linking the Chain and Substrate Next, we wanted to determine whether BRISC could cleave the isopeptide bond directly linking a polyubiquitin chain to a lysine residue of a non-ubiquitin substrate. Here, we adapted the strategy used by Liu et al. (34) to generate polyubiquitinated substrates. We incubated Mms2/Ubc13 with E1, MgATP, and radiolabeled Lys63-linked tetramers or E2-25K (27) with E1, MgATP, and radiolabeled Lys48-linked tetramers under conditions in which the E2 enzymes would self-ubiquitinate. Because these enzymes only generate Lys63 and Lys48 linkages (27), respectively, and because each tetramer was blocked at the distal end by a K63R or K48R mutation (27), the enzymes could not link multiple tetramers to each other. Under the conditions we used, each enzyme was modified with only a single tetraubiquitin chain. Mms2/Ubc13 attached the Lys63-linked tetramer primarily to the Ubc13 subunit, which we then purified (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d).Consistent with its endoprotease activity (23), BRISC cleaved each Lys63 linkage within the chain, yielding mono, di-, and triubiquitin. Over time, the di- and triubiquitin conjugates were further processed to monoubiquitin (Fig. 4, left panel). BRISC, however, did not remove the proximal ubiquitin attached directly to the substrate (Fig. 4, left panel). This indicates that BRISC only cleaves Ub-Ub linkages and supports the idea that interactions with both a proximal and a distal Ub are necessary for cleavage. BRISC did not cleave any of the Lys48 linkages in the E2-25K-Lys48-Ub4 substrate (Fig. 4, right panel), indicating that BRISC retains its specificity even toward substrate-linked chains.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4.BRISC removes all but the proximal ubiquitin (Ub) from a polyubiquitinated substrate. The E2 enzymes Ubc13 (left panel) or E2-25K (right panel) were conjugated to radiolabeled Lys63-linked or Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin, respectively (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d for details). These polyubiquitinated proteins were then incubated with 5 nm BRISC for the indicated times, run on 13.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.Interaction with Abro1 Induces a Conformational Change in Brcc36 Next, we wanted to determine whether Brcc36 was active on its own or whether it required incorporation into the BRISC complex for activity. We generated baculoviruses to express each of the four BRISC subunits, and we included a C-terminal His6 tag on Brcc36 to facilitate isolation of the complex. By co-infecting insect cells with all four baculoviruses, we were able to purify a stoichiometric, four-subunit BRISC complex (Fig. 5A, left panel). Although prone to aggregation (supplemental Fig. S1A), the recombinant BRISC possessed potent DUB activity that cleaved Lys63-linked diubiquitin with an equivalent Km (\u223c2.5 \u03bcm) and a Vmax that was very similar (i.e. \u223c50%) to the values determined with the native complex immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1B).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5.Abro1 binds directly to Brcc36-His6 and promotes a conformation that exposes the C-terminal epitope tag. A, purified, recombinant BRISC complex. Insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses expressing all four BRISC subunits as follows: Brcc36-His6, Abro1, Bre, and HA-Hspc142. Insect cell lysates were incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin, and after washing, bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Note that on this percentage gel, the Brcc36-His6 and HA-HSPC142 subunits migrate identically. B, Brcc36 binds to Abro1. Insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing Brcc36 alone (lane 1) or Brcc36 in combination with either Bre (lane 2), Hspc142 (lane 3), or Abro1 (lane 4). Insect cell lysates were incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin, and after washing, bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.When expressed in insect cells without co-expression of any additional BRISC components, Brcc36-His6 did not bind to Ni2+-NTA resin (Fig. 5B, lane 1) unless it was first denatured with 8 m urea (data not shown). From this observation, we inferred that the C-terminal His6 tag was masked under native conditions. Attempts to purify Brcc36-His6 by conventional chromatography were hampered by the propensity of Brcc36-His6 to aggregate and elute in very broad peaks from ion exchange and size exclusion columns. We did not detect NEM-resistant, Lys63-directed DUB activity in the Brcc36-containing fractions collected from an ion exchange column. This could be because Brcc36 was misfolded or that it requires interaction with an additional BRISC subunit(s) for its activity.Although Brcc36-His6 expressed alone did not bind to Ni2+-NTA resin under native conditions, it did bind when incorporated into the four-subunit BRISC complex (Fig. 5A, left panel). This suggested that the association of Brcc36-His6 with one or more of the other BRISC subunits exposed the C-terminal His6 tag. To determine which subunit(s) bound directly to Brcc36-His6, we co-expressed Brcc36-His6 in insect cells individually with each of the three other BRISC subunits as follows: Abro1, Hspc142, and Bre (23). We incubated the cell lysates with Ni2+-NTA-agarose and examined the bound proteins by SDS-PAGE. Native Brcc36-His6 only bound to Ni2+-NTA when associated with Abro1, and we could purify the Brcc36-His6-Abro1 heterodimer in apparent 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5, lane 4). Neither Bre nor Hspc142 co-expression exposed the C-terminal tag on Brcc36-His6 that would allow it to bind to the column (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Our results indicate that Abro1 binds directly to Brcc36-His6 and promotes a conformational change that exposes the Brcc36 C-terminal His6 tag. With this assay, we could not determine whether Bre or Hspc142 interacted directly with Brcc36-His6, but we could conclude that they did not induce the change in Brcc36-His6 that exposed the C-terminal His6 tag.Brcc36-Abro Includes a Minimal DUB with Lys63-specific Activity Next, we tested whether the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer had Lys63-specific DUB activity. Although the Brcc36-His6-Abro1 heterodimer formed SDS-resistant aggregates that were apparent on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A, lanes 1\u20133) and eluted from a size exclusion column near the void volume (supplemental Fig. S2), it specifically cleaved Lys63-linked, but not Lys48-linked, diubiquitin (Fig. 6B, middle panel). To compare the cleavage activity of the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer with that of the four-subunit BRISC complex, we assayed equal amounts (i.e. in terms of total Abro1 and Brcc36-His6 proteins) of the two recombinant complexes. Brcc36-Abro1 was \u223c30\u201340-fold less active than the four-subunit BRISC complex (Fig. 6C, compare top and middle panels), reflecting either the instability of the heterodimer or an actual effect on the velocity of the cleavage reaction. This indicates that Brcc36-Abro1 includes a minimal complex that possesses similar enzymatic properties to the four-subunit BRISC complex immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 6.Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer includes a minimal DUB with Lys63-specific activity. A, N terminus of Abro1 is sufficient for binding to Brcc36, but both the Brcc36-Abro1 (full length) and Brcc36-Abro1-(1\u2013258) heterodimers form SDS-resistant aggregates. Insect cells were co-expressed with baculoviruses encoding Brcc36- His6 and either full-length or C-terminally truncated Abro1 (residues 1\u2013258). Cell lysates were incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin and, after washing, bound proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. B, Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimers retain Lys63 linkage specificity. Increasing amounts of recombinant, insect cell expressed BRISC (upper panel), Brcc36-Abro1 (full-length) (middle panel), or Brcc36-Abro1-(1\u2013258) (lower panel) were incubated with Lys63-linked (lanes 1\u20134) or Lys48-linked (lanes 5\u20138) diubiquitin (Ub2) for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and then proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized in an anti-ubiquitin immunoblot. Note that because of the differences in activity of the enzyme preparations, different ranges of enzyme concentrations were used. Ub, ubiquitin. C, specific activities of the Brcc36-containing enzyme preparations. Increasing amounts of recombinant insect cell-expressed BRISC (upper panel), Brcc36-Abro1 (full-length) (middle panel), or Brcc36-Abro1-(1\u2013258) (lower panel) were incubated with 125I-labeled Lys63-Ub2 for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were run on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.Abro1 N Terminus Is Necessary for Lys63-specific DUB Activity The N-terminal two-thirds of Abro1 is very similar to another Brcc36-interacting protein called Abraxas, which is a component of the Brca1-Rap80-containing complex that participates in the cellular response to DNA damage (12). The N terminus of Abraxas contains a coiled-coil region that provides the interaction surface for Brcc36 (35) and an MPN domain (Fig. 6A) (36). We tested whether the N terminus of Abro1 was also sufficient for binding to Brcc36 and, if so, whether a heterodimer consisting of Brcc36 and C-terminally truncated Abro1 possessed Lys63-specific DUB activity. We were able to purify a heterodimer from insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses expressing Brcc36-His6 and truncated Abro1-(1\u2013258), although, like Brcc36-His6-Abro1, it also formed SDS-resistant aggregates (Fig. 6A, lanes 4\u20136). Brcc36-Abro1-(1\u2013258) did retain Lys63-specific cleavage activity (Fig. 6B, lower panel), although it was \u223c500-fold less active than the four-subunit BRISC complex. It is likely that interactions of Abro1 with other BRISC subunits help to stabilize the complex. DISCUSSIONWe have addressed the question of how the BRISC deubiquitinating enzyme attains its specificity and found that, although BRISC specifically cleaves Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (Fig. 1A), its selectivity is not due to preferential binding to these types of chains. Using different forms of mono- and diubiquitin as potential inhibitors in deubiquitination assays, we determined that BRISC binds to Lys48- and Lys63-linked diubiquitin with equal affinity (Fig. 2, A and B). This may allow BRISC to scrutinize different ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages, including those in mixed linkage polyubiquitin chains, until it encounters a Lys63 linkage that can bind in an orientation favorable for cleavage.BRISC also appears to have no binding preference for poly- versus monoubiquitin, because the latter inhibited BRISC with a Ki value nearly identical to the Km value of the cleavage reaction (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that a single ubiquitin-binding site on BRISC furnishes the bulk of the affinity for polyubiquitin substrates.The BRISC-(poly)ubiquitin interaction surface, like most ubiquitin-binding proteins, recognizes the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch (Fig. 2E) that includes residues Leu8 and Ile44, and BRISC can bind to either the distal or proximal units of a ubiquitin dimer (Fig. 3B). There appears to be no polarity, per se, to this interaction. Our conclusion is based on experiments in which diubiquitin conjugates containing a hydrophobic patch mutation in either the proximal or distal unit were used as inhibitors in cleavage assays. Both mutant dimers inhibited BRISC activity (Fig. 3B), and they did so with affinities equivalent to either Ub-Gly76 (for the proximal L8C mutant) (Fig. 2C) or Ub-Asp77 (for the distal L8C mutant) (Fig. 2D). These results are summarized in Fig. 7.Diubiquitin mutated in the distal hydrophobic patch (in this case, with an L8C mutation) can only bind to BRISC via the wild-type proximal ubiquitin hydrophobic patch, even though this results in an unproductive complex that does not allow substrate cleavage. In this case, Asp77, which extends from the proximal ubiquitin, would be oriented toward the Brcc36 active site and impair the ubiquitin-BRISC interaction. Similarly, an Asp77 extension on monoubiquitin must exert a similar effect on the BRISC-ubiquitin interaction (Fig. 2, C and D). Both Ub-Asp77 and the distal hydrophobic patch mutant dimer inhibit BRISC-mediated cleavage with Ki \u223c8\u201310 \u03bcm. Conversely, when the hydrophobic patch of the proximal ubiquitin is mutated, diubiquitin binds to BRISC via the intact hydrophobic patch of the distal ubiquitin. In this configuration, Asp77 exerts no effect on the interaction with the Brcc36 active site. Instead, the Gly76\u2013Lys63 isopeptide bond linking the two ubiquitins (or Gly76 of a monoubiquitin) orients toward the active site. Without the Asp77 affecting the interaction, the affinities of the proximal mutant dimer and Ub-Gly76 for BRISC are stronger, with Ki values \u223c1\u20132 \u03bcm. Together, the data indicate that either ubiquitin of the dimer can bind to BRISC, likely with very similar affinities. However, in our experiments, the presence of the C-terminal Asp77 extension on several inhibitors led to higher Ki values (Fig. 2D and Fig. 3B). This effect of Asp77 also suggests that other extensions from the C terminus of a polyubiquitin chain, including a bulky, non-ubiquitin protein substrate, may interfere with the BRISC interaction. This may contribute to the inability of BRISC to cleave the ubiquitin directly linking a polyubiquitin chain to a substrate (see below).Although BRISC can interact with either unit of diubiquitin, binding to the distal ubiquitin is required to orient the substrate for cleavage of the Lys63\u2013Gly76 isopeptide linkage. Mutating the hydrophobic patch of the distal ubiquitin prevents cleavage, whereas mutating the hydrophobic patch of the proximal ubiquitin has no effect (Fig. 3A). This is consistent with the structure of the Amsh-like protein (Amsh-LP) bound to diubiquitin (26). The structure shows that the hydrophobic patch of the distal ubiquitin binds to the Amsh-LP JAMM/MPN+ domain and that this interaction accounts for the bulk of the affinity between enzyme and substrate. In the crystal structure, Amsh-LP also contacts residues of the proximal ubiquitin of the dimer that are near the isopeptide linkage. Mutations within this second Amsh-LP-binding site, in a region called Ins-2 that is not found in the Brcc36 JAMM/MPN+ domain sequence, affect the kcat value of the cleavage reaction but not the Km value (26). Because our kinetic assays did not detect a second ubiquitin-binding site in BRISC, if it exists, its affinity must be much lower than that of the distal ubiquitin-binding site (Fig. 2B). Nonetheless, we favor the idea that BRISC, like Amsh-LP (26) and the Lys48 linkage selective enzyme human Ouabain-1 (37), possesses a second ubiquitin-binding site that orients the isopeptide bond within the DUB active site for cleavage. If BRISC does indeed possess a proximal ubiquitin-binding site, it must not interact primarily with the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch, because mutation of the proximal hydrophobic patch did not affect cleavage (Fig. 3A).We did not detect DUB activity with Brcc36-His6 expressed alone, but we could not conclude if this was due to protein misfolding or if Brcc36 needs to be incorporated into a multisubunit complex for activity. We found that Abro1 binds directly to Brcc36 and appears to promote catalytic activity and also a conformational change that exposes a C-terminal epitope tag on Brcc36. This is consistent with previous mapping studies that identified a C-terminal coiled-coil domain in Brcc36 that binds directly to a coiled-coil domain of Abraxas, the Abro1 paralog (35). Because the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer has Lys63-specific DUB activity, we suspect that the critical proximal ubiquitin-binding site is within the MPN domain of Abro1. There is precedent for ubiquitin binding by an MPN domain in an otherwise unrelated protein, Prp8 (38).Although the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer retained Lys63-specific DUB activity, its activity was much less robust than that of the four-subunit BRISC complex. The reduced activity may reflect either the instability of the heterodimer or an actual effect on the velocity of the cleavage reaction.We could not determine, by co-expression in insect cells and subsequent binding to Ni2+-NTA resin, whether the other two BRISC subunits, Bre and HSP142 (also known as Merit40 or Nba1), bound directly to Brcc36 because neither of these induced exposure of the C-terminal tag. Recently, several groups found that Hspc142 (36, 39, 40) and Bre stabilize the Brcc36-containing BRCA1 complex and are necessary for targeting it to DNA damage foci following irradiation. Given that the Brcc36-Abro1 heterodimer formed SDS-resistant aggregates, it is likely that Bre and Hspc142 perform a similar function in BRISC.Brcc36 and two other BRISC subunits, Bre and Hspc142/Merit40/Nba1, are also components of the Brca1-Abraxas-Rap80 complex that localizes to DNA damage foci following irradiation (11, 12). Recruitment of this complex requires the tandem ubiquitin-interaction motifs of the Rap80 subunit, which bind selectively to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin (14). Although the precise biochemical role of this complex in mediating the DNA damage repair process is poorly understood, knockdown of different components of this complex leads to sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (35, 36, 39,\u201341). Unlike the Brca1 complex, BRISC is largely cytosolic (23) and lacks the Abraxas subunit. However, BRISC contains the Abraxas paralog Abro1, which shares similarity to Abraxas within its N terminus (12). Abraxas and Abro1 most likely act as scaffolds that deliver the associated Brcc36 catalytic subunit to distinct substrates.If the Brcc36-containing Brca1-Rap80-Abraxas complex, like BRISC, can bind to ubiquitin on its own, why should targeting to Lys63-linked substrates require a linkage-selective adaptor protein such as Rap80 (11,\u201313)? One possibility is that Rap80 serves to protect Lys63 linkages from disassembly until DNA is repaired. Brcc36-mediated deubiquitination may then signal the dismantling of the Brca1 complex and its release from DNA. Alternatively, multiple interactions with Brca1 complex components may be needed for tight, cooperative binding to select physiological substrates for deubiquitination. Whether BRISC subunits other than Brcc36 are involved in substrate selection remains to be determined.Because BRISC-mediated cleavage requires an interaction with a \u201cdistal\u201d ubiquitin, BRISC should not cleave monoubiquitinated substrates (that only contain a \u201cproximal\u201d ubiquitin). Indeed, when we incubated BRISC with a substrate conjugated with a Lys63-linked polyubiquitin tetramer, it cleaved all the Ub-Ub linkages but spared the proximal ubiquitin directly attached to the substrate. Moreover, BRISC shows no significant activity toward ubiquitin-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (data not shown) (42). Without a distal ubiquitin to which to bind, the isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin and the conjugated substrate may not be oriented in the BRISC active site in a configuration that permits cleavage. Moreover, just as the Asp77 extension on both mono- and diubiquitin weakened their interactions with BRISC, it is likely that a (non-ubiquitin) protein substrate covalently linked to the ubiquitin C terminus would reduce binding as well.
