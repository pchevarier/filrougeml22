{"title": "Exploiting dynamic enhancer landscapes to decode macrophage and microglia phenotypes in health and disease", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1016/j.molcel.2021.08.004", "PMID": "34464593", "abstract": "The development and functional potential of metazoan cells is dependent on combinatorial roles of transcriptional enhancers and promoters. Macrophages provide exceptionally powerful model systems for investigation of mechanisms underlying the activation of cell-specific enhancers that drive transitions in cell fate and cell state. Here, we review recent advances that have expanded appreciation of the diversity of macrophage phenotypes in health and disease, emphasizing studies of liver, adipose tissue, and brain macrophages as paradigms for other tissue macrophages and cell types. Studies of normal tissue-resident macrophages and macrophages associated with cirrhosis, obese adipose tissue, and neurodegenerative disease illustrate the major roles of tissue environment in remodeling enhancer landscapes to specify the development and functions of distinct macrophage phenotypes. We discuss the utility of quantitative analysis of environment-dependent changes in enhancer activity states as an approach to discovery of regulatory transcription factors and upstream signaling pathways.", "author": [{"author": "Ty D Troutman", "affiliation": ["Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; Division of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Center for Inflammation and Tolerance, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."], "href": "/?term=Troutman+TD&cauthor_id=34464593"}, {"author": "Eric Kofman", "affiliation": ["Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Kofman+E&cauthor_id=34464593"}, {"author": "Christopher K Glass", "affiliation": ["Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.
