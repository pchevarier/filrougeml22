IntroductionAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening medical condition associated with mortality rates ranging approximately from 25% to 46% across all severities and can be even higher when associated with dysfunction of other organs.1 2 Depending on the severity of hypoxia which is defined by the arterial oxygen tension (paO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio (Horovitz quotient), moderate ARDS (with a paO2/FiO2 ratio 101\u2013200) has been reported to occur in 16\u201323 and severe ARDS (with a paO2/FiO2 ratio \u2264100) in 58\u201379 per 100\u2009000 inhabitants per year.3 Lung-protective ventilation, that is, the use of low tidal volumes and the limitation of airway pressures, has been shown to improve outcomes compared with mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes and airway pressures. Despite this outcome-improving strategy, the large multicentre, observational \u2018LUNG SAFE\u2019-trial observed a low adherence to lung-protective ventilatory strategies and guidelines associated with a high mortality rate up to 46% in severe ARDS.1 An additional finding of the LUNG SAFE-trial was that up to 39% of the ARDS cases were not diagnosed by the physicians, which suggests procedural and infrastructural deficits. Particularly early and mild or moderate ARDS often remains unrecognised until respiratory dysfunction of the patient has deteriorated further and severe hypoxia is present. By implementing consistent lung-protective ventilation, as described in the German guideline \u2018Invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal procedures in acute respiratory insufficiency\u2019,4 significant improvement in the prognosis of this disease entity should be achieved.5 6 However, implementation of these therapy principles cannot be achieved when ARDS is not or not early enough diagnosed. Hence, improvements in both ARDS screening as well as in implementation of evidence-based therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Improvements of procedural and infrastructural deficits might be provided by intelligent technical solutions.7 8 A software approach preprocessing data from electronic health records (EHRs) and providing diagnostic data and treatment recommendations on a mobile device might be such a solution. This approach has been taken by the use case \u2018Algorithmic Surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with ARDS\u2019 (ASIC). ASIC is an integral part of the \u2018Smart Medical Information Technology for Healthcare\u2019 (SMITH) project.9 SMITH is one of four consortia funded by the \u2018Medical Informatics Initiative\u2019 of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.10The objective of our quality improvement project is to improve ARDS detection and guideline adherence in the treatment of mechanically ventilated ARDS-patients by implementing an application software (app) provided on a mobile device and consecutively improve outcome in this patient population. Methods and analysisASIC appThe ASIC app is a mobile, technical support system to facilitate diagnosis and therapy of ARDS and has been specifically developed for this project. It operates system independently on different devices. As part of the ASIC project, it is intended to be used on a mobile device (eg, tablet, smartphone). The data used by the ASIC app are obtained from the local EHR. According to these data, a diagnosis of ARDS can be made by the physician according to the Berlin Criteria.11 Manual entries are required for the findings, which are not documented automatically, like radiographic reports. Due to these functions, the ASIC app only displays a compilation of already existing and documented clinical routine data.ARDS is suspected in mechanically ventilated patients (\u226524\u2009hours duration) by automated ASIC app dependent positive screening of respiratory dysfunction. The duration of mechanical ventilation, the paO2/FiO2 ratio and the positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) are extracted and screened by the ASIC app automatically. An ARDS suspicion is defined as deterioration of the paO2/FiO2 ratio \u2264300\u2009mm Hg that occurs under a PEEP \u22655 cmH2O. In case of ARDS suspicion, the physician will be informed and has to evaluate a potential diagnosis by checking the non-automated criteria of ARDS. These include (1) an acute onset of lung injury within 1\u2009week of an apparent clinical insult and with progression of respiratory symptoms, (2) presence of bilateral opacities on chest imaging (chest radiograph or CT) not explained by other lung pathology (eg, effusion, lobar/lung collapse or nodules) and (3) respiratory failure not explained by heart failure or volume overload. According to the Berlin definition, three severity stages of ARDS (mild, moderate, severe) are categorised based on the degree of hypoxemia using the paO2/FiO2 ratio.11 If the diagnosis has been made by the physician, the ASIC app displays the relevant recommendations of the German S3 guideline \u2018Invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal procedures in acute respiratory insufficiency\u20194 and requests the physician to evaluate applicability of these recommendations for the individual patient. Responsibilities for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions remain with the physicians in charge. If the ARDS diagnosis is not verified, a 24-hour blocking period follows, in which the app does not issue any further notifications. If screening for ARDS remains positive, the app will ask the physician for re-evaluation after 24 hours.Project designThis paragraph describes the initial design of the project as it was planned before the start of control phase. The project is designed as a multicentre stepped-wedge cluster randomised quality improvement strategy (QIS).12 It will be conducted at 8 German university hospitals: Aachen (8 ICUs/96 beds), Bonn (4/58), Duesseldorf (1/16), Halle a. d. Saale (2/30), Hamburg-Eppendorf (10/116), Jena (2/50), Leipzig (3/78) and Rostock (1/23). Since not all of these 31 ICUs are technically and organisationally independent, the dependent ICUs will be summarised into clusters. This results in a total of 12 clusters available for randomisation, of which each will be randomised to one of the 12 steps. After a preparation phase of 18 months, all participating clusters start with a control phase (standard of care) simultaneously. After 8 months, the first clusters enter the roll-in phase (3 months) that is followed by the actual QIS phase. The remaining clusters follow in a stepwise fashion with 1\u2009month between each step (figure 1). During the control phase, the status quo in diagnosis and therapy of ARDS is recorded without any interventions and change in clinical routine. According to the randomisation scheme, the ASIC app will be implemented on the participating ICUs during the roll-in phase to ensure clinical and technical functionality and adequate training of the ICU staff. 3 months later, the QIS phase will start, using the ASIC app in clinical routine. In this phase, the physicians will be assisted to optimise diagnosis and guideline-adherent therapy of ARDS by the ASIC app. Except for the app-usage, there are no further changes in routine caregiving. The final evaluation of primary and secondary key performance indicators (KPIs) (see below) will take place in the evaluation phase.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Stepped-wedge design. During the control phase, ARDS detection is performed according to local standard by the physician in charge with beginning of the QIS phase, physician\u2019s ARDS diagnosis is supported by the ASIC app. ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; QIS, quality improvement strategy.Population under surveillanceAll patients \u226518 years of age in the participating ICUs, who are mechanically ventilated for at least 24 hours, will be admitted to the project. According to pre-existing data from the local EHRs, we expect approximately 5000 patients per year to be surveyed within the project.Key performance indicatorsThe coprimary KPIs of the project consist of the diagnostic rate, defined as the proportion of patients diagnosed with ARDS out of all monitored patients, and guideline adherence regarding lung-protective ventilation, defined as shown below (see table 1).Table 1Coprimary and secondary key performance indicators of ASICCoprimary key performance indicatorsSecondary key performance indicators1.

Acceptance and usability of the ASIC app and the mobile device:Pre-Roll-In of the ASIC app.Post-Roll-In (6 months) of the ASIC app.Open in a separate windowARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; ICU, intensive care unit.Secondary KPIs include the prevalence of organ dysfunction within 28 days after ARDS diagnosis or ICU discharge (whatever occurs first). The treatment duration on ICU and the hospital mortality after ARDS diagnosis will be assessed at hospital discharge, irrespective of length of stay.Furthermore, the user acceptance and usability of new technologies in medicine, such as mobile devices or clinical decision support systems will be examined. Therefore, a survey among the app users will be conducted before and after the ASIC app implementation, in order to investigate user acceptance of mobile technical support systems within clinical routine.Clinical data collection and data protectionThe total data collection started in July 2019 and is scheduled to be completed in December 2021. All data used by the ASIC app or included in the analysis are primarily displayed and stored in the local EHR (tables 1\u20133). At admission to the ICU, the body height of the patients will be measured using disposable measuring tape in order to determine the predicted body weight for calculating the tidal volume according to ARDS network.13 Predicted body weight is computed in men as 50 + (0.91\u00d7[height in centimetres \u2212 152.4]) and in women as 45.5+(0.91\u00d7[height in centimetres \u2212 152.4]). The diagnosis of ARDS is assumed to be made when the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10) code J80.x is documented, depending on severity of disease. The onset of ARDS in the control phase is defined as the time, when the paO2/FiO2 ratio decreases consistently \u2264300\u2009mm Hg, that is, during a period of 2\u2009hours or in two consecutive arterial blood gas analyses, if the time interval between them is longer than 2\u2009hours. During the QIS, the onset of ARDS is assumed, when the physician diagnoses an ARDS using the app. Data are collected from admission to the project until discharge from hospital. Patients who develop ARDS will be assessed for their outcomes when discharged from ICU or 28 days after diagnosis (whatever occurs first) and at hospital discharge depending on the outcome parameter.

When the patient has been discharged, the collected data are transferred to the local Data Integration Centre (DIC), where they are anonymised. The DIC of each location enables medical data sharing across institutional boarders to improve patient care and clinical research. The establishment of these DIC is intended to create a sufficiently large database to allow further analyses. This could help to identify further risk factors with diagnostic or prognostic relevance for ARDS in the future, using, for example, current methods of data science.Comprehensive validation of data protection issues was carried out by external legal consultants. Furthermore, a data protection concept was developed by external data protection experts for the concrete data protection processes in accordance with the local data protection commissioners (eg, data transfer, anonymisation and data storage).Proposed sample sizeTo check whether the size of the sample we expect to collect in the 12 clusters will suffice to detect a difference in ARDS diagnosis rates with 80% power, we did a power calculation as proposed by Hussey and Hughes14 using the R package swCRTdesign15 in R (V.3.5.1).16 This package implements power calculations that take into account the particular characteristics of stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trials such as within-cluster correlations as shown in the article by Hussey and Hughes.14Based on the expected case numbers of 5000 Patients/year, we assumed a mean of 1041 patients per cluster for the study duration of 2.5 years. For the ARDS diagnosis rate in the control phase we used incidences from Brun-Buisson et al17 and Bellani et al1 which suggest a rate of 16.1% and 23.4%, respectively. Under both of these baseline rates an increase as small as 1% (eg, from 16.1% to 17.1%) could be detected with at least 80% power.Statistical analysisTo provide explorative evidence of improvement in healthcare of ARDS patients, differences in primary and secondary KPIs between control phase and QIS will be tested using generalised linear mixed models, where the level of clustering is the 12 clusters. The hypotheses tested for the coprimary KPIs are:(A) The ARDS diagnosis rate in the QIS phase (pQIS) is higher than the rate in the control phase (pcontrol)):(B) The percentage of lung protective ventilation time in the QI phase (pQIS) is higher than the percentage in the control phase (pcontrol):We will conduct two-sided significance tests with a significance level of 5% and also use point estimates and their 95% CI to judge the effect. Secondary KPIs will be analysed descriptively and if feasible with exploratory hypothesis tests following the modelling approach of the primary KPIs.Patient and public involvementASIC is carried out in the routine care of critically ill patients. It fosters the timely diagnose and the adherence to existing guidelines and does not introduce new therapeutic measure. Due to that fact, patients were not included into the planning of the project. During the development of the ASIC app, physicians, who were supposed to use the app, contributed to a user-friendly design of the app. Additionally, surveys among the using physicians will be carried out to evaluate the physician\u2019s view onto the app. At last, patient and public involvement will be reached by the SMITH Congresses 2019 and 2022 (https://www.smith.care/) and the activities of the German \u2018Medical Informatics Initiative\u2019 (https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/).Ethics and disseminationEthics review, registration and informed consent Ethical approval was obtained from the independent Ethics Commitee (EC) at the RWTH Aachen Faculty of Medicine (local EC reference number: EK 102/19) as well as the respective data commissioner in March 2019. The use case ASIC is registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00014330) and will be conducted according to the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The collection of routine documentation on which the ASIC app operates does not require an informed consent because the app merely serves as a supplement to the existing EHR, which will remain the main resource in patient data management.Access to data and disseminationThe results of the ASIC QIS will be presented at scientific and medical conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. ASIC was created to demonstrate the possibilities offered by advanced digital services and infrastructure in healthcare, and therefore, serves as an exemplary use case with clinical benefit in order to prove the functionality of the DIC infrastructure within the SMITH consortium. One of the main objectives of establishing DIC at the local sites is to facilitate the exchange and use of medical data across the borders of institutions and geographical locations in interoperable data formats for medical research while meeting the data protection and security laws and requirements.
