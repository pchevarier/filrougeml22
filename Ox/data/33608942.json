When histone genes are activated in S phase, the number of PCs increases in association with HLBs. CBs can organize histone genes and sn/snoRNA genes on chromosome 1 by forming ternary CB\u2013HLB\u2013PC associates. This genome organization may fine\u2010tune transcription efficiency by Pol II molecules with S5P or S7P CTD in PCs.\n 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic nuclei are highly organized structures comprising chromatin, the nuclear lamina, nucleoli and nuclear bodies (NBs). NBs are phase\u2010separated liquid droplets that contain specific proteins and RNAs (Strom & Brangwynne,\u00a02019; Uversky,\u00a02017). In humans, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is the main player in transcription and is composed of 12 subunits. In addition to numerous small transcription foci, Pol II can form relatively large phase\u2010separated condensates via the intrinsically disordered C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1, which is the largest subunit that harbors the catalytic activity (Boehning et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018; Lu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018). Human Pol II CTD consists of 52 repeats of hepta\u2010amino acids, Tyr\u2013Ser\u2013Pro\u2013Thr\u2013Ser\u2013Pro\u2013Ser. The Tyr, Ser and Thr residues can be phosphorylated, depending on the transcription status. In general, Ser5 and Ser2 become phosphorylated during the initiation and elongation of transcription, respectively (Harlen & Churchman,\u00a02017; Maita & Nakagawa,\u00a02020). Thus, transcribing Pol II molecules on most of protein coding genes harbor phosphorylated Ser2 (S2P) at the CTD, but those on histone genes and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes are only phosphorylated at Ser5 (S5P) (Medlin et\u00a0al.,\u00a02005). Pol II on snRNA genes also harbors phosphorylated Ser7 (S7P) (Egloff et\u00a0al.,\u00a02007, 2012). Phosphorylation of CTD was recently reported to regulate phase separation or condensation of Pol II clusters. Pol II with hypophosphorylated CTD forms clusters with mediators, while Pol II with hyperphosphorylated CTD is clustered with splicing factors (Guo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019). Pol II large condensates [hereafter termed Pol II condensates (PCs) to avoid confusion with numerous smaller clusters] contain both unphosphorylated and S5P CTD forms (Alm\u2010Kristiansen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Guglielmi et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013; Nizami et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010; Schul et\u00a0al.,\u00a01998; Xie & Pombo,\u00a02006).Pol II condensates were reported to associate with NBs, such as Cajal/coiled bodies (CBs) and histone locus bodies (HLBs) (Alm\u2010Kristiansen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Guglielmi et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013; Lamond & Carmo\u2010Fonseca,\u00a01993; Nizami et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010; Schul et\u00a0al.,\u00a01998; Xie & Pombo,\u00a02006). CBs are involved in transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional regulation of histone genes, snRNA genes and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes via genome organization (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Sawyer et al., 2016), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis (Stan\u011bk, 2017) and telomerase RNA modification (Henriksson & Farnebo,\u00a02015; Venteicher et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). CBs tend to localize near sn/snoRNA genes (U1 and U2 snRNA gene arrays on chromosomes 1 and 17, respectively) and HIST2 locus (six histone genes on chromosome 1) in human cells (Duronio & Marzluff,\u00a02017; Frey & Matera,\u00a02001; Nizami et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010a, 2010b; Shopland et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). CBs contain various proteins, such as coilin, survival motor neuron protein (SMN) (Raimer et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016) and telomerase Cajal body protein 1 (TCAB1; also known as WDR79 or WRAP53\u03b2) (Henriksson & Farnebo,\u00a02015; Venteicher et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). Coilin is a marker protein of CBs, and its depletion leads to loss of CBs (Machyna et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). SMN and TCAB1 contribute to snRNP recycling and telomere maintenance, respectively (Henriksson & Farnebo,\u00a02015; Raimer et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Venteicher et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009). SMN is also a component of another, coilin\u2010negative NB called Gem (gemini of Cajal bodies), which is often co\u2010localized with a CB (Cauchi,\u00a02010; Liu & Dreyfuss,\u00a01996; Sleeman et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003). Diverse biological functions of coilin or CBs have been observed during development and reproduction. Coilin\u2010knockout (KO) mice show semi\u2010embryonic lethality and are defective in fertility and fecundity (Tucker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001; Walker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009), and coilin\u2010knockdown (KD) zebrafish were embryonic lethal because of insufficient snRNP production (Strzelecka et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010). At the cellular level, coilin\u2010KO mouse and coilin\u2010KD human cells are viable but show impaired splicing efficiency and fidelity, decreased transcription of histone and sn/snoRNA genes, and decreased cell proliferation (Lemm et\u00a0al.,\u00a02006; Tucker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Whittom et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008). Coilin is considered to play a role as glue to co\u2010assemble many proteins and RNAs into CBs and to facilitate RNP biogenesis (Klingauf et\u00a0al.,\u00a02006).The HLB is another type of NB that localizes near replication\u2010dependent histone gene loci, such as HIST1 (55 histone genes on chromosome 6) and HIST2 (six histone genes on chromosome 1) in humans (Duronio & Marzluff,\u00a02017; Marzluff et\u00a0al.,\u00a02002; Nizami et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010a, 2010b; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). HLBs are often found adjacent to CBs, consistent with the association between CBs and HIST2 (Duronio & Marzluff,\u00a02017; Nizami et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010a, 2010b). HLBs contain proteins essential for both the initiation of histone gene transcription and 3\u2032 cleavage of nonpolyadenylated histone mRNAs, including an HLB marker protein, nuclear protein of the ataxia telangiectasia\u2010mutated locus (NPAT) (Fruscio et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997; Ghule et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Ma et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000; Romeo & Sch\u00fcmperli,\u00a02016; Ye et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003). Disruption of the NPAT gene results in early embryonic lethality in mice and halts cell proliferation because of G0/G1 arrest (Di Fruscio et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997; Ma et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000; Ye et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003).Although the liquid droplet nature of NBs has recently been studied intensively (Carmo\u2010Fonseca & Rino,\u00a02011; Sawyer et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019; Shevtsov & Dundr,\u00a02011; Stan\u011bk & Fox,\u00a02017), it remains unclear how different NBs associate with each other in living cells. In the present study, time\u2010lapse imaging was employed to examine how three NBs (PCs, CBs and HLBs) are formed and interact with each other in living human cells. PCs were often nucleated at the beginning of S phase near CBs or HLBs, with a preferential association with HLBs. PC\u2013CB\u2013HLB ternary associates were formed via three different pathways. Although CBs were not essential for PC formation, the association of PCs with other NBs was affected. PCs were more sensitive to 1,6\u2010hexanediol (1,6\u2010HD) than CBs and HLBs. Our data combined with previous findings suggest that PCs are dynamic structures, and their nucleation is initiated during activation of gene clusters, facilitated by other NBs. 2.\u2003RESULTS2.1. Frequent emergence of PCs at entry of S phase in living cellsTo examine when and where PCs are formed in living cells, we knocked\u2010in the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) into both alleles of RPB1 gene in human colon cancer HCT116 cells so that EGFP\u2010RPB1 is expressed under the own promotor (Figure\u00a01a). Western blot analysis confirmed that EGFP\u2013RPB1 was expressed in knock\u2010in HCT116 cells (referred as KI cells) at a similar level to that of endogenous RPB1 in wild\u2010type cells (Figure\u00a01b). In living KI cells, EGFP\u2013RPB1 fluorescence was concentrated in several large foci (Pol II condensates or PCs; average 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 per nucleus; range 0\u201310; Table\u00a0S1) with a maximum Feret diameter of ~0.7\u00a0\u03bcm (Figure\u00a01c), as previously reported (Steurer et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018). The number of PCs in living KI cells was slightly lower than that in parental HCT116 cells that were fixed and stained with anti\u2010CTD antibody (average 8.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 per nucleus; range 0\u201321). This difference may be due to a higher contrast by immunofluorescence using fixed cells than in living cells where diffuse EGFP\u2013RPB1 is present. The effects of GFP\u2010fusion might also cause the difference; the addition of GFP may partially interfere with the condensate formation and/or may cause CTD truncation as a band below 200\u00a0kDa was observed on anti\u2010GFP blot (Figure\u00a01b) (Chapman et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004; Kim & Dahmus,\u00a01989). In this study, however, the 1.6\u2010fold difference in the absolute number had little impact on the analysis and interpretation, as we essentially compared the associations between NBs in KI\u2010derivatives with those in KI cells and the data were supported by immunofluorescence using parental cells. Immunofluorescence using phosphorylation\u2010specific antibodies showed that PCs contained S5P and S7P, but not S2P and T4P, on Pol II CTD (Figure\u00a01d), which was consistent with observations using parental HCT116 cells (Figure\u00a0S1) as well as previous reports (Xie & Pombo,\u00a02006).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Generation of EGFP\u2013RPB1 KI cells and characterization of PCs. (a) Summary of the cell lines used in the present study. EGFP\u2013RPB1 KI (KI) is a cell line in which EGFP is knocked\u2010in into both RPB1 alleles and all RPB1 is EGFP\u2010tagged. Asterisks indicate cell lines obtained via single\u2010cell cloning. (b) Western blots. Whole\u2010cell lysates prepared from parental HCT116 (P) and KI (KI) cells were separated and probed with antibodies against Pol II CTD (CMA601), GFP and beta\u2010actin (ACTB). Two bands above 200\u00a0kDa on anti\u2010CTD and anti\u2010GFP blots represent hyperphosphorylated (top) and unphosphorylated (bottom) forms (Stasevich et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). An extra band just below 200\u00a0kDa in KI cells on anti\u2010GFP blot may be a degraded form (Pol IIb) during sample preparation or in cells (Chapman et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004; Kim & Dahmus,\u00a01989). (c) EGFP\u2013RPB1 in living KI cells. Single confocal section of EGFP\u2013RPB1 and a magnified view of a Pol II condensate (PC) are shown. The table (right) shows the properties of PCs in parental HCT116 and KI cells, detected by immunofluorescence using anti\u2010CTD and by EGFP\u2013RPB1, respectively. Parameters (means of 50 cells) were determined by intensity thresholding and size constraint (see Experimental Procedures section). The numbers of CBs and HLBs in KI cells (2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 and 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1, respectively; n\u00a0=\u00a0100 cells; Figure\u00a0S2a; Table\u00a0S1) were similar to those in parental HCT116 cells (2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 and 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3, respectively; n\u00a0=\u00a0100 cells; Figure\u00a0S2b; Table\u00a0S1). (d) Immunofluorescence images of EGFP\u2013RPB1 (green) in KI cells with antibodies against Pol II CTD, S2P, T4P, S5P or S7P, and Cy5\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse secondary antibodies (magenta). Magnified views of areas indicated by yellow boxes are shown. Max\u2010Intensity\u2010Projection (MIP) images of Z\u2010stack confocal sections at 0.30\u00a0\u03bcm intervals (31\u201334 stacks) to cover the entire nucleus are shown. Scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcm; for magnified views, 1\u00a0\u03bcmWe expressed mCherry\u2013PCNA as a marker of replication foci during S phase (Leonhardt et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000) in KI cells to examine the cell cycle dynamics of PCs. Figure\u00a02a shows a typical example representing the dynamics of EGFP\u2013RPB1 and mCherry\u2013PCNA during the cell cycle (Movie S1). A few bright PCs were observed from G2 to M phase (elapse time, hr:min; 0:00, 2:40 and 3:00). After the mitosis, PCs were rarely observed during G1 phase (4:10 and 7:10). The number of PCs increased when the cells entered S phase (7:40, at which mCherry\u2013PCNA was concentrated in many replication foci). Most PCs persisted until the mid to late S phase (13:50 and 16:50) and the number decreased during the G2 to the next G1 phase (19:50, 21:50, 22:30 and 26:20). Analysis of 100 cells revealed that the number of PCs per nucleus increased from 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 in G1 phase (0 in 69% of cells) to 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 in early S phase (3 in 46% of cells) (Figure\u00a02b). It was plausible that PCs appeared in G1 and S phase are associated with CBs and HLBs that are involved in gene expression of snRNA (expressed in G1 phase and enhanced in S phase) and histone genes (expressed in S phase) (Faresse et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012; Marzluff & Koreski,\u00a02017; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). This prompted us to investigate the relationship between PCs, CBs and HLBs in living cells.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2PC formation in living cells.

Live\u2010cell imaging analysis of the association between PCs, CBs and HLBsThe association between PCs, CBs and HLBs was examined by expressing C\u2010terminally SNAP\u2010tagged coilin (coilin\u2013SNAP) in coilin\u2010KO cells that were generated from KI cells and C\u2010terminally HaloTag\u2010tagged NPAT (NPAT\u2013HaloTag) in KI cells (Figure\u00a01a and Figure\u00a0S3a\u2013d). Time\u2010lapse imaging (Movie S2) revealed that some PCs nucleated near CBs (~38% of PCs in 75 cells, n\u00a0=\u00a0232, Table\u00a0S2; Figure\u00a03a, arrowhead), whereas the others appeared to be distant from CBs (~62%; Figure\u00a03a, asterisk). The size of PCs was enlarged after association with CBs in some rare cases (~3%, Figure\u00a03a, arrow). In NPAT\u2013HaloTag expressing KI cells, PCs also nucleated near HLBs, but at a higher rate (~51% PCs in 75 cells, n\u00a0=\u00a0226, Table\u00a0S2; Figure\u00a03b, arrowhead; and Movie S3). Some PCs simultaneously formed with HLBs (~25%, Figure\u00a03b, arrow; and Movie S4) while others nucleated away from HLBs (~24%; Figure\u00a03b, asterisk). These observations indicated that PCs preferentially nucleate near or together with HLBs.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3PCs nucleated near CBs and HLBs.

Scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcmWe next analyzed how long the PC\u2013CB and PC\u2013HLB associates were maintained using the time\u2010lapse data. The mean association periods were 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 (range, 1.3\u20139.3) hr for PC\u2013CB (n\u00a0=\u00a029 associates in 22 cells) and 4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7 (range, 1.0\u20139.0) hr for PC\u2013HLB (n\u00a0=\u00a033 associates in 22 cells) (Table\u00a0S3). Most PC\u2013CB (90%) and PC\u2013HLB (76%) associates dissolved within ~6.6\u00a0hr of early S phase, as judged from the mCherry\u2013PCNA pattern (Figure\u00a03c). The residual fractions (10% for PC\u2013CB and 24% for PC\u2013HLB) had dissolved by 9.5\u00a0hr, before mCherry\u2013PCNA exhibited late\u2010replicating heterochromatic distribution (Figure\u00a03c). PC\u2013CB associates showed four patterns of dissolution: disappearance of PCs in the presence of CBs (38%), disappearance of CBs in the presence of PCs (21%), simultaneous disappearance of both (34%) and separation of a PC\u2013CB associate into two distinct NBs (7%; n\u00a0=\u00a029 associates in 22 cells, Figure\u00a03d and Table\u00a0S3). PC\u2013HLB associates showed three patterns of dissolution: disappearance of PCs (46%), disappearance of HLBs (12%) and disappearance of both (42%, n\u00a0=\u00a033 associates in 22 cells; Figure\u00a03d and Table\u00a0S3). These findings indicated that PCs turn over more dynamically than CBs or HLBs.The relationship between the three NBs (PCs, CBs and HLBs) was examined using live\u2010cell imaging with coilin\u2010KO cells that expressed both coilin\u2013SNAP and NPAT\u2013HaloTag (Figure\u00a01a). These cells showed similar numbers of CBs or HLBs per nucleus to those of parental KI cells (Table\u00a0S1). PCs in living cells were categorized into four patterns (n\u00a0=\u00a0382 PCs in 100 cells; Figure\u00a04a): not associating with CBs or HLBs (17%), associating with only CBs (11%), associating with only HLBs (46%) and associating with both CBs and HLBs (26%). This observation was consistent with the higher rate of PC nucleation nearer HLBs than CBs in the analysis with each combination (Figure\u00a03a,b; Table\u00a0S2). PC\u2013CB\u2013HLB associates (n\u00a0=\u00a0142 in 100 cells imaged for 40\u00a0hr) were reverse\u2010tracked to reveal how ternary NB associations were formed. There were three association pathways (Figure\u00a04b,c, pathways A\u2013C; Figure\u00a0S4; and Movie S5\u2013S7). In more than a half of all cases (53%), PCs and HLBs were simultaneously nucleated near CBs (pathway A; Movie S5). The second major pathway (32%) involved a preformed PC\u2013HLB becoming associated with a nearby CB (pathway B; Movie S6). Nucleation of a PC near a preformed CB\u2013HLB associate (pathway C; Movie S7) was relatively less frequent (15%). These findings are also consistent with PCs preferentially associating with HLBs than with CBs.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Association of NBs in living cells.

In this analysis, 142 PC\u2013CB\u2013HLB associates in 100 coilin\u2010KO cells expressing both NPAT\u2013HaloTag and coilin\u2013SNAP were reverse\u2010tracked from assembly of the ternary associates using live imaging data for 40\u00a0hr.

Coilin\u2010KO did not affect PC formation but affected association between NBsTo investigate the requirement of CBs for PC formation, we used coilin\u2010KO cells, which were generated from KI cells using CRISPR/Cas9 nickase (Figures\u00a01a and 5a,b). Coilin KO did not affect the number (5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 and 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 in clones 1 and 2, respectively; Table\u00a0S1) or phosphorylation status of PCs (Figure\u00a0S5a). Time\u2010lapse imaging using coilin\u2010KO cells that express mCherry\u2013PCNA revealed that PCs appeared in early S phase (Figure\u00a0S6a and Movie S8), as observed in KI cells. These data indicate that CBs are not essential for PC formation. Similarly, HLBs and Gems (coilin\u2010negative SMN foci) were still observed in coilin\u2010KO cells, and their numbers were unchanged compared with those of KI cells. By contrast, TCAB1 foci disappeared in coilin\u2010KO cells (Figure\u00a0S6b and Table\u00a0S1), supporting an essential role of CBs on TCAB1 foci (Chen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015; Vogan et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Effects of coilin\u2010KO on PC formation and associations with NBs.

KI cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against coilin and NPAT to detect CBs and HLBs, respectively. PCs were detected using EGFP\u2013RPB1. Nuclear DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (only shown in cells stained with coilin and NPAT; blue). MIP images of Z\u2010stacks at 0.30\u00a0\u03bcm intervals to cover the entire nucleus (51\u201358 stacks) are shown.

Example images are magnified.

The relationship between PCs and SMN foci, or Gems in coilin KO cells, is indicated on the right. Scale bars, 5\u00a0\u03bcm; for magnified views, 1\u00a0\u03bcmNext, by using immunofluorescence with fixed cells, we analyzed the associations between NBs in KI and coilin\u2010KO cells in more detail. We classified the localization patterns of two protein pairs (i.e., Pol II\u2013coilin, Pol II\u2013NPAT and coilin\u2013NPAT) into three categories: \u201cco\u2010localizing\u201d (most pixels overlapped), \u201cadjacent\u201d (few pixels overlapped) and \u201cnonassociating\u201d (no overlapping pixels) (Figure\u00a05c). Both \u201cco\u2010localizing\u201d and \u201cadjacent\u201d were treated as \u201cassociating,\u201d which we used in live imaging as the spatial resolution was not high enough to distinguish \u201cco\u2010localizing\u201d from \u201cadjacent.\u201d The co\u2010localization rate between HLBs and PCs was higher than that between CBs and PCs in KI cells (Figure\u00a05d and Figure\u00a0S3d). In coilin\u2010KO cells, HLBs and PCs became more co\u2010localized, while the association between coilin\u2010negative SMN foci (Gems) and PCs decreased (Figure\u00a05d). These data suggest that the associations between PCs and NBs are balanced among different NBs, with a preferred association of PCs with HLBs, and so a PC\u2013HLB association becomes more prominent in the absence of CBs because of a lack of sequestration. By contrast, coilin or CBs may bridge SMN and PCs through the direct interaction between coilin and SMN proteins (Hebert et al., 2001).We then examined the effect of coilin overexpression on the associations between NBs. In KI cells that overexpressed coilin\u2013SNAP, compared with KI cells, CBs became larger and PCs were more co\u2010localized with CBs (Figure\u00a0S7) whereas the number of CBs was not substantially increased (Table\u00a0S4). The co\u2010localization rate of PCs with SMN foci was also increased by coilin\u2013SNAP overexpression (Figure\u00a05d), which was reciprocal to their decreased association in coilin\u2010KO cells (Figure\u00a05d). Coilin\u2013SNAP overexpression did not affect the PC\u2013HLB co\u2010localization rate, again reflecting the preferential association of PCs with HLBs to CBs. These data support the above view that CBs modulate associations between NBs.As CBs are known to co\u2010localize with CDK7, which phosphorylates Ser5 in the RPB1 CTD (Jordan et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997), the association between PCs and CBs could facilitate Ser5 phosphorylation. However, levels of S5P in PCs with CBs were similar to those in PCs without CBs (Figure\u00a0S5b,c), suggesting that the function of the PC\u2013CB association is not simply facilitating phosphorylation. In addition, levels of S5P in PCs were also constant, irrespective of the associations with HLBs (Figure\u00a0S5d). Thus, CBs and HLBs do not appear to play an essential role in regulating Ser5 phosphorylation in PCs.2.4. PC depletion did not influence CBs and HLBsWe next investigated the effect of Pol II depletion on CBs and HLBs in parental HCT116 cells using triptolide, which degrades Pol II via RPB1 ubiquitination (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011). When cells were treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM triptolide for 2\u00a0hr, Pol II signals detected using anti\u2010CTD antibody were substantially diminished. In contrast, CBs and HLBs remained present in triptolide\u2010treated cells (Figure\u00a0S8a), and the numbers of CBs and HLBs (average 3.3 and 2.3, respectively) were similar to those with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\u2010treated control (average 3.4 and 2.2, respectively). The association between CBs and HLBs was also unaffected (Figure\u00a0S8b). Thus, the integrity of CBs and HLBs was independent of Pol II, consistent with the frequent nucleation of PCs from these NBs, but not vice versa.2.5. PCs were liquid\u2010like NBs compared with solid\u2010like CBs and HLBsPhase\u2010separated NBs exhibit a broad range of biophysical properties, from solid\u2010like to liquid\u2010like (Boeynaems et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018); thus, we investigated the sensitivity of PCs, CBs and HLBs to 1,6\u2010HD, which is known to disrupt liquid\u2010like droplets rather than solid\u2010like materials (Kroschwald et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). PCs disappeared within 1\u00a0min after administration of 1,6\u2010HD, whereas CBs and HLBs remained unchanged in coilin\u2010KO cells expressing coilin\u2013SNAP and KI cells expressing NPAT\u2013HaloTag, respectively (Figure\u00a06), suggesting that PCs had more liquid\u2010like properties compared with CBs and HLBs.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 61,6\u2010HD only disrupted PCs in living cells.

MIP images of 11 Z\u2010stacks at 0.90\u00a0\u03bcm intervals are shown for EGFP\u2013RPB1 (Pol II; green in merge) and coilin\u2013SNAP (CBs) labeled with SNAP\u2013Cell 647\u2013SiR (magenta in merge) or NPAT\u2013HaloTag (HLBs) labeled with Janelia Fluor 646 HaloTag ligand (magenta in merge). Yellow lines indicate nuclear peripheries. Scale bar, 5\u00a0\u03bcm 3.\u2003DISCUSSIONThe present study analyzed the formation of PCs, CBs and HLBs, and their associations in HCT116 cells. PCs were often nucleated at the beginning of S phase near CBs and HLBs, and PC\u2013CB and PC\u2013HLB associates were dissolved before the end of S phase (Figures\u00a02 and \u200band3;3; Tables S2 and S3). This observation is consistent with the function of CBs and HLBs, which are localized near sn/snoRNA and/or histone gene clusters and are involved in transcriptional and post\u2010transcriptional regulation of these genes (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). CBs were reported to associate with HIST2 more frequently during late G1 and S phase compared with other cell cycle phases (Shopland et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001), and HLBs became apparent during S phase (Duronio & Marzluff,\u00a02017). CBs and HLBs can be formed by increased local concentrations of the component proteins that bind to specific DNA sequence and/or RNA elements at these gene clusters. Once CBs and HLBs are formed, they are quite stably maintained probably because of their rather solid\u2010like droplet nature, relatively resistant to 1,6\u2010HD (Figure\u00a0S8), through pi/pi, cation/pi and electrostatic interactions (Alberti et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019; Carmo\u2010Fonseca & Rino,\u00a02011; Ghule et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Kaiser et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Shevtsov & Dundr,\u00a02011). By contrast, PCs were sensitive to 1,6\u2010HD (Figure\u00a0S8), suggesting their liquid\u2010like nature, which may secure the dynamic turnover of PCs compared with CBs and HLBs. As snRNA and histones are highly transcribed depending on the cell cycle (Faresse et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012; Marzluff & Koreski,\u00a02017; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016), the formation of PCs near these genes can increase the local concentration of Pol II to facilitate timely transcription. Then, dissolution of PCs may associate with decreased level of transcription.Cajal bodies and HLBs appear to facilitate the nucleation of PCs near the target gene cluster, such as sn/snoRNA genes (RNU2 and SNORD3A) on chromosome 17 for CBs and the histone gene cluster, HIST1, on chromosome 6 for HLBs. Taken together with the fluorescence in situ hybridization data (Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016), the ternary associate of CB, HLB and PC is likely to be formed near chromosome 1 on which both sn/snoRNA genes and histone genes (RNU1, RNU11, SNORA72, HIST2 and H3F3A) are located (Figure\u00a07). A preformed CB on the sn/snoRNA gene locus can act as a core to form a PC\u2013CB\u2013HLB ternary associate via interaction with the histone gene locus, either by stimulating HLB and PC nucleation (Figure\u00a04b,c; pathway A; Figure\u00a0S4) or interacting with a PC\u2013HLB associate (Figure\u00a04b,c; pathway B; Figure\u00a0S4). The presence of Pol II harboring S5P and S7P on its CTD in PCs also supports the view that PCs may contribute to the active transcription of sn/snoRNA and histone genes because these phosphorylated forms of Pol II (but not S2P) transcribe these genes (Figure\u00a01d) (Egloff et\u00a0al.,\u00a02007, 2012; Medlin et\u00a0al.,\u00a02005). Although CBs are not essential for the transcription of snRNA and histone genes, as coilin\u2010KO cells grow normally (Lemm et\u00a0al.,\u00a02006; Tucker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001; Whittom et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008), CBs may contribute to the fine tuning of sn/snoRNA transcription and the formation of other NBs, which may be required for precise developmental regulation (Strzelecka et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010; Tucker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02001; Walker et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 7A model of the spatiotemporal and functional relationships between PCs, CBs and HLBs. CBs and HLBs can be formed near sn/snoRNA and histone gene clusters with or without PCs. When histone genes are activated in S phase, the number of PCs increases in association with HLBs. CBs can organize histone genes and sn/snoRNA genes on chromosome 1 by forming ternary CB\u2013HLB\u2013PC associates. This genome organization may fine\u2010tune transcription efficiency by Pol II molecules with S5P or S7P CTD in PCsDisruption of CBs via coilin KO did not affect PCs in terms of the number per nucleus, nucleation timing and the phosphorylation status of Pol II (Figures S5 and S6; Table\u00a0S1; Movie S8). However, the association between PCs and HLBs increased in response to coilin KO (Figure\u00a05d). This may be explained by a loss of PC sequestration to CBs. In the absence of CBs, increased free Pol II could facilitate nucleation at HLBs, and/or PCs free of CBs could associate with HLBs. Although it was of interest to investigate the effect of HLB depletion on PCs and CBs, this experiment was not possible in the present study as NPAT is essential for cell cycle progression (Di Fruscio et\u00a0al.,\u00a01997; Ma et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000; Ye et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003). In contrast to the increased association between PCs and HLBs, coilin KO decreased the association between PCs and coilin\u2010negative SMN foci (Gems) (Figure\u00a05d). Reciprocally, coilin\u2013SNAP overexpression, which resulted in increasing the size of CBs, increased the association between PCs and SMN foci (Figure\u00a05d and Table\u00a0S4). These are consistent with the previous data showing that coilin mediates the interaction between CBs and SMN (Hebert et al., 2001). Thus, the presence or absence of one type of NB may affect other NBs via direct or indirect associations between NBs. A specific interaction between proteins in different NBs could mediate these associations (Hebert et al., 2001). However, recent studies have suggested that interactions between different NBs may depend more on their biophysical properties than specific protein\u2013protein interactions. Relative surface tensions are considered to be a key parameter in regulating associations between two heterotopic NBs (Bergeron\u2010Sandoval et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Feric et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Shin & Brangwynne,\u00a02017). Alterations of relative surface tensions among CBs, HLBs and PCs may result in different association patterns. Although we observed overlapping and adjacent associations between NBs, the biological significance of these dynamic interactions remains unclear. Biological surfactant proteins may modulate the interactions between these NBs (Cuylen et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Feric et\u00a0al.,\u00a02016). 4.\u2003EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES4.1. Cell culture, transfection and flow cytometryHCT116 cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL\u2010247, ATCC) and grown in high\u2010glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; 08458\u201016, NACALAI TESQUE) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10270\u2010106, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamate, 100\u00a0U/ml penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptomycin (G6784\u2010100Ml, Merck, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) under 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Lipofectamine 3000 was used for transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions (L3000015, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antibiotics selection was carried out by culturing cells in medium supplemented with 500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml G418 for one week or 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml puromycin for two days. A flow cytometer (SH800S, Sony) was used to collect cells expressing fluorescence\u2010tagged proteins.4.2. Plasmid construction, genome editing and single\u2010cell cloningTotal RNAs were extracted for use as cDNA synthesis templates using TRIzol (15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific), treated with RQ1 RNase\u2010Free DNase (M6101, Promega, WI, USA) in the presence of RNaseOUT (10777019, Thermo Fisher Scientific), extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated using ethanol according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Primers to amplify cDNA were designed using Primer\u2010BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer\u2010blast/index.cgi). cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScript II High Fidelity One Step RT\u2010PCR Kit (R026A, Takara Bio), purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, 28106) and cloned into the PiggyBac Transposon Vector (PB533A\u20102, Funakoshi) or its derivatives with appropriate antibiotics resistant genes (ampicillin for Escherichia coli and neomycin or puromycin for mammalian cells) and a tag (SNAP\u2010tag or HaloTag) using an In\u2010Fusion HD Cloning Kit (639635, Takara Bio). The E.\u00a0coli DH5\u03b1 strain was transformed using In\u2010Fusion products, and single colonies were picked up for plasmid preparation and verification by DNA sequencing. For transfection, plasmids were purified using a Plasmid DNA Midiprep Kit (K210005, Thermo Fisher Scientific).KI cells were generated by using TALE nuclease (TALEN) knock\u2010in method using a Platinum Gate TALEN Kit, a gift from Takashi Yamamoto (1000000043, Addgene) (Sanjana et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). To construct a TALEN pair that targets the 1st exon of POLR2A, DNA\u2010binding modules for 5\u2032\u2010ATGCACGGGGGT\u20103\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2010GCATGCGCTGTC\u20103\u2032 were assembled into the ptCMV\u2013153/47 vector, respectively. To construct a donor vector (pDonor\u2013EGFP\u2013POLR2A), ~1,000\u00a0bp upstream of the annotated start codon of POLR2A, EGFP with A206K mutation, ~250\u00a0bp fragment of the 1st exon including coding sequence, loxP\u2010puromycin selection marker\u2010loxP, and ~1,000\u00a0bp of downstream sequence were tandemly flanked by PCR and inserted into the pBlueScript vector. The TALEN plasmids and pDonor\u2013EGFP\u2013POLR2A were co\u2010transfected into parental HCT116 cells by electroporation using an NEPA21 super electroporator (Nepa Gene). Puromycin\u2010resistant clones were isolated and validated by genomic PCR, DNA sequencing and Western blotting. Note that KI cells used in this study spontaneously lost the puromycin cassette at the loxP site for unknown reasons.Coilin\u2010KO cells were generated using the Cas9 nickase system (pX335 and pKN7; Addgene) (Cong et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013) with single guide RNAs designed using CHOPCHOP (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/). KO of the coilin gene (COIL) was achieved using the following sequences: 5\u2032\u2010TGCCTCAGGTGCGCGGCGCAGGG\u20103\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032\u2010TCCGCGCGCGAGAGCCGCCCCCC\u20103\u2032 (reverse), where the PAM sequence is underlined.For single\u2010cell cloning, transfected cells were resuspended in DMEM, filtered through a 40\u00a0\u03bcm cell strainer (352340, Corning), and seeded at a density of 1,000\u00a0cells/20\u00a0ml in a 15\u2010cm dish. After incubation in a CO2 incubator for a week, single colonies were picked using a P20 pipette tip under a conventional phase\u2013contrast microscope and transferred to an ibidi\u2010coated 96\u2010well plate (\u00b5\u2010Plate 96 Well Black, 89626, ibidi).4.3. Antibodies, dyes, florescent ligands and chemicalsAll antibodies, dyes and florescent ligands are listed in Table\u00a0S5. Three mouse \u03b1\u2010RPB1 CTD monoclonal antibodies (IgGs) were generated in our laboratory (Stasevich et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). The mouse monoclonal \u03b1\u2010CTD antibody (C13B9) was generated using the unphosphorylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the CTD heptarepeat; however, the antibody can also recognize phosphorylated CTD (Stasevich et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). Fab preparation and dye\u2010conjugation were carried out as previously described (Hayashi\u2010Takanaka et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011; Stasevich et\u00a0al.,\u00a02014). 1,6\u2010HD was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (H0099, Tokyo, Japan), dissolved in DMEM, filtered through a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm filter for sterilization and stored at 4\u00b0C. Triptolide was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (3253, Tocris, R&D Systems), dissolved in DMSO at 100\u00a0\u03bcM and stored at \u221230\u00b0C. Triptolide was diluted in cell culture medium immediately prior to use.4.4. Immunofluorescence, live\u2010cell imaging and image analysisAll immunofluorescence procedures were carried out at room temperature. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X\u2010100 and 250\u00a0mM HEPES, pH 7.4 for 20\u00a0min, rinsed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate\u2010buffered saline (D\u2010PBS) (\u2212) (048\u201029805, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) and permeabilized with 1% Triton X\u2010100 in D\u2010PBS (\u2212) for 20\u00a0min. After blocked with Blocking One P (05999\u201084, NACALAI TESQUE) for 20\u00a0min and rinsed in D\u2010PBS (\u2212), the processed cells were incubated with primary antibodies in D\u2010PBS (\u2212) for 2\u00a0hr. Cells were rinsed three times in D\u2010PBS (\u2212), incubated with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 (H3570, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in D\u2010PBS (\u2212) for 2\u00a0hr and rinsed three times in D\u2010PBS (\u2212).For live\u2010cell imaging, cells were seeded on ibidi\u2010treated culture dishes (\u00b5\u2010Slide 8 Well, 80826, or \u00b5\u2010Dish 35\u00a0mm high, 81156, ibidi) and cultured for one to two days. The medium was replaced with FluoroBright (A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2\u00a0mM l\u2010glutamate, 100\u00a0U/ml penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, immediately prior to imaging. Images were acquired using a spinning disk confocal microscope comprising an inverted microscope (Ti\u2010E, Nikon), a Plan\u2010Apo VC 100\u00d7 (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective lens (NA 1.4; with Type F immersion oil, MXA22168, Nikon), a spinning disk unit (CSU\u2010W1, Yokogawa), an EM\u2010CCD camera (iXon3 DU888 X\u20108465, Andor) and a LU\u2010N4 laser unit (Nikon) under the control of an operating software (NIS\u2010Elements, Nikon). Live\u2010cell imaging was carried out at 37\u00b0C under 5% of CO2 using a stage top incubator (INUBG2TF\u2010WSKM\u2010A14R, Tokai\u2010Hit). Images were analyzed using Icy (Chaumont et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012) (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/). Individual Z\u2010section images were used for quantitative analysis, although Max\u2010Intensity\u2010Projection (MIP) images of Z\u2010series were presented in all figures unless stated otherwise. To detect foci of NBs, the threshold was set as 30 percentiles intensity to cut off pixels with intensity <30% of an intensity histogram of all pixels in an image with a size filer between 10 and 150 pixels in order. All results were checked visually and, in cases in which 30 percentiles did not sufficiently detect foci, the threshold value was changed manually. The distance threshold judged as \u201cco\u2010localizing\u201d was within 3 pixels (390\u00a0nm) between centers of foci in 3D. We analyzed cells that exhibited at least one PC, CB, HLB, SMN focus or TCAB1 focus.4.5. Western blottingCells were trypsinized, collected into 15\u2010ml tubes and washed twice in 10\u00a0ml PBS (\u2212). The cell density was counted and lysed in Laemmli buffer without dithiothreitol and bromophenol blue to yield 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0cells/ml. Whole\u2010cell lysates were heated at 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and stored at \u221230\u00b0C. Protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (297\u201073101, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical). After supplemented with dithiothreitol and bromophenol blue, and boiling at 95\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, whole lysates (50\u00a0\u03bcg to detect coilin or 90\u00a0\u03bcg to detect RPB1 and GFP) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (90\u00a0min at 20\u00a0mA constant currency per 85\u00a0mm height gel). Gels were gently shaken in Transfer buffer (100\u00a0mM Tris, 200\u00a0mM glycine and 5% methanol) for 10\u00a0min. Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (BSP0161, FluoroTrans W PVDF Transfer Membranes, Pall, NY, USA) were immersed in methanol for 3\u00a0min and equilibrated in Transfer buffer for 10\u00a0min with gentle shaking. Proteins on gels were transferred to membranes for 60\u00a0min at 150\u00a0mA (for coilin) or 250\u00a0mA (for RPB1) per 85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a090\u00a0mm membrane. After an incubation in Blocking One (03953\u201095, NACALAI TESQUE) for 20\u00a0min with gentle shaking, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Can Get Signal Solution I (NKB\u2010101, TOYOBO) overnight at 4\u00b0C (for coilin and GFP) or 2\u00a0hr at room temperature (for RPB1). After washed in TBS\u2010T (100\u00a0mM Tris\u2010HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween\u201020, 150\u00a0mM NaCl) for 20\u00a0min three times, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated secondary antibodies (80\u00a0ng/ml, AB_10015289, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in Can Get Signal Solution II (NKB\u2010101, TOYOBO) for 1\u00a0hr at room temperature. After membranes were washed in TBS\u2010T for 20\u00a0min three times, signals were developed using ImmunoStar LD (296\u201069901, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) and detected using a gel documentation system (LuminoGraph II, ATTO).
