IntroductionAs of July 1st, there had been 249,659 SARS-CoV-2 infections diagnosed in Spain, causing at least 28,363 deaths during the same period [1], and no effective therapy available. During the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 was controversial, based on data from influenza pneumonia and SARS-CoV-1 infection [2]. However, they were used in many cases, due to the lack of effective therapy for this entity. There was not enough knowledge about the different phases of the illness nor had there been time to generate scientific evidence on the safety and effectiveness of different potential treatments [3].Initially, drugs with presumed antiviral properties, such as hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir, were widely administered, but failed to demonstrate benefits [4]. Progressively, it became clear that elevation of inflammatory biomarkers and certain clinical features such as fever, pointed towards a hyper-inflammatory state. Based on this rationale, despite controversies, and in the absence of a better option, steroid treatment was considered to treat patients with COVID19 in many cases.The first studies that analyzed the role of steroid treatment in COVID-19 did not support their use, in some cases for fear of delayed viral clearance based on the previous scarce evidence with SARS and MERS [5,6]. However, when viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in patients who received corticosteroid treatment, there was no evidence of delayed viral clearance [7,8]. Furthermore, other single center studies suggested a positive impact of corticosteroids in mortality of patients with COVID-19 who needed supplementary oxygen [9,10].The results of the RECOVERY trial [11] suggest that treatment with dexamethasone is beneficial for patients with COVID-19 that present with hypoxemia, which motivated the change in the World Health Organization recommendations [12]. In the present study, we analyze real-world data with the aim of confirming the consistency of these findings in a large Spanish multicenter cohort. 2. Material/Patients and Methods2.1. Setting and Study DesignThe present observational study is based on the SEMI (Spanish Society of Internal Medicine)-COVID-19 Registry. This is an ongoing, nationwide multicenter anonymized online database of consecutive adult patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed pneumonia from 131 different Spanish hospitals.As described elsewhere [13], inclusion criteria for the registry were age \u2265 18 years and first hospital discharge with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Exclusion criteria were subsequent admissions of the same patient and denial or withdrawal of informed consent. Patients were cared for at their attending physician\u2019s discretion, according to local protocols and clinical judgment.A retrospective cohort study was designed to compare the differences in all-cause mortality between patients who received corticosteroids as part of the treatment for COVID-19 (independently of the dose, duration of the treatment and moment of initiation) and those who did not.2.2. Data CollectionThe registry includes epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiologic data extracted from electronic medical records. More in-depth information on the registry is available in previously published works [13].2.3. DefinitionsWe considered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients those with a microbiological confirmation by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of a respiratory sample. Exposure to corticosteroids was defined as the use of systemic corticosteroids at any time during the hospital admission. Different types of corticosteroids were considered (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisone). The effect of different doses or different corticosteroids is analyzed elsewhere (Lavilla-Olleros C. et al. in press).The main outcome variable was in-hospital mortality.The diagnosis and grading of ARDS was determined according to modified Berlin criteria [14] (in non-ventilated patients, the PEEP value in the modified criteria was not taken into consideration): mild: PaO2/FiO2 200\u2013300 mmHg (PEEP or CPAP \u2265 5 cmH2O, or non-ventilated); moderate: PaO2/FiO2 100\u2013200 (PEEP \u2265 5 cmH2O, or non-ventilated); severe: PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 100 mmHg (PEEP \u2265 5 cmH2O, or non-ventilated).2.4. Statistical AnalysisQuantitative variables were expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) and/or medians and interquartile ranges, and qualitative variables as frequencies and percentages. The association of baseline characteristics among the steroid and control cohorts with mortality was assessed through univariable conditional logistic regression to compute crude odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).To compare differences between survivors and non-survivors, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, X2 test, Fisher\u2019s exact test or Student t test were used where appropriate. To explore risk factors associated with in-hospital death, univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression models were used. Variables with a p < 0.05 in univariable analysis were selected into the multivariable.To reduce the effect of corticosteroid treatment selection bias and potential confounding, we adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics by a propensity score, which predicts the patient\u2019s probability of being treated with corticosteroids regardless of confounding factors, using multivariable logistic regression. Potential confounders considered in propensity score matching analysis were those variables included in the final model by means of stepwise backward elimination procedures. The effect of steroid treatment on clinical outcome was analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for major variables associated with mortality; the individual propensity score was incorporated into the model as a covariate, to calculate the propensity adjusted odds ratio (OR), as described elsewhere [10].All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS system (version 26.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The statistical significance level was set at a two-sided p value of <0.05. An odds ratio (OR) was reported along with 95% confidence interval (CI). 3. ResultsAs of July 2020, 14,921 patients were included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Among them, 5262 (35.26%) patients were treated with corticosteroids and 9659 (64.73%) patients were not (from now on, control cohort). Median time to corticosteroid treatment from symptoms onset was 10 days (IQR 7 to 14 days).3.1. Clinical CharacteristicsThe clinical characteristics of the steroid and control cohorts are shown in Table 1. There were significant differences between the group of patients who received steroid treatment and those who did not in all the baseline characteristics and laboratory findings considered relevant (including known poor prognosis risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, D-dimer or C-RP which were more prevalent or presented higher levels among those who received steroids), except for the total lymphocyte count, which showed no significant differences.Table 1Baseline characteristics of patients in the steroid and non-steroid complete cohort and in the propensity-matched cohort.\nComplete CohortPropensity Score Matched Cohort\nNon-Steroid TreatmentSteroid Treatmentp ValueNon-Steroid TreatmentSteroid Treatmentp ValueBaseline Characteristics and Underlying Medical ConditionsSex (Men, %)5208 (54.0%)3323 (63.2%)0.0001269 (55.1%)1011 (65.4%)0.000Age (mean, SD)65700.00067.870.50.000Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (mean)3.44.00.0003.74.20.000High blood pressure4590 (47.6%)2983 (56.8%)0.0001242 (53.9%)953 (61.5%)0.000Diabetes1724 (17.9%)1140 (21.7%)0.000471 (20.4%)370 (23.9%)0.011Acute coronary syndrome703 (7.3%)485 (9.2%)0.000193 (8.4%)162 (10.5%)0.028Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease516 (5.4%)388 (7.4%)0.000154 (6.7%)123 (7.9%)0.137Dyslipidemia3630 (37.7%)2272 (43.3%)0.000964 (41.8%)711 (45.9%)0.012COPD505 (5.2%)516 (9.8%)0.000170 (7.4%)199 (12.8%)0.000Stroke664 (6.9%)417 (7.9%)0.01968 (3.0%)43 (2.8%)0.750Obesity1657 (18.8%)1209 (25.3%)0.000543 (23.5%)464 (30.0%)0.000Leukemia93 (1.0%)86 (1.6%)0.00024 (1.0%)24 (1.5%)0.163Lymphoma120 (1.2%)92 (1.7)0.01332 (1.4%)27 (1.7%)0.378Hematologic disease211 (2.2%)175 (3.3%)0.00055 (2.4%)50 (3.2%)0.116Solid tumor with metastases218 (2.3%)105 (2.0%)0.29160 (2.6%)34 (2.2%)0.421Solid tumor without metastases581 (6.0%)351 (6.6%)0.119150 (6.5%)104 (6.7%)0.797Malignancy787 (8.2%)454 (8.6%)0.323208 (9%)137 (8.8%)0.848Moderate to severe liver disease90 (0.9%)58 (1.1%)0.31524 (1%)21 (1.4%)0.372Laboratory findings at admissionUrea (mg/dL)45.553.40.00049.155.70.000LDH (U/L)3544030.000385.58437.40.000C-reactive protein (mg/L)52.170.50.00094.1130.90.000Lymphocytes (per 106/L)1437.31169.40.0001150.61047.40.090D-Dimer (ng/mL)1607.32430.90.0001881.82563.40.076Interleukin-6 (pg/mL)47.0695.70.00053.8103.50.003Ferritin (mcg/L)750.51209.20.000801.41281.40.000Respiratory parametersSpO2/FiO2 at admission273.0203.80.000405.4375.60.000ARDS1082 (11.2%)1549 (29.6%)0.000597 (26.0%)928 (60.1%)0.000Open in a separate window3.2.

Mortality was higher in the subgroup of patients without ARDS who received steroid treatment (5% vs. 9.9%).Age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.481 (1.440\u20131.524), p = 0.000), low SpO2/FiO2 ratio at admission (OR 0.997 (0.996\u20130.998), p = 0.000), established ARDS at any point during the course of the disease 4.233 (3.958 to 4.527), p = 0.000), high values of LDH (OR 1.001 (1.000\u20131.001), p = 0.000) and high values of C-reactive protein (OR 1.002 (1.001 to 1.003), p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for mortality, whereas steroid treatment (OR 0.793 (0.7682\u20130.923), p = 0.003), Tocilizumab treatment (OR 0.458 (0.371 to 0.564), p = 0.001), Hydroxychloroquine treatment (OR 0.342( 0.281 to 0.416), p = 0.000) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment (OR 0.620 (0.533 to 0.723), p = 0.000) were independent protective factors.A propensity score for steroid treatment was developed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. The propensity score for steroid treatment included the following variables: hypertension, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, diabetes, onco-hematologic underlying disease, acute coronary syndrome, COPD, obesity, moderate-severe chronic kidney disease, SpO2/FiO2, lymphocyte, LDH and C-RP at admission. The propensity-score-matched cohort is displayed in Table 1.Table 3 shows the risk factors for mortality in both univariable and multivariable analyses, including those adjusted by the propensity score for steroid treatment. When adjusting these results including the propensity score as a covariate, the overall in-hospital mortality remained significantly lower in the steroid treatment group (OR 0.774 (0.660 to 0.907), p = 0.002). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 24% relative to no steroid treatment (RRR 0.24).Table 3Risk factors for mortality in both univariable and multivariable analyses (including a multivariable analysis including the propensity score for steroid treatment as a covariate).\nUnivariable AnalysisMultivariable AnalysisMultivariable Adjusted with Propensity ScoreN = 14.921OR (95% CI)p ValueOR (95% CI)p ValueOR (95% CI)p ValueBasal characteristics and underlying medical conditionsSex (Women)0.756 (0.697\u20130.821)0.000\n\n\n\nAge1.088 (1.084\u20131.092)0.000\n\n\n\nAge-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index1.445 (1.420\u20131.470)0.0001.481 (1.440\u20131.524)0.0001.440 (1.397\u20131.485)0.000High blood pressure2.824 (2.592\u20133.076)0.000\n\n\n\nDiabetes1.972 (1.799\u20132.163)0.000\n\n\n\nIschemic heart disease2.470 (2.179\u20132.800)0.000\n\n\n\nModerate to severe chronic kidney disease3.184 (2.772\u20133.656)0.000\n\n\n\nDyslipidemia1758 (1.623\u20131.905)0.000\n\n\n\nCOPD2.441 (2.135\u20132.791)0.000\n\n\n\nIctus2.754 (2.420\u20133.315)0.000\n\n\n\nObesity1.133 (1.024\u20131.254)0.016\n\n\n\nOnco-hematologic2.128 (1.900\u20132.384)0.000\n\n\n\nHematologic disease2.687 (2.183\u20133.306)0.000\n\n\n\nLeukemia2.713 (2.008\u20133.665)0.000\n\n\n\nLymphoma2.693 (2.042\u20133.553)0.000\n\n\n\nSolid tumor with metastases1.688 (1.326\u20132.148)0.000\n\n\n\nSolid tumor without metastases1.922 (1.664\u20132.219)0.000\n\n\n\nModerate to severe liver disease1.596 (1.117\u20132.282)0.010\n\n\n\nLaboratory findings at admissionUrea (mg/dL)1.022 (1.021\u20131.023)0.000\n\n\n\nLDH (U/L)1.003 (1.0020\u20131.003)0.0001.001 (1.000\u20131.001)0.0001.000 (1.000\u20131.001)0.005C-reactive protein (mg/L)1.006 (1.005\u20131.006)0.0001.002 (1.001\u20131.003)0.0001.000 (0.999\u20131.002)0.526Lymphocytes (per 106/L)1.00 (1.00\u20131.00)0.436\n\n\n\nD-Dimer (ng/mL)1.00 (1.00\u20131.00)0.000\n\n\n\nInterleukin-6 (pg/mL)1.001 (1.001\u20131.002)0.000\n\n\n\nFerritin (mcg/L)1.000 (1.000\u20131.000)0.000\n\n\n\nRespiratory parametersSatO2/FiO2 (SD)0.991 (0.991\u20130.992)0.0000.997 (0.996\u20130.998)0.0000.998 (0.997\u20130.999)0.000ARDS14.845 (13.444\u201316.393)0.0004.233 (3.958\u20134.527)0.0004.299 (3.393\u20134.540)0.000Treatments administeredSteroid treatment2.068 (1.908\u20132.242)0.0000.793 (0.682\u20130.923)0.0030.774 (0.660\u20130.907)0.002Hydroxychloroquine0.386 (0.349\u20130.426)0.0000.342 (0.281\u20130.416)0.000\n\nLopinavir/Ritonavir0.626 (0.578\u20130.679)0.0000.620 (0.533\u20130.723)0.0000.636 (0.542\u20130.747)0.000Interferon2.031 (1.816\u20132.271)0.000\n\n\n\nTocilizumab1.294 (1.130\u20131.481)0.0000.458 (0.371\u20130.564)0.0010.476 (0.383\u20130.592)0.000Anakinra1.587 (1.004\u20132.507)0.048\n\n\n\nOpen in a separate window 4. DiscussionIn the present study, we observed that patients with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia with established acute respiratory distress syndrome who received corticosteroids as part of their treatment had 24% inferior in-hospital mortality than those who did not.Although retrospective studies on steroid effect on COVID-19 mortality are discordant, our results are consistent with those reported in the RECOVERY trial. Other retrospective studies support these results [9,10].Interestingly, as reported in the RECOVERY trial, steroid treatment did not show a beneficial effect on patients who did not require oxygen, on the contrary, mortality in this subset was higher than in the non-steroid treatment group [11]. This can be at least partly explained by the characteristics of the patients who received steroids, who presented a higher prevalence of dismal prognostic factors such as hypertension, obesity or diabetes among others and higher levels of biomarkers associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (D-dimer, C-RP). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that in some cases steroid could have been administered too early, during the viral phase of the disease, which has been associated with worse outcomes [15,16]. In addition, corticosteroids are not exempt of adverse effects, in particular when given at high-dose, and in patients without severe involvement the risk-benefit ratio may not be favorable.Furthermore, our results suggest that the greater the respiratory failure, the larger the impact on mortality of the steroid treatment. These results are in accordance with the physiopathology of ARDS in COVID-19 which is based in the exuberant inflammatory response in the lungs [17].The only corticosteroid tested in the RECOVERY trial was dexamethasone, at 6 mg per day [11]. In the present study, different corticosteroids at different dosage regimens were used. This real-life use of diverse corticosteroids in COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with COVID-19 that fulfilled ARDS criteria. Dexamethasone doses in the RECOVERY trial are equivalent to medium prednisone doses. It is a matter of controversy whether higher doses or even pulses would present better results in COVID-19 (Lavilla-Olleros C et al. in press) [18]. However, some authors believe that viral clearance could be affected by high dose corticosteroids, but not by low-dose [19]; consequently, this must be taken into consideration when analyzing different doses of steroid treatment for COVID-19.The major strength of the present study was the great number of patients included, and being a multicenter registry with a highly heterogeneous population (as there were no exclusion criteria), which we believe provides real-life results, generalizable to other populations.Limitations of the present study are those typical of retrospective studies, including the occasional missing data. Unfortunately, the precise moment of developing ARDS criteria relative to symptoms onset or corticosteroid administration was not appropriately registered, as was neither the exact corticosteroid used in each case, limiting the subgroup analysis. To overcome selection bias, we developed a propensity score for steroid treatment from the baseline characteristics of patients, and performed an adjusted analysis.Our real-life results support evidence from clinical trials in favor of the use of steroid treatment in patients with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia and established ARDS. The ideal dosage and the optimal moment in the course of the disease require further investigation. Future studies should address as well whether steroid treatment has a class effect in COVID-19 or is specific for some drugs, and determine if synergies with other anti-inflammatory or antiviral drugs exist.
