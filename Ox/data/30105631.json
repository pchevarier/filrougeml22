{"title": "Lysine-specific demethylase 1 cooperates with BRAF-histone deacetylase complex 80 to enhance HIV-1 Tat-mediated transactivation", "pubDate": "2018", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s11262-018-1589-5", "PMID": "30105631", "abstract": "Despite the notable success of combination antiretroviral therapy, how to eradicate latent HIV-1 from reservoirs poses a challenge. The Tat protein plays an indispensable role in HIV reactivation and histone demethylase LSD1 promotes Tat-mediated long terminal repeats (LTR) activation. However, the role of LSD1 in remodeling chromatin and the role of its component BHC80 in activation of latent HIV-1 in T cells are unknown. Our findings indicate that LSD1 could decrease the level of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the HIV-1 promoter by recruiting histone lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) and preventing histone methyltransferase Set1A and WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5) from binding to LTR. Moreover, BHC80 is necessary for LSD1-triggered LTR activation and assists LSD1 in activating LTR by binding to nucleotides 305-631 of LTR. In activated J-Lat-A2 cells, BHC80 expression was elevated and its isoform BHC80-6 promoted the association of BHC80 with LSD1. These results suggest that the LSD1-BHC80 complex enhances HIV-1 transcription by a decrease of H3K4me3 level at the viral promoter. Therefore, it might be used as a new drug target to reactivate latent HIV-1.", "author": [{"author": "Yu Liu", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Liu+Y&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Deyu Zhou", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Zhou+D&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Di Qi", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Qi+D&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Jiabin Feng", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Feng+J&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Zhou Liu", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Liu+Z&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Yue Hu", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Hu+Y&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Wenyuan Shen", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Shen+W&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Chang Liu", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China."], "href": "/?term=Liu+C&cauthor_id=30105631"}, {"author": "Xiaohong Kong", "affiliation": ["Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Medicine, Nankai University, 94 Weijin Road, Nankai District, Tianjin, 300071, China. kongxh@nankai.edu.cn."], "href": "/?term=Kong+X&cauthor_id=30105631"}], "refPMID": ["14657027", "8945521", "28878233", "27671333", "26645689", "26423811", "28262558", "24620025", "25393648", "28689087", "24907868", "22837004", "20335163", "19265012", "10199401", "17512414", "22355797", "17245431", "16079795", "26832332", "15325272", "17392792", "21164480", "22067449", "16140033", "21715480", "29140109", "3031512", "21876670", "15620353", "25561738", "21596603", "24002202", "17687328", "12032298", "23795863", "17079683", "25482560", "8999795", "18270511", "18838538", "14701750", "7752225", "26886794", "27470028", "15680324", "19855399", "17245432", "18292755"], "citedInPMID": ["30105631", "30885676"], "body": ""}
