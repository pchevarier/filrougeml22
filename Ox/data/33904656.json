The anti\u2010inflammatory adipokine adiponectin has been speculated to play a role in COVID\u201019 respiratory failure (Lockhart & O'Rahilly, 2020), but only one study has examined adiponectin levels in patients with COVID\u201019 (Zelst et al., 2020). No studies have examined adiponectin levels strictly in patients with COVID\u201019 acute respiratory failure. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODSWe included all patients with COVID\u201019 respiratory failure who consented to donate blood samples to the University of Virginia (UVA) Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Biorepository. We then selected patients with non\u2010COVID\u201019 respiratory failure (i.e., due to other viral or bacterial infections) in the UVA ICU Biorepository to serve as a comparison cohort. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines and our study complied with all principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All study protocols were approved by the UVA Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research (Protocol #21101). Respiratory failure was defined as patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome using Berlin criteria (Force et al., 2012) who were on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. COVID\u201019 diagnoses were confirmed by RealTime SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 assay (Abbott Molecular Inc.; Des Plaines, IL). Plasma samples for adipokines were obtained on ICU admission and then 24 and 72\u00a0hr later. Human adipokine (i.e., adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, lipocalin\u20102, and plasminogen activator\u2010inhibitor\u20101 (PAI\u20101)) levels in plasma were measured using the Milliplex Human Adipokine Magnetic Bead Panel 1 kit (Millipore Sigma; Burlington, Massachusetts) following manufacturer's protocol. Plasma samples were prepared at a 1:400 dilution. If analytes were found to be above the linear range, samples were run again with a 1:40,000 dilution. Hour 0, 24, and 72 adipokine measurements were analyzed on the natural logarithmic scale as repeated measures by way of linear mixed models. Hypothesis testing, with respect to comparing the measurement distributions of the aforementioned list of outcome variables between the COVID\u201019 and other infectious respiratory failure cohorts, was conducted in a hierarchical manner. For each outcome variable, a global null hypothesis test was first conducted to test the null hypothesis that independent of the hour of blood draw, the geometric mean of the COVID\u201019 respiratory failure cohort outcome variable measurement distribution did not differ from the geometric mean of the other infectious respiratory failure outcome variable measurement distributions. If the global null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 significance level, then a second set of hypothesis tests were conducted to identify at what hour of blood draw the geometric mean of the COVID\u201019 respiratory failure outcome variable measurement distribution differed from the geometric mean of the other infectious respiratory failure outcome variable distribution at the 0.05 significance level. Results were adjusted for the following covariates: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), preexisting diabetes mellitus, enteral nutrition, glucocorticoid therapy, total insulin, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.4 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). 3.\u2003RESULTSIn total, twenty\u2010nine patients were included in this study. Table \u200bTable11 provides descriptive statistics for subjects in both the COVID\u201019 (n\u00a0=\u00a012) and the non\u2010COVID\u201019 (n\u00a0=\u00a017) infectious respiratory failure cohorts. Notably, the two cohorts were generally similar in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes. For the non\u2010COVID\u201019 acute respiratory failure group, infectious diagnoses included presumed bacterial pneumonia (n\u00a0=\u00a08), presumed hospital\u2010acquired pneumonia (n\u00a0=\u00a01), presumed healthcare\u2010associated pneumonia (n\u00a0=\u00a01), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n\u00a0=\u00a01), influenza A (n\u00a0=\u00a04), parainfluenza (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and human metapneumovirus (n\u00a0=\u00a01).TABLE 1Baseline demographic characteristics and clinical outcome data for study cohorts.

Adipsin, resistin, lipocalin\u20102, and PAI\u20101 did not significantly differ between groups at any single time point or globally over the 72\u00a0hr of evaluation. Conversely, adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the COVID\u201019 cohort over the 72\u00a0hr of evaluation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), as well as being significantly lower at Hour 0 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031) and Hour 72 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Adiponectin levels remained significantly lower in those with COVID\u201019 after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, pre\u2010existing diabetes mellitus, enteral nutrition, glucocorticoid therapy, total insulin, APACHE II score, and SOFA score (Figure \u200b(Figure11).TABLE 2Daily and global geometric mean ratios for measured adipokines.

Interestingly, adiponectin levels were significantly lower in patients with COVID\u201019 respiratory failure than in patients with other forms of infectious respiratory failure, and this remained true even after adjustment for multiple covariates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of adiponectin levels in COVID\u201019 ICU patients with acute respiratory failure. van Zelst et al. recently investigated adiponectin levels on emergency room admission in a small subset of patients with and without COVID\u201019 (Zelst et al., 2020). They found no difference in admission adiponectin levels between COVID\u201019 negative and COVID\u201019 positive patients, but adiponectin was only measured at one time point and the cohort mostly consisted of patients who did not require intubation. Caterino et al. recently evaluated adiponectin levels in 53 patients with COVID\u201019 infection and found that adiponectin levels were higher in those with severe infection compared to mild or moderate infection, though the difference between the three subgroups was not statistically significant (Caterino et al., 2021).Adipose tissue is a dynamic endocrine organ with the ability to produce numerous signaling molecules (i.e., adipokines) that impact whole\u2010body metabolism. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokine in human plasma, and numerous studies demonstrate its anti\u2010inflammatory, antioxidative, and insulin\u2010sensitizing effects (Choi et al., 2020). Obese patients have lower circulating levels of adiponectin (Arita et al., (1999)), and this has been hypothesized to play a role in the poor COVID\u201019 outcomes observed in this population (Lockhart & O'Rahilly, 2020). Pre\u2010clinical studies demonstrate that adiponectin has an anti\u2010inflammatory function in lung cells (Garcia & Sood, 2012). Furthermore, adiponectin\u2010deficient mice develop inflammation of the pulmonary vasculature (Summer et al., 2009) and are predisposed to experimental acute lung injury (Konter et al., 2012). These findings suggest that the hypoadiponectinemia frequently seen in obesity could facilitate an exaggerated inflammatory response directed to the pulmonary capillaries (Lockhart & O'Rahilly, 2020).In the current study, COVID\u201019 respiratory failure was associated with significantly reduced adiponectin levels even after adjustment for BMI. These results indicate that COVID\u201019 may independently reduce adiponectin in those with respiratory failure, and if true, this holds specific implications for patients with hypoadiponectinemia at baseline (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, etc.). Alternatively, it could suggest that patients with low adiponectin levels are more prone to develop COVID\u201019 respiratory failure.Some reports suggest potential therapeutic benefit of peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor\u2010\u03b3 agonists (e.g., pioglitazone) and interleukin\u20106 receptor monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab) in COVID\u201019 patients (Carboni et al., 2020). Interestingly, pioglitazone and tocilizumab each increase circulating levels of adiponectin (Fioravanti et al., 2019; Shimizu et al., 2006). A recent preliminary report from the REMAP\u2010CAP Investigators found that, in adult ICU patients with COVID\u201019 receiving organ support, treatment with the interleukin\u20106 receptor monoclonal antibodies tocilizumab and sarilumab improved outcomes (including survival) compared to standard care (Gordon et al., 2021). Other studies with tocilizumab, however, have shown equivocal results (Veiga et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021). We now await final results from the numerous clinical trials currently evaluating the efficacy of pioglitazone and tocilizumab as potential COVID\u201019 therapies.Strengths of this study include serial measurement of adipokine levels over 72\u00a0hr and comparing COVID\u201019 respiratory failure patients to patients with respiratory failure of other infectious etiology. There are several major limitations of this study that should also be noted, including its small sample size. Another limitation is that we restricted our study to only critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Adiponectin levels in COVID\u201019 patients with more mild pulmonary disease may differ, so our findings should not be generalized to those whom are not critically ill. Finally, there was no formal matching on demographic/anthropometric variables between cohorts. While the two cohorts were generally similar, the lack of formal matching does warrant caution when interpreting our results. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONWe conclude that adiponectin levels are reduced in patients with COVID\u201019 respiratory failure, even after adjustment for multiple covariates. Larger studies are needed to confirm this report, and we await further work regarding possible therapeutic implications.
