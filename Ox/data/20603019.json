By genetic studies in the zebrafish tif1\u03b3 mutant moonshine we found that loss of function of Pol II-associated factors PAF or DSIF rescued erythroid gene transcription in tif1\u03b3-deficient animals. Biochemical analysis established physical interactions among TIF1\u03b3, the blood-specific SCL transcription complex, and the positive elongation factors p-TEFb and FACT. ChIP assays in human CD34+ cells supported a TIF1\u03b3-dependent recruitment of positive elongation factors to erythroid genes to promote transcription elongation by counteracting Pol II pausing. Our study establishes a mechanism for regulating tissue cell fate and differentiation through transcription elongation. IntroductionVertebrate hematopoiesis defines an evolutionarily conserved hierarchy in which self-renewing hematopietic stem cells (HSCs) progressively differentiate into multi-lineage blood cells (Orkin and Zon, 2008). Forward genetic screens in zebrafish have identified many mutants affecting the erythroid lineage (Ransom et al., 1996; Weinstein et al., 1996). We previously characterized the defective gene in moonshine (mon), a mutant with a profound anemia and embryonic lethality (Ransom et al., 1996). mon gene encodes the zebrafish ortholog of Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1gamma (tif1\u03b3) (Ransom et al., 2004), a ubiquitously expressed gene that is highly enriched in blood tissues. The primitive erythroid lineage is normally specified in mon mutants but rapidly lost in developing embryos. Rare adult mon survivors (~1/500) are extremely anemic, suggesting an essential function of tif1\u03b3 in definitive erythropoiesis as well (Ransom et al., 2004).The four members in TIF1 family, TIF1\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4, are nuclear proteins composed of multiple evolutionarily conserved domains implicated in protein-protein interaction and chromatin association, including an N-terminal RBCC or TRIM domain, and the C-terminal PHD finger and bromodomain (Khetchoumian et al., 2004). At the molecular level, TIF1\u03b1 and \u03b2 function as transcription cofactors for nuclear hormone receptors and KRAB zinc-finger transcription factors, respectively (Friedman et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1996; Le Douarin et al., 1996). In contrast, the molecular function of TIF1\u03b3 remains controversial. He et al found that TIF1\u03b3 mediates TGF\u03b2 signaling by interacting with phosphorylated Smad2/3 (He et al., 2006), whereas Dupont et al showed that TIF1\u03b3 inhibits TGF\u03b2/BMP signaling by monoubiquitinating Smad4 (Dupont et al., 2009; Dupont et al., 2005).Hematopoietic gene expression has been extensively studied at the transcription initiation step that is controlled by cell-specific transcription complexes composed of SCL, LMO2, GATA1, and many other cofactors (Meier et al., 2006; Schuh et al., 2005; Wadman et al., 1997). In addition to transcription initiation, recent genome-wide studies have discovered a commonly occurred pausing/stalling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotic genomes, suggesting transcription elongation as a critical step in gene regulation (Guenther et al., 2007; Muse et al., 2007; Zeitlinger et al., 2007). Studies on transcription elongation have shown that both negative and positive factors regulate elongation. Negative elongation factors DSIF (DRB Sensitivity Inducing Factor) and NELF (Negative Elongation Factor) stall Pol II at the proximal promoter (Wu et al., 2003; Yamaguchi et al., 2002), whereas the positive elongation factor p-TEFb is required to release paused Pol II by phosphorylating the CTD domain of Pol II (Cheng and Price, 2007; Peterlin and Price, 2006). Pol II elongation is tightly linked to chromatin modification. The PAF complex (Pol II Associated Factor) associates with the elongating Pol II and recruits enzymes for histone 2B ubiquitination (Pokholok et al., 2002; Wood et al., 2003). The histone chaperone FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex is required for nucleosome assembly during Pol II elongation and also facilitates the recruitment of p-TEFb (Saunders et al., 2003; Wada et al., 2000). Regulation of Pol II elongation has also been implicated in blood gene expression. Sawado et al found that the locus control region (LCR) of murine \u03b2-globin gene regulates the transition from the transcription initiation to elongation (Sawado et al., 2003). A study from Elagib et al suggested an involvement of p-TEFb in megakaryocyte differentiation (Elagib et al., 2008).In an effort to understand the role of TIF1\u03b3 in regulating erythropoiesis, we undertook a genetic modifier screen to look for suppressor mutants that could bypass TIF1\u03b3 and rescue the erythroid defect in mon mutants. One suppressor mutant, sunrise, has a mutation in cdc73 gene, which encodes a subunit of the elongation factor PAF. Genetic studies revealed a functional antagonism between TIF1\u03b3 and PAF/DSIF elongation factors in regulating erythroid gene expression. Biochemical studies in human cells demonstrated a direct link between TIF1\u03b3 and the transcription elongation machinery and supported a model in which TIF1\u03b3 couples the blood-specific transcriptional complex with Pol II elongation machinery to promote the transcription elongation of erythroid genes by counteracting Pol II pausing. Our study illustrates a critical developmental checkpoint in which cell-specific transcription factors interacts with the elongation machinery to regulate cell fate. ResultsGenetic suppressor screen in the zebrafish moonshine (mon) mutantIn order to identify genetic pathways interacting with TIF1\u03b3 during hematopoiesis, we conducted a genetic modifier screen to identify suppressor mutants that rescue the blood defect in mon embryos. The vast majority of mon homozygous fish die at 7~10 days post fertilization (dpf), making it difficult to perform a genetic screen. Therefore we created a viable mon homozygous line using a BAC transgene (Figure1A). This 168kb zebrafish BAC clone contains the entire tif1\u03b3 gene locus. A GFP marker driven by the \u03b2-actin promoter was recombined onto the backbone of BAC. After establishing stable transgenic lines, we confirmed that a single copy of the transgene could fully rescue mon homozygous fish to adulthood with normal blood development.Open in a separate windowFigure1Genetic suppressor screen in the mon mutantA) Scheme of generating viable mon transgenic fish using a BAC transgene.B) Scheme of the suppressor screen. BAC transgenic fish are green fluorescent. In F1 generation, three groups of embryos were obtained: transgene homozygous (mon; Tg/Tg), transgene heterozygous (mon; Tg/+), and embryos with no transgene (mon). Only transgene heterozygous (in the red circle) were raised up to adults. Double in situ hybridization of GFP and \u03b2e3 globin was performed on F2 haploid embryos. Note the GFP staining on mon; Tg haploids (strong in the head and weak throughout the body) but not on haploids lacking the transgene. \u201csup\u201d indicates a suppressor mutation.C) Morphology of the sunrise mutant at 48hpf.D) In situ hybridization of \u03b2e3 globin at 22hpf. See also Figure S1.Using this transgenic line, we undertook a haploid screen to identify suppressor mutants (Figure1B). ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mutagenesis was performed on males that were homozygous for mon and carried one copy of the transgene (mon; Tg{Tif1\u03b3+; \u03b2actin:GFP}/+). F1 females were used to produce haploid embryos that were subjected to double in situ hybridization for GFP and \u03b2e3 globin at 22 hpf (hours post fertilization). During the screen, most F1 females did not carry suppressor mutations and gave rise to embryo clutches that contain only double positive (GFP+; \u03b2e3+) and double negative (GFP\u2212; \u03b2e3\u2212) embryos. If a female carried a suppressor mutation that could restore \u03b2e3 globin expression in the absence of tif1\u03b3 transgene, it would give rise to double mutant embryos (mon; sup) that were GFP negative but globin positive (GFP\u2212; \u03b2e3+). This female would be outcrossed to recover mutations in suppressor genes.Using this strategy, we screened about 800 haploid genomes and identified two recessive suppressor mutants. One of the mutants is named sunrise (sun), which is an embryonic lethal mutant with distinctive morphologic phenotypes (Figure 1C). As shown in Figure 1D, the sun mutant by itself has normal \u03b2e3 globin expression at 22hpf but greatly restores \u03b2e3 expression in mon mutants. Benzidine staining confirmed that hemoglobin production was also partially rescued in mon; sun double mutants (Figure S1).The defective gene in sunrise was mapped to the cdc73 locusBy positional cloning we mapped the sun gene to chromosome 2 between microsatellite makers z19387 and z13475 (Figure 2A). This region contains a gene named cdc73, which is a subunit of the PAF complex. We noticed that the morphology of the sun mutant is very similar to the rtf1\u2212/\u2212 mutant (Figure 2B), another subunit in the PAF complex, including severely reduced body melanocytes, small ears, impaired blood circulation and profound pericardial edema. Sequencing of the cdc73 gene in the sun mutant identified a C to T transition at +1507 in the coding region that leads to a premature stop codon after amino acid 502 (Figure 2C). This mutation is predicted to cause a truncated protein missing the last 19 amino acids that are highly conserved from Drosophila to human (Figure 2D). The western blot showed a complete loss of CDC73 protein in sun mutants (Figure 2E), indicating that the truncated protein is unstable and sun is a null mutant of cdc73.Open in a separate windowFigure 2The defective gene in sunrise is cdc73A) The sunrise locus was mapped on chromosome 2 between the microsatellite marker z19837 and z13475. The cdc73 gene is located within this region.B) The morphology of wild type, sun mutant and rtf1\u2212/\u2212 mutant at 36hpf.

Red asterisk: zebrafish CDC73 (~64kD). Black asterisk: non-specific bands. Actin is used as a loading control.F) Morpholino (MO)-mediated knockdown of cdc73 completely rescues globin expression in mon (22 out of 22 embryos), whereas 5-bp mismatch control morpholino has no rescue (0 out of 13 embryos)We further confirmed that injection of wildtype cdc73 mRNA completely rescued sun mutants (Figure 2B), whereas an antisense morpholino of cdc73 not only phenocopied the sun mutant (data not shown), but effectively rescued \u03b2e3 expression in mon embryos (Figure 2F). In contrast, a control morpholino with five base-pair mismatches failed to rescue mon. These results demonstrate that the defective gene in the sun mutant is cdc73.TIF1\u03b3 and PAF antagonistically regulate blood gene expressionCDC73 is a component of the PAF complex that also contains PAF1, RTF1, LEO1 and CTR9 (Mueller and Jaehning, 2002). To test if other PAF components have similar rescue activity, antisense morpholinos targeting paf1 or ctr9 were injected into mon embryos. Knocking down these PAF subunits caused a sun-like morphological phenotype (data not shown), and rescued \u03b2e3 expression in mon (Figure 3A, iv & v). The rtf1\u2212/\u2212 genetic mutant also rescued globin expression in mon (Figure 3A, iii). These data suggest that TIF1\u03b3 antagonizes the whole PAF complex during blood development.Open in a separate windowFigure 3TIF1\u03b3 and PAF antagonistically regulates erythroid gene expressionA) In situ hybridization of \u03b2e3 showing rescue of mon by depleting other PAF subunits.

Left: heat map of 243 erythroid signature genes. Right: a close-up look of average fold change of top 20% (a) and bottom 20% genes (b) from the heat map on the left. All microarray data have been deposited in the NCBI\u2019s GEO database under the accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20432\",\"term_id\":\"20432\"}}GSE20432. See also Fig S2.We next examined the gene expression profiles in tif1\u03b3- and cdc73-deficient cells. To focus on blood-specific targets, we used gata1:GFP transgenic fish, in which all erythroid cells are labeled with GFP therefore can be isolated by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) (Long et al., 1997). Morpholinos targeted to tif1\u03b3 or cdc73 were injected into gata1:GFP embryos. GFP+ cells were isolated at the 12ss (somite stage) for RNA extraction (Figure 3B). Quantitative RT-PCR showed downregulation of several blood-specific genes in tif1\u03b3-deficient cells, but their expression was greatly restored by knocking down cdc73 simultaneously (Figure 3C). Microarray analyses revealed that among the 243 erythroid-signature genes that are enriched in gata1:GFP+ cells (Weber G and Zon L, unpublished data), many genes were oppositely regulated by tif1\u03b3 and cdc73, and the deregulated genes in tif1\u03b3-deficient cells are largely restored in double-knockdown cells (Figure 3D). Notably, one of the genes regulated by tif1\u03b3 is scl, the master regulator of hematopoiesis. We therefore tested if overexpression of scl could rescue mon. Injection of scl mRNA clearly increased blood formation in wild type embryos but does little in mon mutants (Figure S2A), suggesting a more direct and broad function of tif1\u03b3 in erythropoiesis.Using quantitative RT-PCR, we also tested other tissue-specific genes by selecting 5-8 representative genes for each tissue. The tissues we tested include myeloid cells, muscle, heart and kidney. We did not see obvious antagonistic regulation of these genes by tif1\u03b3 and cdc73 (data not shown). Among the oppositely regulated genes, genome-wide gene ontology analysis revealed the enrichment of several pathways, including BMP signaling pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway (Figure S2B).TIF1\u03b3 deficiency reduces the full-length transcript level of blood genesThe PAF complex is involved in multiple steps during transcription, including histone 2B ubiquitination, transcription elongation and mRNA 3\u2032 end processing and polyadenylation (Penheiter et al., 2005; Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2009; Sheldon et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2003). To determine which function of PAF contributes to the mon-rescuing effect, we used morpholinos to knock down factors known to interact with PAF during these processes. Rad6 is an E2 ligase for H2B ubiquitination and known to be recruited by PAF. We found that knockdown of the zebrafish Rad6 homologs Rad6A and Rad6B failed to rescue globin expression in mon (Figure 4A). Similarly, knockdown of multiple factors essential for 3\u2032 RNA processing, including CPSF2, CPSF3 and CstF2, also failed to rescue mon (Figure 4A). Western blot analysis demonstrated near-complete knockdown of these proteins (Figure S3). These results suggest pathways other than H2B ubiquitination and 3\u2032 RNA processing are likely to be responsible for rescuing mon upon losing PAF function.Open in a separate windowFigure4tif1\u03b3-deficiency reduces the level of full-length transcripts of blood genesA) Morpholino knockdown of Rad6 and mRNA processing factors could not rescue \u03b2e3 globin expression in mon. In situ hybridization of \u03b2e3 globin was performed at 22hpf. See also Figure S3.B) Top: A schematic diagram showing the position of primers used in real-time RT-PCR analyses. Primers for the 5\u2032 transcripts are located within 120bp from transcription start site (TSS), and primers for the 3\u2032 transcripts are in the 3\u2032 coding region or 3\u2032UTR. Bottom: real-time RT-PCR analyses to compare the level of 5\u2032 (light pink and light blue) and 3\u2032 (dark pink and dark blue) transcripts of selected genes between wildtype cells and morpholino knockdown cells.

Results are shown as average fold change (mean \u00b1 SD) from three independent experiments, normalized to the level of the 5\u2032 transcript of \u03b2-actin.C) TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73 share common gene targets.

Results were normalized to the background level that was determined by ChIP without antibody. An inactive gene TRO (tropinin) was used as the negative control. The results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.E) Real-time RT-PCR to compare erythroid gene expression between uninfected and infected CD34+ cells with indicated shRNA constructs. EV: empty vector. Data are represented as fold change relative to expression levels in uninfected cells. The results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments.PAF is thought to promote transcription by positively regulating elongation, yet our results suggested a negative role of PAF on blood gene expression. To test if loss of tif1\u03b3 or cdc73 can potentially affect transcription elongation of blood genes, we measured the level of transcripts at the 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032 end of blood genes, including gata1, scl, \u03b2e3 and a red-cell membrane protein epb4.1 using quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 4B). We detected similar level of the 5\u2032 transcripts between wildtype and tif1\u03b3-deficient cells. In contrast, the PCR products from the 3\u2032 blood transcripts were dramatically decreased in tif1\u03b3-deficient cells (Figure 4B). This result could be explained by inefficient Pol II elongation that leads to reduced level of full-length transcripts, although this approach mainly measures the steady state levels of RNA that are probably released from the Pol II. Surprisingly, depletion of cdc73 greatly restored the level of the 3\u2032 blood transcripts (Figure 4B), suggesting a negative role of PAF in producing full-length blood transcripts.TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73 share common blood gene targetsTo determine if TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73 exert their antagonistic roles by directly binding to blood genes, we performed a small-scale ChIP-Chip analysis for TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73 in K562 human erythroleukemia cells using the Genome Tiling 2.0R Array C. We identified 313 genes bound by TIF1\u03b3 and 233 genes bound by CDC73, respectively (Figure 4C). In total 129 genes are bound by TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73, including several blood-specific genes: gata1, gata2, runx1 and alas2 (Figure 4C and data not shown). We further confirmed the binding of TIF1\u03b3 and CDC73 on these blood genes in proerythroblasts differentiated from primary human CD34+ cells (Figure 4D). Furthermore, knocking down TIF1\u03b3 by shRNA in CD34+ cells reduced the expression of multiple erythroid genes and severely blocked erythroid differentiation in vitro (Figure 4E). Two different TIF1\u03b3-shRNA constructs showed similar effects and both efficiently knockdown TIF1\u03b3 at both the protein level and the mRNA level (Figure 4E and data not shown). These results demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved function of TIF1\u03b3 in eryrthropoiesis.The function of PAF-associated elongation factors in zebrafish erythropoiesisAs an elongation factor, PAF has been shown to functionally interact with other elongation factors, including DSIF, FACT and p-TEFb (Qiu et al., 2006; Squazzo et al., 2002). To test if these factors also play specific roles in hematopoiesis, we knocked down these PAF-associated elongation factors in zebrafish embryos by morpholinos. Knockdown of FACT subunits SPT16 and SSRP1 diminished globin expression at 22hpf (Figure 5A, ii), suggesting that FACT is required for primitive erythropoiesis. In contrast to a previous study showing that p-TEFb is not required for primitive hematopoiesis (Meier et al., 2006), we found that knockdown of CDK9, the kinase subunit in p-TEFb, disrupted primitive erythropoiesis (Figure 5A, iii). In addition, treating embryos with flavopiridol, a chemical inhibitor of CDK9 (Chao and Price, 2001), also inhibited blood formation (Figure 5A, iv) but left other mesoderm tissues relatively intact (Figure S4). Moreover, flavopiridol treatment also blocked erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells, as shown by benzidine staining in Figure 5B. Taken together, these results establish that elongation factors FACT and p-TEFb positively regulate erythropoiesis.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Effects of FACT, p-TEFb and DSIF on erythropoiesisA) Reduced erythropoiesis by inhibiting FACT and p-TEFb. In situ hybridization of \u03b2e3 was performed on 22hpf zebrafish embryos treated with morpholino injection (ii & iii) or 35uM flavopiridol (iv). See also Figure S4.B) Flavopiridol treatment blocks erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells. Cells were harvested at d11 after differentiation (close to terminal differentiation stage), stained for benzidine (brown) and counter-stained with May-Grunwald (blue).C) Similar morphology of sun mutants and spt5 morphants at 36hpf.D) Rescue of mon mutants by spt5 morpholino and mutants, shown by in situ hybridization of \u03b2e3 globin at 22hpf. Note the rescue efficiency was 100% in each case (ii, iii and iv).In contrast to FACT and p-TEFb, morpholino-knockdown of DSIF subunit SPT5 phenocopied the morphology of sun mutants (Figure 5C), suggesting that DSIF and PAF have similar functions in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, depletion of spt5 effectively rescued \u03b2e3 expression in mon (Figure 5D, ii). To verify the morpholino results, we crossed mon into the spt5s30 mutant that harbors a deletion of the spt5 gene (Keegan et al., 2002). Blood was also rescued in mon; spt5s30 double mutants (Figure 5D, iii). These results suggest that both DSIF and PAF play negative roles on blood gene expression and TIF1\u03b3 is required to antagonize their function.DSIF has been shown to play dual roles during transcription elongation (Krishnan et al., 2008). It inhibits elongation by stalling Pol II at the promoter-proximal region (Chen et al., 2009; Yamaguchi et al., 2002). To release Pol II, p-TEFb is recruited to the target gene to phosphorylate Pol II CTD (Cheng and Price, 2007; Wada et al., 1998) and DSIF, and converts DSIF to a positive elongation factor (Ivanov et al., 2000; Kim and Sharp, 2001; Yamada et al., 2006). To determine which function of DSIF is responsible for rescuing mon, we tested a hypomorphic allele spt5m806, which carries a mis-sense mutation leading to a Valine \u2192 Aspartic acid change at amino acid 1012 (V1012D). In vitro transcription studies have shown that the V1012D protein specifically loses the Pol II pausing ability without affecting the stimulatory function of SPT5 (Guo et al., 2000). We found that the spt5m806 hypomorphic mutant was able to rescue \u03b2e3 expression in mon mutants with the same efficiency as the null allele spt5s30 (Figure 5D, iv). This result supports the view that transcription elongation of blood genes in mon mutants is paused by negative elongation factors, and loss of Pol II pausing in spt5m806 mutants can restore elongation. This is also consistent with the skewed reduction of the 3\u2032 transcript level of blood genes by tif1\u03b3 deficiency (Figure 4B). Because PAF-deficiency can restore the 3\u2032 transcript level (Figure 4B), we suspect that PAF may behave similarly as DSIF to negatively regulate elongation by stalling Pol II on blood genes.TIF1\u03b3 physically associates with FACT, p-TEFb and the SCL complexBoth TIF1\u03b3 and elongation factors are ubiquitously expressed proteins yet play specific roles in erythroid gene expression. To elucidate the mechanism that determines this cell-specificity, we performed a pull-down assay to identify the blood-specific binding partners of TIF1\u03b3. We made a stable cell line expressing Flag-tagged human TIF1\u03b3 by transfecting K562 human erythroleukemia cells (Figure 6A). Flag pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry (MS) revealed many blood-specific transcription factors and co-factors that bind to Flag-tagged TIF\u03b3 (Figure 6B&C and Table S1), including SCL, LDB1, HEB and other factors known to associate with SCL. We classified these proteins into the group of \u201cthe SCL complex\u201d. The finding of blood-specific transcription factors coupled to TIF1\u03b3 establishes a mechanism by which TIF1\u03b3 exerts blood-specific regulation of transcription.Open in a separate windowFigure 6TIF1\u03b3 is required to recruit positive elongation factors to erythroid genesA) The western blot showing the expression of Flag-tagged human TIF1\u03b3 in stably transfected K562 cells.

The numbers of peptides were summarized from six independent experiments. See also Table S1.D) K562 nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) and subsequently immunoblotted (IB) with indicated antibodies. Corresponding IgG was used as the negative control. Note CDC73 and SPT5 do not co-IP with TIF1\u03b3 or SCL. DDX17 was used as a negative control to show the specificity of co-IP experiments. See also Figure S5.E) CDK9 ChIP in human CD34+ cells infected with empty vector (EV) or tif1\u03b3-shRNAs. Cells were harvested after 5 days of erythroid differentiation (proerythroblast stage). Results are shown as fold enrichment compared to the background level that is determined by no-antibody ChIP. The results are shown as mean \u00b1 SD from two independent experiments.Surprisingly, the most abundant proteins pulled down with Flag-tagged TIF1\u03b3 were SPT16 and SSRP1, the two subunits of the FACT complex. To verify the MS results, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using endogenous proteins from untransfected K562 cells (Figure 6D). TIF1\u03b3, SCL and SPT16 can reciprocally immunoprecipitate with one another, confirming interactions among the endogenous proteins. Although MS did not identify p-TEFb subunits in the pull-down assay, we found that p-TEFb subunit CDK9 co-immunoprecipitated with TIF1\u03b3, SCL and SPT16, and vice versa (Figure 6D), suggesting p-TEFb as an endogenous interacting partner of TIF1\u03b3 and SCL. Gel filtration assays revealed a co-elution of these proteins (Figure S5), suggesting that these proteins may exist in the same complex. These data demonstrate that TIF1\u03b3 interacts, directly or indirectly, with the SCL, FACT, and pTEFb complexes. In contrast, we did not find interactions of the PAF and DSIF components CDC73 and SPT5 with TIF1\u03b3 and SCL (Figure 6D).A hypothesis from the interaction data is that TIF1\u03b3 may recruit elongation factors p-TEFb and FACT to blood genes. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP analysis on CDK9 in human CD34+ cells under erythroid differentiation. In control cells, we detected an enriched occupancy of CDK9 on several blood genes, including gata1, gata2, runx1 and alas2 (Figure 6E); however, this enrichment was dramatically decreased upon knocking down tif1\u03b3 by shRNA (Figure 6E). The two tif1\u03b3-shRNA constructs showed similar effect. These data support a TIF1\u03b3-dependent recruitment of p-TEFb to erythroid genes, although we could not assess the recruitment of FACT due to the lack of ChIP-grade antibody. Together with the genetic results, we propose that TIF1\u03b3 promotes blood gene transcription by recruiting positive elongation factors such as p-TEFb to counteract negative factors that pause Pol II. In the absence of Pol II pausing (such as in DSIF or PAF-deficient cells), transcription of blood genes can bypass the requirement of TIF1\u03b3. DiscussionCell fate specification at the transcription level involves a series of molecular steps. Transcription initiation is regulated by cell-specific DNA-binding proteins that associate with chromatin factors and recruit Pol II to promoters. After Pol II is engaged, transcription pausing occurs commonly. The reason why pausing exists, and its role in organogenesis, remain unclear. To release paused Pol II, positive elongation factors are recruited by cell-specific factors. The work presented here highlights the required coordination of all aspects of transcription within a cell lineage including initiation, pausing and elongation.Genetic suppressor screens in zebrafishThe zebrafish is a powerful model organism for the study of vertebrate genetics. Many zebrafish mutants define critical steps of organogenesis and are excellent models of human diseases. Performing suppressor screens on these mutants will be very useful to identify interacting pathways that may have clinical implications. Unfortunately, many mutants are embryonic lethal, making suppressor screens practically difficult. Our work here provides a foundation for undertaking genetic suppressor screens in zebrafish and making use of the powerful haploid genetics. The BAC rescue approach leads to viable fish with a homozygous lethal mutation available in large numbers, and the linkage of GFP on the BAC distinguishes the transgenic mutants from non-transgenic mutants. The haploid genetics in zebrafish allows for an adequate number of recessive mutants to be identified in the F1 generation. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic suppressor screen performed in zebrafish.A model of TIF1\u03b3 regulating transcription elongationOur study suggests a role of TIF1\u03b3 in regulating transcription elongation of erythroid genes: 1) Multiple elongation factors, including PAF, DSIF, FACT and p-TEFb, specifically affect blood gene expression (either positively or negatively). 2) TIF1\u03b3 physically associates with positive elongation factors p-TEFb and FACT. 3) Recruitment of p-TEFb to blood genes is interrupted in tif1\u03b3-deficient cells. 4) Loss of Pol II pausing activity in spt5 hypomorphic mutant is sufficient to rescue blood gene expression in tif1\u03b3 mutant animals.As shown in Figure 7, we propose a model in which TIF1\u03b3 functionally links positive elongation factors to blood-specific transcription complexes to regulate transcriptional elongation of blood genes by antagonizing Pol II pausing. In wildtype blood cells, TIF1\u03b3 is required to counteract Pol II pausing factors by recruiting p-TEFb (and possibly FACT as well) to blood genes through interacting with the SCL complex. Lack of TIF1\u03b3 disrupts the recruitment of p-TEFb and FACT, resulting in elongation blockage. In double mutant cells missing both TIF1\u03b3 and pausing factors (such as DSIF and PAF), Pol II is no longer paused, elongation may continue even without help from positive elongation factors. Consistent with this model, a previous study in C. elegans showed that spt5 mutants could bypass the requirement of p-TEFb to turn on heatshock gene expression (Shim et al., 2002). Our model predicts that Pol II should be concentrated on blood-specific promoters in tif1\u03b3 mutant cells, but should be released into the gene body in double mutant cells. Due to technical limitations, we currently have not examined Pol II occupancy on erythroid genes in the tif1\u03b3 mutant, as this would directly establish that Pol II is paused in the mutant.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Model of TIF1\u03b3 regulating transcription elongation of blood genesIn wildtype blood cells, Pol II elongation on blood-specific genes is inhibited by PAF and DSIF. TIF1\u03b3 is required to release paused Pol II by recruiting p-TEFb and FACT to blood genes through interacting with the SCL complex. The kinase activity of p-TEFb phosphorylates DSIF and Pol II CTD. Phosphorylated Pol II then proceeds to finish elongation. In mon mutant blood cells, recruitment of p-TEFb and FACT is not efficient in the absence of TIF1\u03b3, which in turn affects Pol II phosphorylation and releasing from the paused state, resulting in elongation blockage. In double mutant cells missing both TIF1\u03b3 and DSIF/PAF, Pol II is no longer paused, elongation will continue even without help from positive elongation factors.Function of PAF in transcription elongationThe rescue of tif1\u03b3 mutants by the loss of inhibitory function of DSIF establishes a major function of TIF1\u03b3 in counteracting Pol II pausing. Unlike DSIF, PAF was shown as a positive elongation factor in previous studies. To our knowledge, our work is the first example suggesting a negative role of PAF during elongation. PAF is known to associate with elongating Pol II and plays an important role in H2B ubiquitination, which is a hallmark of active transcription. However, a recent study has suggested that H2B ubiquitination does not directly affect the activity of the transcriptional machinery, but rather exists as a consequence of transcription (Kim et al., 2009). In light of this view, we found that depletion of the H2B ubiquitination enzyme Rad6 could not rescue mon. In addition, PAF is known to physically interact with 3\u2032 RNA processing factors to regulate polyadenylation; however, morpholino knockdown of polyadenylation factors showed no similarity to PAF mutants (Figure S3A). Instead we found that PAF mutants and DSIF mutants behave similarly in terms of morphological defects and the ability to rescue tif1\u03b3-deificient blood defects. Depletion of PAF restored the 3\u2032 transcript level of blood genes in mon mutants, suggesting a negative function of PAF during elongation. We suspect that PAF may also have dual functions similar to DSIF, which inhibits Pol II progression at the early elongation stage but then is converted to a positive factor and travels with elongating Pol II. NELF is another pausing factor but in our hands, depletion of NELF subunits did not cause DSIF/PAF-like phenotypes and also failed to rescue blood in mon (data not shown), suggesting a NELF-independent mechanism in our system.Regulation of pausing as a cell-specific developmental checkpointPol II pausing is predominantly found on the genes involved in signaling transduction and developmental regulation (Zeitlinger et al., 2007). An advantage of having paused Pol II at the promoter-proximity is to allow a rapid and synchronized activation of gene expression upon developmental or environmental stimuli. Blood development is a very dynamic process and multiple signals cooperate to control cell proliferation and differentiation. The erythroid lineage is particularly sensitive to environmental stress and responds by rapid proliferation/differentiation to maintain red cell homeostasis. One hypothesis is that erythroid precursors use paused elongation to coordinate gene expression in response to external stimuli.We propose that transcriptional pausing may function as a developmental checkpoint for erythroid cell differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint in PAF and DSIF mutants has no major effect on erythroid differentiation. Only under certain conditions where elongation is disrupted, such as in mon mutants, the effect of pausing is detected. This is similar to a tumor suppressor pathway that is activated only in certain situations such as DNA damage and represents a checkpoint of the cell cycle.The cell-specific nature of the mon mutant is remarkable. We propose that the SCL complex provides a cell-specific regulation of elongation, in the same way that it regulates the cell-specificity of transcription initiation. The enriched tif1\u03b3 expression in erythroid cells may represent an evolutionary selection of utilizing the special role of TIF1\u03b3 in erythroid cells.It remains a question which signaling pathways control the transcription elongation of blood genes. Previous studies have found interactions between TIF1\u03b3 and TGF\u03b2/BMP pathways, albeit with contradictory results (Dupont et al., 2009; Dupont et al., 2005; He et al., 2006). In our TIF1\u03b3 pull-down assays, both Smad2 and Smad4 proteins were detected with only a few peptides (Table S1). Although tif1\u03b3-deficient animals do not resemble mutants in TGF\u03b2/BMP pathways, our data do not exclude the possibility that either pathway may contribute to TIF1\u03b3-dependent elongation regulation in hematopoiesis. BMP signaling is involved in stress-induced erythropoiesis (Lenox et al., 2005; Perry et al., 2007). In this respect, it is interesting to note that our microarray analysis identified the BMP pathway as the most represented signaling pathway oppositely regulated by tif1\u03b3 and cdc73 (Fig. S2B).Our findings provide a checkpoint mechanism for coordinated cell differentiation during organogenesis. If external signals are not available or cell-specific intrinsic regulators are not fully assembled, the cell can use the Pol II pausing mechanism to temporarily stall transcription while maintaining cell identity and viability. Relief of the pause by factors such as TIF1\u03b3 ensures a rapid and perhaps synchronized response to differentiation signals. Experimental ProceduresZebrafish maintenance, transgenesis and haploid screenZebrafish were maintained in accordance with Animal Research Guidelines at Children\u2019s Hospital Boston. The BAC construct was injected into 1-cell stage embryos from mon heterozygote intercrosses to generate mon; Tg {Tif1\u03b3+; \u03b2actin:GFP} stable lines. ENU mutagenesis and haploid screen were performed as previously described (Solnica-Krezel et al., 1994, Shepard, 2005 #73). Haploid embryos at 22hpf were used for double in situ hybridization of GFP and \u03b2e3. Females giving rise to at least 10% embryos with a GFP\u2212; \u03b2e3+ pattern were considered carrying the suppressor mutation and outcrossed with wild-type transgenic males, and F2 diploid intercrosses were performed to verify the mutants. See supplemental materials for detailed description of BAC transgene construction and genetic mapping.Morpholino injectionMorpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC, and injected into 1-4 cell stage embryos. See supplemental materials for morpholino sequences and working concentrations.Microarray and ChIP analysesMicroarray hybridization was performed at Roche Nimblegen (Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland) using Nimblegen zebrafish expression arrays. The goldenspike package in Bioconductor/R (Choe et al., 2005) was used to process CEL files and identify genes with relative changes of mRNA levels between WT and morphants. A log2 mean fold change was calculated along with a q-value. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software (www.ingenuity.com) was used for genome-wide gene ontology analysis. All microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under the accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20432\",\"term_id\":\"20432\"}}GSE20432.ChIP reactions were performed as described previously (Kim et al., 2008) with 1:100 dilution of individual antibody. 3~5 \u00d7 107 cells were used for each antibody. CHIP hybridizations were performed at Dana-Farber Microarray Core Facility using the Human Genome Tiling 2.0R Array C that contains chromosomes 3, 21, 22, X and Y. Model-based Analysis of Tiling-array (MAT) (Johnson et al., 2006) was applied to predict the target loci. The raw dataset is available on NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE20428\",\"term_id\":\"20428\"}}GSE20428. For ChIP-PCR analysis, the ChIP samples were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (BioRad). All primers were tested for PCR efficiency as recommended by the manufacturer (BioRad). See supplemental materials for primer sequences.shRNA knockdowns in human CD34+ cellsPrimary human CD34+ cells were obtained from the Yale Center of Excellence in Molecular Hematology (YCEMH). shRNA clones in the puromycin-resistant pLKO vector were obtained from Sigma. The empty vector pLKO.1 was used to produce control lentiviruses. Lentiviruses were prepared and infection of cells was carried out as described (Moffat et al., 2006). Selection with puromycin (1ug/ml) was initiated at 48 hours following infection, which corresponded to the time when the cells were seeded into differentiation medium. See supplemental materials for cell culture condition and shRNA sequences.Plasmid construction and K562 cell transfectionThe cDNA encoding human TIF1\u03b3 excluding the start ATG, was cloned in-frame into the pEF-FLAG-Biotag vector (Woo et al., 2008) to generate an amino-terminal FLAG fusion molecule. K562 cells were transfected by electroporation with pEF-FLAG-TIF1\u03b3 construct, cultured in 96-well plates containing medium with 1ug/ml puromycin to select single clones.Flag pull-down assays and mass spectrometryNuclear extract was prepared from ~1 \u00d7 1010 cells as previously described (Woo et al., 2008). 50~120 mg of total nuclear protein was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight. After wash, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) and concentrated by TCA precipitation. Precipitated proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Colloidal Coomassie blue stain (Invitrogen). The excised acrylamide gel sections were used for mass spectrometry conducted at Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility of Harvard Medical School.Antibodies for co-immunoprecipitation and ChIPSee supplemental materials for a list of antibodies Supplementary Material01Click here to view.(16K, pdf)02Click here to view.(33K, pdf)03Click here to view.(1.2M, doc) AcknowledgementsWe thank Drs H.
