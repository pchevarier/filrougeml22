OLIG2 is expressed only in the central nervous system (CNS) and plays an important role in the development of brain cancers. As usual, its role in tumorigenesis is an extension of its \u201cnormal\u201d function, such as promoting neural differentiation at specific stages of neural development. Early in oligodendrocyte specification, two signaling pathways (BMP\u2014bone morphogenetic protein\u2014and SHH\u2014sonic hedgehog) converge on OLIG1 and OLIG2 and play a significant role in the formation of multipotential neural progenitor cells (NPC) including their development to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) [1]. OLIG2 is also involved in chromatin remodeling by directing the histone-acetylating molecule BRG1 to genes needed for differentiation [1].There is also significant evidence for the role of OLIG2 in cancer. Exposure to glioma-related mitogens EGF and PDGF leads to proliferation of OLIG2+ rapidly dividing cells (type C) [2\u20134]. All malignant gliomas express OLIG2, and inhibiting the OLIG2 pathway inhibits glioma growth and sensitizes to radiation [5\u201311]. Given this evidence, we used a systems biology approach involving hierarchical gene network analysis to identify OLIG2-related pathways and genes that may influence cancer development and that inform drug development approaches for this pathway.Recently researchers increased their interest in regulatory role of TFs and their networks in brain development [12\u201315].Interesting attempt to elucidate the regulatory module network for basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix TFs was undertaken by Li and coauthors [12]. They created a 28-module network using a probabilistic method for identifying regulatory modules from gene expression data introduced by Segal and colleagues [16] and found 26 cooperative bHLH TF pairs. Tsigelny with coauthors created and investigated the hierarchical gene networks including transcription factors involved in brain development [13]. Recently a profile of OLIG2-target genes that are involved in progenitors of motor neurons and oligodendrites was studied using KEGG networks [14]. Significant role of OLIG2 as a multifunctional regulator of neurons is underlined using network analysis by Mateo and coauthors [15] who showed that this TF activates 616 genes and represses 760 genes. They also showed that TFs interact between each-other in creation of the network-driven regulation action.Our goal was to develop a set of networks that allowed to find a hierarchy of TFs regulating processes that lead to glioma development. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOLIG2 expression regulationOLIG2 expression is induced by sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) during development. A simplified diagram of SHH, FGF, and OLIG2 interactions is shown in Figure \u200bFigure1A1A [6, 17\u201321]. FGF and SHH signaling pathways cooperate to induce OLIG2 [22]. When SHH signaling establishes a progenitor domain that expresses OLIG2, FGFR signaling promotes OLIG2 transcription. Another hypothesis proposed by Kessaris and colleagues suggest the FGFR signaling leads to necessary level of MAPK phosphorylation that leads to OLIG2 expression [20]. This hypothesis is supported by experiments by Furusho and coauthors [22]. In general, FGFs (around 23 known by now) are very important for CNS development. They are involved in migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neural cells [22, 23]. FGF3 expression is consistent with oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs,) driven by OLIG2. In comparison FGF2 is related to differentiated OLPs and less related to OLIG2. FGF2 promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) production and inhibits the transition from pre-OPCs to OPCs repressing SHH-dependent coexpression of OLIG2 and NKX2-2 [17].Open in a separate windowFigure 1OLIG2-related gene networks(A) Expression of OLIG2 is inducted by SHH and FGF proteins. (B) OLIG2 cell cycle impact. (C) OLIG2 interacting with RHO pathway [41].OLIG2 translocation to nucleus and neural stem cellsNotch signaling upregulates OLIG2 expression and promotes OLIG2 localization in nucleus (Figure \u200b(Figure1A)1A) [24]. OLIG2 translocates from the nucleus of neural stem cells (NSCs) to cytosol, where it is subsequently degraded during formation of astrocytes. This is simulated by AKT via phosphorylation of the residue S30 of OLIG2 [25, 26]. More phosphorylation sites are found in OLIG2 by mass spectroscopy S10, S13, S14, and T43 [26]. Phosphorylation at the triple-serine site correlated with oncogenic potential [26].OLIG2 and cell cycle including epigenetic style regulationp21 (WAF1/CLIP1) is a known cell cycle inhibitor and effector of p53 (Figure \u200b(Figure1B).1B). It is directly involved in fulfillment of p53 inhibiting regulation of NSC [27]. p21 locus is directly affected by OLIG2 transcriptional repression. Disruption of p21 enhances proliferation rates of NSC in mammalian forebrain [28]. p21 is involved in Cyclin D and CDK4/6 inhibition and, by inhibiting p21, OLIG2 indirectly increases expression of these two tumorigenic proteins. It is interesting to note that attenuation of p53 function resulted by mutations in genes interacting with it\u2014p14ARF (CDKN2A), MDM2, or ATM\u2014still does not prevent fully p53-driven response in genotoxic damage, but OLIG2 completely abolishes p53 function [9].Complete transcriptional activity of p53 requires the coactivators\u2014CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 and PCAF [29]. Later additional coactivators were found. p53 acetylation is mediated by the p300 and CBP acetyltransferase domains. Overexpression of either p300 or CBP induces p53 acetylation. MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, actively suppresses p300/CBP-mediated TP53 acetylation in vivo and in vitro. This inhibitory activity of MDM2 on p53 acetylation is in turn abrogated by tumor suppressor p19ARF (mouse equivalent of p14ARF(CDKN2A), indicating that regulation of acetylation is a central target of the p53\u2013MDM2\u2013p19ARF function [30].TP53 was the first non-histone protein shown to be acetylated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) [31]. The most important acetylation sites on TP53 are: K164, K120, and six lysines at C-terminus (Figure \u200b(Figure2B)2B) [31]. OLIG2 suppresses TP53 acetylation. Mehta and colleagues showed that by suppressing acetylation on specific site OLIG2 suppresses both basal and radioinduced interactions of TP53 with p21 (CDKN1A), WIG1, BAX, and MDM2 [9]. OLIG2 acts as an important posttranslational modifier of p53.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Positive feedback loops including OLIG2(A) Network including receptor tyrosine kinases, p300, KDM1A, and p53.

Yellow sites are necessary for TP53 activation. Modified from ref. 28.Positive feedback loop with KDM1A (LSD1)It is possible that OLIG2 \u201ctriggers\u201d the positive feedback loop (Figure \u200b(Figure2A,2A, thick yellow arrows) including EGFR and PDGFR (and possible additional tyrosine kinase receptors), activating them. PDGFR and EGFR then activate Catenin delta-1 (p120, CTNND1) protein, which activates a set of RCOR (CoREST) proteins and as a result the demethylase KDM1A (LSD1). KDM1A is involved in demethylation of p300 HAT that through TCF3 (E47) activates OLIG2, which is a member of heterodimer with TCF3. Downing and Reynolds showed that PDGF, EGF, and CSF-1 induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p120. KDM1A demethylates K-370 of p53/TP53 that prevents interaction of p53/TP53 with TP53BP1 and represses p53-mediated transcriptional deactivation [32].Activation of KDM1A is coregulated by RCOR group of genes. There are three isoforms of RCOR proteins. RCOR1 and RCOR2 activate KDMA1\u2014nucleosomal demethylation, while RCOR3 inhibits this function [33]. p120-catenin directly binds the REST\u2013CoREST complex, displacing it from established gene targets to permit their transcriptional activation [34]. p300/CBP coactivator complex contains two coactivators: p300 (E1A binding protein 300) and CBP (CREB-binding protein, CREBBP). Each of coactivators contains histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain [35]. Ito and colleagues showed that p300/CBP-mediated acetylation is a universal and critical modification for p53 function [30] (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B). Ligon and colleagues showed that OLIG2 function is necessary for primary glioma development related to activation of EGFR and PDGFR [4].Complex TFAP2C\u2013MYC\u2013KDM5B demethylates histone 3 (H3K4me3) that leads to direct p21 repression [36]. Similar role most probably plays KDM1A (LSD1). Downregulation of LSD1 in vitro with both siRNA and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (pargyline, clorgyline, or tranylcypromine) led to growth inhibition and differentiation with an increase of H3K4 methylation [37].Kaplan\u2013Meier curves (Figure \u200b(Figure3)3) show increase in survival with the lower expression of KDM1A (AOF2), RCOR, and OLIG2, and some increase of survival with increased expression of CDKN1A. All that is consistent with our scheme of gene interactions related to epigenetic control. These results above here are in whole or part based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ (Figure \u200b(Figure2A2A).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Kaplan\u2013Meier curves show increase of survival with the lower expression of KDM1A (AOF2), RCOR, and OLIG2, and some increase of survival with increased expression of CDKN1AAll that is consistent with our scheme of gene interactions related to epigenetic control (Figure \u200b(Figure2A2A).Another point of view is presented by Kozono and coauthors. They showed that KDM1A promotes loss of H3K4me3 (responsible for activation of cancer-related genes) and proposed that KDM1A does it through regulation of H3K4me3 homeostasis at the MYC locus [38]. They showed that decreased KDM1A expression increases MYC H3Kme3 and MYC expression [38]. The authors acknowledged that their findings are contradictory to a number of results [39, 40] showing that the KDM1A inhibitors actually inhibit growth of a number of cancers and stated that the mechanism of such \u201cdichotomy\u201d is an important area of investigation. So KDM1A decreases H3K lysine 4 methylation and activates the related genes; in the same time causes loss of H3K4me expression [38]. The summary result depends on the ratio of these two activities of demethylase.Positive feedback loops with TK (tyrosine kinase) receptorsThis loop also contains a number of tyrosine kinase receptors including EGFR, PDGFR, FLT1, etc. (see Figure \u200bFigure4,4, thick pink and yellow arrows) that OLIG2 activates. These receptors activate the well-known oncogenic pathways: PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK. It was interesting to find the link that can elucidate the possible positive feedback loops that would generate the constant activation of these pathways triggered by OLIG2 or other genes. OLIG2 mediates its functions through a number of proteins. One of them is BAD. When it is not phosphorylated, BAD protein binds and inhibits BCL2 and other members of this family [41, 42]. Once phosphorylated by AKT kinase (or other kinases) the phosphoserine residues of BAD form affinity-binding sites for 14-3-3 protein, thus localizing phosphorylated BAD to the cytosol and effectively neutralizing its proapoptotic activity [42, 43].Open in a separate windowFigure 4AKT-stimulated export of OLIG2 from the nucleus of NSCs is essential for the astrocyte differentiationRed arrows\u2014activating connections, light-blue arrows\u2014inhibiting. Thick arrows present two positive feedback loops (1\u2014pink and 2\u2014yellow); both of them activating AKT.AKT promotes translocation of OLIG2 to nucleus to NSC [20, 21] and in this way promotes its function. Jahn and coauthors reported that impact of GRB10 increased AKT activity levels without increasing PI3K activity levels [44]. This fact can be evidence that GRB10 is a positive regulator of the AKT pathway downstream of PI3K. GRB10 acts as an adaptor involved in the relocalization of AKT to the cell membrane, which results in its activation [44]. OLIG2 expression causes upregulation of GRB10 and GRB14 [4, Suppl. Data]. Some positive feedback GRB10/14\u2013OLIG2\u2013AKT can function, causing OLIG2 activation and BAD protein activity preventing apoptosis. Another positive feedback includes OLIG2\u2013EGFR (or other TK receptor)\u2014PI3K\u2013AKT.RHO pathwayRHO expression is increased in human cancer, alongside with increased RHOA expression in high-grade astrocytomas. As shown in Figure \u200bFigure1C,1C, OLIG2 activates RHOA, which in its turn activates ERK1/2 [45, 46]. The authors showed that RHO/ROCK is involved in GBM cell migration and proliferation via ERK1/2 activation.Coherent-gene modules networks\u2014framework of OLIG2 involvement in cancerInitial network of OLIG2 interaction (Figure \u200b(Figure5)5) was obtained using IPA program (Ingenuity Inc., Santa Clara, CA) on the basis of our gene sets presented in Figures \u200bFigures1,1, \u200b,2,2, and 4 and then analyzed by VisANT program (Center for Advanced Genomic Technology, Bioinformatics Program, Boston University, MA) with its Predictome database of gene\u2013gene interactions [47], which is updated every month. VisANT added a number of genes that participate in various aspects of OLIG2 function and separated them to eight modules (Figure \u200b(Figure6A).6A). The lists of genes in each modules are present in Supplementary Table S1. The following exploration of these modules genes with the IPA program had shown that all the selected by VisANT modules contain functionally connected groups of genes responsible for the specific functions of the cell related to cancer. Some of the involved genes participate in different IPA networks.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Simplified OLIG2 gene signaling networkRed lines\u2014activating by OLIG2 connectors, blue\u2014inhibiting.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Gene modules involved in the comprehensive OLIG2 signaling network(A) General network diagram. (B) Quantity of genes in the modules (i) and connectivity of each module (ii). (C) Number of connections between modules are presented as the relative thickness of the connecting lines. Thicker lines indicate a greater number of connected genes between two modules, while thinner lines indicate a smaller number of connected genes between two modules.Most populated module is Module 8 having 273 genes and the highest connectivity (Figure \u200b(Figure6B)6B) and the smallest module is Module 6 (with 33 genes). OLIG2 along with OLIG1 and OLIG3 and other 49 genes (total 52 genes) is located in Module 3. Analyzing the intensity of connections between the modules revealed that the greatest numbers of connections are in the pairs Module 1 and Module 5, Module 1 and Module 2, Module 2 and Module 5, and Module 3 and Module 5 (Figure \u200b(Figure6C6C).Module 3 containing OLIG2 controls the largest module of the network\u2014Module 8\u2014through controlling EGFR and other genes from its network. Module 1 contains a number of epigenetic-related genes like RCOR1, KDM5B, etc., and is controlled partially by ERK1/2. Module 2 includes a number of MAP kinase family members and HIF1A, important hypoxia-related transcription factor. Module 3 contains a network controlled significantly by OLIG2, OLIG1, and connected genes.The top (having maximum numbers of connections) gene in the entire multimodal network is shown in Figure \u200bFigure7:7: EGFR (Module 8), the next level includes CALM1 (Module 7) and HSP90AA1 (Module 5).

MATERIALS AND METHODSVisANT program, version 4.0 [219] was used for biological pathway analysis and for the querying and visualization of gene-regulation and gene networks for glioblastoma. VisANT is a web-based tool for data mining; visualizing gene data in the context of sequence, pathway, structure, and associated annotations; and analyzing different types of networks for biological interactions and associations [219]. In addition to simple networks, interactions in VisANT can also be defined as higher-level connections between groups of proteins, complexes, pathways, or subnetworks. These \u201cmodular\u201d connections can be viewed simultaneously with connections between subcomponents, such as individual protein interactions [219], thus creating a hierarchical clustering. Constructed networks include (1) simple interactions: links defined as protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013DNA, gene\u2013gene, etc.; (2) modules, groups, and clusters: genes, proteins, pathways, and subnetworks; (3) modular interactions: complex interactions, colocalization data, shared components, and pathway interactions [219]. Once a gene data set has been loaded into VisANT, the genes or proteins within it can be queried for other known and predicted interactions from published data sets, using well-known databases as Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) database, Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, to name a few.VisANT creates gene modules based on relationships. Because genes in these modules are working together and the modules are hierarchically integrated in biological networks, we call them coherent-gene modules (CGMs). Essentially, VisANT analyzes the interactions between all the available genes in the gene network and groups them based on connectivity with surrounding genes. VisANT specifically emphasizes CGMs (the most heavily connected genes within each module) than it does each individual gene. With that being said, modules are created within VisANT first due to connectivity within CGMs and then to connectivity with surrounding genes. The CGMs are separately analyzed through literature checks in order to extrapolate important information about their function in cancers, in this case gliomas. VisANT primarily takes the global clustering coefficient and the local clustering coefficient into account when generating weighted networks. After forming CGMs of all genes within the gene network, genes were filtered out based on connectivity.After obtaining modules in VisANT, we uploaded genes of each module individually into IPA\u00ae program (Ingenuity Inc., Santa Clara, CA), starting with the two CGMs linked to OLIG2. Ingenuity IPA further elucidated the signaling networks including the genes from the VisANT-defined modules lists; so that a more simple and comprehensive network may be analyzed. Unlike VisANT, IPA specifies interactions between genes, which allow us to extrapolate important information from the uploaded genes and related genes identified through IPA Knowledge Base. Because multiple networks are created for every given module, we analyzed in more detail the networks with the maximum score for the genes selected from VisANT modules. The score is a measure of the number of input genes in a network.KEGG database and KEGG software [220] were used to confirm obtained module networks, mapping them into KEGG pathways and looking for high-frequency cancer genes such as EGFR (linked to 522 genes in VisANT), Calmodulin (linked to 261 genes in VisANT), etc. After networks were confirmed, we used KEGG to extrapolate information about different pathways and to visualize key networks. CONCLUSIONSOLIG2 transcription factor is involved in a set of signaling gene networks including inhibition of p53 by suppressing its acetylation and consequently its interactions with p21.We elucidated a set of positive feedback loops in signaling pathway including OLIG2. Such loops may cause constant activation of the involved proteins and consequently oncogenesis.Two of these loops include EGFR and PDGFR and most probably some of the other tyrosine kinase receptors (Figures \u200b(Figures2,2, thick yellow arrows, and 4, thick pink arrows). One of these loops (Figure \u200b(Figure2A)2A) comprising KDM1A, p300/CBP, and RCOR is involved keeping activated epigenetic regulation circuit and tyrosine kinase receptors. Two other loops (Figure \u200b(Figure4)4) can lead for an extended activation of AKT pathway and again tyrosine kinase receptors.Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves based on TCGA data support an OLIG2 and KDM1A (AOF2) concerted involvement in cancer development.We showed that genes interacting with OLIG2 formed eight coherent-gene modules (CGMs) having a set of intermodular connections.We showed that among the genes involved in these CGMs the most connected hub is EGFR, then on a lower level HSP90 and CALM1, followed by three lower levels including epigenetic genes KDM1A, NCOR1, and RCOR. The genes on the six upper levels of the hierarchy are involved in interconnections of all eight CGMs.Genes in the elucidated CGMs organized functionally defined gene-signaling subnetworks having specific functions. For example, CGM1 is significantly involved in epigenetic control. CGM2 is significantly related to cell proliferation and differentiation. CGM3 includes a number of interconnected basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) transcription factors including OLIG2.The OLIG2 pathway is complex and needs to be taken into account when developing inhibitors of OLIG2. Small molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interfaces to disrupt dimerization are showing promising results in preclinical models and are being developed by academic and biotechnology companies for clinical use ([11] and http://www.curtanapharma.com). Mechanisms of resistance and combination strategies based on OLIG2 pathways will also need to be incorporated in the future.
