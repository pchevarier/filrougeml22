Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a fatal comorbidity of critically ill patients with COVID-19, who often end up on respiratory support. Patients who experience persistent refractory hypoxemia despite mechanical ventilation maybe benefit from Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), which was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidelines (2). However, the safety and effectiveness of ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated at present, as studies report mixed results regarding the benefit of ECMO treatment (3, 4). Moreover, knowing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage of the pandemic would be useful for tracing its evolution. Here, we report on nine patients who received ECMO due to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in the city of Wuhan, China. Materials and MethodsThis study recruited patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received ECMO from 11 designated intensive care units (ICUs) in Wuhan. The detailed information of each patient before and after ECMO implementation was collected by physicians using a standard data form, including demographic data, medical history, underlying medical conditions, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiological findings, and the treatment the patients received. ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition (5). This study was approved by the Shanghai East Hospital Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. ResultsBetween February 2 and March 20, 2020, a total of 354 COVID-19 patients from 11 ICUs in Wuhan were retrospectively evaluated. Among these patients, there were nine cases from six different ICUs who received ECMO treatment due to ARDS, with all of them starting ECMO implementation in the ICU rather than transferring from other departments. The medical team charged with their care was brought in from different areas of China to support the local hospital. The detailed baseline clinical characteristics of those patients are shown in Table 1. The median (min to max) age was 58 (47\u201368) years and 6 (66.7%) patients were men. Five patients had underlying medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The primary reason for ECMO implementation was ARDS in all nine cases (Figure 1). Before ECMO implementation, the median (min to max) duration of mechanical ventilation before implementation of ECMO was 48 (11\u2013345) h. A prone position was used for six (66.7%) patients.Table 1Characteristics and severity of ARDS and outcome of COVID-19 patients received ECMO*.\nAll % or median (min\u2013max)\n\nCase 1\n\nCase 2\n\nCase 3\n\nCase 4\n\nCase 5\n\nCase 6\n\nCase 7\n\nCase 8\n\nCase 9\n\nAge (years)\n58 (47-68)684758606255665556\nSex\n66.7% MaleMMFFMMMFM\nComorbidities\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hypertension33.3%YesNoYesNoYesNoNoNoNo\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes33.3%NoYesYesNoNoNoNoNoYes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coronary artery disease11.1%YesNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoBMI20.8 (24.0\u201327.0)23.723.126.024.027.020.826.424.823.0From illness onset to Mechanical ventilation, days24 (11-46)162538302421211146From illness onset to ECMO, days31 (13\u201349)313540313122221349From Mechanical ventilation to ECMO, hours48 (11\u2013345)345239471119447294854Prone positioning66.7%YesYesYesYesYesNoNoNoYesRenal replacement therapy44.4%NoNoYesYesYesNoYesNoNo\n24 h Before Commencement of ECMO\nLowest PaO2/FIO2 ratio92 (41\u2013156)1144592451224111642156Highest FIO285 (70\u2013100)81%100%85%100%70%100%80%100%75%Highest PEEP, cm H2O10 (7\u201315)121071471510108Highest peak airway pressure, cm H2O38 (27\u201345)3538N/A452735454040Lowest pH7.35 (7.21\u20137.42)7.337.247.347.417.377.407.217.427.35Highest PaCO2, mm Hg72.0 (41.2\u2013102.0)73.4102.060.355.178.844.372.041.279.3Highest tidal volume, mL/kg6.4 (4.7\u20137.5)4.76.47.55.8N/A7.55.46.16.9SOFA score8 (6\u201312)10128678867\nECMO parameters\nModel100% V-VV-VV-V to V-V-AV-VV-VV-VV-VV-VV-VV-VCircuit blood flow at 4 h, L/min4.0 (3.0\u20135.6)4.65.63.54.34.0N/A3.53.03.0\nOutcome\nHemorrhage55.6%NoYesYesYesYesNoYesNoNoDuration of Mechanical ventilation, hours290 (79\u2013871)50029087115864479583231241Duration of ECMO, hours147 (32\u2013450)1555137814745032255133144Withdraw Mechanical ventilation11.1%NoNoNoNoNoNoNoYesNoWithdraw ECMO44.4%NoNoYesNoNoNoYesYesYesDuration of ICU stay, days24 (8\u201345)81945243013263713Duration of hospital stay, days26 (8\u201358)82058284013264522Survival33.3%NoNoNoNoNoNoYesYesNoOpen in a separate window*Case 7 was discharged and case 8 was still in hospital after mechanical ventilation as of April 15, 2020.ECMO, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; SOFA score, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; V-V, veno-venous; V-A, veno-arterial; V-V-A, veno-arterial-venous.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Representative chest X-ray of COVID-19 patients before and after ECMO treatment.The median (min to max) highest recorded FIO2, positive end-expiratory pressure, tidal volume (per kg body weight), and peak airway pressure before ECMO commencement were 85% (70\u2013100%), 10 (7\u201315) cmH2O, 6.4 (4.7\u20137.5) mL/kg, and 38 (27\u201345) cm H2O, respectively. The Median (min\u2013max) SOFA score in the 24 h before ECMO implementation was 8 (6\u201312).The veno-venous model of ECMO was used in all patients, though one patient was later changed to a veno-arterial-venous model due to unstable cardiac output. The median (min to max) duration of ECMO support was 147 (32\u2013450) h and the median (min to max) circuit blood flow at 4 h was 4.0 (3.0\u20135.6) L/min.Hemorrhagic complications occurred in five patients (55.6%) during ECMO therapy. Of the nine patients, 5 (55.6%) died while receiving ECMO, and 4 (44.4%) were weaned from ECMO. After ECMO withdrawal, two patients died, one patient was discharged, and one patient was withdrawn from mechanical ventilation but remained in hospital as of May 15, 2020. DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, studies that reported the clinical characteristics, technical details, and outcomes in COVID-19 patients who received ECMO in China were limited. As the respiratory system is the primary target of the virus, which causes ARDS in a substantial proportion of ICU patients, the requirement of respiratory supports like ECMO is expected. However, the usefulness of ECMO, which was associated with reduced mortality in patients with MERS-CoV infection (6), remains debatable in terms of its safety and effectiveness in COVID-19 patients according to initial studies (7). In a study conducted by Yang et al. (8) five (83%) of six patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO died in the city of Wuhan, China. A recent study reported that the 90-days mortality was 54% in patients who received ECMO treatment due to COVID-19. Our study found seven in nine patients had died and one patient remained in hospital (9). The mortality is higher than those with MERS or H1N1 infection (3, 6) and those with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan (9). This might be due to several reasons. First, the patients in the current study were older than those with MERS or H1N1 infections, and more patients had underlying medical conditions. Second, the ECMO specialists were from different centers elsewhere in China and therefore different standards and criteria might be adopted during the implementation of ECMO. Third, it is likely that related equipment was in shortage, given the heavy burden COVID-19 presented during the outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Fourth, the potential harm of ECOM itself in the treatment of COVID-19 cannot be excluded based on our and previous studies (10). Therefore, our initial experiences suggested that carefully selecting patients who might benefit from ECMO, as well as management by a well-trained team with relevant equipment, were critical to implementing ECMO in patients with COVID-19. More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate the usefulness of ECMO in patients with COVID-19.
