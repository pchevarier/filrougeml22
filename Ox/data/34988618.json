{"title": "Intensive Care Unit and Hospital Outcomes of Patients Admitted with Blastomycosis: A 14-Year Retrospective Study", "pubDate": "2022", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s00408-021-00499-7", "PMID": "34988618", "abstract": "Introduction:                       Blastomycosis is an uncommon; potentially life-threatening granulomatous fungal infection. The aim of this study is to report hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes of patients admitted with blastomycosis.                  Methods:                       All patients admitted for treatment of blastomycosis at the Mayo Clinic-Rochester, Minnesota between 01/01/2006 and 09/30/2019 were included. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, ICU admission, and outcomes were reviewed.                  Results:                       A total of 84 Patients were identified with 90 unique hospitalizations primarily for blastomycosis. The median age at diagnosis was 49 (IQR 28.1-65, range: 6-85) years and 56 (66.7%) were male. The most frequent comorbidities included hypertension (n = 28, 33.3%); immunosuppressed state (n = 25, 29.8%), and diabetes mellitus (n = 21, 25%). The lungs were the only organ involved in 56 (66.7%) cases and the infection was disseminated in 19 (22.6%) cases. A total of 29 patients (34.5%) underwent ICU admission due to complications of blastomycosis. ICU related events included mechanical ventilation (n = 20, 23.8%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 13, 15.5%), tracheostomy (n = 9, 10.7%), renal replacement therapy (n = 8, 9.5%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (n = 4, 4.8%). A total of 12 patients (14.3%) died in the hospital; all of whom had undergone ICU admission. In-hospital mortality was associated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) (P = 0.0255).                  Conclusion:                       Blastomycosis is a serious, potentially life-threatening infection that results in significant morbidity and mortality with a 34.5% ICU admission rate. RRT was associated with in-hospital mortality.", "author": [{"author": "Vaibhav Ahluwalia", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ahluwalia+V&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Yahya Almodallal", "affiliation": ["Department of Pediatrics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."], "href": "/?term=Almodallal+Y&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Adham K Alkurashi", "affiliation": ["Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."], "href": "/?term=Alkurashi+AK&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Hasan Ahmad Hasan Albitar", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Albitar+HAH&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Hussam Jenad", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jenad+H&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Suartcha Prueksaritanond", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Prueksaritanond+S&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Rudy Tedja", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Tedja+R&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Bibek Pannu", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Pannu+B&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Prashant Jagtap", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA."], "href": "/?term=Jagtap+P&cauthor_id=34988618"}, {"author": "Vivek N Iyer", "affiliation": ["Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. iyer.vivek@mayo.edu."], "href": "/?term=Iyer+VN&cauthor_id=34988618"}], "refPMID": ["9313293", "6950684", "22797452"], "citedInPMID": ["34988618"], "body": ""}
