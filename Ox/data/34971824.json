As of November 11, 2021, more than 250 million people had contracted COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 5 million had died (Dong\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020).COVID-19 progresses with an initial viral replication phase, followed by a viral clearance phase as a result of the immune response. In some patients, SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs may trigger a cytokine storm that leads to the development of uncontrolled inflammation, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure; these are the main causes of death in these patients (Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o et\u00a0al., 2020). This uncontrolled inflammation has prompted the use of several anti-inflammatory drugs in severe cases (Horby et\u00a0al., 2020).It has been speculated that patients receiving chronic systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive (IS) therapies are likely to have a lower risk of this uncontrolled inflammation (D'Antiga,\u00a02020). In this regard, special attention should be paid to calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), including cyclosporine and tacrolimus (G\u00e1lvez-Romero\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Solanich\u00a0et\u00a0al,\u00a02021), which form the basis of immunosuppression therapy in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, and are also used in some patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). In vitro studies have shown that cyclosporine and tacrolimus inhibit viral replication of several coronaviruses through binding to intracellular cyclophilins, inactivating peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase function (Ma-Lauer\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, chronic treatment with CNI could reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Belli\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). On the other hand, as in other viral infections, IS therapies may lead to uncontrolled initial viral replication (Urra\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020), viral immune evasion, and higher risk of mortality (Belsky\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Data on the natural course of COVID-19 in chronically immunosuppressed patients (ISPs) are scarce and inconsistent when compared with those for the general population. Some studies suggest that ISPs have higher rates of severe COVID-19 and mortality compared with the general population, while others show just the opposite \u2014 a lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and lower mortality (Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Minotti\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Mart\u00ednez-Urbistondo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021)In the light of the above, our study aimed to assess whether patients receiving certain IS treatments \u2014 corticosteroids and CNI in particular \u2014 may be at different risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse outcomes compared with the non-immunosuppressed population. PATIENTS AND METHODSStudy population and participantsThis was a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients (18 years of age or older) admitted to hospital for the first time due to COVID-19, in 150 hospitals across Spain, from March to July, 2020, and who had reached a hard endpoint (death or hospital discharge). Information on the SEMI-COVID-19 registry and data collection procedures have been described in previously published works (Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021).The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Provincial Research Ethics Committee of M\u00e1laga (Spain) pursuant to the recommendation of the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Products (AEMPS). All patients gave their informed consent.Definitions and variablesSARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of a nasopharyngeal exudate sample, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage.Patients were defined as on IS treatment if they were receiving any immunosuppressive medication, including systemic corticosteroids, CNI (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), antimetabolites (mycophenolate, azathioprine), mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus), and/or other immunosuppressive treatments at the time of admission. ISPs were classified either as SOT recipients or IMID patients. Due to limitations in the database, it was not possible to identify the specific IMID disease. Patients with hematological malignancies (involving active lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative disorders, or bone marrow transplantation) or solid organ malignancies were not included in this study. ARDS and severity were defined according to the Berlin definition (Ranieri\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2012). Patients not receiving IS treatments prior to admission (non-IS population) were used as controls.Study outcomesThe primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were 30-day mortality and in-hospital complications, including bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute heart failure (AHF), myocarditis, stroke, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF).Statistical analysisQuantitative variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages and absolute frequencies.Clinical presentations and complications were compared between each ISP group and controls, using the chi-square test for qualitative variables (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) and Student's t-test for quantitative variables (or the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test when appropriate).The influence of belonging to either ISP group (SOT recipients or IMID patients) as well as specific IS medications on mortality were analyzed by including demographic and comorbidity variables in a single-step multivariate logistic regression model, which also included the aforementioned groups (model 1) or medications (model 2). The corrected odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for statistically significant variables.A survival analysis was also performed, comparing time to death between groups, with data censored at 30 days of clinical progress (30-day mortality). Time to death was modeled using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, and differences were assessed using stratified Cox regression models. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI were determined.In order to better estimate the influence of chronic immunosuppressive medication on clinical course and mortality, a 1:1 propensity score analysis was performed comparing ISPs with the non-IS population after matching according to sex, age, and comorbidities. A propensity score-matching analysis was also conducted for ISPs on specific medications found to be associated with mortality in comparison with ISPs who were receiving other medications. All models were required to have only exact matches. The validity of all propensity score-matching models was assessed by comparing demographic and comorbidity variables between the groups. Clinical course and mortality were also compared between groups, using the same analytical method as described above. OR and 95% CI were provided for all variables with a p-value < 0.10.For all statistical analysis, two-tailed p-values < 0.05 were considered significant. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS version 25 software package (IBM SPSS Statistics). RESULTSIn total, 16\u00a0647 consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included in the registry. 1674 patients with malignancy were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 14\u00a0973 evaluable patients, 868 (5.79%) were considered ISPs and 14\u00a0105 (94.2%) were not. Among the ISPs, 654 patients had a prior history of IMID (4.36% overall) and 214 were SOT recipients (1.42% overall, with 151, 32, 16, and 15 undergoing kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplantation, respectively). There were 1243 prescriptions for immunosuppressive medications among the 868 ISPs. The most common treatments were glucocorticoids (593 patients, 68.3%), followed by antimetabolites such as mycophenolate, azathioprine, and methotrexate (369 patients, 42.5%), CNI (155 patients, 17.9%), and m-TOR inhibitors (65 patients, 7.5%).The demographic characteristics, general baseline data, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and outcomes for ISPs and controls are summarized in Table\u00a01\n. Overall, the mean age was 69 years and 8460 patients (56.5%) were male. The hospital mortality rate was 19.1% (2857 deaths). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age and comorbidities (Table\u00a02\n), higher in-hospital mortality was found both in SOT recipients (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.73\u20133.49) and IMID patients (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.72). Among specific chronic IS treatments, only corticoids use at admission was associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.41\u20133.55). Interestingly, after adjusting for chronic glucocorticoid use at admission in the survival analysis (Figure\u00a01\n), SOT recipients remained at higher risk of 30-day mortality (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.23\u20132.35), while IMID patients had a similar risk to the general non-IS population (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76\u20131.15). On the other hand, chronic glucocorticoid use was strongly associated with 30-day mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.43\u20132.79)Table 1Demographic factors, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and outcomes according to patient groupVariableTotal (n\u00a0=\u00a014973)Non\u2013IS (n\u00a0=\u00a014105)SOT (n\u00a0=\u00a0214)p1IMID (n\u00a0=\u00a0654)p2Demographic factors and comorbiditiesAge (years)69 (56\u201379)68 (55\u201379)65 (54\u201373)0.01471 (60\u201381)< 0.001Sex (male)56.5% (8460)56.8% (8008)62.8% (134)0.10948.6% (318)< 0.001Obesity20.4% (3059)22.2% (2876)21.0% (44)0.67723.5% (139)0.479CCI1 (0\u20132)0 (0\u20131)2 (1\u20134)< 0.0011 (1\u20132)< 0.001Age-adjusted CCI3 (2\u20135)3 (1\u20135)4 (3\u20137)< 0.0014 (3\u20136)< 0.001Alcohol4.2% (630)4.4% (596)5.1% (11)0.7103.7% (23)0.425Active smoking4.7% (701)5.0% (669)3.4% (7)0.0084.0% (25)< 0.001Hypertension50.1% (7497)49.4% (6959)74.8% (160)< 0.00157.8% (378)< 0.001Dyslipidemia39.0% (5847)38.7% (5450)57.0% (122)< 0.00142.0% (275)0.092Diabetes mellitus14.1% (2112)14.0% (1972)20.6% (44)0.00814.7% (96)0.645Cardiac failure6.8% (1021)6.5% (918)10.8% (23)0.01712.2% (80)< 0.001Atrial fibrillation10.4% (1558)10.2% (1434)16.9% (36)0.00213.5% (88)0.007Acute IHD5.6% (832)5.4% (768)10.4% (22)0.0036.4% (42)0.291Chronic IHD3.5% (521)3.4% (479)5.6% (12)0.0854.6% (30)0.123Peripheral vascular disease4.4% (662)4.2% (589)10.3% (22)< 0.0018.0% (51)< 0.001COPD6.3% (936)6.0% (847)4.7% (10)0.42212.1% (79)< 0.001Asthma7.3% (1097)7.1% (1006)4.7% (10)0.18112.4% (81)< 0.001Stroke2.7% (411)2.8% (388)2.3% (5)0.8362.8% (18)1.000Cognitive decline9.7% (1458)9.9% (1397)3.3% (7)0.0028.3% (54)0.179Depression10.3% (1545)10.2% (1436)8.4% (18)0.42714.0% (91)0.003CRF5.6% (845)4.9% (696)46.3% (99)< 0.0017.7% (50)0.003Liver cirrhosis0.9% (135)0.7% (102)7.9% (17)< 0.0012.5% (16)< 0.001Anticoagulation10.8% (1618)10.5% (1475)18.7% (40)< 0.00115.7% (103)< 0.001Antiaggregation15.2% (2273)15.0% (2109)23.5% (50)0.00117.5% (114)0.093Clinical presentationsCough73.5% (10998)73.8% (10375)66.3% (142)0.01873.5% (481)0.973Arthromyalgia30.8% (4614)31.3% (4374)24.6% (52)0.04329.0% (188)0.225Asthenia42.4% (6343)42.8% (5967)36.5% (77)0.06846.8% (299)0.073Fever63.3% (9472)63.8% (8967)59.3% (127)0.20258.0% (378)0.009Dyspnea57.6% (8620)57.8% (8118)46.3% (99)< 0.00161.6% (403)0.052Diarrhea24.4% (3659)24.5% (3425)34.9% (74)0.00124.6% (160)0.963Rx infiltrate64.5% (9653)64.5% (9102)61.1% (149)0.31062.1% (402)0.195Lymphocytes0.94 (0.68\u20131.30)0.96 (0.70\u20131.30)0.80 (0.50\u20131.18)< 0.0010.84 (0.55\u20131.20)< 0.001CRP61 (20\u2013130)60 (20\u2013128)60 (22\u2013106)0.41765 (21\u2013141)0.202LDH322 (247\u2013434)322 (249\u2013432)290 (223\u2013338)< 0.001325 (253\u2013439)0.607Ferritin613 (287\u20131231)612 (287\u20131242)662 (333\u20131455)0.324543 (277\u20131043)0.100D\u2013dimer0.67 (0.37\u20131.26)0.64 (0.36\u20131.20)0.64 (0.37\u20131.24)0.3850.74 (0.39\u20131.54)0.001Complications and outcomesSevere distress17.4% (2602)17.3% (2428)24.1% (51)0.02918.8% (123)0.292Bacterial pneumonia10.6% (1590)10.6% (1490)9.9% (21)0.82312.1% (79)0.242Sepsis6.4% (954)6.3% (882)6.6% (14)0.8868.9% (58)0.009Septic shock4.6% (686)4.6% (640)4.2% (9)0.8725.7% (37)0.213ARI13.5% (2027)13.1% (1842)36.3% (77)< 0.00116.5% (108)0.013ACF5.5% (819)5.3% (739)8.5% (18)0.0449.5% (62)< 0.001Myopericarditis0.9% (130)0.8% (109)2.4% (5)0.0102.5% (16)< 0.001AIHD0.8% (120)0.8% (113)00.2711.1% (7)0.499Stroke0.7% (110)0.8% (105)0.5% (1)0.8720.6% (4)0.793DIC1.0% (152)1.0% (141)00.1791.7% (11)0.077MOF5.7% (854)5.5% (773)11.8% (25)< 0.0018.6% (56)< 0.001ICU admission9.3% (1388)9.3% (1314)7.5% (16)0.4078.9% (58)0.731Hospital mortality19.1% (2857)18.6% (2618)32.2% (69)< 0.00126.0% (170)< 0.001COVID-related mortality94.2% (2691/2857)94.2% (2465/2618)89.9% (62/69)0.13696.4% (164/170)0.207Open in a separate windowQualitative variables are expressed as percentage (absolute number).

Furthermore, patients under corticoid treatment presented more in-hospital complications, such as severe ARDS (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.05\u20132.91), sepsis (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.06\u20134.38), septic shock (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.19\u201311.36, AKI (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.37\u20133.80), and MOF (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.41\u20134.26). Finally, chronic systemic corticoid treatment was also associated with worse outcomes among SOT recipients (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.01\u20133.30).As planned, a separate propensity score-matching analysis for a total of 212 ISPs treated with systemic glucocorticoids, paired with ISPs without glucocorticoids, was performed. Differences in clinical courses and complications between patients with and without systemic glucocorticoids are summarized in Table 4. Figure\u00a03\nshows the time-to-death analysis for the groups. In-hospital mortality was higher in IS patients with glucocorticoids (27.8% vs 14.2%; HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.30\u20133.31). Interestingly, in this model, patients without glucocorticoids but with other immunosuppressive treatments had similar in-hospital mortality rates to the general non-IS population (14.2% vs 18.6%, respectively), although the groups were not statistically comparable.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Time to death according to chronic corticoid treatment.Kapplan-Meier curves were used to show survival trends, while stratified Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios and their 95% confident intervals. Cox regression models were adjusted for other IS treatments (including CNI, mTOR inhibitors, and antimetabolites), none of which showed a significant association with time to death.HR: hazard ratio; CI: confidence interval; CNI: calcineurin inhibitorChronic calcineurin inhibitorsIn the propensity score analysis, chronic CNI therapy before hospital admission was not associated with worse outcomes (OR 1.19, 95%CI 0.65\u20132.20). Notably, the majority of patients on CNI were SOT recipients (85.2%, 132/155). Consequently, a sub-analysis was performed to analyze the role of CNI treatment before admission in SOT patients. When chronic CNI treatment was considered, no differences regarding mortality were found (31.7% vs 32.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a01.000). DISCUSSIONA recently published study involving the Spanish cohort showed that immunosuppression and immunosuppressant drugs conferred a higher death risk associated with COVID-19 (Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). In light of these findings, our study sought to evaluate which immunosuppressant drugs in particular were associated with this greater risk, using a propensity-score analysis. Consequently, the main finding of our study was that chronic systemic glucocorticoid therapy at admission was the strongest risk factor for death in immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients. Our study also found that immunosuppression with CNI was not associated with better outcomes.Our results indicated that not all chronic immunosuppressive treatments may be comparable with regard to COVID-19 severity risk, as previously postulated by other authors (Pablos\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; FAI2R/SFR/SNFMI/SOFREMIP/CRI/IMIDIATE\u00a0consortium and contributors,\u00a02021). Of special relevance was the deleterious effect of chronic glucocorticoid treatment at admission on immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19, confirming that, in our previous study, the impact of immunosuppressant drugs on mortality was probably attributable to chronic corticoids (Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). In our population, patients receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy prior to hospital admission had similar clinical presentations, but they developed more complications, including severe ARDS, sepsis, AKI, and MOF. In addition, mortality rates were clearly higher in patients with glucocorticoids after adjusting for comorbidities and in propensity score-matched analysis. Moreover, when analyzing the different patient subgroups, chronic glucocorticoid treatment was found to be at least partly responsible for the higher mortality seen in ISPs, since it was the strongest risk factor for death. Furthermore, in our study, patients with IMID who were not on chronic systemic glucocorticoids had a comparable in-hospital mortality to non-immunocompromised patients. Additionally, among SOT recipients (who had higher in-hospital mortality compared with the general non-IS population after adjusting for chronic corticosteroid therapy), chronic corticoid treatment was also associated with increased risk of mortality and complications.These results may seem shocking, considering that glucocorticoids are, to date, the most effective treatment for this disease (Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Horby\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). However, some smaller studies analyzing patients treated with chronic immunosuppressive medications have shown that patients receiving glucocorticoids seem to be at higher risk of death than those not receiving them (Ayala-Guti\u00e9rrez\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Anikhindi\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Pablos\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Schulze-Koops\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Furthermore, higher mortality rates have been found even in patients taking chronic inhaled glucocorticoids (Schultze\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). It has been suggested that patients on chronic glucocorticoids have a longer incubation period and present with atypical symptoms (Han\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020), probably due to a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance (Ma\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). In addition, some authors have found a harmful effect of glucocorticoid treatments in COVID-19 patients when they are administered too soon in the disease's clinical course (Li\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). This has led to some experts suggesting that glucocorticoids should indeed be administered, but only at the right time (Fern\u00e1ndez-Cruz\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Our results support the theory that glucocorticoids should only be prescribed in the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 (Griffin\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Ngo\u00a0et\u00a0al,\u00a02021), as it has been demonstrated that patients treated with chronic glucocorticoids during the initial stages of infection are at high risk of severe COVID-19, complications, and death.Another point of interest is the hypothesized protective role of calcineurin inhibitors via the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication (Poulsen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). This effect may provide benefits during both the inflammatory and first phases of COVID-19, where there is a predominance of viral replication (Griffin\u00a0at al., 2021; Ngo\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Some authors have reported favorable results for COVID-19 patients treated with cyclosporine (Guisado-Vasco\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; G\u00e1lvez-Romero\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). It has also been reported that chronic CNI treatment prior to COVID-19 may entail a better prognosis (Belli\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a02021). However, other studies have failed to corroborate this finding (Yin\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Our data also suggest that CNI treatment is not associated with favorable outcomes. Indeed, SOT recipients on chronic immunosuppressive treatment with CNI at admission presented similar in-hospital mortality to those without CNI. The lack of benefit found could relate to the fact that clinically targeted concentrations of CNI are much lower than those required to inhibit viral replication (Poulsen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020; Solanich\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, our findings support the idea that immunosuppression with CNI during the early stages of COVID-19 is not associated with favorable outcomes.Our study did not find higher in-hospital mortality in patients with other immunosuppressive medications, including antimetabolites, methotrexate, mTOR inhibitors, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, and anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies. After adjusting for confounding factors, none of these medications was associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Other authors have also noted that some immunosuppressive medications may not result in more severe COVID-19 disease (Pablos et\u00a0al., 2021; Schultze et\u00a0al., 2021; Han\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2020). This may be a result of the different biological effects of these medications and/or the different baseline characteristics of the patients receiving the different treatments (Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Calder\u00f3n-Parra\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021; Ward\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021).Our study showed various strengths associated with a large, multicenter cohort, but it also had several limitations. Firstly, the database was not specifically designed to analyze COVID-19 prognosis in ISPs. Therefore, some relevant variables, such as immunosuppressive medication management during hospital admission, specific IMID condition, and date of transplant in SOT patients, were not available. Secondly, not knowing the cumulative doses of steroids or the dose before the admission was another potential pitfall, since the risk of death might have depended on these (Ward\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2021). Thirdly, the low number of non-SOT patients treated with CNI limited the external validity of our conclusion regarding this therapy beyond SOT recipients. Finally, the paucity of patients treated with some drugs, including mTOR inhibitors, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, prevented us from drawing any robust conclusions about the influence of these therapies on COVID-19 clinical outcomes. However, our results emphasized that we should identify and carefully monitor ISPs at special risk of severe COVID-19, which may include SOT recipients and those on chronic glucocorticoid therapy. CONCLUSIONImmunosuppressant therapies form a heterogeneous group of drugs with different risk profiles for severe COVID-19 and death. While corticosteroids present a well-established benefit during the inflammatory phase in COVID-19, chronic treatment with glucocorticoids at the time of admission entails a special risk of severe COVID-19, complications, and death. On the contrary, chronic CNI treatment at the time of admission does not seem to have any effect on mortality. More studies are needed to clarify the profile of COVID-19 in different immunosuppressed patients, and the influence of specific immunosuppressive drugs on their outcomes.
