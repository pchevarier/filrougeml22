There was an overall good recovery 2\u00a0months after discharge, with reduced body weight and exertional dyspnea being the main complaints.\n 1.\u2003INTRODUCTIONThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic led to a dramatic number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. In Italy, as of November 7th, 2020, 902,490 people were diagnosed with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection,\n1\n and 41,063 died.COVID\u201019 is in most cases a self\u2010limited lower respiratory tract illness, but in some patients, it may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, and multi\u2010organ failure.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n Long\u2010term clinical outcomes of ARDS survivors is a topic of high interest\n5\n; over the years, ARDS mortality declined but its incidence increased, and a growing number of ARDS survivors present functional, psychological, and cognitive consequences persisting for years.\n6\n Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of survivors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV\u20101) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) showed a high prevalence of post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (39%), depression (33%), anxiety (30%), and reduced quality of life.\n7\n\nUp to one\u2010third of general ICU patients develop the so\u2010called Post\u2010Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS),\n8\n which includes cognitive, physical, and psychological sequelae, occurring independently of the reason for ICU admission. PICS leads to significant burden and costs for patients, caregivers, and society. It reduces patients\u2019 quality of life, due to an impaired physical and cognitive functioning and a delay or inability to return to work. Follow\u2010up ICU of patients can facilitate prompt recognition and treatment of PICS and improve long\u2010term physical, psychological, and cognitive outcomes.\n9\n\nThe short\u2010term mortality of invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS patients is extremely high, in the range of 80%\u201090%,\n10\n, \n11\n and the middle\u2010term outcome and quality of life of survivors is unknown. COVID\u201019 is severe and multifactorial, and it involves several organs and systems.\n12\n In the hypothesis that COVID\u201019 disease can lead to severe functional impairments after discharge, the primary aim of this study was to assess the quality of life of invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS survivors. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Study design and settingThis study is part of the COVID\u2010BioB study, an observational investigation performed at San Raffaele Scientific Institute\u2014a 1,350\u2010bed university hospital in Milan, Italy. The study was approved by the hospital Ethics Committee (protocol No. 34/int/2020) and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04318366\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04318366\"}}NCT04318366). All the authors reviewed the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and adherence to the study protocol.Our hospital was immediately involved in the management of the COVID\u201019 surge. Since the beginning, a reorganization of large areas of the hospital took place, in order to admit COVID\u201019 patients, and elective surgical activity was rapidly reduced and then stopped.\n2\n, \n3\n, \n13\n The emergency department admitted simultaneously up to 70 patients requiring oxygen therapy or non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV). In a few days, we had a total of 279 general ward beds dedicated to COVID\u201019 patients; moreover, the ICU beds were also increased from 28 to 72 (54 of them dedicated to critical COVID\u201019 patients). Healthcare staff was rapidly trained in order to use personal protective equipment and deliver care to critically ill patients. We were able to have a nurse ratio of at least 1:3 (one nurse for three patients) in our ICUs, therefore, ensuring high standards of care.2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteriaWe included all adult patients with COVID\u201019 ARDS admitted to an ICU of San Raffaele Scientific Institute during the study period (February 25th, 2020 \u2013 April 27th, 2020), who received at least one day of invasive ventilation, and were already discharged home on June 3rd. Patients aged 18\u00a0years or over admitted to an ICU at San Raffaele Scientific Institute, affected by confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection (defined as positive real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a nasal and/or throat swab together with signs, symptoms, and radiological findings suggestive of COVID\u201019 pneumonia), were included in the study.2.3. Patients managementAnesthesiologists and intensivists managed patients in the ICUs, while internal medicine and infectious diseases specialists managed the general wards, supported by intensivists for deteriorating patients.General ward patients could receive non\u2010invasive ventilation, usually continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and, in selected cases, some were treated with prone positioning while receiving non\u2010invasive ventilation (NIV). Prone position in the main ward was suggested in case of poor response to NIV, and if the first hour of treatment showed improvement it was continued.\n14\n, \n15\n We were fully aware of the theoretical risk of aerosolization during NIV, exposing staff and patients to an increased risk of infection, but during such a pandemic, the number of ICU beds for mechanical ventilation through tracheal intubation could rapidly become insufficient, whereas NIV can be offered also outside the ICU.\n16\n\nA management protocol for patients with COVID\u201019 respiratory failure was implemented in our hospital.\n2\n If the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was less than 8\u00a0kPa (60\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) or saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was less than 90%, while breathing room air, physicians would increase the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) up to 70\u201080% via non\u2010rebreathing mask with an O2 flow up to 15 L/min, and the target SpO2 would be >94%. If SpO2 was stable above 94%, the indication was to continue the treatment and monitor for deterioration. If SpO2\u00a0<\u00a094% despite 15 L/min O2 via nonrebreathing mask, the physicians would start CPAP (initial parameters FiO2 0.5, PEEP 7.5cmH2O), with target SpO2\u00a0>\u00a094% and recommended blood gas analysis after 1\u00a0hour, with the possibility to increase the PEEP up to 12 cmH2O if SpO2\u00a0<\u00a094%. Intubation was considered if SpO2\u00a0<\u00a094% and/or PaO2/FiO2\u00a0<\u00a026.7\u00a0kPa (200\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and respiratory rate (RR) > 25\u201030 after 1\u00a0hour. For mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, we adopted current recommendations for mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.2.4. Data collectionStudy methodology has been previously described.\n2\n We prospectively collected data on medical history, comorbidities, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),\n17\n ARDS severity according to the Berlin Definition,\n18\n major organ support, and outcome.To assess mid\u2010term follow\u2010up, discharged patients were contacted by phone by a trained investigator after a median of 61 (51\u201071) days from ICU discharge. The follow\u2010up questionnaire is described in detail in the Supplemental Digital Content. Data were progressively recorded in a dedicated database during the phone interview. For this study, we present the follow\u2010up data as of June 3rd, 2020.2.5. Study outcomes and follow\u2010up protocolWe evaluated multidimensional outcomes through the phone administration of various tests.Functional outcomes were explored via the Glasgow Outcome Scale extended (GOSe) which assesses physical recovery and disability,\n19\n, \n20\n the Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC) which evaluates the autonomy in walking,\n21\n the Borg Category Ratio 10 (CR\u201010) scale for self\u2010evaluation of dyspnea\n22\n, \n23\n (either at rest and during an effort such as two floors of stairs), and the Mini Nutritional Assessment \u2013 Short Form (MNA\u2010SF) which evaluates nutritional status.\n24\n Quality of life was assessed through the Euro Quality 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EQ5D\u20103L),\n25\n, \n26\n which includes an overall score self\u2010evaluated by the patient, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Psychological outcomes were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),\n27\n, \n28\n the PTSD Checklist for DSM\u20105 (PCL\u20105 \u2010 which assesses PTSD),\n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).\n32\n Cognitive status was assessed through the Italian Telephonic version of the Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (Itel\u2010MMSE).\n33\n\nWe also explored patients\u2019 smoking habit, basal working status and return to work, alterations in senses of smell and taste. We also asked the patients to report any form of discrimination that they (or their families) may have endured because of the disease.Baseline data of consecutive COVID\u201019 patients who died during or after ICU stay were collected as well.2.6. Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Stata 16 (StataCorp. 2016. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Data were presented as medians with interquartile range (IQR: 25th \u2013 75th percentiles) or as means with standard deviation (SD). Means and SD were used with normally distributed variables, while medians and IQR were used with non\u2010normally distributed variables. Categorical and dichotomous variables were presented as absolute number and percentages (%). No data imputation for missing data was performed. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Baseline characteristics of patients and ICU courseAmong invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS patients admitted to our ICUs in the study period, all the first 42 discharged home were contacted after a median follow\u2010up of 61 (51\u201071) days after ICU discharge (Figure\u00a01): 39 accepted to reply (adherence rate 93%: one patient was abroad; one had a psychiatric illness; and one was confirmed alive by the general practitioner but did not answer).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1FlowchartThe mean age of our cohort of patients was 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0years at ICU admission (six were >70\u00a0y), and 35 (90%) were males. Twenty\u2010eight (72%) had a job, two patients (5.1%) were current smokers, and the most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (49%). Mean SAPS II score was 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7, while the PaO2/FiO2 mean ratio was 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u00a0kPa (125\u00a0\u00b1\u00a061.8\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). Patients were on mechanical ventilation for a median of 9 (6\u201014) days. At the time of evaluations for the start of mechanical ventilation, according to the Berlin criteria,\n18\n 15 out of 39 patients were affected by severe ARDS, 18 out of 39 by moderate ARDS, and 4 out of 39 by mild ARDS, with two missing data. Then, during their ICU stay, all but one fulfilled the criteria for severe ARDS. Also, at the time of ICU admission, 38 out of 39 patients were already intubated.The vast majority of patients required inotropic support (33 patients, 87%), neuromuscular blocking agents (31 patients, 82%), and prone positioning (28 patients, 74%). Two patients (5.3%) received extra\u2010corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and three patients (8.1%) received continuous renal replacement therapy.The median length of ICU stay was 10 (7\u201016) days, while the overall hospital stay was 30 (23\u201044) days. Overall survival was 65/116 (56%) with no death occurring after hospital discharge; of the 51 patients who died in hospital, 46 died while still in the ICU, and 5 died in the general ward, after ICU discharge.Characteristics of the patients at baseline and during ICU course are presented in Table\u00a01 and Table S1, and results of mid\u2010term follow\u2010up questionnaires are presented in Table\u00a02 and Table\u00a03.TABLE 1Characteristics of the 39 invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS ICU patients who were discharged home and replied to the follow\u2010up questionnaireBaselineValueMissing dataAge (years), mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u2010Male sex, no.

It can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source, for the duration of the public health emergency.3.2. Cognitive outcomesAfter a median of 61 (51\u201071) days after ICU discharge, only one patient (2.6%) had cognitive impairment at the Itel\u2010MMSE scale.3.3. Quality of lifeThe overall quality of life explored through the administration of the EQ5D\u20103L test showed no difficulty in walking (32/39:82%), self\u2010care (33/39:85%), and usual activities (30/39:78%), with only eight (21%) patients reporting moderate anxiety or depression.3.4. Psychological outcomesPsychological tests confirmed low rates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and insomnia.3.5. Working statusBefore the onset of the disease, 28 out of 39 patients (72%) were working. At 2\u00a0months after discharge, despite a good recovery, only eight patients (21%) had returned to their usual job, while one patient (2.6%) returned with different tasks due to the disease. Eleven out of 39 patients (28%) were unemployed or retired as before the COVID\u201019 disease, but 19 patients (49%) were not working because of COVID\u201019 disease\u2010dependent reasons.3.6. Other outcomesWhen investigating the subjective perception of patients and relatives after the discharge, asking if they ever felt discriminated in any field of their life because of the disease, upon returning to their everyday life, very few patients reported personal (3/39:7.7%) or family (2/39:5.1%) discrimination, in their everyday life, due to their COVID\u201019 illness. No patient reported a lack of access to non\u2010urgent care (ie, outpatient clinics) because of the disease.A total of 6 out of 39 patients (15%) reported alterations in smell before the disease, and only in one of them, this situation persisted after hospital discharge. Four further patients reported alterations in smell only after hospital discharge. Alteration in taste was reported by 12 out of 39 patients (31%) before the disease, and in 3 patients this situation persisted after hospital discharge. Five further patients reported alteration in taste only after hospital discharge. Overall, 19/39 (49%) reported either alteration in senses of smell or taste either before or after hospitalization.3.7. Functional outcomes67% of patients (26 out of 39) reported good recovery, according to the GOSe. Only one patient (2.6%) complained about dyspnea at rest, while almost half of the patients (20 out of 39) reported exertional dyspnea (varying from \u201cvery light\u201d to \u201cvery strong\u201d). We found a good level of autonomy in walking (82% of the patients\u201432 out of 39\u2014could walk independently anywhere). The mean nutritional status, explored with the MNA\u2010SF, showed that 15 patients (38%) were malnourished and 34 (62%) at risk for malnutrition. 4.\u2003DISCUSSION4.1. Key findingsThis report of outcomes and quality of life of invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS survivors shows that, at a median follow\u2010up of 2\u00a0months, overall survival was 56% with no death occurring after hospital discharge. The vast majority of patients reported no cognitive decline, no limitation in daily activities, and no psychological impairment or PTSD. On the other side, all patients were at least at risk for malnutrition and half of them had exertional dyspnea.4.2. Relationship to previous studiesOnly two studies investigated the quality of life of COVID\u201019 ICU patients so far, and the majority of them focused on the need for a post\u2010ICU follow\u2010up of COVID\u201019 critical patients, due to the well\u2010known PICS.\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n\nValent A. et al,\n38\n explored the health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL) of COVID\u201019 ICU French survivors at a 3\u00a0months evaluation: 89% of patients described pain or discomfort; 47% worsened mobility; 42% worsened usual activities; 42% worsened anxiety/depression; and 10% worsened self\u2010care. These results are different from those reported by our study: 45% of our patients experienced pain or discomfort to some extent; 18% worsened mobility; 22% worsened usual activities; 21% anxiety/depression; and 15% worsened self\u2010care. This difference might be explained by a different follow\u2010up period, and by small study populations. Moreover, different ICU managements (eg, neuromuscular blocking, inotropic support) can modify HRQOL scores.Garrigues E. et al\n39\n explored post\u2010discharge persistent symptoms and HRQOL in another cohort of COVID\u201019 French patients. They compared patients managed in hospital wards without need for intensive care, with those who were transferred to the ICU, and found that most patients requiring hospitalization for COVID\u201019 still have persistent symptoms, especially fatigue and dyspnea. They also found that HRQOL was quite satisfactory, and except for pain and discomfort, there was no significant difference regarding persistent symptoms and HRQOL between ward and ICU patients. These findings are not comparable with ours since only 14 patients were mechanically ventilated among the ICU patients, and their outcomes were grouped together with patients admitted to ICU who only required NIV, while all our patients required invasive mechanical ventilation.Our patients were relatively young, a vast majority were males and overweight with few comorbidities, consistent with literature data reported so far.\n40\n We found that the number of active smokers was extremely low. This finding is surprising and counterintuitive. We had already noticed this finding when presenting the short\u2010term outcome of our patients,\n2\n, \n41\n but at that time there was the possibility of poor medical history recording during the pandemic outbreak. Nonetheless, the protective effect of active smoking on the progression toward severe COVID\u201019 disease has now been confirmed by several publications in high\u2010impact journals which have recently been systematically reviewed.\n41\n\nPrevious studies assessed long\u2010term sequelae of similar coronavirus diseases (MERS and SARS).\n7\n These studies collectively showed a high prevalence of post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (39%), depression (33%), anxiety (30%), and reduced quality of life. Previous studies on general ICU population\n42\n and non\u2010COVID\u201019 ARDS\n5\n, \n43\n patients also showed that at least one\u2010third of patients are affected by PTSD. The difference with our study could be explained by a different baseline severity or a different length of follow\u2010up. In fact, patients could show a delayed onset of psychological disorders, as reported in previous studies.\n44\n, \n45\n\nInterestingly, although patients reported a good recovery, few of them returned to work. This is consistent with what has been previously reported for non\u2010COVID\u201019 ARDS.\n5\n, \n46\n Indeed, previous data showed that it can take up to 5\u00a0years for critical patients to get back to their previous work. In these terms, our data show that COVID\u201019 ARDS is not different from other types of critical illness.Of note, our mid\u2010term mortality was 44%. This is in the lower range of short\u2010term mortality data from other groups in February\u2010March 2020,\n47\n, \n48\n but far more encouraging when compared to early reports of short\u2010term mortality which was in the range of 80%\u201090% for invasively ventilated patients with COVID\u201019 ARDS.\n10\n, \n11\n Interestingly, mortality in our cohort was higher\u2010than\u2010expected as calculated by the SAPS II score, but in line with ARDS predicted mortality based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio.ICU triage is challenging and controversial during pandemics, when demand exceeds resources. A \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis could possibly be not the best choice while dealing with a pandemic surge. The Society of Critical Care Medicine stated that \u201cThe foremost consideration in triage decisions is the expected outcome of the patient in terms of survival and function, which turns on the medical status of the patient. In general, patients with good prognoses for recovery have priority over patients with poor prognoses.\u201d\n49\n More recently, a triage consensus statement unanimously agreed on the need for explicit guidelines that would facilitate the fair use of scarce resources and the importance of triage guidelines.\n50\n\nLiterature data regarding COVID\u201019 critical patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation confirmed that the elderly have poor outcomes: a recent systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of 57,420 adult patients in 69 studies, reported a case fatality rate greater than 70% among patients aged above 60\u00a0years of age.\n51\n Data from our group, although preliminary, confirmed that age is a strong predictor of survival in COVID\u201019 ARDS critical patients.\n2\n Attempts have been made to develop objective triage scores, but none is currently being used.\n52\n Therefore, during the pandemic surge, patients were declared eligible or non\u2010eligible for intubation for age and/or comorbidities by expert intensive care physicians\u2019 collegial evaluation.\n15\n\n4.3. Significance of study findings and what this study adds to our knowledgeDue to improvement in short\u2010term survival, there is now increasing awareness toward long\u2010term sequelae of critical illness survivors. Ensuring good long\u2010term quality of life, rather than simply survive an acute event, is now becoming the major goal of intensive care medicine. Our findings are important to raise awareness about the need for follow\u2010up of COVID\u201019 ICU patients, being SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 a novel and still little\u2010known disease. For this reason, our Hospital set up a multidisciplinary COVID\u201019 follow\u2010up outpatient clinic that was operative since the beginning of April, and in 2\u00a0months (April 7th \u2013 June 5th), 453 patients were evaluated. The aim of the follow\u2010up clinic is to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID\u201019 survivors.\n53\n From 2016, our hospital also offers a Post\u2010ICU Outpatient Clinic, conducted by an intensivist, an ICU nurse, and a psychologist, with the aim to identify patients affected or at risk for PICS. This outpatient clinic was interrupted during the first phase of the pandemic, since all the intensivists were involved in the acute care of patients, but it started again in July 2020 and COVID\u201019 ICU survivors are offered the possibility to participate. Furthermore, our data, although exploratory, will be of help to provide baseline data in order to plan future studies on the long\u2010term outcome of COVID\u201019 ARDS. Importantly, our data suggest that, despite disease severity, COVID\u201019 ARDS is associated with a high probability of long\u2010term physical and psychological recovery, if the patient survives the acute illness.4.4. Strengths and limitations of the studyThe strengths of our study are the well\u2010defined and detailed characterization of the cohort of COVID\u201019 survivors and our high\u2010rate of response to follow\u2010up. Even for the three patients that did not complete the interview, we were able to assess survival status by other strategies. We had very few missing data in the questionnaire, mainly due to language issues (2 patients were foreigners, although Italian speaking) in the administration of slightly more complex tests (HADS, PCL\u20105, ISI, Itel\u2010MMSE). Outcomes are deeply influenced by age and frailty as testified by the baseline data of the first 39 invasively ventilated COVID\u201019 ARDS ICU patients who died (Table S1).A limitation of the study is the limited sample size and the short follow\u2010up time. Moreover, it is proved that the depth of patient's insights is strongly influenced by means of communication: questionnaires administered by telephone do not have the same degree of reliability as tests administered face to face. Another limitation is the different rehabilitation interventions received by patients, which may influence the reported outcomes. All patients were offered a period of rehabilitation, and almost all had an in\u2010hospital rehabilitation, while very few were the ones that showed a level of recovery good enough to be discharged home immediately after their general ward stay. Our data are limited to ICU survivors from a single\u2010center, and may not be generalizable to all COVID\u201019 patients.4.5. Future studies and prospectsIn consideration of the exercise limitations reported by our patients, future studies should involve objective measures of pulmonary functioning through the administration of tests such as the 6\u2010minutes walking test (6MWT), Spirometry, and CT\u2010scan. Also, the role of current or previous smoking in the course of the disease should be addressed in the future. Pain is a field that should be as well adequately explored: nearly 50% of our COVID\u201019 ARDS survivors report pain to some extent, and further studies should investigate its quality and characteristics. 5.\u2003CONCLUSIONIn summary, in a cohort of consecutive COVID\u201019 invasively ventilated ARDS patients we found a 56% survival rate at 2\u00a0months after ICU discharge. The overall quality of life in survivors was good, and cognitive and psychological outcomes showed no impairment at the 2\u00a0months follow\u2010up, suggesting that recovery in COVID\u201019 patients with ARDS could be better than previously published in non\u2010COVID\u201019 patients. 6.\u2003CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SOURCE OF FUNDINGAll the authors have disclosed that they do NOT have any conflicts of interest or source of funding.
