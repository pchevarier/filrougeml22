RNAPII directs gene transcription in several phases, including initiation, elongation, and termination 1, 2, 3. The C\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII contains repeats of the heptapeptide YSPTSPS, and phosphorylation of the individual serines within these repeats is necessary for individual steps of the transcription cycle 4, 5. Phosphorylation of RNAPII Ser2 is a hallmark of transcription elongation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser5 correlates with initiating RNAPII 1, 6. Various kinases have been implicated in CTD phosphorylation 7, 8, 9, 10, and the kinase CDK12 is thought to phosphorylate predominantly Ser2 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. These findings were based on the use of phospho\u2010CTD specific antibodies combined with various experimental approaches including in\u00a0vitro kinase assays, long\u2010term siRNA\u2010mediated depletion of CDK12 from cells or application of the CDK12 inhibitor THZ531. However, each of these experiments has caveats with respect to the physiological relevance. The specific impact of a short\u2010term CDK12\u2010selective inhibition on CTD phosphorylation and genome\u2010wide transcription in cells remains an important question to be addressed.CDK12 and cyclin K (CCNK) are RNAPII\u2010 and transcription elongation\u2010associated proteins 11, 12, 19. CDK12 and its homolog CDK13 (containing a virtually identical kinase domain) associate with CCNK to form two functionally distinct complexes CCNK/CDK12 and CCNK/CDK13 11, 12, 16, 20. Transcription of several core homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair genes, including BRCA1, FANCD2, FANCI, and ATR, is CDK12\u2010dependent 11, 16, 21, 22, 23. In agreement, treatment with low concentrations of THZ531 resulted in down\u2010regulation of a subset of DNA repair pathway genes. Higher concentrations led to a much wider transcriptional defect 17. Mechanistically, it has been suggested that CCNK is recruited to the promoters of DNA damage response genes such as FANCD2\n24. Other studies using siRNA\u2010mediated CDK12 depletion showed diminished 3\u2032end processing of C\u2010MYC and C\u2010FOS genes 18, 25. Roles for CDK12 in other co\u2010transcriptionally regulated processes such as alternative or last exon splicing have also been reported 26, 27, 28. Nevertheless, comprehensive insights into CDK12 target genes and how CDK12 kinase activity regulates their transcription are lacking.CDK12 is frequently mutated in cancer. Inactivation of CDK12 kinase activity was recently associated with unique genome instability phenotypes in ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers 29, 30, 31. They consist of large (up to 2\u201310\u00a0Mb in size) tandem duplications, which are completely different from other genome alteration\u00a0patterns, including those observed in BRCA1\u2010 and other HR\u2010inactivated tumors. Furthermore, they are characterized by an increased sensitivity to cisplatin and thus represent potential biomarker for treatment response 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Although inactivation of CDK12 kinase activity clearly leads to HR defects and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in cells 21, 34, 35, 36, 37, the discovery of the CDK12 inactivation\u2010specific tandem duplication phenotype indicated a distinct function of CDK12 in maintenance of genome stability. The size and distribution of the tandem duplications suggested that DNA replication stress\u2010mediated defect(s) are a possible driving force for their formation 30, 31.Proper transcriptional regulation is essential for all metabolic processes including cell cycle progression 38. Transition between G1 and S phase is essential for orderly DNA replication and cellular division, and its deregulation leads to tumorigenesis 39. G1/S progression is transcriptionally controlled by the well\u2010characterized E2F/RB pathway. E2F factors activate transcription of several hundred genes involved in regulation of DNA replication, S phase progression, and also DNA repair by binding to their promoters 40. Expression of many DNA replication genes (including CDC6, CDT1, TOPBP1, MCM10, CDC45, ORC1, CDC7, CCNE1/2), like many other E2F\u2010dependent genes, is highly deregulated in various cancers 41, 42, 43, 44. However, it is not known whether or how their transcription is controlled downstream of the E2F pathway, for instance during elongation.To answer the above questions, we used a chemical genetic approach to specifically and acutely inhibit endogenous CDK12 kinase activity. CDK12 inhibition led to a G1/S cell cycle progression defect caused by a deficient RNAPII processivity on a subset of core DNA replication genes. Loss of RNAPII occupancy and transcription from gene 3\u2032ends coincided with a shift of the broad peaks of RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser2 from gene 3\u2032ends into the gene body. Our results show that CDK12\u2010regulated RNAPII processivity of core DNA replication genes is a key rate\u2010limiting step of DNA replication and cell cycle progression and shed light into the mechanism of genomic instability associated with frequent aberrations of CDK12 kinase activity reported in many cancers. ResultsPreparation and characterization of AS CDK12 HCT116 cell lineThe role of the CDK12 catalytic activity in the regulation of transcription and other cellular processes is poorly characterized. Most of the previous studies of CDK12 involved long\u2010term depletion, which is prone to indirect and compensatory effects 11, 12, 14, 23. The recent discovery of the covalent CDK12 inhibitor THZ531 made it possible to study CDK12 kinase activity; however, THZ531 also inhibits its functionally specialized homolog CDK13 and transcriptionally related JNK kinases 17.To overcome these limitations and determine the consequences of specific inhibition of CDK12, we modified both endogenous alleles of CDK12 in the HCT116 cell line to express an analog\u2010sensitive (AS) version that is rapidly and specifically inhibited by the ATP analog 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 45 (Fig\u00a01A). This chemical genetic approach has been used to study other kinases 9, 46, 47 and was also attempted for CDK12 by engineering HeLa cells carrying a single copy of AS CDK12 (with the other CDK12 allele deleted) 48.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Preparation and characterization of AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line\nAScheme\u00a0depicting preparation of AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line.

The single\u2010strand oligo donor used as a template for CRISPR\u2010Cas editing introduced a silent GTA>GTT mutation to prevent alternative splicing 48, and a TTT>GGG mutation to implement the desired F813G amino acid change and created a novel BslI restriction site used for screening (Fig\u00a0EV1A). We validated our intact homozygous AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line by several approaches, including allele\u2010specific PCR (Fig\u00a0EV1B), BslI screening (Fig\u00a01B; for expected restriction patterns see Fig\u00a0EV1A), and Sanger sequencing (Fig\u00a01C and Appendix\u00a0Fig S1A and B). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of CDK12 from the WT and AS CDK12 HCT116 cells followed by Western blotting showed that equal amounts of CCNK associated with CDK12, and that comparable levels of CDK12 were expressed in both cell lines, confirming the functionality of the AS variant (Fig\u00a0EV1C). To investigate the putative role of CDK12 as a RNAPII CTD kinase, we treated AS CDK12 cells with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 or control vehicle for 1, 2, 3, and 6\u00a0h and monitored changes in CTD phosphorylation by probing Western blots with phospho\u2010specific antibodies (Figs\u00a01D and EV1D). However, we did not observe any substantial changes in the global levels of phosphorylated Ser2 or Ser5 compared to untreated cells. Only short exposures of Western blots revealed a subtle, but noticeable trend toward accumulation of P\u2010Ser2 after 3\u00a0h and P\u2010Ser5 at 6\u00a0h and a slight decrease of P\u2010Ser5 at 1\u20133\u00a0h, respectively, consistent with previous observations in AS CDK12 HeLa cells 48. Surprisingly, P\u2010Ser7 levels were noticeably diminished starting with 1\u2010h treatment but started recovering at 6\u00a0h. To functionally characterize AS CDK12 HCT116 cells, we treated them with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 1, 3, 5, and 24\u00a0h and monitored the expression of DNA repair genes that were previously shown to be regulated by CDK12 (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATR, and FANCI). We observed rapid down\u2010regulation of all four CDK12\u2010dependent genes (Fig\u00a01E). Importantly, similarly treated WT HCT116 cells showed no down\u2010regulation of these genes (Fig\u00a01F), and RNA\u2010seq of WT HCT116 cells treated with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 showed differential expression of only six protein\u2010coding genes compared to the control (data not shown), confirming the absence of off\u2010target effects of the ATP analog on other transcription\u2010related kinases.Open in a separate windowFigure EV1Preparation and characterization of AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line\nDepiction of CDK12 locus, genome editing, and genotyping strategy.

All protein levels were normalized to a corresponding tubulin loading control, and samples without treatment in each time point (CTRL) were considered as 1; n\u00a0=\u00a03 biological replicates and error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nIn summary, these results demonstrated the generation of a fully functional, homozygous AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line.CDK12 kinase activity is essential for optimal G1/S progression independently of DNA damage cell cycle checkpointIn our previous work, we noted that long\u2010term CDK12 depletion leads to an accumulation of cells in G2/M phase, consistent with diminished transcription of CDK12\u2010dependent DNA repair genes and activation of a DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint 11, 49. To determine whether CDK12 kinase activity directly regulates cell cycle progression, we arrested AS CDK12 HCT116 cells at G0/G1 by serum withdrawal for 72\u00a0h, released them into serum\u2010containing media in the presence or absence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, and harvested cells for flow cytometry analyses every 6\u00a0h after the release (Fig\u00a02A).Open in a separate windowFigure 2CDK12 kinase activity is essential for optimal G1/S progression independently of DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint\nAExperimental outline.

In contrast, in the presence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, cells started to enter S phase at 18\u00a0h, indicating a delay in G1/S progression by 6\u20139\u00a0h. (Fig\u00a02B and C). WT HCT116 cells treated with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 showed no defect in cell cycle progression excluding unspecific inhibition of other kinases (Fig\u00a0EV2A). Importantly, serum\u2010synchronized WT HCT116 cells treated with the CDK12 inhibitor THZ531 (Fig\u00a0EV2B), as well as AS CDK12 HeLa 48 or AS CDK12 HCT116 cells synchronized by thymidine\u2013nocodazole and inhibited by 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 also demonstrated the G1/S progression delay (Fig\u00a0EV2C and data not shown). Thus, the function of CDK12 in optimal G1/S progression appears to be general, rather than cell type\u2010 or treatment\u2010specific.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2\nCDK12 kinase activity is essential for optimal G1/S progression\n3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 does not affect cell cycle progression in WT HCT116 cells.

To examine whether CDK12 levels change during cell cycle progression, we arrested AS CDK12 HCT116 cells by serum starvation, released them, and analyzed CDK12 proteins by Western blotting (Fig\u00a02D). Strikingly, CDK12 levels were highest during early G0/G1 phase, started to diminish in G1/S transition, reached lowest levels in late S phase, and started to slightly recover in G2/M (Fig\u00a02D). Similar trends, however much less distinct, were observed for CDK13 and CCNK. We verified cell cycle synchronization and individual phases of the cell cycle by the expression of CCNE1 in G1/S and accumulation of CCNA2 in G2/M phases (Fig\u00a02D) and by the flow cytometry DNA content profiles (Fig\u00a02B).To define when CDK12 kinase activity is needed for early cell cycle progression, serum\u2010synchronized AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were released into serum\u2010containing medium and 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 was added at various times post\u2010release, ranging from 0 to 12\u00a0h. Cell cycle progression was measured by flow cytometry at 16\u00a0h post\u2010release (Fig\u00a02E). Whereas treatments at 9 and 12\u00a0h had a weak or no effect on the G1/S transition, treatments within 6\u00a0h post\u2010release delayed the transition, suggesting that CDK12 kinase activity is needed at very early G1 phase (Fig\u00a02F). Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry analyses of BrdU\u2010labeled cells (Fig\u00a02G). As an additional approach, we released cells in the presence and absence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 and washed away 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 after 2, 3, 4, and 5\u00a0h (Fig\u00a0EV2D). When the inhibitor was washed away between 2 and 5\u00a0h, the cells were able to progress to S phase comparably to untreated cells (Fig\u00a0EV2E), indicating the requirement of CDK12 kinase activity in very early G1 phase for optimal G1/S progression.As long\u2010term CDK12 depletion causes down\u2010regulation of DNA repair genes resulting in endogenous DNA damage 11, 23, we asked whether the observed G1/S delay upon CDK12 inhibition was due to secondary activation of DNA damage cell cycle checkpoints 50. However, the levels of phosphorylated P\u2010ATM and P\u2010P53, markers of an activated DNA damage pathway, increased in cells only after 48\u2010h inhibition of CDK12 (Fig\u00a02H), coincident with onset of endogenous DNA damage upon long\u2010term CDK12 depletion 11. These data suggest that the delay in G1/S progression is independent of secondary activation of DNA damage pathways.CDK12 catalytic activity controls expression of core DNA replication genesCDK12 is associated with the transcription of specific genes, particularly DNA repair genes 11, 22, 23. We hypothesized that CDK12 catalytic activity is also needed for the expression of genes regulating G1/S progression. To test this hypothesis, we synchronized AS CDK12 HCT116 cells by serum starvation, released them into serum\u2010containing media with or without 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, and isolated RNA after 5\u00a0h (n\u00a0=\u00a03 independent replicates). We then performed 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq with poly(A)\u2010selected RNA. CDK12 inhibition resulted in the significant differential expression of 2,102 genes (\u22121\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), including 611 up\u2010regulated and 1,491 down\u2010regulated genes (Fig\u00a03A and Dataset EV1).Open in a separate windowFigure 3CDK12 catalytic activity controls expression of core DNA replication genes\nCDK12 inhibition results in differential expression of a subset of genes.

Comparable processes were found to be associated with down\u2010regulation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 51 (Fig\u00a0EV3A, in red frames). Manual inspection of the corresponding processes revealed reduced expression of most genes involved in the activation and formation of replication origin recognition complexes and pre\u2010replication complexes (Figs\u00a03C and EV3B). Assembly of these complexes and their activation in early G1 phase are essential for DNA replication and cell cycle progression 52. Using RT\u2013qPCR, we confirmed that several of these DNA replication genes were down\u2010regulated upon CDK12 inhibition in early G1 phase (Fig\u00a03D). In contrast, mRNA expression of control non\u2010regulated genes but also genes inducible during G1 phase did not change significantly (Fig\u00a0EV3C). These data indicate that CDK12 inhibition specifically disrupts the expression of its target genes, rather than general transcription, and suggest that CDK12 regulates DNA replication and cell cycle progression by controlling the expression of a subset of genes.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3\nCDK12 catalytic activity controls expression of core DNA replication genes\nACDK12 inhibition down\u2010regulates DNA replication\u2010related genes.

In (G), a representative experiment from three replicates is shown.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nTo determine whether the decrease in the transcript levels upon CDK12 inhibition is a result of decreased mRNA stability, we performed transcription inhibition using actinomycin D (ActD; Fig\u00a0EV3D). Comparison of the degradation rates after transcription shut\u2010off on select DNA repair and replication transcripts in cells either treated or not with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 revealed no difference in the relative mRNA stability (Fig\u00a0EV3D). We therefore conclude that CDK12 inhibition does not influence mRNA half\u2010lives of its target genes.To elucidate whether the CDK12\u2010dependent decrease in transcript levels of the DNA replication genes corresponds to lower protein levels during G1/S phase, we serum synchronized cells and released them in the absence or presence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 and evaluated lysates after 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15\u00a0h. The tested proteins were selected based on antibody availability and their involvement in the formation and activation of origin recognition and pre\u2010replication complexes 52. We found that the levels of TOPBP1, CDC6, CDT1, MTBP, and CCNE2 proteins were reduced after 6\u00a0h of CDK12 inhibition compared to untreated controls, and CDC7 and ORC2 were reduced after 9 and 12\u00a0h inhibition, respectively (Figs\u00a03E and EV3E). In contrast, the levels of ORC3, CCNE1, and GINS4 were not significantly affected (Figs\u00a03E and EV3E). Of note, depletion of CDK12 regulatory subunit CCNK in asynchronous cells also resulted in decrease of mRNA and protein levels of the DNA replication genes (Fig\u00a0EV3F and G).Assembly of origin recognition and pre\u2010replication complexes on the chromatin in early G1 phase and pre\u2010replication complex activation in G1/S phase (Fig\u00a03C) are prerequisite for the start of DNA replication 39, 52. To examine whether the reduced expression of DNA replication factors upon inhibition of CDK12 affects their loading to and association with chromatin in early cell cycle phases, we isolated the cellular chromatin fraction 53. Cells were synchronized by serum starvation, released into media with or without 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, and harvested every 3\u00a0h for 24\u00a0h, and chromatin\u2010bound ORC6, CDC6, and CDT1 were followed by Western blotting. Indeed, we found that CDK12 inhibition diminished and delayed the loading of CDC6 and CDT1 proteins onto chromatin relative to control (Fig\u00a03F, compare points 6\u201315\u00a0h post\u2010release in the presence or absence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1).Altogether, our results show that CDK12 catalytic activity is required for the expression of several crucial DNA replication genes including CDC6, CDT1, and TOPBP1. CDK12 inhibition diminishes levels of these proteins, disrupting their loading on chromatin and formation of pre\u2010replication complexes, which delays G1/S progression (Fig\u00a02B).A tight interplay between CDK12 kinase activity, expression of DNA replication genes, cell cycle progression, and genome stabilityTo further clarify the interplay between CDK12 kinase activity, DNA replication gene expression, and cell cycle progression, we performed an inhibitor wash off experiment (Fig\u00a04A). We employed RT\u2013qPCR and Western blotting to monitor the expression of DNA replication genes, and flow cytometry to monitor cell cycle progression. Consistent with our observations so far, CDK12 inhibition induced a strong decrease in mRNA (Fig\u00a04B) and protein levels (Fig\u00a04C) of DNA replication genes, and delayed S phase entry (Fig\u00a04D). Notably, washing off the inhibitor at various times between 1 and 5\u00a0h after the release led to progressive rescue of mRNA (Fig\u00a04B), protein expression (Fig\u00a04C), and a gradual normalization of cell cycle progression (Fig\u00a04D). In agreement, the inhibitor wash off after 1\u00a0h of treatment restored the chromatin association of CDC6 and CDT1 compared to the no\u2010wash controls (Fig\u00a04E). Altogether, these experiments revealed a tight interplay between CDK12 catalytic activity, DNA replication factors expression, and their chromatin loading and G1/S progression.Open in a separate windowFigure 4A tight interplay between CDK12 kinase activity, expression of DNA replication genes, cell cycle progression, and genome stability\nA Experimental outline. AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were arrested by serum starvation for 72\u00a0h and released into the serum\u2010containing medium with (+) or without (\u2212) 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1. 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 was washed away and replaced with fresh medium at indicated times after the release and samples were subject to RT\u2013qPCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry analyses at 7, 12, and 15\u00a0h after the release, respectively. Note that shown wash away time points (2, 3, 4, 5\u00a0h) are valid for RT\u2013qPCR only, for Western blotting and flow cytometry 1, 2, 3, 5\u00a0h and 1, 3, 5, 7\u00a0h wash away time points were applied, respectively. All experiments were performed in at least three replicates.B\u2013D Removal of CDK12 inhibitor in early G1/S rescues replication gene expression and cell cycle progression.

Western blot analyses of chromatin fractions of serum\u2010starved AS CDK12 HCT116 cells treated with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 6 or 9\u00a0h or with the inhibitor washed off after 1\u00a0h of treatment. CTRL corresponds to cells not treated with the inhibitor at the time of the serum addition. All cells were harvested either 6 or 9\u00a0h after the serum addition.

A representative image of three replicates is shown.F Inhibition of CDK12 kinase activity in cycling cells leads to decreased numbers of actively replicating cells. Asynchronous AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were grown for 24 and 48\u00a0h in the presence or absence of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, and replicating BrdU\u2010stained cells were quantified by FACS analyses. CTRL\u00a0=\u00a0control samples without the 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1. A representative image of three replicates is shown.G, H Prolonged CDK12 inhibition causes chromosomal aberrations in cells. Specific chromosomal aberrations in cells treated with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 (24 or 48\u00a0h), 4\u00a0mM hydroxyurea (5\u00a0h), or control solvent (CTRL) were identified by microscopy. A representative image from three biological replicates is shown (G). Total numbers of chromosomal aberrations per hundred cells of the representative replicate in (G) are quantified (H).\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nConsidering this critical role for CDK12 kinase activity in G1/S progression, we asked if longer\u2010term CDK12 inhibition affects replication of asynchronous cellular populations. Treatment of AS CDK12 HCT116 cells with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 24\u00a0h followed by flow cytometry analyses of BrdU\u2010labeled cells revealed a 15% decrease of S phase stage replicating cells in comparison to the untreated control (Fig\u00a04F). Cellular replication was affected much more strongly after 48\u00a0h of 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 treatment resulting in a 35% decrease in the number of replicating cells and a 34% accumulation of G1 cells compared to the control (Fig\u00a04F).As disruption of every CDK12\u2010dependent process described so far (DNA replication, cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair) is predicted to trigger DNA damage and genome instability 54, we asked whether inhibition of CDK12 would lead to increased chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, we treated AS CDK12 HCT116 cells with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 24 and 48\u00a0h and performed a chromosomal aberration assay (Fig\u00a04G and H). CDK12 inhibition led to a 3\u2010 to 4\u2010fold increase in the number of chromosomal aberrations (e.g., gaps, chromosomal exchanges, DNA breaks, and single/bi\u2010chromatid breakage (frag/difrag)) when compared to cells with normal CDK12 kinase activity. The increase was comparable to cells treated with hydroxyurea (Fig\u00a04H). This result is consistent with fundamental roles of CDK12 kinase activity in maintenance of genome stability.Altogether, these findings support the existence of a tight functional link between CDK12 catalytic activity, the regulation of genes involved in DNA replication and of cell cycle progression, and consequent DNA damage/genome instability in cells.Inhibition of CDK12 leads to diminished RNAPII processivity on down\u2010regulated genesNext, we aimed to determine what transcriptional mechanism(s) affects expression of CDK12\u2010dependent genes. It is well established that transcription of many DNA replication, cell cycle, and DNA repair genes is specifically regulated by the E2F/RB pathway. Since many CDK12\u2010dependent DNA replication and DNA repair genes are dependent on E2F transcription factors 11, 40, we examined CDK12\u2010dependent recruitment of E2F1 and E2F3 to the promoters of DNA replication genes by ChIP\u2010qPCR. However, we did not observe any significant change between CDK12\u2010inhibited cells and controls (Fig\u00a0EV4A). E2Fs are needed for recruitment of RNAPII to its target genes and their activation. However, CDK12 inhibition did not affect\u00a0recruitment of RNAPII to the promoters of E2F\u2010dependent genes (Fig\u00a0EV4B; see below for RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq and RNA\u2010seq experiments, respectively). Thus, these data suggest that CDK12 acts downstream of the E2F/RB pathway.Open in a separate windowFigure EV4\nCDK12 directs expression of replication and DNA damage response genes downstream of the E2F/RB pathway\nCDK12 directs expression of DNA replication genes downstream of the E2F/RB pathway.

Promoter occupancy was quantified as read counts in the \u00b13\u00a0kb regions around the transcription start site (TSS). For each gene, we selected the transcript with the most read counts in the RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq samples (normalized to library size) in the \u00b13\u00a0kb regions around the TSS and transcription termination site (TTS). Corresponding RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq and nuclear RNA\u2010seq experiments are presented in Fig\u00a05A and B. E2F target genes were obtained from Bracken et\u00a0al\n40; rho\u00a0=\u00a0Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\nCDK12 has been implicated in the transcription of a subset of genes via phosphorylation of RNAPII, particularly on Ser2 and Ser5 in the CTD 11, 12, 13, 16, 17. To uncover a role for CDK12 kinase activity in transcription of genes on a genome\u2010wide level during early G1 phase, we performed ChIP\u2010seq using antibodies for RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, and P\u2010Ser5, coupled with nuclear RNA\u2010seq (n\u00a0=\u00a03 replicates each). In contrast to 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq, nuclear RNA\u2010seq allowed analyzing changes in RNA processing and splicing and also measuring non\u2010polyadenylated RNAs. We synchronized AS CDK12 HCT116 cells by serum starvation for 72 h, released them into serum\u2010containing media with or without 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1, and collected samples at 4.5\u00a0h post\u2010release for ChIP\u2010seq and nuclear RNA\u2010seq.Nuclear RNA\u2010seq revealed significant differential expression of 1,617 genes (\u22121\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), including 1,277 genes with diminished and 340 genes with increased expression (Fig\u00a0EV5A and Dataset EV2), consistent with our observation that only a subset of genes are regulated by CDK12 kinase activity. Log2 fold\u2010changes were highly correlated between 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq and nuclear RNA\u2010seq (Spearman rank correlation \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.78, Fig\u00a0EV5A), and we observed significant overlap between differentially expressed genes in both experiments (Figs\u00a05A and EV5B).Open in a separate windowFigure EV5Inhibition of CDK12 leads to diminished RNAPII processivity on down\u2010regulated genes\nHigh correlation between gene expression changes in nuclear and 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data.

The Venn diagrams represent the overlap between genes significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) up\u2010 (log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a01) or down\u2010regulated (log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0<\u00a0\u22121) in nuclear and 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data.B, CGenes down\u2010regulated in nuclear RNA\u2010seq after CDK12 inhibition have diminished relative occupancy of RNAPII at their 3\u2032ends and higher relative occupancy of P\u2010Ser2 in their gene bodies. Metagene analyses of RNAPII (B) and P\u2010Ser2 (C) ChIP\u2010seq data (see Materials and Methods). Each transcript was divided into two parts with fixed length (transcription start site (TSS) \u22123\u00a0kb to +1.5\u00a0kb and transcription termination site (TTS) \u22121.5\u00a0kb to +3\u00a0kb) and a central part with variable length corresponding to the rest of gene body (shown in %). Each part was binned into a fixed number of bins (90/180/90), and average coverage for each bin was calculated for each transcript in each sample. The curve for each transcript was normalized to a sum of one and then averaged first across genes and second across samples. Dotted lines indicate TSS, 1,500 nucleotides downstream of TSS, and 1,500 nucleotides upstream of TTS and TTS. The color track at the bottom of each subfigure indicates the significance of paired Wilcoxon tests comparing the normalized transcript coverages for each bin between untreated (CTRL) cells and cells treated with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1.

Nuclear RNA\u2010seq data on the respective strand and RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, P\u2010Ser5, and SPT6 ChIP\u2010seq data for MED13 (D), UBE3C (E) genes from cells either treated (red) or not (blue, CTRL) with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 were visualized with Gviz. Read counts were normalized to the total number of mapped reads per sample and averaged between replicates. Blue and red boxes below the RNA\u2010seq data indicate the 90% distance (see Fig\u00a07D and E and corresponding text) in control and CDK12\u2010inhibited samples, respectively.\nTo determine whether this differential expression is due to a transcriptional defect caused by CDK12 inhibition, we analyzed the distribution of RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, and P\u2010Ser5 ChIP\u2010seq reads from \u22123\u00a0kb of the transcription start site (TSS) to +3\u00a0kb of the transcription termination site (TTS). Genes were divided into three groups according to their differential expression after CDK12 inhibition in the nuclear RNA\u2010seq data: up\u2010regulated (log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), down\u2010regulated (log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0<\u00a0\u22121, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and non\u2010regulated (\u22120.1\u00a0<\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0<\u00a00.1, P\u00a0>\u00a00.01).Metagene plots display the expected profile of RNAPII occupancy for all three groups with a peak of paused RNAPII at the promoter (Fig\u00a05B). Strikingly, CDK12 inhibition reduced the relative RNAPII occupancy at the 3\u2032ends of down\u2010regulated genes (Fig\u00a05B). More strongly down\u2010regulated genes had tendency toward a higher reduction in 3\u2032end occupancy (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2). Little or no occupancy difference was observed for non\u2010regulated and up\u2010regulated genes, respectively (Fig\u00a05B). This phenotype is consistent with an RNAPII elongation/processivity defect at down\u2010regulated genes.P\u2010Ser5 signal peaked at promoters, consistent with a role in initiating RNAPII 6, and we found that P\u2010Ser5 occupancy was reduced significantly at 3\u2032ends of down\u2010regulated genes and a little at non\u2010regulated genes when CDK12 was inhibited (Fig\u00a0EV5C). However, P\u2010Ser5 occupancy normalized to RNAPII showed no or very little changes across the three groups of genes after CDK12 inhibition (Appendix\u00a0Fig S3), providing evidence that observed changes in P\u2010Ser5 signal are only due to changes in RNAPII occupancy.In control cells, P\u2010Ser2 occupancy was most pronounced on gene bodies with highest enrichment at 3\u2032ends (Fig\u00a05C), consistent with its role in elongation and 3\u2032end processing 6, 55, 56. Importantly, in response to CDK12 inhibition, down\u2010regulated genes showed a very strong shift of P\u2010Ser2 occupancy into the gene body and toward the TSS (Fig\u00a05C). The shift toward the gene body was most pronounced in strongly down\u2010regulated genes (Appendix\u00a0Fig S4). To exclude that the shift in P\u2010Ser2 occupancy was only a consequence of the change in overall RNAPII levels, we also normalized P\u2010Ser2 occupancy profiles to RNAPII levels (Appendix\u00a0Fig S5). This showed a small but highly significant increase of normalized P\u2010Ser2 occupancy in the gene body and a reduction at gene 3\u2032ends for down\u2010regulated genes and to a lesser degree for non\u2010regulated genes (Appendix\u00a0Fig S5).SPT6 binds RNAPII via the CTD linker and stimulates transcription elongation 57, 58, 59. To investigate whether SPT6 and RNAPII association is dependent on CDK12 kinase activity and to correlate the observed changes in RNAPII occupancies with occupancies of this well\u2010characterized elongation factor we performed SPT6 ChIP\u2010seq (n\u00a0=\u00a03 replicates, Fig\u00a0EV5D). Metagene plots show the expected profile of SPT6 binding with a peak at the promoter and an increase at 3\u2032ends of genes, which resembles RNAPII profiles (Fig\u00a0EV5D). CDK12 inhibition reduced relative SPT6 occupancy at the 3\u2032ends of down\u2010regulated genes. Little or no occupancy difference was observed at non\u2010regulated and up\u2010regulated genes, respectively (Fig\u00a0EV5D). However, SPT6 occupancy normalized to the RNAPII showed little changes for all three gene groups (Appendix\u00a0Fig S6), indicating that SPT6 travels together with RNAPII on genes and SPT6\u2010RNAPII association is independent of CDK12 kinase activity. In agreement, immunoprecipitation of SPT6 from cells showed no change in the interaction with RNAPII when CDK12 was inhibited (Fig\u00a0EV5E).The genome\u2010wide trends in RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, P\u2010Ser5, and SPT6 occupancies in down\u2010regulated genes were clearly visible at selected CDK12\u2010dependent genes (Fig\u00a05D and E, and Appendix\u00a0Fig S7A) including DNA replication genes (Appendix\u00a0Fig S7B and C). Here, the RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, P\u2010Ser5, and SPT6 signals ended within the gene body upon CDK12 inhibition rather than after the gene 3\u2032end. Strikingly, nuclear RNA\u2010seq showed that CDK12 inhibition also lead to an earlier termination of transcription of these genes at roughly the genomic location in the gene body where RNAPII occupancy was lost and the broad 3\u2032end peak of P\u2010Ser2 signal appeared upon CDK12 inhibition. This suggests that the apparent down\u2010regulation of the corresponding genes in both the 3\u2032end and nuclear RNA\u2010seq data upon CDK12 inhibition actually represents a shortening of transcripts as a consequence of an RNAPII processivity defect.Transcript shortening upon inhibition of CDK12As differential gene expression analysis is based on all reads mapped to exonic regions of a gene, it cannot distinguish between shortening of transcripts, resulting in fewer reads on only some exons, from overall lower transcription levels, resulting in lower levels on all exons.To address this issue, we analyzed differential exon usage on the nuclear RNA\u2010seq data using DEXSeq, a method to identify relative changes in exons usage 60. CDK12 inhibition resulted in significant down\u2010regulation of at least one exon for 2,110 genes and significant up\u2010regulation of at least one exon for 1,550 genes (0\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). A comparison to differentially expressed genes included in the differential exon usage analysis [2,089 down\u2010regulated, 1,822 up\u2010regulated (0\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01)] in nuclear RNA\u2010seq showed an overlap of 924 genes (44% of down\u2010regulated genes) that were both significantly down\u2010regulated in expression and had significantly down\u2010regulated exons (Fig\u00a06A). In contrast, only 123 up\u2010regulated genes (7%) had at least one exon significantly up\u2010regulated. Furthermore, 1,156 genes had both up\u2010 and down\u2010regulated exons, i.e., 75% of genes with at least one up\u2010regulated exon and 55% of genes with at least one down\u2010regulated exon. This can be explained by a relative decrease in the use of some exons resulting in a relative increase in the use of other exons of the same gene. Notably, the majority of these genes (59%) were also down\u2010regulated, whereas only 7% were up\u2010regulated.Open in a separate windowFigure 6CDK12 inhibition results in transcript shortening of a subset of genes\nOverlap between down\u2010regulated genes and genes with differential exon usage upon CDK12 inhibition. Venn diagram shows the overlap between significantly differentially expressed genes (identified by DESeq2) and genes with differential exon usage (identified by DEXSeq) in nuclear RNA\u2010seq data (0\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, restricted to genes included in the DEXSeq analysis).Differentially used exons are enriched at gene 3\u2032ends. Graph shows the distribution of the relative genomic position of the exon on the gene (relative exon position: 0\u00a0=\u00a0at gene 5\u2032end, 1\u00a0=\u00a0at gene 3\u2032end) of differentially used exons (0\u00a0>\u00a0log2 fold\u2010change\u00a0>\u00a00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).For down\u2010regulated genes with differentially used exons, exons close to the 5\u2032end and 3\u2032end tend to be up\u2010 and down\u2010regulated, respectively. Box\u00a0plots show the log2 fold\u2010change in exon usage after CDK12 inhibition determined by DEXSeq. Exons were grouped into deciles according to their relative exon position. n\u00a0=\u00a03 replicates. The boxes indicate the range between the 25th and 75th percentile (=interquartile range (IQR)) around the median (thick horizontal line) of the distribution. The whiskers (=short horizontal lines at ends of dashed vertical line) extend to the data points at most 1.5 \u00d7 IQR from the box. Data points outside this range are shown as circles.\nTo investigate whether differential exon usage of genes reflects shortening of transcripts, we determined the relative exon position of differentially used exons within genes. We found that differentially used exons are highly enriched at 3\u2032end of genes with a slight accumulation also toward gene 5\u2032ends (Fig\u00a06B). Moreover, the relative position of either down\u2010 or up\u2010regulated exons showed exclusive accumulation at the gene 3\u2032end and 5\u2032end, respectively (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8A\u2013C). Down\u2010regulated genes with at least one significantly differentially used exon (1,151 genes) showed a clear trend, with exons up\u2010regulated at the 5\u2032end and down\u2010regulated at the 3\u2032end (Fig\u00a06C). This indicates that these genes are down\u2010regulated because transcripts tend to get shorter in the absence of CDK12 catalytic activity. Notably, down\u2010regulated genes without significantly differentially used exons (45% of down\u2010regulated genes) showed a similar but less pronounced trend (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8D). In summary, our findings reveal that the observed down\u2010regulation of genes upon CDK12 inhibition generally results from transcript shortening.When correlating differential exon usage to the ChIP\u2010seq data, we found that genes with down\u2010 or up\u2010regulated exons (most of the latter also had down\u2010regulated exons) showed reduced RNAPII occupancy at the 3\u2032end (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8E) as well as a relative shift of P\u2010Ser2 normalized to RNAPII from the gene 3\u2032end into the gene body (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8F). Altogether, our results suggest that inhibition of CDK12 kinase activity causes a shift of P\u2010Ser2 from gene 3\u2032ends to gene bodies and diminished RNAPII processivity, consequently leading to shorter transcripts of CDK12\u2010dependent genes. Since P\u2010Ser2 is important for recruitment of splicing factors to the RNAPII CTD 2, 61, 62, we investigated whether significantly regulated exons in genes not down\u2010regulated might be reflective of alterations in splicing rather than shortening of transcripts. However, the distribution of exon usage changes relative to the position of the exon again showed a trend similar to down\u2010regulated genes with a\u00a0tendency for down\u2010regulated exons near the gene 3\u2032ends (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8G). In this case, strong down\u2010regulation of exons was only observed very close to gene 3\u2032ends, suggesting that these genes are only slightly affected by the RNAPII processivity defect (Appendix\u00a0Fig S8G).CDK12 kinase activity is required for optimal transcription of long, poly(A)\u2010signal\u2010rich genesWe previously showed that long\u2010term depletion of CDK12 leads to diminished expression of mostly longer genes 11. To determine whether short\u2010term inhibition of CDK12 kinase predominantly affects RNAPII processivity at longer genes, we sorted genes into deciles based on their length and evaluated the fraction of exons that are differentially used in each gene. We found that longer genes tended to have a larger fraction of differentially used exons (Fig\u00a07A). Similar results were obtained when only the fractions of down\u2010regulated or up\u2010regulated exons were plotted (Appendix\u00a0Fig S9A and B). This is consistent with the overlap between genes with up\u2010 and down\u2010regulated exons, and the scenario that relative down\u2010regulation of some exons leads to relative up\u2010regulation of other exons in the same gene. Accordingly, genes with at least one exon down\u2010 or up\u2010regulated tended to be longer than genes with no differentially used exon, but there was no significant difference in gene length between the two groups (Fig\u00a07B). Down\u2010regulated genes also tended to be longer than non\u2010regulated and up\u2010regulated genes (Fig\u00a07C), consistent with the hypothesis that optimal RNAPII processivity and RNA expression in longer genes requires CDK12 catalytic activity. This conclusion is also supported by metagene plots for genes grouped according to gene length, which showed stronger changes for longer genes in RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, and P\u2010Ser5 ChIP\u2010seq occupancies after CDK12 inhibition (Appendix\u00a0Figs S10\u2013S12).Open in a separate windowFigure 7CDK12 kinase activity is required for optimal transcription of long, poly(A)\u2010signal\u2010rich genes\nLonger genes tend to have a larger fraction of differentially used exons.

See legend in Fig 6C for the boxplot description.RNAPII processivity is affected not close to but at some distance from the TSS after CDK12 inhibition. The graphs compare the relative distance from the TSS where 10, 50 and 90% of read coverage is identified (=x% distance) in control (x\u2010axis) against CDK12\u2010inhibited (y\u2010axis) cells.Transcripts of longer genes are more often impacted by shortening and lose a larger proportion of their length in comparison with shorter genes. The plot shows on the x\u2010axis the relative change in the 90% distance (relative \u039490% distance\u00a0=\u00a0(90% distance in control\u00a0\u2212\u00a090% distance in CDK12 inhibited cells)/gene length) and on the y\u2010axis the percentage of genes showing a \u039490% distance equal or greater than the value on the x\u2010axis. Positive and negative relative \u039490% distances on the x\u2010axis indicate a shortening or extension of transcripts, respectively, after CDK12 inhibition. Genes were divided into quintiles according to gene length, and curves for quintiles are shown separately. Dotted and dashed horizontal lines indicate the percentage of genes in each quintile with a transcript shortening of at least 10 and 20%, respectively.Shortening of transcripts is evidenced by down\u2010regulated poly(A) sites (PAS) in the 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data and accompanied by up\u2010regulated upstream PAS for the majority of genes. The plot shows the fraction of genes with shortened (relative \u039490% distance\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2), extended (absolute \u039490% distance\u00a0<\u00a0\u221250\u00a0bp), or unaffected transcripts (|absolute \u039490% distance| \u2264\u00a025\u00a0bp) with down\u2010, up\u2010, and non\u2010regulated PAS according to the 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data. For genes with shortened transcripts and down\u2010regulated PAS in a 3\u2032 UTR, the percentage of genes with upstream up\u2010regulated PAS is indicated on the right. In case of multiple identified PAS, the order of preference was as indicated in the legend from top to bottom.DNA replication and repair genes are longer than other protein\u2010coding genes. Box\u00a0plots show the length for the indicated groups of genes (according to GO annotations). Median gene lengths for each GO category were compared against all other protein\u2010coding genes using a one\u2010sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (P\u2010values provided in figure, n.s.: P\u00a0>\u00a00.001). See legend in Fig 6C for the boxplot description.\nTo verify that CDK12 catalytic activity controls the processivity of RNAPII predominantly at long genes, we calculated the distance to the TSS at which a certain percentage of read coverage (10, 50 or 90%) was observed for each gene in the nuclear RNA\u2010seq data (denoted as the x% distance). When comparing control and inhibited samples, we observed little difference for the 10% distance, indicating that CDK12 inhibition does not substantially affect transcription close to the TSS (Fig\u00a07D). In contrast, we observed a significant reduction for the 50 and 90% distances, consistent with transcripts getting shorter due to the processivity defect caused by CDK12 inhibition (Fig\u00a07D). To find out how many genes are affected by the transcript shortening defect and to which degree transcripts were shortened, we evaluated the percentage of genes with a certain change in their 90% distance after CDK12 inhibition relative to their length (denoted relative \u039490% distance, Fig\u00a07E and Dataset EV3). The 90% distance was used as proxy for transcripts ends as these were mostly not clearly defined after CDK12 inhibition as the RNA\u2010seq signal tapered off over some range. Division of genes into quintiles based on their length showed that the longest genes (86\u20132,058\u00a0kb) are massively affected by transcripts shortening when compared to short ones (1\u201323\u00a0kb; Fig\u00a07E). For instance, almost 50% of the longest genes are shortened by at least 10%, while <\u00a05% of short genes are affected to this extent (Fig\u00a07E). Notably, the longest genes lose a higher proportion of their transcript length: 26% of these genes are shortened in transcription by at least 20%, whereas such shortening occurs rather exceptionally (<\u00a01%) in shorter genes (Fig\u00a07E). Metagene analyses of ChIP\u2010seq data demonstrated that genes with shortened transcripts (relative \u039490% distance\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2) have reduced RNAPII occupancies at their 3\u2032ends and show a strong shift of the P\u2010Ser2 signal to gene bodies (Appendix\u00a0Figs S13 and S14).Next, we asked whether shortening of transcripts might also be influenced by sequence\u2010specific properties, in particular the presence of canonical poly(A) signal sequences (AATAAA, ATTAAA). Since gene length and the abundance of poly(A) signal sequences are highly correlated (Spearman rank correlation \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.94, Appendix\u00a0Fig S15A), we grouped genes according to the number of canonical poly(A) signals divided by gene length (denoted as poly(A) signal content) and then evaluated changes in the 10, 50, or 90% distance after CDK12 inhibition for each group (Appendix\u00a0Fig S15B). Interestingly, we observed a correlation to the poly(A) signal content for the changes in the 90% distance, and to a lesser degree for changes in the 50% distance, with genes with a higher poly(A) signal content showing a stronger shortening of transcripts. This suggests that the presence of poly(A) signals may contribute to the shortening of transcripts and possibly explains why longer genes are more affected by the processivity defect as they contain a larger number of poly(A) signals. Since our 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data provide information on polyadenylated transcripts ends, we used these data to identify down\u2010regulated poly(A) sites (PAS) as well as upstream PAS with increased usage after CDK12 inhibition (Fig\u00a07F, see Materials and Methods). For 60% of genes with shortened transcripts, we found at least one down\u2010regulated PAS in an annotated 3\u2032 UTR in the 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data. Furthermore, 55% of these genes exhibited at least one up\u2010regulated upstream PAS and 15% exhibited multiple up\u2010regulated upstream PAS. Notably, in the majority of cases these upstream PAS were not found in annotated 3\u2032 UTRs but in other exons or introns. Recently, it was reported that CDK12 suppresses intronic polyadenylation sites 63. While our data show up\u2010regulation of intronic PAS, considering the much larger number of potential intronic PAS compared to exonic/UTR PAS, no particular enrichment of intronic PAS was observed among upstream up\u2010regulated PAS.Considering the enrichment of DNA replication and repair genes as well as cell cycle genes among CDK12\u2010dependent genes, we investigated whether genes in these groups tended to be longer than other protein\u2010coding genes and thus more affected by the processivity defect. We found that these groups of genes tended to be longer than average protein\u2010coding genes (Fig\u00a07G), though the differences in median gene length were small and statistically significant only for DNA replication and DNA repair. Notably, however, down\u2010regulated genes in each group tended to be even longer, whereas the remaining genes in each group tended to be closer to the median gene length of the other protein\u2010coding genes.In summary, our results show that CDK12 catalytic activity is essential for optimal RNAPII processivity at longer genes, including many DNA replication and DNA repair genes.CDK12 inhibition decreases transcription elongation rates in bodies of genes with a RNAPII processivity defectSince CDK12 is a regulator of transcription elongation 11, 12, 17, we wanted to determine whether genes with a CDK12\u2010dependent processivity defect showed reduced elongation rates. To address this question, we measured elongation rates by RT\u2013qPCR as the onset of a pre\u2010mRNA expression \u201cwave\u201d at two different positions along the gene determined by primers at corresponding intron\u2013exon junctions 64, 65. Initially, cells are treated with the pan\u2010kinase inhibitor 5,6\u2010dichlorobenzimidazole 1\u2010\u03b2\u2010D\u2010ribofuranoside (DRB) to switch off the transcription cycle and synchronize RNAPII at gene promoters 64. The inhibitor wash off releases RNAPII into gene bodies, and pre\u2010mRNA is synthetized at a relatively uniform elongation rate of 3\u20135\u00a0kb per minute along individual genes 64, 66. RNA samples are taken every 3\u20138\u00a0min after the wash off, and the change in elongation rate is determined by monitoring the onset of pre\u2010mRNA synthesis at specific locations in the gene defined by primer positions 64. To assess the role of CDK12 kinase activity on elongation rates, we selected three CDK12\u2010dependent (TOPBP1, MCM10, UBE3C) and two CDK12\u2010independent (ARID1A, SETD3) genes and compared their pre\u2010mRNA synthesis in AS CDK12 HCT116 cells either treated or not with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 after the DRB wash off (see Fig\u00a08A for the experimental setup). For each gene, we designed two primer sets within its gene body, one at its 5\u2032end and another close to its center. For the CDK12\u2010dependent genes, the second set of primers always preceded the region where the loss/decrease of RNAPII processivity became apparent in the RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq and RNA\u2010seq signals (Fig\u00a05E, and Appendix\u00a0Fig S7B and C). DRB wash off in control samples resulted in an onset of pre\u2010mRNA synthesis at expected time points (based on the location of primers) and was consistent with an expected elongation rate between 3 and 5\u00a0kb per minute along the gene body (Fig\u00a08B). In CDK12\u2010inhibited samples, we found a delay in the onset of pre\u2010mRNA synthesis in all the locations tested. Surprisingly, synthesis of pre\u2010mRNA of all investigated genes was already delayed at 5\u2032ends by a similar time window of approximately 3\u20136\u00a0min (Fig\u00a08B, compare time of upswing of blue and brown curves). This indicates that CDK12 kinase activity may play a role in an optimal release of promoter\u2010paused RNAPII on those genes. Importantly, in the middle of gene bodies of the CDK12\u2010independent genes the delay in pre\u2010mRNA synthesis was comparable to the one observed at their 5\u2032ends (3\u20136\u00a0min), indicating that elongation rates do not change considerably on their genes bodies. This was in a contrast to the CDK12\u2010dependent genes where the delay in pre\u2010mRNA synthesis in the middle of the genes was much longer (at least 9\u00a0min; Fig\u00a08B, compare time of upswing of black and red curves). This indicates that RNAPII elongation slows down in bodies of these genes when the CDK12 kinase is inhibited which likely contributes to or accompanies the observed RNAPII processivity defect.Open in a separate windowFigure 8CDK12 inhibition decreases transcription elongation rates in bodies of genes with RNAPII processivity defect\nExperimental outline for measurement of transcription elongation rates. AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were treated with DRB for 3.5\u00a0h to synchronize RNAPII at gene promoters. The cells were either pretreated (+) or not (\u2212) with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 0.5\u00a0h prior DRB wash off. After DRB wash off (0\u00a0h), fresh medium either supplemented (+) or not (\u2212) with 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 was added and samples were taken at indicated time points for analyses of pre\u2010mRNA expression by RT\u2013qPCR.Transcription elongation rate decreases in bodies of CDK12\u2010dependent but not CDK12\u2010independent genes after CDK12 inhibition.

Schema shows groups of genes whose RNAPII processivity is particularly sensitive to CDK12 catalytic activity and cellular functions that are especially dependent on optimal expression of these genes. The situation in cells with normal and aberrant CDK12 kinase activity is depicted. CDK12 (green oval) phosphorylates (P) unknown substrate(s) (orange oval), possibly including the CTD (blue line), which results in optimal elongation and processivity (blue arrow) of RNAPII (blue oval) for CDK12\u2010sensitive genes. Full length, functional mRNAs are synthesized (upper panel). Inhibition of CDK12 leads to hyperphosphorylation (capital P) of Ser2 (S2) in bodies of CDK12\u2010sensitive genes, which is associated with slower elongation and premature termination. Shorter, aberrant mRNAs are made (lower panel). mRNAs are depicted as black lines.\nAlthough these experiments were performed only on a limited number of genes, they suggest that the CDK12\u2010dependent RNAPII processivity defect is accompanied by slower elongation rates at gene bodies of the affected genes. DiscussionUsing rapid and specific inhibition of CDK12 kinase activity in AS CDK12 cells, we uncovered a crucial role for CDK12 catalytic activity in G1/S progression. CDK12 activity is required for optimal expression of core DNA replication genes and timely formation of the pre\u2010replication complex on chromatin. Our genome\u2010wide studies of total and modified RNAPII suggest that CDK12 kinase does not globally control P\u2010Ser2 levels on transcription units; however, it is crucial for RNAPII processivity on a subset of long and poly(A)\u2010signal\u2010rich genes, particularly those involved in DNA replication and DNA damage response. We further demonstrate that CDK12\u2010dependent RNAPII processivity is a rate\u2010limiting factor for optimal G1/S progression and cellular proliferation.The general requirement of CDK12 kinase activity for optimal G1/S progression in human cells is corroborated by our finding that CDK12 expression peaks in early G1 phase (Fig\u00a02) resembling regulation of classical cell cycle\u2010related cyclins 39. This could not be accounted for by activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, as its signaling occurs later than 24\u00a0h post\u2010inhibition, after the cell cycle defect. In parallel, CDK12 kinase activity directs transcription of crucial HR repair genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and Fanconi anemia genes (Fig\u00a08C) that are also essential for dealing with replication stress by protecting and/or restarting stalled replication forks 67. As deregulation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression leads to replication stress and genome instability 39, 68, 69, these findings combined with a well\u2010established role of CDK12 in the HR DNA repair pathway have important clinical implications, as discussed below.Recent findings show that many cancers with disrupted CDK12 catalytic activity have a unique, CDK12\u2010inactivation\u2010specific genome instability phenotype: tandem duplications 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. There are several possible scenarios for their genesis; nevertheless, we favor the concept that they arise due to disrupted expression of both core DNA replication and HR genes upon inhibition of CDK12. This leads to an onset of replication stress that as a consequence of inefficient HR\u2010mediated fork restart results in use of alternative repair mechanism (Fig\u00a08C). These defects thus correspond to the onset of HR\u2010independent genome instability resulting in the distinct tandem duplication genome rearrangements pattern observed in tumors with inactivated CDK12. They likely have catastrophic consequences for cell survival, however in some cells are occasionally compensated by a pro\u2010growth event leading to tumorigenesis with distinct tandem duplications (Fig\u00a08C). The outcomes of early stages of CDK12 inactivation were mimicked in AS CDK12 HCT116 cells documenting a progressive accumulation of various chromosomal defects over several rounds of replication accompanied by a gradual decrease of cellular proliferation. Notably, the recently discovered role of CDK12 in translation of many mRNAs that encode subunits of mitotic and centromere complexes contributes to these defects and adds yet another layer of complexity into the essential function of CDK12 in the maintenance of genome stability 70.During the course of our research, two studies suggested a connection between CCNK/CDK12 and S phase cell cycle progression: CDK12 deficiency was found to be synthetically lethal in combination with inhibition of S phase checkpoint kinase CHK1 71, further supporting our findings as activation of the checkpoint will give the cell time to repair DNA damage caused by replication stress. In another study, knockdown of CCNK was shown to lead to G1/S cell cycle arrest 72. The proposed mechanism suggested interference with pre\u2010replication complex assembly caused by CDK12\u2010mediated CCNE1 phosphorylation (directly or indirectly) 72. Our results demonstrate that CDK12 also functions upstream of the pre\u2010replication complex assembly, as CDK12 inhibition (and also CCNK depletion, see Fig\u00a0EV3F and G) in the same cell line (HCT116) strongly down\u2010regulate mRNA and protein levels of pre\u2010replication complex subunits, including CDC6, CDT1, TOPBP1, and MTBP. It will be important to determine whether CDK12 can directly phosphorylate CCNE1 and regulate CCNE1/CDK2 activity in early stages of replication as suggested 72. In particular, alterations in CCNE1 also lead to the onset of a distinct tandem duplication phenotype 32.Mechanistically, CDK12 inhibition did not affect global transcription and P\u2010Ser2 levels, but led to a loss of RNAPII processivity accompanied by transcript shortening of a subset of genes, consistent with defective transcriptional elongation. Individual CDK12\u2010dependent genes showed a shift of P\u2010Ser2 peaks toward gene 5\u2032ends approximately to the positions where RNAPII occupancy and transcription was lost, i.e., to new 3\u2032ends of shortened transcripts. Notably, our findings resemble inhibition of CDK12 by very low (50\u00a0nM) concentrations of THZ531, when only a subset of genes, including DNA repair genes, was down\u2010regulated without an appreciable decrease of P\u2010Ser2 levels 17. In contrast, we did not find wider transcriptional defects and parallel loss of Ser2\u2010phosphorylated RNAPII as observed with higher (\u2265\u00a0200\u00a0nM) THZ531 concentrations 17. This difference might be potentially explained by a residual kinase activity in the presence of competitive 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 in contrast to a complete kinase shut\u2010off with higher concentrations of covalent THZ531 or alternatively by off\u2010target effects of higher concentrations of THZ531.Overall, our data indicate a role of human CDK12 that is different from that of CDK12 homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila, where the kinase is responsible for global P\u2010Ser2 phosphorylation and regulation of elongation 12, 73. One possible explanation might be the presence of CDK13 and BRD4, redundant P\u2010Ser2 kinases, in humans 12, 20, 74. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, short (5\u00a0min) inhibition of AS Lsk1, a non\u2010essential CDK12 homolog, decreased Ser2 phosphorylation, but had only a subtle effect on RNAPII distribution and transcription 75. Although we cannot completely rule out that very short (in minutes) CDK12 inhibition globally affects transcription in human cells, this seems unlikely, since bulk P\u2010Ser2 and P\u2010Ser5 levels in cells are either not affected or only subtly (Figs\u00a01D and EV1D) 48. Notably, bulk phosphorylation of Ser7, the modification implied in expression of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) 76, was decreased after CDK12 inhibition (Figs\u00a01D and EV1D). In any case, our experiments using 4.5\u2010h inhibition identified the subset of genes whose transcription is crucially dependent on CDK12 catalytic activity. Notably, we did not find any evidence that inhibition of CDK12 affects alternative last exon splicing, as observed in breast cancer cell lines upon CDK12 depletion 28. Thus it seems likely that this function of CDK12 is independent of its kinase activity.Inspection of individual genes sensitive to CDK12 inhibition revealed a relative accumulation of RNAPII hyperphosphorylated on Ser2 on the gene body rather than at gene 3\u2032ends, predominantly at a longer distance from the TSS together with a sudden loss of RNAPII occupancy and transcription from a gene at approximately the same position. Although we cannot determine the order and consequence of events, we speculate that disrupted or slow elongation results in a compensatory increase of phosphorylation on Ser2 by an unknown kinase (in bulk, the time\u2010dependent accumulation of P\u2010Ser2 and also, to some extent P\u2010Ser5, is visible in Figs\u00a01D and EV1D). Alternatively, inactivation of a P\u2010Ser2 phosphatase or its disabled recruitment, perhaps via CDK12\u2010mediated changes in Ser7 phosphorylation, could be involved. In either scenario, the aberrant accumulation of P\u2010Ser2 in gene bodies of long genes might represent a signal for triggering premature termination or polyadenylation (Fig\u00a08C). We found that long genes, genes with higher numbers of canonical poly(A) signals, and subsets of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes are most reliant on CDK12 catalytic activity. Although CDK12\u2010dependent genes are on average longer than other human genes, we believe that there must be yet another mechanistic/signaling basis for their dependence on the kinase. Given the catastrophic phenotypic effects of aberrant CDK12\u2010mediated processivity, identification of the corresponding CDK12 substrate(s) will be of high importance.During revision of this study, it was revealed that inducible depletion of full length CDK12 leads to enhanced usage of intronic PAS resulting in down\u2010regulation of a subset of genes, particularly HR genes 63. This was explained by a shortening of transcripts due to a higher occurrence of intronic PAS in these genes and their higher sensitivity to CDK12 loss. We also found that CDK12 inhibition results in transcript shortening for a subset of genes with a higher frequency of poly(A) signals. Nevertheless, we did not conclusively identify enriched intronic PAS usage compared to exonic/UTR PAS in our datasets when CDK12 was inhibited (Fig\u00a07F). Perhaps mere inhibition of CDK12 by 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 is not sufficient to trigger preferential use of intronic PAS although slower elongation and premature termination still occur on CDK12\u2010sensitive genes. Alternatively, some of the numerous experimental differences between the studies can account for the difference.We conclude that CDK12\u2010dependent RNAPII processivity is a rate\u2010limiting factor for optimal transcription of DNA replication genes and G1/S progression, which provides a novel link between regulation of transcription, cell cycle progression, and genome stability. Overall, our study has important implications for understanding the CDK12 cellular function, origins of CDK12\u2010specific genome instability phenotype, and in longer term for the development of CDK12\u2010specific cancer therapy. Materials and MethodsCell synchronization and cell cycle analysisWT or AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were synchronized by serum starvation (for G0/G1 block) and AS CDK12 HeLa cells by thymidine\u2013nocodazole (for mitotic block). For serum starvation, cells were plated at 50\u201360% confluency onto 60\u2010mm dishes containing starvation medium (0.1% FBS containing DMEM) for 72\u00a0h and then released into medium containing 15% FBS. For mitotic block, the cells were plated at 60\u201370% confluency onto 60\u00a0mm dishes, and after incubation with 2\u00a0mM thymidine (Sigma, T1895) for 24\u00a0h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and released into fresh media for 3\u00a0h. This was followed by 100\u00a0ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma, M1404) block for 10\u00a0h. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then released into fresh media containing 10% FBS. Synchronously progressing cells were collected at appropriate time points depending on the type of experiment. During the time of release (0\u00a0h), cells were treated with either DMSO (CTRL) or 5\u00a0\u03bcM ATP analog 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 inhibitor (Merck, 529582) for the indicated times. Cell cycle profile was measured by flow cytometry based on the DNA content of cells using propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, P4170) staining. For the PI staining, trypsinized cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice\u2010cold 70% (v/v) ethanol, and incubated at \u221220\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. After washing twice with ice\u2010cold PBS, cells were resuspended in Vindal buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH\u00a0=\u00a08, 1\u00a0mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X\u2010100) containing freshly added PI (50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and RNase A (200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; Qiagen, 19101) and incubated for 20\u00a0min at room temperature before measurement by BD FACSVerse (BD Bioscience). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by FLOWING version 2.1 software.Rescue or washout assaySerum\u2010starved AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were released by serum addition (with DMEM containing 15% FBS; 0\u00a0h) and treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for the indicated time points. Medium containing inhibitor was subsequently removed, cells were washed carefully three times with warm PBS, and fresh medium (DMEM containing 15% FBS) was added. Cells were collected at appropriate time point for flow cytometry (0 and 15\u00a0h), immunoblotting (12\u00a0h), nuclear fractionation (6 and 9\u00a0h), or RT\u2013qPCR (7\u00a0h).Nuclear fractionationAS CDK12 HCT116 cells were seeded onto 150\u2010mm dishes and synchronized by serum starvation as described. After release into 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing medium with either DMSO (CTRL) or 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 dissolved in DMSO, the cells were grown for various time points and then harvested. Cell pellets were washed twice in PBS, and small aliquots were taken away for flow cytometry analyses. Remaining cell pellets were quickly frozen in dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. After collecting all the time points, the samples were further processed together.Briefly, each cell pellet was lysed in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of cytoplasmic lysis buffer on ice for 5\u00a0min [10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl pH\u00a0=\u00a08.0, 0.32\u00a0M sucrose, 3\u00a0mM CaCl2, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X\u2010100, and Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340)] and spin at 500\u00a0g/5\u00a0min/4\u00b0C. The supernatant containing cytoplasmic fraction was discarded, and the pellets were washed once in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of the cytoplasmic lysis buffer and once in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of the same buffer without detergent to remove any residual cytoplasmic proteins. Remaining nuclear extracts were resuspended in 80\u00a0\u03bcl of EDTA\u2010EGTA buffer [3\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.2\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, and Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340)] and left on ice for 30\u00a0min, then spin at 10,000\u00a0g/5\u00a0min/4\u00b0C, and supernatant was discarded. Remaining pellets containing chromatin\u2010bound proteins (insoluble nuclear fraction) were washed once in 300\u00a0\u03bcl EDTA\u2010EGTA buffer and after spin at 1,700\u00a0g/10\u00a0min/4\u00b0C lysed in 40\u00a0\u03bcl of RIPA buffer [50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl pH\u00a0=\u00a08, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% NP\u201040, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340), and benzonase nuclease (Sigma, E1014)] for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. After addition of SDS sample buffer, the samples were sonicated 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0s (amplitude 0.20) (QSonica Q55), spin at 13,000\u00a0g for 1\u00a0min, and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. Protein levels in insoluble nuclear fractions were analyzed by Western blotting.Cell lines and chemicalsHCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (ATCC) and HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells (gift from Dr. A.L. Greenleaf, Duke University Medical Center, USA 48) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing high glucose supplemented with L\u2010glutamine, sodium pyruvate (Sigma, D6429), and 5% FBS (Sigma, F7524) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless specified otherwise.Generation of AS CDK12 HCT116 cells by genome editingTo create AS CDK12 HCT116 cell line, both alleles of CDK12 were targeted using CRISPR/Cas9 system as previously described 48, 77. Guide RNA (20\u2010nt) targeting exon 6 of CDK12 was designed with appropriate PAM motif (5\u2032\u2010NGG) as close to the F813 codon as possible. Sequences of single\u2010guide RNA (sgRNA) used were the following: CDK12\u2010sgRNA\u20101: ATA CTC AAA TAC AAG GTA AAA GG; Cdk12\u2010sgRNA\u20102: GGT CCA TAT ACT CAA ATA CAA GG. The efficiency of gRNA/Cas9 targeting and activity was validated by sequencing with the following primers: CKD12\u2010Seq 1\u2010fwd: TAG GAC TTG AGG CAT TGT TAT TTC, CDK12\u2010Seq 1\u2010rev: TTA GAA CAC TTA ATA TCC CGA TGA. HCT116 cells expressing Cas9 and CDK12 targeting sgRNA were transfected with a 166\u2010nt\u2010long homologous repair template that introduced desired genome changes. The homologous repair template contains: TTT to GGG mutation which results in F813G, adjacent silent change (A to T) to generate a novel BSII restriction site to facilitate downstream validation and a silent mutation GTA to GTT to prevent alternative splicing. Following selection, individual colonies were isolated by low density plating and expanded, and PCR genotyped using specific forward PCR primers for either WT (CDK12\u2010PCR 1\u2010WT\u2010fwd: GGT GCC TTT TAC CTT GTA TTT GA) or AS (CDK12\u2010PCR 1\u2010AS\u2010fwd: GTG CCT TTT ACC TTG TTG GGG AG) sequences and with the reverse primer (CDK12\u2010PCR 1\u2010rev: GGA GCA GGT ATG TTT CTC CCA; Fig\u00a0EV1B). Positive clones were further validated by PCR of genomic DNA using the following primers: CDK12\u2010PCR 2\u2010fwd (GCT CCG TTG TTT ATT ATT AGG AAG G) and CDK12\u2010PCR 2\u2010rev (TCA CTA AAT AGT GTG TGA ATA CTG C) followed by digestion using Bsll (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FD1204) (Fig\u00a01B). Digested products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the pattern of digestion confirmed homozygous AS CDK12 clones. Initial PCR screening was followed by Sanger sequencing with the following primers to confirm the presence of the desired mutation (Fig\u00a01C): CDK12\u2010PCR 3\u2010fwd: CCC CCA TGA AGA GGT GAG TAG and CDK12\u2010PCR 3\u2010rev: GGA GCA GGT ATG TTT CTC CCA, and CDK12\u2010Seq 2\u2010fwd: GCT CCG TTG TTT ATT ATT AGG AAG G and CDK12\u2010Seq 2\u2010rev: TCA CTA AAT AGT GTG TGA ATA CTG C. Immunoprecipitation of CDK12 followed by Western blotting with cyclin K (CCNK) from both WT and AS CDK12 HCT116 cells was performed to check the presence of intact CDK12/CCNK complex.BrdU incorporation assayTo differentiate between replicating and non\u2010replicating cells based on the staining of newly synthesized DNA, BrdU (5\u2010Bromo\u20102\u2032\u2010deoxyuridine) incorporation assay was performed as described in 78. Briefly, BrdU (Sigma, B9205) was added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM and incubated for 30\u00a0min. After BrdU incorporation, cells were harvested and washed twice with 1% BSA/PBS before fixing in 70% (v/v) ethanol at \u221220\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Ethanol fixed cells were denatured with 2\u00a0N HCl containing 0.5% Triton X\u2010100 for 30\u00a0min to yield single\u2010stranded DNA molecules. Cells were resuspended in 0.1\u00a0M Na2B4O7.10 H2O (pH\u00a0=\u00a08.5) to neutralize acid before resuspending in 1% BSA/PBS/0.5% Tween\u201020. Cells were then incubated with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg anti\u2010BrdU FITC (clone B44, BD Bioscience, 347583) for 45\u00a0min, washed twice with 1% BSA/PBS, and stained with propidium iodide (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) before measurement by BD FACSVerse (BD Bioscience). Data were analyzed by FlowJo version 10 software.ImmunoblottingFor the isolation of total cellular proteins, AS CDK12 HCT116 cells (from either 100\u00a0mm or 150\u00a0mm dishes) were lysed in protein lysis buffer [20\u00a0mM HEPES\u2010KOH, pH\u00a0=\u00a07.9, 15% glycerol, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.2% NP\u201040 (Sigma, 18896), 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5% v/v Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340)], sonicated, and centrifuged (10,000\u00a0g, 10\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C). Cellular protein concentrations were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto appropriate percentage of either Tris\u2010glycine or Tris\u2010acetate gels, and proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE using appropriate running buffer under denaturing conditions (120\u00a0V for 90\u00a0min). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred (100\u00a0V for 1\u00a0h) to 0.45\u2010\u03bcm nitro cellulose membranes (Sigma, GE10600008). After blocking either with 5% nonfat dry milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS\u2010T buffer for 90\u00a0min at room temperature, the membranes were probed using antibodies raised against the indicated proteins overnight at 4\u00b0C (see the Table\u00a01 for the complete list of antibodies used in this study). Either FUS or \u0251\u2010tubulin was used as loading controls. Membranes were washed and subsequently incubated with appropriate HRP (horseradish peroxidase)\u2010conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, NA931V, NA934V or Santa Cruz, sc\u20102032) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected on either Amersham Hyperfilm ECL or UltraCruz Autoradiography Film (Santa Cruz, sc\u2010201697) using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Western Blotting Luminol Reagent, Santa Cruz, sc\u20102048).Table 1Antibodies used for ChIP, IP, and Western blottingTarget proteinCloneCat. no.ChIPIPWBSource/ReferenceCCNKG\u201011sc\u2010376371\u20133\u00a0\u03bcg1:500Santa CruzCDC6180.2sc\u20109964\u2013\u20131:200Santa CruzMTBPB\u20105sc\u2010137201\u2013\u20131:600Santa CruzCDT1F\u20106sc\u2010365305\u2013\u20131:300Santa CruzFUS4H11sc\u201047711\u2013\u20131:10,000Santa CruzHistone 2A (H2A)ab18255\u2013\u20131:10,000AbcamORC63A4sc\u201032735\u2013\u20131:3,000Santa CruzE2F1A300\u2010766A5\u00a0\u03bcg\u2013\u2013BethylE2F3PG30sc\u2010566655\u00a0\u03bcg\u2013\u2013Santa CruzCDK12U1\u20104th immune\u2013\u2013\u20131:3,000In\u2010house madeCDK12R\u201012sc\u201081834\u20132\u00a0\u03bcg1:500Santa CruzCyclin A24656\u2013\u20131:1,000Cell SignalingCyclin E24132\u2013\u20131:1,000Cell SignalingCyclin E14129\u2013\u20131:1,000Cell SignalingRNAPIIN\u201020sc\u2010899x2\u00a0\u03bcg\u20131:1,000Santa CruzPhospho\u2010RNAPII (Ser2)3E10610833\u00a0\u03bcg\u20131:6,000Active MotifPhospho\u2010RNAPII (Ser5)3E8610853\u00a0\u03bcg\u20131:8,000Active Motif\u03b1\u2010TubulinB\u20107sc\u20105286\u2013\u20131:200Santa CruzATM2873\u2013\u20131:300Cell SignalingPhospho\u2010ATM (Ser1981)EP1890Yab81292\u2013\u20131:1,000Abcamp53D0\u20101\u2013\u2013\u20131:10In\u2010house madePhospho\u2010p53 (Ser15)9284\u2013\u20131:800Cell SignalingTOPBP1B\u20107sc\u2010271043\u2013\u20131:250Santa CruzCDC7SPM171sc\u201056275\u2013\u20131:600Santa CruzORC23G6sc\u201032734\u2013\u20131:1,500Santa CruzORC31D6sc\u201023888\u2013\u20131:1,500Santa CruzGINS4 (SLD5)D\u20107sc\u2010398784\u2013\u20131:400Santa CruzMCM3E\u20108sc\u2010390480\u2013\u20131:200Santa CruzCDK13N\u2010term.\u2013\u2013\u20131:3,000In\u2010house madeSPT6NB100\u201025823.5\u00a0\u03bcg1\u00a0\u03bcg1:4,000Novus BiologicalsRNAPIINBP2\u2010320801:2,000Novus BiologicalsPhospho\u2010RNAPII (Ser7)4E12\u2013\u20131:1,000ChromotekRNAPII (Rpb7)C\u201020sc\u2010398213\u2013\u20131:100Santa CruzSheep anti\u2010mouse IgG\u2010HRPNA931V\u2013\u20131:3,000GE Healthcare Life SciencesDonkey anti\u2010rabbit IgG\u2010HRPNA934V\u2013\u20131:3,000GE Healthcare Life SciencesGoat anti\u2010rat IgG\u2010HRPsc\u20102032\u2013\u20131:3,000Santa CruzOpen in a separate windowImmunoprecipitationWT or AS CDK12 HCT116 cells (150\u00a0mm dish per IP) were harvested in ice\u2010cold PBS, lysed in protein lysis buffer [20\u00a0mM HEPES\u2010KOH, pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 150\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.2% NP\u201040 (Sigma, 18896), 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5% v/v protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340)], sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation (10,000\u00a0g, 10\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C). Cellular protein concentrations were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. For CDK12 IP, lysate was incubated with 2\u00a0\u03bcg of anti\u2010CDK12 antibody (Santa cruz, sc\u201081834) for 2\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with pre\u2010washed protein G sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 17\u20100618\u201001; 20\u00a0\u03bcl per IP) for another 2\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.

Beads were washed three times with 1\u00a0ml of protein lysis buffer and incubated with lysates overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1\u00a0ml of protein lysis buffer; 30\u00a0\u03bcl of 3\u00d7 Laemmli buffer was added and then boiled for 3\u00a0min at 95\u00b0C. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE, and Western blots were probed with SPT6 and RNAPII antibodies.Chromosomal aberration assay by metaphase spreadsChromosomal aberration assay was performed as described previously 79 with AS CDK12 HCT116 cells treated with and without 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 24 and 48\u00a0h, and with 4\u00a0mM hydroxyurea (Sigma, H8627) for 5\u00a0h as a positive control. Briefly, at the end of the treatment the cells (from 25\u2010cm2 flasks) were incubated with 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml KaryoMax colcemid (Thermo fisher Scientific, 15212012) for 90\u00a0min to arrest the cells in metaphase and allow chromosome spreading. Cells were swollen by treatment with hypertonic KCL (0.075\u00a0M) for 12\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and fixed with methanol: glacial acetic acid (3:1). Cells were carefully dropped onto a microscopic slide, stained with 5% Giemsa, and air\u2010dried. Slides were mounted with Richard\u2010Allan Scientific Cytoseal 60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 8310\u201016) and analyzed with an Olympus BX60 microscope at 1,000\u00d7 magnification.siRNA\u2010mediated knockdownAS CDK12 HCT116 cells were plated at 30% confluency 7\u201311\u00a0h before transfection. siRNA was transfected at a final concentration of 10\u00a0nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 13778\u2010150) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, to transfect one well in 6\u2010well plate we mixed together 2.5\u00a0\u03bcl of siRNA (10\u00a0\u03bcM stock solution) diluted in 250\u00a0\u03bcl of Opti\u2010MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31985\u2010070) with 5\u00a0\u03bcl of Lipofectamine diluted in 250\u00a0\u03bcl of Opti\u2010MEM. After 15\u00a0min, the mixture was added dropwise into the cultured cells containing 2.5\u00a0ml of media. If larger plates were used for transfections, the amount of reagents was scaled up proportionally. Control samples were transfected with non\u2010targeting control siRNA\u2010A (Santa Cruz, sc\u201037007). The levels of proteins after depletion were analyzed by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies.

CSequencingThis studyOpen in a separate windowAnalysis of mRNA stabilityTo assess relative stability of select DNA damage and replication\u00a0transcripts, AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were treated with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma, A9415) to block transcription in the presence or absence of 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1. Cells were harvested at various time points (0 to 5\u00a0h) after actinomycin D treatment by\u00a0addition of TRIzol reagent. RNA was extracted and relative mRNA levels were analyzed by reverse transcription qPCR (RT\u2013qPCR) as described above, with HPRT1 as normalization control. Primers spanning exon\u2010exon boundaries were used to\u00a0assess the percentage of remaining mRNA present after the\u00a0inhibition of transcription. The list of primer is in the Table\u00a03.Analysis of elongation rateElongation rate experiments on select genes were carried out as described 64. Briefly, AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were grown overnight on 60\u2010mm dishes to 70\u201380% confluency and treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcM DRB (Sigma, D1916) for 3.5\u00a0h to synchronize the transcription cycle at the promoter\u2010proximal paused stage. Thirty minutes before DRB removal, the cells were pretreated with either 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 or DMSO (CTRL). After DRB removal, the cells were washed twice with PBS and released into fresh medium containing either 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 or DMSO (CTRL) for transcription restart. The cells were then directly lysed in TRIzol reagent at appropriate time points. 2\u00a0\u03bcg of total RNA was treated with DNase and reverse transcribed using 200\u00a0U SuperScript II RT with random hexamers. Pre\u2010mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT\u2013qPCR using SYBR Green on AriaMx Real\u2010Time PCR System, as described above. The relative pre\u2010mRNA expression was determined using comparative C\nT method (2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method) with HPRT1 as normalizer. Primers spanning exon\u2013intron junctions of select genes were designed using the IDT software PrimerQuest (IDT). The list of primers is in the Table\u00a03.3\u2032end (PolyA\u2010selected) RNA sequencingAS CDK12 HCT116 cells were plated on to 60\u2010mm dishes and synchronized by serum starvation as described. At the time of release (0\u00a0h) into DMEM containing 15% FBS, cells were treated either with DMSO (CTRL) or 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 5\u00a0h. Total RNA was isolated from three biological replicates by TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026) and purified by RNA QiAamp Spin Column (QIAGEN, 52304), according to the manufacturer's guidelines. RNA quality was assessed by TapeStation 2200 (Agilent Technologies), and only samples with a RIN values \u2265\u00a09 were used for library preparation. PolyA\u2010selected libraries were made from 200\u00a0ng of total RNA input using QuantSeq 3\u2032mRNA\u2010Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, 015.24) and external multiplexing barcodes for Illumina (i7 index primers 7001\u20107096; Lexogen, 044.96) with 12\u00d7 PCR cycles for library amplification, according to manufacturer's instructions. The fragment size and quality of the libraries were assessed by fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies) and sequenced with 50\u00a0bp single\u2010end reads on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (VBCF Vienna).Nuclear total RNA\u2010seqAS CDK12 HCT116 cells were plated onto 150\u2010mm dishes and synchronized by serum starvation for 72\u00a0h. Cells were released by adding 15% FBS containing medium with either DMSO (CTRL) or 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 diluted in DMSO. The cells were washed twice with ice\u2010cold PBS 4.5\u00a0h after the release, scraped, pelleted at 500\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min, and lysed in 150\u00a0\u03bcl of cytoplasmic lysis buffer [10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl pH 8, 0.32\u00a0M sucrose, 3\u00a0mM CaCl2, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X\u2010100, 40\u00a0U/ml RNase inhibitor (Roche, 3335402001), and Protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340)] for 5\u00a0min. Cytoplasmic RNA present in the supernatant was removed by centrifugation (500\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min). Nuclear pellet was washed with 90\u00a0\u03bcl of cytoplasmic lysis buffer, and supernatant was completely removed after centrifugation (500\u00a0g for 3\u00a0min). Nuclear RNA was isolated from the remaining nuclear pellet using Tri\u2010Reagent (MRC, #TR118). 1\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA was treated with 1\u00a0\u03bcl of DNase (Sigma, AMPD1). 250\u00a0ng of nuclear RNA was used for library preparation after removing ribosomal RNA with NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (NEB, E6310S). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7760) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB, E7500S and E7335S) and sequenced with 50\u00a0bp at single\u2010end reads on Illumina HiSeq 2500 (VBCF Vienna, Austria).Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP\u2010qPCR)ChIP was performed with antibodies indicated in the Table\u00a01. Briefly, 20\u00a0\u03bcl of protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10009D) per one immunoprecipitation was washed three times with RIPA buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 5\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% NP\u201040, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitors, Sigma, P8340), and pre\u2010blocked with 0.2\u00a0mg/ml BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2616) and 0.2\u00a0mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15632\u2010011) for 4\u00a0h. After pre\u2010blocking, the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer followed by the incubation with specific antibody for at least 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C.AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were plated onto 150\u2010mm dishes and synchronized by serum starvation as described. The cells were released and incubated with 15% FBS containing medium supplemented with either DMSO or 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 inhibitor diluted in DMSO for 4.5\u00a0h. Cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min; reaction was quenched with glycine (final concentration 125\u00a0mM) for 5\u00a0min. Cells were washed twice with ice\u2010cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted. Each 20\u2010\u03bcl packed cell pellet was lysed in 600\u00a0\u03bcl of RIPA buffer and sonicated 20\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07s (amplitude 0.85) using 5/64 probe (QSonica Q55A). Clarified extracts (13,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min) were precleared with protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10009D) rotating for 2\u20134\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C and then incubated overnight with antibody pre\u2010bound to the protein G Dynabeads. We used 1\u00a0ml of clarified extract to immunoprecipitate E2F1 or E2F3 proteins. 5% of clarified extract was saved and used as input DNA. Next, day beads were washed sequentially with low salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% SDS), high salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 0.1% SDS), LiCl buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8, 250\u00a0mM LiCl, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% NP\u201040, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and twice with TE buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). Bound complexes were eluted with 500\u00a0\u03bcl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1\u00a0M NaHCO3). To reverse formaldehyde crosslinks, both immunoprecipitated and input DNA were incubated at 65\u00b0C for at least 4\u00a0h with NaCl at final concentration 0.2\u00a0M and subsequently treated with proteinase K at 42\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Sigma P5568) with 2\u00a0\u03bcl of GlycoBlue added (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9516). After phenol:chloroform extraction (Sigma, P3803), both immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNAs were dissolved in 200\u00a0\u03bcl water and 5\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA served as template for each qPCR reaction. Enrichment of specific gene sequences was measured by qPCR (Agilent AriaMx Real\u2010time PCR System) using SYBR Green JumpStart TaqReadyMix (Sigma, S4438) with following parameters: 95\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. ChIP enrichment of specific target was always determined based on amplification efficiency and C\nt value, and calculated relative to the amount of input material. All primer sequences used in this study are specified in the Table\u00a03. qPCR was performed in triplicate for each biological replicate, and error bars represent standard error of the mean of three biological replicates.ChIP sequencingChIP was performed with RNAPII, P\u2010Ser2, P\u2010Ser5, and SPT6 antibodies as described above. AS CDK12 HCT116 cells were plated on to 150\u2010mm dishes and synchronized by serum starvation as mentioned above. At the time of release (0\u00a0h) into DMEM containing 15% FBS, the cells were treated either with DMSO (CTRL) or 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2010MB\u2010PP1 for 4.5\u00a0h. For each ChIP sequencing (ChIP\u2010seq) experiment (three biological replicates were processed for each antibody), we performed three technical replicates, and from each replicate, the immunoprecipitated DNA was dissolved in 20\u00a0\u03bcl H2O and pooled together. DNA concentration was measured by Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 4\u00a0ng (3.5\u00a0ng for SPT6) of immunoprecipitated DNA was used for library preparation. ChIP\u2010seq libraries were generated using the KAPA Biosystems Hyper Prep Kit (KK8502) with KAPA Pure Beads (KK8001), and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Index Primers Set 1 and Set 2 (NEB, E7335S, E7500S) with 13\u00d7 (15\u00d7 for SPT6) PCR cycles for library amplification, as per manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were run on the fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies) to check the quality and were sequenced with 50\u00a0bp single\u2010end reads on two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (VBCF Vienna).RNA\u2010seq and ChIP\u2010seq analysisQuality check of RNA\u2010seq reads was performed using fastQC (available online at: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). RNA\u2010seq reads were mapped against the human genome (hg38) and human rRNA sequences using ContextMap version 2.7.9 80 (using BWA 81 as short read aligner and default parameters). Number of read counts per gene and exon were determined from the mapped RNA\u2010seq reads in a strand\u2010specific manner using featureCounts 82 and gene annotations from GENCODE version 27. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 83. Differential exon usage was determined using DEXSeq 60. P\u2010values were adjusted for multiple testing using the method by Benjamini and Hochberg 84, and genes and exons with an adjusted P\u2010value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01 were considered significantly differentially expressed and used, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes for Gene Ontology terms was performed with the GOrilla webserver 85. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 51 based on log2 fold\u2010changes of all genes was performed. Analysis workflows were implemented and run using the Watchdog workflow management system 86.Regulated poly(A) sites (PAS) were identified from 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq data in the following way: First, occurrences of polyadenylation signal sequences as defined by 87 as well as occurrences of at least 10 consecutive As (to exclude internal poly(A) priming) were identified in the genome on both strands. Second, windows around the poly(A) signal sequences (\u2212300\u00a0bp upstream of signal to 50\u00a0bp downstream of signal to include the actual PAS) and oligo\u2010As (\u2212350\u00a0bp upstream of oligo\u2010A until end of the 10 As) were defined. All overlapping poly(A) signal windows and oligo\u2010A windows were merged and poly(A) signal windows overlapping with an oligo\u2010A window were removed. Third, read counts were determined for remaining poly(A) signal windows using featureCounts in each 3\u2032end RNA\u2010seq sample and differential gene expression analysis was performed using DEseq2 as described above.ChIP\u2010seq reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38) using BWA 81. Reads with an alignment score <\u00a020 were discarded. Read coverage per genome position was calculated using the bedtools genomecov tool 88. ChIP\u2010seq and RNA\u2010seq read coverage was visualized using Gviz 89. For this purpose, read counts were normalized to the total number of mapped reads and averaged between replicates. Creation of other figures and statistical analysis of RNA\u2010seq and ChIP\u2010seq data were performed in R 90.\nX% distance (i.e., 10, 50 and 90% distance) for ChIP\u2010seq and nuclear RNA\u2010seq data were calculated as the minimum distance in bps from the transcription start site (TSS) at which X% of the total read coverage of the gene was obtained. Absolute \u0394X% distance was defined as the difference of X% distance in control minus the X% distance in inhibitor\u2010treated cells. Relative \u0394X% distance was defined as absolute \u0394X% distance divided by gene length.Metagene analysisThe metagene analysis of read coverage distribution in ChIP\u2010seq data was restricted to high confident transcripts of protein\u2010coding genes annotated in GENCODE version 27. Transcripts shorter than 3,180\u00a0bp were excluded. For each gene, we selected the transcript with the most read counts in the RNAPII ChIP\u2010seq samples (normalized to library size) in the \u00b13\u00a0kb regions around the transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS). For each gene, the regions \u22123\u00a0kb to +1.5\u00a0kb of the TSS and \u22121.5\u00a0kb to +3\u00a0kb of the TTS were divided into 50\u00a0bp bins (180 bins in total) and the remainder of the gene body (+1.5\u00a0kb of TSS to \u22121.5\u00a0kb of TTS) into 180 bins of variable length in order to compare genes with different lengths. For each bin, the average coverage per genome position was then calculated and normalized to the total sum of average coverages per bin such that the sum of all bins was 1. Finally, metagene plots were created by averaging results for corresponding bins across all genes considered. To determine statistical significance of differences between inhibitor and control, paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed for each bin comparing normalized coverage values for each gene for this bin with and without the inhibitor. P\u2010values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method across all bins within each subfigure and are color\u2010coded in the bottom track of each subfigure: red\u00a0=\u00a0adj. P\u2010value\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u221215; orange\u00a0=\u00a0adj. P\u2010value\u00a0\u2264\u00a010\u221210; yellow: adj.
