{"title": "A mutation in a single gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe affects the expression of several snRNAs and causes defects in RNA processing", "pubDate": "1990", "PMCID": "PMC551696", "DOI": "", "PMID": "2406130", "abstract": "A bank of temperature sensitive (ts-) mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe was screened for snRNA expression mutants using an oligodeoxynucleotide that recognizes U2 RNA. One mutant with a novel phenotype was identified that has reduced steady-state levels of the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6. In addition, the mutant exhibits a temperature-dependent accumulation of aberrant U2 and U4 transcripts elongated at their 3' end. The steady-state concentration of the RNA component of RNase P is also reduced in the mutant, whereas the amount of U3 RNA, 7SL RNA, tRNA, rRNA and mRNA are the same as wild-type. Pre-mRNA, pre-tRNA and U6 RNA precursor processing are impaired in the mutant. Genetic analysis demonstrates that the snRNA defects are tightly linked to the ts- growth defect and are recessive. We have named this mutant snm1 to indicate a defect in snRNA maintenance. The data on snm1 suggest that a single trans-acting factor is essential for the maintenance of steady-state levels of several snRNAs and for proper 3' end formation of U2 and U4 RNAs.", "author": [{"author": "J Potashkin", "affiliation": ["Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY 11724."], "href": "/?term=Potashkin+J&cauthor_id=2406130"}, {"author": "D Frendewey", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Frendewey+D&cauthor_id=2406130"}], "refPMID": ["6203910", "2410138", "6210104", "3768956", "1165770", "2411548", "3743551", "2721492", "3530502", "3793736", "2410771", "4557193", "16453822", "2958304", "3516987", "2958638", "3024969", "2959855", "3555841", "3037343", "3442819", "2411541", "954090", "3194197", "3729952", "2409453", "3537805", "3027566", "2842067", "3181131", "3048702", "2933102", "2470644", "2795654", "2953599", "2441711", "3041282", "2456570", "2837648", "3464970", "4344644", "2950324", "3805053", "3244367", "2427202", "5418169", "2909894", "2798130", "6246368", "6313211", "2414294", "3021336", "5817758", "2411940", "3031599"], "citedInPMID": ["2406130", "34352089", "10445882", "9649443", "9372950", "9365256", "9334335", "8887563", "8710510", "7616961", "2188102", "1735122"], "body": ""}
