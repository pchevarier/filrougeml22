The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. As of April 14, 2021, there have been 136,996,364 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, which have resulted in 2,951,832 deaths [2].Previous studies on the condition have observed that elderly patients and those with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are more likely to develop severe forms of COVID-19, with more complications and/or more susceptibility to death from the disease [3,4]. However, the impact of these cardiovascular risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases on the clinical outcomes and the prognosis of COVID-19 disease is still poorly understood.This study investigated the association between the level of the patients' cardiovascular risk and the severity of COVID-19. We hypothesized that patients with increased cardiovascular risk levels, compared to those with a lower level of cardiovascular risk, are more likely to develop severe forms of COVID-19. Materials and methodsStudy designThis single-center observational study included all adult patients (aged\u00a018 years and above) admitted with confirmed COVID-19 disease to the Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital in Casablanca, Morocco, between March 20\u00a0and May 10, 2020. This hospital has been mandated by the Moroccan Ministry of Health to care for patients with COVID-19. Depending on the severity of COVID-19, patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (severe patients) or provided non-ICU care (non-severe patients). Criteria of ICU admission were defined\u00a0based on the WHO interim guidelines: respiratory rate of >30 breaths per minute, severe respiratory distress or oxygen saturation level of SpO2 below 92% with 4 l\u00a0of oxygen ventilation, or neurological or hemodynamic disorders [5]. Pregnant women and\u00a0patients under the age of 18 were excluded from the study.Data collectionData were collected from the electronic medical records of patients\u00a0by a trained team of physicians. These medical investigators gathered and reviewed the data of all patients.For each patient, we collected data related to her/his cardiovascular risk level as well as demographic characteristics including age and gender; comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, etc.), respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, etc.), dyslipidemia, and other diseases and risk factors (hyperuricemia, neoplasia, smoking, obesity, etc.); clinical symptoms including fever, general symptoms (dizziness, myalgias, asthenia, etc.), respiratory symptoms\u00a0(dyspnea, cough, etc.), as well as ear, nose, and throat (ENT)\u00a0and digestive symptoms; and clinical outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation use, the onset of complications [acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), secondary infection, multiple organ failure, thromboembolic disease], and deaths.Outcomes definitionThe diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the WHO interim guidelines [6] and confirmed as per reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction\u00a0(RT-PCR) assays. Diabetes was defined as a self-reported medical history of diabetes. Newly diagnosed diabetes was defined based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria [7], including fasting plasma glucose of over 126 mg/dl and/or random glycemia higher than 200 mg/dl and classic signs of hyperglycemia and/or HbA1c of \u22656.5% during the hospital stay. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg, and ARDS was defined according to the Berlin definition [8].Outcomes assessmentA cardiovascular risk assessment was performed for each patient by the doctor who had recommended\u00a0her/his hospitalization. As shown in Table \u200bTable1,1, doctors at the study hospital performed the cardiovascular risk stratification based on the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines, and for patients with diabetes, as per the 2019 ESC and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines [9,10]. This cardiovascular risk stratification is commonly used in many countries including Morocco [11]. Based on this, patients were classified into four cardiovascular risk level categories: very high risk level, high risk level, moderate risk level, and low\u00a0risk level.Table 1Cardiovascular risk level categories**[9,10]aTarget organ damage is defined as\u00a0microalbuminuria, retinopathy, or neuropathyASCVD: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; BP: blood pressure; CKD: chronic kidney disease; CVD: cardiovascular disease; DM: diabetes mellitus; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; FH: familial hypercholesterolemia; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; SCORE: Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation; T1DM: type 1 DM; T2DM: type 2 DM; TC: total cholesterolRisk levelDescriptionVery high risk levelDocumented ASCVD DM with target organ damagea, or at least three major risk factors, or early onset of T1DM of long duration (>20 years).

Patient consent\u00a0was waived as the study included only unidentifiable data, in accordance with the national law.Statistical analysisFor descriptive analysis, we presented continuous variables as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) (small sample) and categorical variables as percentages. Patients with different cardiovascular risk level categories were compared in terms of demographics characteristics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, and clinical outcomes, using the nonparametric k-sample test on the equality of medians for continuous variables and using the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.Secondly, univariate analysis was performed to study the association between all available variables, as described above, and ICU admissions. Finally, multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association between cardiovascular risk level and ICU admissions. Since cardiovascular risk might be highly correlated with many variables, particularly those related to comorbidities, we used a stepwise multivariate model based on a bidirectional elimination, with a p-value of <0.05 and including all significant control variables as found in the univariate analysis. Results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA software (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). P-values were two-sided, and those <0.05 were considered statistically significant. ResultsA total of 133 adult patients who were hospitalized at Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection from March 20\u00a0to May 10, 2020, were included in the study. Table \u200bTable22 presents the characteristics of the study population. The median age of included patients was 53 years (IQR: 36-64 years); 55.6% of the included patients were male. The most common cardiovascular risk factors were hypertension (28.6%), diabetes (14.3%), and preexisting cardiovascular disease (13.5%). Among the study population, 46.6%\u00a0had a low cardiovascular risk level, 19.5% had a moderate cardiovascular risk level, 15.8% had a high cardiovascular risk level, and 18.1% had a very high cardiovascular risk level.Table 2Characteristics of the study populationaDizziness, myalgias, asthenia, etc.bHyperuricemia, neoplasia, smoking, obesity, etc.ENT: ear, nose, and throat; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; ICU: intensive care unit;\u00a0IQR: interquartile rangeVariablesValuesDemographicsAge, years, median (IQR)53 (36-64)Male gender, n (%)74 (55.6)Cardiovascular risk,\u00a0n (%)\u00a0Low level62 (46.6)Moderate level26 (19.5)High level21 (15.8)Very high level24 (18.1)Comorbidities,\u00a0n (%)Hypertension38 (28.6)Diabetes19 (14.3)Cardiovascular disease18 (13.5)Respiratory disease11 (8.3)Dyslipidemia11 (8.3)Other diseasesa\n16 (12)Clinical symptoms,\u00a0n (%)\u00a0Fever60 (45.1)General symptomsb\n55 (41.4)Respiratory symptoms77 (57.9)ENT symptoms40 (30.1)Digestive symptoms32 (24.1)Outcomes,\u00a0n (%)\u00a0Secondary infection27 (20.3)Invasive mechanical ventilation14 (10.5)ARDS13 (9.8)Thromboembolic complication4 (3)Multi-organ failure9 (6.8)ICU admission46 (34.6)Death14 (10.5)Open in a separate windowThe characteristics of the study population as per their cardiovascular risk levels are presented in Table \u200bTable3.3. Patients with different cardiovascular risk levels were comparable in terms of clinical symptoms (p-value: >0.05), but significantly differed in terms of demographics including age (p-value: <0.001) and gender (p-value = 0.028), in terms of comorbidities including hypertension (p-value: <0.001), diabetes (p-value: <0.001), cardiovascular disease (p-value: <0.001), dyslipidemia (p-value: = 0.008), and other diseases (p-value = 0.041), and in terms of clinical outcomes including secondary infection (p-value: <0.001), requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (p-value = 0.001), ARDS (p-value = 0.017), ICU admission (p-value: <0.001), and death (p-value: <0.001). However, there were no significant differences regarding thromboembolic complications and multi-organ failure (p-values of 0.743 and 0.148, respectively). Notably, patients with a very high cardiovascular risk level also had higher rates of secondary infections, invasive mechanical ventilations, ARDS, ICU admissions, and deaths, when compared to patients with lower levels of cardiovascular risk (low, moderate, or high level of cardiovascular risk).Table 3Characteristics of the study population according to their cardiovascular risk levelaDizziness, myalgias, asthenia, etcbHyperuricemia, neoplasia, smoking, obesity, etc.ENT: ear, nose, and throat; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; ICU: intensive care unit; IQR: interquartile rangeVariablesLow risk level (n = 62)Moderate risk level (n = 26)High risk level (n = 21)Very high risk level (n = 24)P-valueDemographics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Age, years, median (IQR)36 (26-46)58 (54-64)66 (59-73)72 (63-76)<0.0001Male, n (%)26 (41.9)18 (69.2)15 (71.4)15 (62.5)0.028Comorbidities,\u00a0n (%)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hypertension0 (0)8 (30.8)12 (57.1)18 (75)<0.0001Diabetes0 (0)0 (0)8 (38.1)11 (45.8)<0.0001Cardiovascular diseases0 (0)0 (0)1 (4.8)17 (70.8)<0.0001Respiratory diseases5 (8.1)2 (7.7)3 (14.3)1 (4.2)0.672Dyslipidemia3 (4.8)0 (0)2 (9.5)6 (25)0.008Other diseasesa\n4 (6.5)5 (19.2)1 (4.8)6 (25)0.041Clinical symptoms,\u00a0n (%)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fever22 (35.5)13 (50)13 (61.9)12 (50)0.160General symptomsb\n23 (37.1)10 (38.5)9 (42.9)13 (54.2)0.536Respiratory symptoms30 (48.4)15 (57.7)15 (71.4)17 (70.8)0.143ENT symptoms21 (33.9)7 (26.9)6 (28.6)6 (25)0.868Digestive symptoms15 (24.2)6 (23.1)7 (33.3)4 (16.7)0.636Outcomes, n (%)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondary infection3 (4.8)6 (23.1)6 (28.6)12 (50)<0.0001Invasive mechanical ventilation1 (1.6)4 (15.4)2 (9.5)7 (29.2)0.001ARDS2 (3.2)3 (11.5)2 (9.5)6 (25)0.017Thromboembolic complications2 (3.2)0 (0)1 (4.8)1 (4.2)0.743Multi-organ failure2 (3.2)2 (7.7)1 (4.8)4 (16.7)0.148ICU admissions6 (9.7)9 (34.6)11 (52.4)20 (83.3)<0.0001Death1 (1.6)2 (7.7)2 (9.5)9 (37.5)<0.0001Open in a separate windowFor the univariate analysis (Table \u200b(Table4),4), we found that the cardiovascular risk level was associated with ICU admission. In fact, compared to patients with a low level of cardiovascular risk,\u00a0only those patients with a very high level of cardiovascular risk were more likely to require ICU admission [OR = 46.67, 95% CI: (11.93-182.60)]. Furthermore,\u00a0patients with a very high cardiovascular risk level were still more likely to require ICU admission\u00a0when compared with all other patients including those with low, moderate, or high levels of cardiovascular risk [OR = 15.96, 95% CI: (5.00-50.94)].\u00a0Table 4Association of cardiovascular risk with ICU admissionaIn this model, we included the patient's \"cardiovascular risk\" with four dummy variables (low level, moderate level, high level, and very high level)\u00a0bIn this model, we included the variable \"very high cardiovascular risk level\" onlycDizziness, myalgias, asthenia, etc.dHyperuricemia, neoplasia, smoking, obesity, etc.ICU: intensive care unit; ENT: ear, nose, and throat; OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence intervalVariablesUnivariate model, OR (95% CI)Multivariate modela, OR (95% CI)Multivariate modelb, OR (95% CI)Demographics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Age, years1.08 (1.05-1.11)1.05 (1.00-1.11)1.07 (1.03-1.11)Male3.92 (1.76-8.70)3.19 (1.05-9.69)3.24 (1.07-9.81)Cardiovascular risk\u00a0\u00a0Low level11\u00a0Moderate level4.94 (1.54-15.87)1.64 (0.34-7.98)\u00a0High level10.27 (3.09-34.12)2.17 (0.32-14.68)\u00a0Very high level46.67 (11.93-182.60)11.94 (1.34-106.78)\u00a0Very high cardiovascular risk levelNo11\u00a0Yes15.96 (5.00-50.94)\u00a06.42 (1.45-28.30)Comorbidities\u00a0\u00a0Hypertension4.80 (2.15-10.71)\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes4.03 (1.46-11.13)\u00a0\u00a0Cardiovascular diseases13.55 (3.67-50.02)\u00a0\u00a0Respiratory diseases2.46 (0.71-8.55)\u00a0\u00a0Dyslipidemia1.65 (0.47-5.72)\u00a0\u00a0Other diseasesc\n3.75 (1.27-11.10)5.95 (1.20-29.41)6.55 (1.33-32.19)Clinical symptoms\u00a0\u00a0Fever2.33 (1.12-4.82)\u00a0\u00a0General symptomsd\n1.97 (0.95-4.07)\u00a0\u00a0Respiratory symptoms4.83 (2.08-11.21)6.24 (1.96-19.84)6.51 (2.06-20.58)ENT symptoms1.03 (0.47-2.23)\u00a0\u00a0Digestive symptoms1.18 (0.52-2.70)\u00a0\u00a0Open in a separate windowFor the multivariate analysis (Table \u200b(Table4),4), we found that patients having\u00a0very high cardiovascular risk levels were independently associated with ICU admission. Indeed, these patients with a very high cardiovascular risk level were more likely to\u00a0require ICU admission when compared with patients with low cardiovascular risk level [OR = 11.94, 95% CI: (1.34-106.78)] and also\u00a0when compared with all other patients including those with a low, moderate, or high levels of cardiovascular risk [OR = 6.42, 95% CI: (1.45-28.30)]. DiscussionIn this study, we investigated\u00a0the association of cardiovascular risk levels of the patients with the severity of COVID-19 disease; this is the first major study involving an African population\u00a0with COVID-19. The patients' level of cardiovascular risk was assessed by the doctor who had recommended their hospitalization, following the\u00a02019 ESC, EAS, and EASD guidelines [9,10].Patients with a very high level of cardiovascular risk had a significantly higher rate of complications including secondary infection and ARDS. In addition, these patients also showed generally poorer clinical outcomes. More than four-fifths of them were admitted to the ICU and about one-third of them required invasive mechanical ventilation. The death rate was also higher among\u00a0patients with a very high cardiovascular risk level. Interestingly, we found that a patient's very high cardiovascular risk level was strongly and independently associated with ICU admissions.These findings are in agreement with previous reports that have linked worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection with cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular infarction. Indeed, Wang et al. have reported higher rates of ICU admissions in patients with several comorbidities [12]. Furthermore, a recent prospective study involving an American cohort of 5,279 patients\u00a0with COVID-19 has shown that advanced age followed by heart failure were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness [13].Similarly, a study that involved an Italian cohort of 1,591 infected patients with COVID-19 in the Lombardy region has shown that 68% of the patients admitted in ICU units were elderly individuals and had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities\u00a0in this study were hypertension (49%) followed by cardiovascular disease (21%)\u00a0and hypercholesterolemia (18%) [14].Moreover, Guan et al. have reported that\u00a0among 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease from 552 hospitals in 30 Chinese provinces, hypertension and diabetes were strongly associated with admission to the ICU unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, and death as a composite endpoint [15]. Likewise, the reported mortality rate was higher in patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases than patients without comorbidities [16]. WU et al. have reported that among patients who succumbed to the disease, 10.5% had cardiovascular disease, 7.3% had diabetes, and 6% had hypertension [4]. Also, Li et al. have reported clinical characteristics of 25 death cases infected with COVID-19 pneumonia and found that among them, 64% had hypertension, 40% had diabetes, 32% had heart diseases, 20% had kidney diseases, and 16% had cerebral infarction [17]. Similarly, an Italian study\u00a0that described the characteristics of patients who died as a result of COVID-19 has observed that deceased patients were predominantly elderly males with multiple comorbidities [18].Several mechanisms may be attributed to the association of cardiovascular risk factors with worse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Patients with a higher level of cardiovascular risk may have a lower grade of vascular inflammation, which combines with the immune response induced by the virus and leads to an aggravation of the inflammatory state [19]. Secondly, the procoagulant state reported in COVID-19 may increase the risk of thromboembolic and acute cardiovascular events, by activating prothrombotic factors in atheromatous plaque [20]. Finally, previous studies have reported a significant association of myocardial injury with fatal outcomes of COVID-19 [21]. Consequently, patients with cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to have a severe form of COVID-19.LimitationsOur study has some limitations. Firstly, it was observational by design, and hence further multicentric prospective and/or retrospective studies are required to validate our results. Secondly, only 133 patients were included in the study, and a larger study including more participants is highly recommended in order to verify our results. Thirdly, our assessment of COVID-19 severity was based on ICU admissions, and factors related to disease progression were not analyzed extensively. Finally, this was a single-center study, and this may have led to some biases in the results. Therefore, further multicenter studies are recommended to rectify this issue. ConclusionsThis study found that an increased level of cardiovascular risk seems to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Further studies need to be conducted in order to study the mechanisms that induce and aggravate the severity of COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Our findings also highlight\u00a0the need for early assessment of cardiovascular risk levels in all patients with COVID-19, as well as implementing a priority vaccination strategy for patients with cardiovascular diseases.
