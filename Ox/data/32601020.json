In this review, we summarise the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection and propose a simplified algorithm for patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic.Keywords: COVID, Coronavirus, CV disease, Myocarditis BackgroundCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated in the Wuhan province of China in late 2019 and is a serious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2002 [1]. The infection has spread globally and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March, 2020. The number of confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise daily.The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 may range from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe life threating respiratory and cardiac failure (Tables\u00a01 and \u200band2\n,2\n, Figure\u00a01\n) [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Among 72,314 patients with COVID-19 in China, the clinical severity was reported as mild in 81.4%, severe in 13.9% and critical in 4.7% of patients [2]. In a recent study from New York, the most common presenting symptoms were cough (79.4%), fever (77.1%), dyspnoea (56.5%), myalgias (23.8%), diarrhoea (23.7%), and nausea and vomiting (19.1%) [7]. The primary cause of death in COVID-19 infection is respiratory failure but cardiac manifestations may contribute to overall mortality and even be the primary cause of death in these patients (Table\u00a03\n) [3,[7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Concomitant cardiovascular (CV) conditions are present in 8\u201325% of\u00a0overall COVID-19 infected population and in a higher proportion of those who die [7,10,[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. A meta-analysis of eight studies from China (46,248 patients) showed a higher prevalence of hypertension (17\u00b17%) and diabetes mellitus (8\u00b16%) followed by cardiovascular disease (5\u00b14%) in COVID-19 patients [10]. In another analysis of 44,672 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a higher case fatality rate was noted among patients with pre-existing comorbid conditions (10.5% for CV disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer) compared to the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% in the entire cohort [2]. Medications used for the treatment of COVID-19 infection can also increase overall cardiovascular risk [12].Table\u00a01Stages of COVID-19 infection.StagesPathogenesisSymptomsSignsProposed Therapeutic StrategiesBased on Limited Data1Viral response/early infectionConstitutional RespiratoryGastrointestinalMild leukopaenia, lymphopenia.

Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of which S protein mediates the viral entry into host\u00a0cells [17,18]. The virus exhibits strong binding to cell-associated and soluble angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors expressed in many organs such as the heart, kidneys, intestine, lung, brain and liver [19,20]. COVID-19 infected patients thus present with a spectrum of atypical gastrointestinal manifestations, cardiac and renal injury, neurological and acute respiratory symptoms [16,19,21]. In the lungs, the virus leads to endothelial and microvascular dysfunction, alveolar exudative inflammation, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and focal bleeding which causes severe respiratory manifestation of the disease [[22], [23], [24]]. Coronavirus particles have been observed in the ciliated columnar epithelial cells of bronchiolar mucosa [23].After gaining entry into the cells via ACE2 receptors, SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates the ACE2 expression such that the enzyme is unable to exert organ protective effects [25]. ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) upregulate the number of ACE2 receptors on the surface of myocardial, alveolar and gastrointestinal cells which has raised the concern of ACEI and ARB induced increase in COVID-19 acquisition into the myocardial and alveolar cells [19,22,26,27]. However, renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade has been shown to reduce the exposure to SARS-CoV-1 spike protein induced acute lung injury in experimental mouse models [19,[28], [29], [30], [31]]. A lower rate of severe COVID-19 disease and a trend toward a lower level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in the peripheral blood and a decreased peak viral load has been observed in patients taking ACEI and ARB [32]. ACEI and ARB therapy may therefore be protective in low level viraemia and trials of losartan on COVID-19 patients are ongoing [9,25,33,34].COVID-19 related immune response may be multiphasic as illustrated in a recent elegant article by Siddiqi et\u00a0al. (Table\u00a01) [4].Similar to an influenza outbreak, myocardial injury due to COVID-19 may be related to increased viscosity, heightened coagulation cascade, pro-inflammatory effects or endothelial cell dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus [35,36]. In a recent study of COVID-19 patients, there was cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, degeneration and necrosis of cardiomyocytes, mild interstitial hyperaemia and oedema along with infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils but no virus component in the myocardial tissue [23,37]. In another autopsy report, there was scattered individual cell myocyte necrosis with lymphocytes adjacent to, but not surrounding, degenerating myocytes, which may represent an early manifestation of a viral myocarditis [24]. The pericytes may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus and cause capillary endothelial cell or microvascular dysfunction leading to individual cell necrosis [[22], [23], [24]]. Myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 infection could be multifactorial which include atherosclerotic plaque rupture, coronary vasospasm, hypoxic injury to the vasculature, direct endothelial or formation of microthrombi [37]. Myocardial injury and fulminant myocarditis can occur from direct viraemic effect on the myocardial cells and secondary effects from the body's hyperimmune response to the virus and overall systemic inflammatory response [9].Increasing levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients, possibly due to cytokine storm or secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [11,[38], [39], [40], [41]]. SARS-CoV-2 can activate the coagulation cascade leading to thrombocytopaenia and sometimes severe hypercoagulability and its sequelae such as ischaemia of the finger and toes [10,42,43]. The higher incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism despite prophylactic anticoagulation in these patients is likely due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation, and some physicians have even used tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with some improvement in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [44,45]. Cardiovascular Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2Myocardial Injury, Acute Coronary Syndrome and MyocarditisMyocardial injury, defined as elevation in cardiac troponin concentration above the 99th percentile of upper reference limit, has been observed in 7\u201317% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients [10,38,39,[46], [47], [48], [49]]. Furthermore, the incidence of myocardial injury as reported from China increases with the severity of illness, rising to 22.2% of patients needing ICU care and 59% of patients that died [10,50]. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be one of the initial presentations of COVID-19 infection which may range from ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [10,41,51]. Myocardial ischaemia and infarction could be secondary to plaque rupture triggered by a virus-induced stress response or from thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulability [10,36]. Myocardial supply-demand mismatch can cause Type 2 MI [46]. In a recent series of 18 COVID patients from New York, who had STEMI during initial presentation (n=10) or during hospitalisation (n=8), there was variability in presentation, a high prevalence of nonobstructive disease (33% of those who underwent cardiac catheterisation), and a poor prognosis (72% mortality) [41]. Acute virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection, with some reports showing improvement in cardiac biomarkers after treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxycholoroquine [52,53]. Any rise in serum troponin level should be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario and results of further evaluation by invasive angiography or coronary computed tomography (CT) angiogram (Table 4\n) [54]. High risk patients may need admission to the hospital for further management as per clinical practice guidelines but low risk patients can be discharged from the emergency department after discussing the appropriate follow-up plan in case of recurrent symptoms [55].Table\u00a04Procedures during COVID-19 infection.Noninvasive Procedures\u00a0Transthoracic echocardiogram\u2022 Suspected HF, ACS or new arrhythmia due to cardiomyopathy\u2022 Consider focussed protocol pertaining to diagnosis of interest.\u2022 Do bedside echocardiogram first when feasible and limit frequent echo\u00a0Transoesophageal echocardiogram\u2022 High-risk for aerosolisation, and use should be restricted unless absolutely essential for a diagnosis that will change short-term management.\u2022 Assess for endocarditis only if Duke Criteria met and transthoracic not diagnostic.\u2022 Pre cardioversion, only if patient unstable or unsafe to wait for 4 weeks on anticoagulation\u2022 Severe valvular regurgitation or stenosis if urgent intervention planned or if diagnosis unclear by transthoracic echocardiogram.\u2022 Mechanical complication from myocardial infarction when not fully assessed by TTE or catheterisation\u00a0Cardiac MRI and CT\u2022 Cardiac CT angiogram in stable NSTEMI or diagnostic uncertainty in ACS cases.\u2022 Cardiac MRI if myocarditis diagnosis would change treatment approach.Invasive Procedures\u00a0Interventional/Structural\u2022 Unnecessary, non-urgent procedures pose high risk to health care providers.\u2022 Consider bedside procedures when feasible to minimise risk.\u2022 Coronary angiogram for STEMI and high-risk NSTEMI\u2022 Right heart catheterisation: Avoid unless necessary, e.g., HF diagnosis uncertain and clinical suspicion of mixed or refractory shock where information will change management.\u2022 No routine endomyocardial biopsy in stable patients.\u00a0Electrophysiology\u2022 Urgent procedures only, e.g, pacemakers, ICD for secondary prevention, ablation for haemodynamically significant arrhythmia not controlled with medications or cardioversion, cardioversion for symptomatic arrhythmia, lead revision for a pacemaker dependent patient, generator change for battery at end of life for a pacemaker dependent patient.\u2022 Defer non-urgent procedures, SVT, VT ablation, AF ablation in the stable patient.Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator; VT, ventricular tachycardia; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia; ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator; AF, atrial fibrillation; HF, heart failure; STEMI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction; NSTEMI, non ST-elevation myocardial infarction; CT, computed tomography; ACS, acute coronary syndrome; TTE, transthoracic echocardiogram.Cardiac ArrhythmiaElevated cytokine levels can lead to a systemic inflammatory response and myocardial injury, both of which can predispose to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. New onset malignant tachyarrhythmias, such as sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and polymorphic VT in the setting of elevated cardiac biomarkers, should raise the suspicion for myocarditis. In 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in Hubei province, heart palpitations were noted as one of the presenting symptoms in 7.3% of patients [15,56]. In another study of 138 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, arrhythmia was noted in 16.7% of patients and was more common in those patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) compared to non-ICU patients (44.4% vs. 6.9%, p<0.001) [50]. There have been reports of complete heart block and atrial fibrillation in patients with COVID-19 infection [57,58].Heart Failure and Cardiogenic ShockIncreased inflammatory cytokines and respiratory distress can cause exacerbation of pre-existing left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or lead to a new onset cardiomyopathy. New onset LV dysfunction may represent myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy or myocardial ischaemia, all of which increase the risk of death [10]. In a study by Zhou et\u00a0al., the incidence of heart failure was significantly higher in non survivors from the infection compared to survivors (52% vs 12%, p\u22640\u00b70001) [10]. Right heart failure is likely to occur due to elevated pulmonary artery pressure from pulmonary complications [16]. In early stages, exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction can occur due to aggressive fluid resuscitation attempts, and in the later stages of disease when cytokine levels rise, acute systolic heart failure leading to cardiogenic shock has been reported [10]. Cardiac Effects of COVID-19 TreatmentThe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection and medication side effects pose challenges to physicians taking care of these patients. Various antivirals, antimalarial and immunomodulating medications, glucocorticoids and convalescent plasma from recovered patients have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 with variable results (Table\u00a05\n) [3,50,[59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]]. The Infectious Disease Society of America recently published guidelines regarding COVID-19 treatment (Table\u00a06\n) [67]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cause alkalinisation of the intracellular phagolysosome and thus cause under-glycosylation of ACE2 receptors required for cellular entry of COVID-19, which prevents virion fusion and uncoating [59,60]. Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has been shown to decrease viral carriage in recent small studies [59]. However, there was no evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement in a recent French study of 181 patients [68]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been used in small studies of COVID-19 patients with variable clinical outcomes, carry a risk of prolonging the QTc interval and torsade de pointes due to blockade of the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel [59,60,69,70]. Electrolyte abnormalities and concomitant use of QT prolonging agents may further increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias in these high risk patients [69]. Chloroquine can also inhibit CYP2D6 which will, in turn, raise the levels of beta blockers (metoprolol and carvedilol) and thus necessitate close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate [71].Table\u00a05Medications used in COVID-19 infection and drug interaction.COVID TherapyInteractionCardiovascular Related EffectsChloroquine hydroxychloroquineInhibition of lysosomal enzymes in the myocyteQT prolongationCYP2D6 inhibition\u2191beta-blocker effect (metoprolol and carvedilol)AzithromycinQT prolonging drugsElectrolyte imbalanceQTc prolongationLopinavir/ritonavirAvoid other QT prolonging drugsAvoid electrolyte imbalanceQTc, PR interval prolongationCYP3A4 inhibition\u2191Ticagrelor level\u2193Clopidogrel, Prasugrel levelRibavirin and lopinavir/ritonavirWarfarin, Apixaban, RivaroxabanIncreased bleeding risk with factor Xa inhibitorsOpen in a separate windowTable\u00a06COVID-19 treatment recommendations.Anti-COVID 19 TherapiesDrugsMechanismIDSA Recommendation April 2020CommentsAntimalarialHydroxychloroquine/chloroquine400 mg bid\u00a0\u00d7 1 d followed by 200 mg bid\u00a0\u00d7 total 5 dMultiple mechanisms- reduces infection & immunomodulation by inhibiting viral entry, release.Very low evidence.In the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patients.Monitor QTC and avoid if QTC > 500 msec or 550 msec if paced or BBB.Bone marrow suppression, retinopathy and cardiomyopathy.Contraindicated if epilepsy or porphyriaHydroxychloroquine/chloroquine plus Azithromycin500 mg 1 d; 250 mg\u00a0\u00d7 4 dAzithromycin, antibacterial has shown anti-inflammatory effects in other infectious disease.Very low evidence.In the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patients.If concomitant bacterial pneumonia suspected.Monitor QTC and avoid if QTC > 500 msec or 550 msec if paced or BBB.Qtc prolonging combination drugs should be avoided.AntiviralLopinavir/ritonavir and other HIV-1 protease inhibitors400/100 mg bid oral\u00a0\u00d7 10 dInhibits HIV-1 protease that lead to the formation of immature, noninfectious viral particles.Very low evidence.In the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patientsCombination increases serum lopinavir.Multiple drug interaction due to CYP3A inhibitionSerious gastrointestinal side effect and skin eruptions.Remdesivir200 mg IV loading dose, followed by 100 mg IV daily 5\u201310 dPremature termination of viral RNA transcriptionNo formal recommendations at this time.Compassionate use protocol in pregnant women.Monitor liver enzymes and consider renal dose adjustmentCorticosteroidsPrednisoneNo clinical evidence of net benefit.Against the routine use of corticosteroids in hospitalised patients.Risk of delayed viral clearance, risk of secondary infection, more adverse effects and increase mortality has been postulated.IV methyl prednisoneIV HydrocortisoneUse of corticosteroids in the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patients with ARDSOr if treating another condition like asthma, COPD or secondary adrenal insufficiency (chronic prednisone> 10 mg daily) or refractory shockInterleukins-6 (IL-6) blocker tocilizumabTocilizumab, Siltuximab, SarilumabIL-6 inhibition and prevents T cell activationVery low evidence.Only in the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patients.Risk of opportunistic infections must be tested.Severe allergic reactions, hepatic failure and intestinal perforations have been reported with the drug.Passive artificial immunityCOVID-19 convalescent plasmaObtained from recovered healthy donors may suppress viraemiaVery low evidence.In the context of a clinical trial in hospitalised patients.Intravenous immunoglobulinProtective antibodies from community recovered from COVID-19Unknown at this timeActive artificial immunityVaccine {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04283461\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04283461\"}}NCT04283461Are antigenic and induce protective immunity in host.Clinical trial phase.Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: BBB, bundle branch block; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Antiviral medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 also have side effects. Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause bradycardia, QT and PR interval prolongation [62,69,72] and ribavirin can affect warfarin dosing [73]. Similarly, lopinavir/ritonavir can increase levels of rivaroxaban, apixaban and ticagrelor, and decrease levels of clopidogrel and prasugrel due to the interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes [[74], [75], [76], [77]]. Tocilizumab and sarilumab, IL-6 receptor blockers, have shown some promising results for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome or secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [78]. In a recent cohort of patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement in respiratory status was observed in 68% of patients [58]. A National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trial also showed 31% faster recovery from advanced COVID-19 infection when treated with remdesivir [79]. When a 5-day course of remdesivir was compared with a 10-day course in phase 3 clinical trial (GS-US-540-5773), there was similar improvement in clinical status and the side effects were nausea, elevated liver enzymes and respiratory failure [80]. However, in another study of adult patients with severe COVID-19 infections admitted to Chinese hospitals, remdesivir was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement [81]. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Many of the side effects of newer investigational medications are still to be evaluated [82,83]. Approach to Cardiac Management in Patients With COVID-19 InfectionThe highly infectious nature of the COVID-19 infection and transmission risk to health care workers makes it challenging to manage patients with suspected or confirmed infection. Tables\u00a02 and \u200band33 and Figure\u00a02\nsummarise a proposed diagnostic approach to a patient suspected of COVID-19 infection and management of their cardiovascular conditions. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and a quick SOFA score may be helpful to assess the severity of the illness and some hospitals have used this as an initial triage tool [10,84,85]. There should be emphasis on minimising exposure of the health care professionals to the viral infection by performing limited bedside testing such as echocardiogram and telemetry to assess QT interval rather than a formal complete echocardiogram and electrocardiograph (ECG) [86].Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02COVID-19 treatment algorithm.Abbreviations: CBC, complete blood count; CMP, complete metabolic profile; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP, C reactive protein; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CT, computed tomography; EKG (also ECG), electrocardiograph; BNP, NTpBNP, N terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; Echo, echocardiograph; VT, ventricular tachycardia; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; STEMI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction; NSTEMI, non ST-elevation myocardial infarction; CTA; computed tomography angiography; ACS, acute coronary syndrome.Respiratory ManagementSupplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, early intubation and use of low tidal volume and high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) are recommended in the management of respiratory distress (Table\u00a02, Figure\u00a02) [87,88]. Patients with COVID-19 infection require close monitoring of respiratory status with a low threshold for intubation to minimise the risk of aerosolised respiratory secretions, and prevent high-risk emergency intubations [87]. Early stages of respiratory infection can be challenging to differentiate from cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in patients with a prior diagnosis of heart failure and a serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and myocardial imaging may be helpful. Routine right heart catheterisation should be avoided due to the potential exposure risk to health care workers (Table\u00a03).Haemodynamic ManagementPatients with COVID-19 infection are prone to fluid overload from aggressive resuscitation attempts, acute kidney injury in critically ill patients and treatment with steroids in those with chronic lung disease, and therefore require close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes. This is critical in very ill patients, many of whom may have new onset or worsening heart failure [87,89] and are prone to rapid fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Norepinephrine is recommended as the first line vasoactive drug in shock and vasopressin can be added if hypotension persists, although currently there is no data about their use in these patients (Table\u00a02) [87].Cardiovascular MonitoringArrhythmia Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection should have telemetry monitoring, since these patients can have various cardiovascular manifestations and are at risk of arrhythmia. The antimicrobial and immunomodulating medications used\u00a0for treatment of COVID-19 can have a proarrhythmic risk, including QT interval prolongation (Table\u00a03). Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have a high risk of QT prolongation and drug interactions [83,90], and the risk associated with this combination must be reassessed. Avoiding unnecessary QT prolonging agents, monitoring electrolytes and use of isoproterenol or dopamine infusion to increase heart rate in patients with bradycardia can prevent arrhythmic complications (Table\u00a05, Figure\u00a03\n) [69,90]. Tisdale and colleagues have developed a scoring system for predicting QTc prolongation in hospitalised patients which may be a useful tool to assess the risk of QTc prolongation [91]. Recent guidance or recommendation from Mayo Clinic authors is that if there is QTc prolongation >500 msec or increase in QTc >60 msec after initiation of COVID-19 treatment, consideration has to be given to stop medications or reverse QTc prolonging effect [69,92]. In another recent case report, late sodium channel blocking agents like lidocaine bolus infusion improved QTc interval in a patient with COVID-19 infection to enable treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [90].Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Prolonged QTc management algorithm.Management of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is otherwise similar to those without COVID-19 infection but using caution with drug interactions and QTc prolongation [[93], [94], [95]]. There have been some anecdotal reports of sudden death, sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular nodal disease in COVID-19 patients. The aetiology of such sudden death is still unclear but given the possibility of ventricular arrhythmias, prolonged ambulatory monitoring may be needed. Electrophysiology procedures such as ablation of atrial and ventricular arrhythmia should be postponed until recovery from acute illness to prevent virus transmission (Table 4) unless the procedure is deemed to be lifesaving or has haemodynamic consequences as recommended by groups including the CSANZ Heart Rhythm Council COVID-19 Pandemic working group [96,97].Ischaemic heart disease Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the recommended treatment strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Table\u00a03, Figure\u00a02) [54,98]. Alternative therapeutic options such as systemic fibrinolytic therapy was used in China and there has been discussion among the interventional cardiology community, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Emerging Leader Mentorship (SCAI ELM) Members and Graduates, regarding consideration for fibrinolytic therapy in low risk STEMI patients (e.g. inferior STEMI without right ventricular involvement or lateral myocardial infarction without haemodynamic compromise) [98]. It is important for regional centres to have equitable access to thrombolytics and stock rotation systems are imperative to ensure supply [99]. Patient transfer to a higher level of care should be limited but should be performed in a timely manner when required [99]. Patients with high risk non ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) also need urgent invasive evaluation but in low risk NSTEMI patients or in those where serum troponin level elevation is not clearly suggestive of Type 1 MI, obtaining a coronary CT angiogram can stratify the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) and help with the decision regarding invasive coronary angiography [54]. Echocardiography and advanced imaging (e.g. magnetic resonance [MRI]) can differentiate myocarditis with diffuse myocardial dysfunction from acute coronary syndromes where a focal wall motion abnormality in the distribution of a specific coronary artery is observed (Table\u00a03). Stable patients with symptoms suggestive of\u00a0COVID-19 should be tested for infection prior to the procedure due to the risk of aerosol transmission to procedural staff. In patients with diagnosed COVID-19 infection, invasive procedures (e.g. intra-aortic balloon pump, pericardiocentesis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, temporary transvenous pacemaker, etc.) can be performed at the bedside rather than in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory to minimise the infection risk to health care workers (Table 4) [98,100]. The elevation in serum troponin or BNP levels could be nonspecific in patients with COVID-19 infection, and clinicians should use their medical judgement in suspected cases of acute MI or heart failure and follow the latest recommendations from the guiding societies [16,54]. It is also important to be mindful of delayed presentations of common cardiovascular pathology during COVID-19 pandemic as there has been a significantly reduced number of STEMI cases in the hospital and increase in out of hospital cardiac arrest [101,102].Cardiogenic shock Shock in COVID-19 infection could be primarily cardiogenic from acute heart failure or myocarditis but may be multifactorial, as cardiac involvement often complicates respiratory failure and sepsis [10,48]. Serum BNP, echocardiography and troponin level can help clarify the degree of cardiac involvement (Figure\u00a02) [103]. Routine endomyocardial biopsy and cardiac MRI to evaluate malignant arrhythmia or myocarditis should not be performed [103]. The utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of shock in COVID-19 patients is unclear [104]. Most patients with cardiogenic shock complicating COVID-19 illness die despite aggressive treatment, as one case series from China reported 83% mortality despite ECMO use [105]. It is therefore important to identify the contribution of cardiac, pulmonary and systemic causes of shock when considering mechanical respiratory and circulatory support with ECMO [106]. Evaluation by a multidisciplinary shock team consisting of an interventional cardiologist, heart failure specialist and cardiac surgeon is recommended to evaluate risks and benefits of ECMO in the individual patient [104]. Lack of sufficient health care resources during this pandemic raises ethical concerns around ECMO use and these calculations may change if effective therapies emerge [106].Impact of COVID-19 Infection on the Health Care SystemCOVID-19 infection has caused a negative impact on both the physical and mental health of health workers, and many health care workers and frontline workers including firefighters have been infected with the virus [107]. Implementation of stringent infection prevention protocols may have caused delayed care in many patients and have put health care workers into difficult clinical decision making situations [107]. However, a high level of compliance (>90%) with these protocols may be required to effectively control the spread of COVID-19 infection [108].In a recent editorial, Allahwalla and colleagues have elegantly pointed out the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 related delay in care of chronic cardiovascular conditions and a possible second tsunami of acute cardiac conditions [102]. Therefore, there is a need for strategies to minimise, and prepare for, an impending second wave of acute medical conditions which may overwhelm the health care system and physicians [102]. Patients with cardiovascular conditions should continue to receive the health care services including preventive health services and efforts should be made to take advantage of telehealth services [99,109]. The psychological impact of the pandemic should be taken into consideration while evaluating patients [109]. ConclusionCardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 infection range from mild elevation of serum troponin and BNP levels to fulminant myocarditis, life-threatening arrhythmias and refractory shock. All patients need close haemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring especially if they are on COVID-19 treatment. While there are multiple ongoing clinical trials, there is currently insufficient data to support any definitive treatment option with antimicrobials or immunomodulators. Infection prevention and control measures such as social distancing and personal hygiene remain the cornerstone of management of this global pandemic. Funding SourcesNone. Conflicts of InterestNone.
