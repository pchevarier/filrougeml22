Morbid obesity was significantly associated to an increased risk of AKI, RRT and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Keywords: Acute kidney injury, Mortality, COVID-19, Morbid obesity 1.\u2003IntroductionIn December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The whole genome sequence was isolated on January 9, 2020 and was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The rapid spread of the virus, produced the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare, by March 11, 2020 a worldwide pandemic [2]; up to April 28, 2021 SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in over 149 million subjects and caused over three million deaths worldwide, a mortality rate of two percent which varies between countries. Mexico is the 15th country with most cases (more than two-million) and third in deaths with >215 thousands, which means a mortality rate of nine percent [3]. The latter makes Mexico one of the most hit countries by this pandemic, which may be partially explained by the elevated prevalence of risk factors, particularly overweight and obesity found in this country (75% among adult population) [4]. Obesity has been implicated as a risk factor for increased positivity testing and severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [[5], [6], [7]]; however, its association with COVID-19 mortality has not been completely elucidated [8]. On the other hand, acute kidney injury (AKI) and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) associated to obesity in patients with COVID-19 remain scarcely explored, and the few reported data are contradictory [9,10]. Moreover, there is no information about whether obesity, and particularly morbid obesity, is associated with AKI in this infectious disease.Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the association of obesity, particularly morbid obesity, with mortality and kidney outcomes in a Mexican sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In addition, clinical and biochemical variables, as well as other clinical outcomes, were compared according to the presence of obesity. 2.\u2003MethodsAll adult patients (>18 years), who fulfilled the selection criteria and were hospitalized during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Mexican state of Jalisco, were included in this retrospective cohort study. Patients were admitted to a tertiary-care teaching hospital [Hospital de Especialidades, Centro M\u00e9dico Nacional de Occidente, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS)], with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the Berlin protocol from March 25, 2020 (first case admitted), to September 7, 2020 (date in which the hospital stopped to be exclusively a COVID-19 center). End of the study was November 07, 2020. Our institution was one of the three hospitals converted to treat patients with COVID-19 in the IMSS in our state. All patients were screened, managed, and hospitalized according to the WHO Interim Guidance for COVID-19 [11]. Sociodemographic, clinical, anthropometric, treatment, and outcome variables were collected from electronic medical records throughout the study. Body weight and height at admission were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and classify patients according to the presence of overweight and obesity. Patients with BMI <18.5\u00a0kg/m2, previous chronic renal failure or incomplete anthropometric data were excluded. Laboratory data were collected from the Central Laboratory electronic record of our hospital, and included: complete blood cell count by impedance (XN-2000, Sysmex), and blood chemistry, electrolytes, and kidney function tests by dry chemistry in a VITROS\u2122 5600 Chemistry System, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Myocardial enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by enzymatic colorimetric method in a VITROS\u2122 4600 Chemistry System, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Ferritin was measured by chemiluminescence in an automated analyzer LIAISON\u2122, DiaSorin Molecular; whereas D-dimer, was measured in an immunoanalyzer VIDAS\u2122 bioM\u00e9rieux by Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay. Biochemical variables were analyzed comparing values at admission and the last measurement before hospital discharge. This protocol was approved by the local ethics and research committees (Comit\u00e9 Local de \u00c9tica en Investigaci\u00f3n 13018 and Comit\u00e9 Local de Investigaci\u00f3n en Salud 1301, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro M\u00e9dico Nacional de Occidente, IMSS) with the registration number R-2020-1301-151.Definitions. Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteremia, and a positive culture of a new pathogen was obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens or blood samples after admission [12,13]. AKI was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines [14], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition [15]. The illness severity was defined according to the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score [16]. Classification of body weight was made according to the OMS recommendation [17] as: normal weight (18.5\u201324.9\u00a0kg/m2), overweight (25\u201329.9\u00a0kg/m2), obesity (30\u201339.9\u00a0kg/m2), and morbid obesity (\u226540\u00a0kg/m2).Statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed in SPSS v. 25. Quantitative variables are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation or median (interquartile range) and nominal ones as n (%). One-way ANOVA, Kruskal\u2013Wallis or \u03c72 tests were used to compare differences between body weight groups, as appropriate. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed between BMI and clinical and biochemical variables. A logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze mortality and renal outcomes according to the presence of obesity, in which significant baseline differences were used to adjust the analysis. A two-sided p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 value was considered as statistically significant. 3.\u2003ResultsOne-thousand and ten patients were hospitalized during the study period; from these, 237 patients were excluded: 138 did not have anthropometric data, 88 had previous chronic kidney disease and 11 had a BMI <18.5\u00a0kg/m2. Thus, 773 were finally analyzed.Mean BMI of the whole sample was 30.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0kg/m2. At baseline, almost half the studied sample had obesity; from this, morbid obesity was present in 8% (Fig.\u00a01\n).Open in a separate windowFig.\u00a01Distribution of body mass index in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.Baseline clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients according to the presence of overweight and obesity are shown in Table\u00a01\n. Patients with obesity and morbid obesity were significantly younger, were more frequently women, and had higher frequency of hypertension, whereas only those with morbid obesity had higher respiratory rate than the other groups. No differences were found in other demographic and clinical variables.Table\u00a01Baseline clinical characteristics according to the presence of obesity in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.VariableNormal weightOverweightObesityMorbid obesitypNumber of patients12127930766Age (years)63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01559\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01456\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u221750\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u2217+\u00a3<0.0001Male sex, n (%)80 (66)193 (69)183 (60)29 (44)0.001Smoking, n (%)13 (30)19 (26)25 (32)10 (56)0.13Comorbidities, n (%)\u00a0Pulmonary disease10 (8)20 (7)26 (8)7 (11)0.82\u00a0Diabetes48 (40)93 (33)129 (42)23 (35)0.16\u00a0Hypertension51 (42)111 (40)164 (53)43 (65)<0.0001\u00a0Cardiovascular disease9 (7)20 (7)21 (7)5 (8)0.99qSOFA, n (%)0.18\u00a0039 (32)92 (33)90 (29)16 (24)\u00a0158 (48)156 (56)181 (59)41 (62)\u00a0224 (20)28 (10)30 (10)7 (11)\u00a0303 (1)6 (2)2 (3)Temperature (\u00b0C)37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7037\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7937\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.730.57Pulse oximetry (%)86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01084\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01284\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01284\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0140.63Cardiac rate (\u00d7 min)96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02095\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01797\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01896\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0150.46Respiratory rate (\u00d7 min)23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0523\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0523\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0425\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u2217+\u00a30.02SBP (mmHg)126\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018125\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020128\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021126\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0240.18DBP (mmHg)76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01176\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01278\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01276\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0130.14Open in a separate windowSBP: systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure. \u2217p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs normal weight;\u00a0+p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs overweight; \u00a3p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs obesity.Biochemical characteristics at baseline and delta (final \u2013 baseline) evaluations, according to the presence of obesity, are shown in Table\u00a02\n.

Reported prevalence of obesity in different meta-analysis was 31%\u201334% [[18], [19], [20]], far below the observed in the current study. Our data support evidence of previous observations from Mexico reporting an obesity prevalence between 39.7% and 55.4% in patients with COVID-19 [[21], [22], [23]]. This is consistent with the fact that Mexico is second in the world in terms of obesity prevalence [24]: 75% of adult population suffering overweight/obesity [4].Many studies have shown an increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 and obesity [[25], [26], [27], [28]]; however, few have specifically analyzed if this issue displays a dose\u2013response effect [18]. Our study shows, that after adjusting for some important variables, the most severe grade of obesity significantly predicts higher mortality. In settings like ours, with higher prevalence of obesity in general population [24] and in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 than other countries [[18], [19], [20]], the highest BMI was more clearly associated with increased mortality. Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association of obesity with mortality in COVID-19 patients, as association with low-grade chronic inflammatory status, higher expression of angiotensin converting enzyme binding system of SARS-CoV-2, and coexistence with other comorbidities [29].On the other hand, AKI is one of the main complications in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality [30,31]. Implications of obesity for development of AKI in patients with COVID-19 have been controversial [[8], [9], [10],23,26]; however, our results support the notion of a direct association, as patients with obesity and morbid obesity significantly increased serum creatinine concentrations at the end of the follow-up, compared to patients with overweight and normal weight. Moreover, those with the most severe obesity had increased risk for AKI and use of RRT in the multivariate analysis. Possible reasons of controversial results in previous studies could have been a lack of analysis by grades of obesity and exclusion of patients with previous diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, variables that were controlled in the present study. Obesity may increase the risk of AKI by several mechanisms not completely understood; however, dysregulation of fatty acids and carbohydrate metabolism, presence of comorbidities, oxidative stress and inflammation are likely the most important factors possibly associated to kidney injury [32]. In critically ill non-COVID-19 patients with AKI, obesity has shown a dual effect, and an \u201cobesity survival paradox\u201d has been proposed; nonetheless, it seems that negative outcomes associated with obesity are more relevant than the positive ones [32].In the current study, morbid obesity also predicted the development of respiratory failure, which is in agreement with the recognized presence of an obesity associated restrictive pulmonary function, characterized by increased respiratory rate and mild hypoxia secondary to ventilation-perfusion desynchronization [33,34].Finally, biochemical markers associated with inflammation were, unexpectedly, lower in patients with obesity and morbid obesity. Ferritin concentrations were significantly lower, and C-reactive protein and D-dimer had a non-significant trend to have lower levels in patients with obesity. These latter findings deserve further investigation, but they could be associated to the so-called \u201cobesity paradox\u201d [32,35,36], in which the obesity-associated chronic inflammation may elicit an immune system strong response, which in turn, could help to recover faster from an infection.Strengths and limitations. Our findings may help to understand the impact of obesity on mortality and kidney outcomes in hospitalized patients by COVID-19 as the current sample has a vast number of subjects exposed to this risk factor. Notwithstanding, the retrospective nature of the study and the characteristics of this single center population may limit validity.In terms of kidney outcomes, patients with known chronic kidney disease were excluded from the study, in order to evaluate the association of obesity with AKI instead of the association with chronic damage. Additionally, it is important to note the possible bias in these results as a drug treatment analysis was not possible to perform. 5.\u2003ConclusionsPrevalence of obesity and morbid obesity was very high in these hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Morbid obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of AKI, use of RRT and mortality.
