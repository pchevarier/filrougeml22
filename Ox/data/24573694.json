{"title": "In vivo genome-wide binding of Id2 to E2F4 target genes as part of a reversible program in mice liver", "pubDate": "2014", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s00018-014-1588-1", "PMID": "24573694", "abstract": "The inhibitor of differentiation Id2, a protein lacking the basic DNA-binding domain, is involved in the modulation of a number of biological processes. The molecular mechanisms explaining Id2 pleiotropic functions are poorly understood. Id2 and E2F4 are known to bind simultaneously to c-myc promoter. To study whether Id2 plays a global role on transcriptional regulation, we performed in vivo genome-wide ChIP/chip experiments for Id2 and E2F4 in adult mouse liver. An Id2-containing complex was bound to a common sequence downstream from the TSS on a subset of 442 E2F4 target genes mainly related to cell development and chromatin structure. We found a positive correlation between Id2 protein levels and the expression of E2F4/Id2 targets in fetal and adult liver. Id2 protein stability increased in fetal liver by interaction with USP1 de-ubiquitinating enzyme, which was induced during development. In adult liver, USP1 and Id2 levels dramatically decreased. In differentiated liver tissue, when Id2 concentration was low, E2F4/Id2 was bound to the same region as paused Pol II and target genes remained transcriptionally inactive. Conversely, in fetal liver when Id2 levels were increased, Id2 and Pol II were released from gene promoters and target genes up-regulated. During liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, we obtained the same results as in fetal liver. Our results suggest that Id2 might be part of a reversible development-related program involved in the paused-ON/OFF state of Pol II on selected genes that would remain responsive to specific stimuli.", "author": [{"author": "Ivan Ferrer-Vicens", "affiliation": ["Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular.
