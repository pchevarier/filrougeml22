Clinical courses of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were characterized in international cohorts with hospital mortality rates between 50 and 88% (including ongoing treatment cohorts) [1-3]. The overall case fatality rates vary internationally (1-12%). Recently, reported case fatality rates in Germany remain lower than in neighboring countries [3-5].Patients with severe pulmonary failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are reported to require multiple organ replacement therapies, some of which have to be applied at the same time. As recently reported, severity of COVID-19 cases immensely increases the strain on staff and resources [1].This retrospective study analyzes the first cohort of patients on three intensive care units at a third-level treatment center in Freiburg, Germany. During the observation period the center never faced a shortage of human or technical resources for the treatment of those patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19. The present study focuses on the necessary resources for the treatment and 60-day survival.\u00a0This article was previously posted to the Research Square preprint server 2020, August 02. Materials and methodsWe enrolled critically ill patients in case of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to pulmonary failure caused by COVID-19 from 03/08/2020 (date of ICU admission of our first case) to 04/08/2020.Inclusion criteriaAccording to the local pandemic plan, COVID-19 patients were treated at different ICUs (medical and surgical). Patients were admitted to the ICU from the emergency room (ER), regular hospital wards, or from first and secondary treatment centers. Our center serves as a reference and referral center for ARDS and veno-venous extracorporeal membrance oxygenation (ECMO) offering a 24/7 ECMO retrieval service. All patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe respiratory failure requiring ICU therapy were included in the present study. The PCR tests were carried out from nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal secretion. Patients with high clinical probability of COVID-19 but negative virology testing were excluded.Patients with do not resuscitate (DNR) orders not excluding ICU therapy for respiratory failure (ventilation, prone positioning) were included. We adhered to their wish if patients did prefer to not continue ICU therapy.\u00a0Pre-ICU treatmentPatient management prior to ICU was outlined in in-house standard operating procedures related to COVID-19. It included hygiene concepts, laboratory work-up, lung-ultrasound, radiology imaging, volume therapy, perioperative management, discharge requirements, and anti-infective recommendations. During the first wave of the pandemic all guidelines were rapidly implemented and shared with transferring hospitals to align therapies.If patients were transferred from other hospitals, we collected patients reports to minimize the loss of information.ARDS treatmentThe ARDS treatment followed current guidelines and house-intern standard operating procedures for lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning and supportive therapies [6,7].In our center attempts with non-invasive ventilation were carried out with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).At this point of time, steroids next to relaxation or recruitment maneuvers were not standard therapy in ARDS in our center; these strategies remained a case-by-case decision and were rarely used in early ARDS. Steroid therapies have been implemented later on.In case of persistent hypoxia or hypercapnia in patients with lung-protective ventilation after employment of all conservative strategies, ECMO was evaluated by an interdisciplinary team of at least one ECMO specialist, a registered nurse, and a perfusionist following local standards. (Relative) exclusion criteria were ventilation over seven days without lung protection, acute intracerebral hemorrhage, severe comorbidities (metastatic cancer), severe thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and advanced age (no cut-off).For the ECMO circuit we cannulated bifemoral or jugular with a dual lumen cannula. Applied systems were St\u00f6ckert Centrifugal Pump Console (SCPC) (LivaNova, Munich, Germany) or the Cardiohelp-System (Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) with customized tubing sets and oxygenators. We primed the sets with 700\u00a0ml electrolyte solution and 5000\u00a0IE of unfractionated heparin.Nursing hoursNursing hours were calculated on a representative day for the patients and cumulative for one representative medical ICU (14-bed) based on the Inpuls\u00ae Intensivpflege- und Leistungserfassungssystem, intensive care nursing and activity recording system (Inpuls\u00ae, Heidelberg, Germany). The cumulative calculation comprises day by day categorization of the patients in six defined categories (K1-6) related to defined criteria. Each category results in ascending requirements for nursing hours.Category 1 comprises patients with monitoring indication and without complications (nursing hours 7.33 hours in 24 hours). Patients with monitoring indication and with complications are grouped in category 2 (8.40 nursing hours in 24 hours). Categories 3-6 capture patients with organ replacement therapies. Category 3 depicts a patient with e.g. only short period of invasive ventilation (perioperative etc.) with 11.00 nursing hours in 24 hours. A patient with a permanent organ replacement (ventilation or renal replacement therapy (RRT)) and e.g. large wound areas is categorized in the 4th category (13.85 nursing hours in 24 hours). Seriously ill patients with IMV and circulatory support systems, therapeutic positioning maneuvers, permanent medication/transfusion requirements belong to the 5th category (20.25 nursing hours in 24 hours). Highly critical patients with permanent two or more organ replacement therapies, permanent medication requirements and e.g. assistance in diagnostic or therapeutic interventions reach category 6 (21.66 nursing hours in 24 hours).The criteria for defining the categories are assigned to subgroups (consciousness, breathing, hygiene, positioning, medication, wounds etc.). Critical events result in upgrading (cardio-pulmonal resuscitation, massive hemorrhage, pericardial effusion etc.). Lone or combined organ replacement categories result in certain categories.Endpoint definitionARDS was classified according to the Berlin classification [8]. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the RIFLE definition and supported by RRT if necessary [9,10]. Frailty was clinically judged according to the modified Rockwood Clinical Frailty Score if meeting the 5th category or higher [11]. All patients dismissed home or to a rehabilitation unit were considered 60-day survivors in regards to this study (if ICU and following hospital stay were shorter than 60 days). The cause of death was determined by clinical judgment of at least two intensivists (participants of this research project).Data managementThe data collection was carried out till 05/28/2020 for the patients admitted between 08/03/2020 until 08/04/2020. Patients admitted later were not included in the analysis. We extracted patient related data from our hospital data systems and documentation from transferring hospitals. The local ethics committee approved the study protocol (Ethik-Kommission der Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg file number 234/20). Non-survivors and ICU-survivors were compared with chi-square test, Student\u00b4s t-test, and Fisher\u00b4s exact. We performed analyses with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and Prism version 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsBaseline characteristics and comorbiditiesDuring the observation period, 34 COVID-19 patients with pulmonary failure were admitted and treated on the ICU. Medium age was 67\u00b113 years, six (17.6%) were female (Table \u200b(Table11).Table 1Baseline CharacteristicsAbbreviations: HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c; ICU, intensive care unit; BMI, body mass index (calculated in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); ER, emergency room; SOFA score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; SAPS II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score; TISS Score, Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System; Inpuls\u00ae, Intensivpflege- und Leistungserfassungssystem, intensive care nursing and activity recording system (Inpuls\u00ae, Heidelberg, Germany); ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome in accordance with the Berlin classification [8].Baseline characteristics are displayed for all patients, non-survivors and survivors. Data are n (%) or mean with standard deviation and range. Student\u00b4s t-test or Fisher\u00b4s exact test was performed to derive p-values.a DNR, no not resuscitate order was assessed prior to ICU admission and did not exclude ICU therapy for respiratory failure (ventilation, prone positioning). Patients not willing to receive ICU therapy were primarily not transferred to our unit.b Other cardiac condition: valve operation or chronic heart failure.c Frailty was clinically judged; clinical frailty scale (CFS) which is a modification of the Canadian frailty scale by Rockwood [11].

Three patients (8.8%) were exclusively managed with HFNC/NIV. On average, patients were on IMV for 19\u00b121 (0-79) days. On day one of IMV therapy measured ventilation values showed a relatively unimpaired compliance 51\u00b128 (18-120) (ml/mbar) and low resistance levels 12\u00b14 (3-17) (mbar/sec).The ventilation settings met lung protection on average (positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 13\u00b13 (7-18) mmHg, P peak 28\u00b15 (17-37) mmHg, tidal volume 460\u00b1130 (270-780) ml), apart from relatively high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) levels 66\u00b119 (40-100) %. Spontaneous breathing on the ventilator was performed in 73.5% in the first 24 hours. Weaning from the respirator was successfully completed in 12 cases before ICU discharge, five patients went to a weaning unit.Prone positioning was performed in 67.6%. If prone positioning was not indicated, alternative strategies were incomplete prone positioning (135\u00b0), pilot\u00b4s seat positioning or the use of a rotational bed. Thus, 88.2% of our patients underwent daily therapeutic positioning maneuvers.If conservative therapeutic efforts failed, ECMO therapy was installed in 8/34 (23.5%) patients for 20\u00b123 (2-75) days. Out of this subgroup, three patients were weaned from ECMO therapy. Two patients died of refractory ARDS and two because of intracerebral hemorrhage during ECMO, one patient died with abdominal sepsis and bleeding during ECMO therapy.A noticeable number of patients showed an acute kidney injury (85.3%), whereas about 35.3% of all cases required RRT. Due to vasoplegic or cardiogenic shock, non-survivors significantly more often required vasopressor therapy (17/17 vs. 11/17; p=0.018) and transfusions of packed red blood cells (12/17 vs. 5/17; p=0.038).Initially, antiviral treatment was applied to almost all patients (97.1%), but not continued later on, when it was proven not to be effective.Resource intense multi-organ replacement ICU treatment was measured in nursing hours using Inpuls\u00ae-categories in 25 patients. A time investment of >20 hours per day was necessary in 96.0% of our patients and required a 1:1 nurse-patient ratio (Table \u200b(Table44).Table 4Nursing HoursNursing hours per day (h/d) were assessed for 25 patients and are calculated according to\nInpuls\u00ae, Intensivpflege- und Leistungserfassungssystem, intensive care nursing and activity recording system (Inpuls\u00ae, Heidelberg, Germany).

On average the followed-up survival since admission was 60\u00b18 days (51-81 days).The clinical course was complicated by pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum in six (17.6%) cases. Furthermore, five (14.7%) patients exhibited non-fatal pulmonary embolism/thrombosis in segmental and sub-segmental lung arteries. Superinfections during treatment in 18 (52.9%) cases were dominated by Serratia marcescens (33.3%).

Notably, 3/17 (17.6%) patients died of fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. Because of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, organ donation was impossible in these patients. Two (11.8%) patients did not continue therapy, as they were not willing to undergo re-intubation and received palliative treatment. No medical autopsies were carried out in this cohort. DiscussionIntensive care resources and 60-day survivalWe present a 60-day follow-up of our first critically ill COVID-19 patients due to pulmonary failure in southwestern Germany. The age and common comorbidities were similar to international cohorts [1-3,12]. In our cohort, 60-day survival was 50.0%. Importantly, the majority of our survivors were able to return to their former lives.This is similar to the case-fatality rate of 49.0% reported for \u201ccritical cases\u201d in a large Wuhan registry [13] and much lower than suggested by early reports in the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with severe pulmonary failure [2,3]. Importantly, we present data with a long follow-up. In other registries a very small number of patients actually could return to normal life [2,3].To characterize the non-survivor and possible determinants of mortality at 60 days, we analyzed the mode of death. Data on mode of death for in-hospital mortality were presented beforehand [5].\u00a0Thus, respiratory failure remained eminent in three cases. All other patients seemed to have overcome respiratory failure but died from overwhelming complications or multiorgan-failure. Interestingly, three patients died from intracerebral hemorrhage and were studied in a subsequent analysis [14]. ICU therapy withdrawal was due to DNR orders in two patients (no re-intubation preferred) - not decisively influencing the high mortality in our opinion. Patients not willing to receive ICU therapy were primarily not transferred to our unit. If patients developed the wish to not continue ICU therapy, we adhered to their wish.\u00a0Data of 92 COVID-19-associated deaths states ARDS as the main complication followed by myocardial injury, liver injury, kidney injury, and multiple organ failure [15]. In pandemic conditions, resource shortages might necessitate rapid decisions regarding futility compared to normal conditions. Survival rate in the present study is lower than described for a general ARDS population (60-day survival 68%) [16]. When considering that ARDS mortality is lower in tertiary hospitals than in hospitals of first and second treatment level [17], the high mortality found in this registry might suggest a significant case-fatality rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU therapy. According to the severity scores (SOFA and SAPS II score), our cohort had a relatively high predicted risk of death (over 40%), which is higher than in cohorts characterized beforehand.Finally, we do not know if unlimited resource allocation affects mortality. We can only suggest that reported very high death rates in the first weeks of the pandemic might result from a shortage of resources and a collapsing health system.But, no matter what kind of resources you apply, death rates seem to stay about 50% in a very critical ICU cohort. This further depicts the potential harm of the virus and possible devastating course of COVID-19.Other general determinants of mortality are age, comorbidities, multi-organ failure, and complications. The latter are often due to a hypercoagulable state during the infection. As stated by Klok et al. the incidence of thrombotic complications is up to 31% in COVID-19 patients on the ICU [4]. The notable rate of 14.7% non-fatal pulmonary artery thrombosis is in line with their findings. Further studies concentrated on autopsies and confirmed a high rate of thromboembolic events [18]. At the moment, the underlying mechanism for the coagulopathy leading to pulmonary artery thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage, which were leading causes of the complications in this cohort, is unknown.As Germany did not experience a shortage of ICU resources, it is not surprising that in our cohort ICU therapy lasted longer than reported as in other registries [1,19]. Not knowing the course of the disease, we ran through long therapies with our patients - partly being surprised by their recovery capacities after weeklong efforts and stagnation.Also, more resources were allocated to patients in this registry including multiple organ replacement therapies - ECMO therapies and RRT were required more often than reported in other cohorts from Wuhan or New York [1,2]. Another German registry depicts similar rates of ECMO and RRT [3].Our hospital never faced a personal or machine shortage (including ventilators, dialysis machines or ECMO systems). Staffing acquirements were calculated by the Inpuls\u00ae category and met with 2:1 (patient:nurse) or in extreme cases 1:1 (patient:nurse) staffing. We are the first to report an estimate on the enormous amounts of nursing hours required for treating every patient and the burden for a whole ICU unit during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.If resource allocation was appropriate remains unknown. The long courses of disease and late possible recoveries suggest not to limit ICU therapies to a certain time span or compare to other virus or bacterial pneumonia.\u00a0This might be even more difficult if facing a resource shortage. Concepts of resource allocation should be discussed interdisciplinary according to current recommendations and local conditions/obligations [20].LimitationsThe case number is limited and the data has to be verified by larger cohorts and longer follow-up intervals. Further, the cohort is a selected one as the university hospital of Freiburg is a tertiary center. Therefore, generalizability for other settings is limited. The center has a large number of patient allocations from primary or secondary treatment centers because of evaluation of ECMO therapy or limited resources in the other centers. For comparability patients\u00b4 severity scores should be regarded e.g., SOFA Score.Moreover, our study misses further information about patients\u00b4 socioeconomic status. To hint at income level, we included the health insurance status. In Germany private health insurance is only allowed after reaching a certain yearly income level (e.g., 62.550 Euro in 2020).Also, as many patients were transferred from other hospitals a loss of information is not excludable in therapies prior to ICU.Finally, 60-day mortality was incomplete followed if patients were discharged home earlier. Further, follow-up was not assessed by functional state and questionnaires on quality of life. ConclusionsCaring for critically ill COVID-19 patients requires an immense amount of organ replacement therapies, nursing hours and ICU days. The 60-day survival is 50% in a German tertiary treatment center despite full resources. High mortality in COVID-19 might be disease-specific rather than caused by resource shortage.
