The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of biventricular longitudinal strain and its combination with hs-TNI in COVID-19 patients.                  Methods:                       A total of 160 COVID-19 patients who underwent both echocardiography and hs-TNI testing were enrolled in our study. COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups (critical and non-critical) according to severity-of-illness. The clinical characteristics, cardiac structure and function were compared between the two groups. The prognostic value of biventricular longitudinal strain and its combination with hs-TNI were evaluated by logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves. Left ventricular longitudinal strain (LV LS) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were determined by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography.                  Results:                       The LV LS and RVFWLS both were significantly lower in critical patients than non-critical patients (LV LS: -16.6\u00b12.4 vs -17.9\u00b13.0, P = .003; RVFWLS :-18.8\u00b13.6 vs -23.9\u00b14.4, P<.001). During a median follow-up of 60 days, 23 (14.4%) patients died. The multivariant analysis revealed that LV LS and RVFWLS [Odd ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.533 (1.131-2.079), P = .006; 1.267 (1.036-1.551), P = .021, respectively] were the independent predictors of higher mortality. Further, receiver-operating characteristic analysis revealed that the accuracy for predicting death was greater for the combination of hs-TNI levels with LV LS than separate LV LS (AUC: .91 vs .77, P = .001), and the combination of hs-TNI levels with RVFWLS than RVFWLS alone (AUC: .89 vs .83, P = .041).                  Conclusions:                       Our study highlights that the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs-TNI can provide higher accuracy for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients, which may enhance risk stratification in COVID-19 patients.", "author": [{"author": "Wei Sun", "affiliation": ["Department of Ultrasound, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of

Acute cardiac injury has been commonly described and shown to be associated with a higher risk of mortality in COVID\u201019 patients,2, 3, 4 but the corresponding research regarding the changes of cardiac structure and function was still insufficient. Echocardiography is the first\u2010line imaging technique for cardiac assessment, and is an indispensable bedside tool that allows non\u2010invasive evaluation of ventricular performance in COVID\u201019 patients in isolated wards. Myocardial strain derived from speckle\u2010tracking echocardiography (STE) has been shown to be more sensitive and accurate in detecting subclinical impairment of ventricular function than conventional echocardiography.5, 6, 7 More importantly, ventricular longitudinal strain has been demonstrated to be of robust prognostic value in various diseases.8, 9, 10, 11 And previous study reported that ventricular strains were impaired in relative severe COVID\u201019 patients than non\u2010severe patients.12, 13 Furthermore, although the prognostic implication of biventricular longitudinal strain in COVID\u201019 patients also has been reported,12, 13, 14 whether the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with high\u2010sensitivity troponin I (hs\u2010TNI) has an incremental prognostic value in COVID\u201019 patients has not been evaluated.Therefore, the study aimed to (1) evaluate the cardiac structure and function in COVID\u201019 patients with different severity of illness; (2) explore the prognostic value of biventricular longitudinal strain; and (3) investigate whether the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs\u2010TNI has an incremental prognostic value in COVID\u201019 patients. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Study populationThis retrospective study was performed at Union Hospital (Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology) Wuhan, China. We enrolled a total of 222 patients who were confirmed with COVID\u201019 according to the WHO interim guidance,15 and both underwent echocardiography from January 29, 2020 to March 4, 2020. Bedside echocardiography was performed based on clinical indications. Of the 222 COVID\u201019 patients, we excluded 31 patients due to insufficient image quality for echocardiographic analysis, 10 patients because of arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation or flutter, frequent ventricular premature beats) during echocardiogram examination, and 21 patients without the data of hs\u2010TNI, leaving 160 patients included for the final analysis.The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Union hospital Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was waived for all participants with emerging infectious diseases.2.2. Clinical dataData including demographic and clinical information during hospitalization were retrieved from the medical records. Patients clinical outcomes were followed up to April 20, 2020, the endpoint event was death. Serum plasma levels of hs\u2010TNI above the 99th percentile of the upper limit of reference were considered to be elevated and suggestive of acute cardiac injury.16 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlin Definition.17 The criteria for the severity of COVID\u201019 disease was defined by the Chinese management guideline for COVID\u201019 (version 7.0), and the 160 COVID\u201019 patients were divided into two groups: critical and non\u2010critical groups.18 The critical COVID\u201019 disease: with any of the following conditions: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, and/or other organ failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) based on the published guideline.18\nOf the 23 deceased COVID\u201019 patients, six patients with acute cardiac injury underwent the ultrasound\u2010guided postmortem tissue sampling to observe the pathological changes of heart tissue under the consent of their family members. The ultrasound\u2010guided postmortem tissue sampling of heart was taken within approximately 2\u00a0hours of death in isolated wards.2.3. Conventional echocardiographyBedside echocardiography was performed with Philip EPIQ7C ultrasound scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) equipped with S5\u20101 transducers. The echocardiography examinations were performed according to the current recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography.19 The frame rate was set between 50 and 70 frames/sec. All 2D and Doppler echocardiographic parameters were acquired according to the published guidelines.20, 21 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated using Simpson's method. Right ventricular (RV) basal diameter was measured from right ventricle\u2013focused apical four\u2010chamber view, and the minor right atrial (RA) diameter was measured from the mid level of RA from apical four\u2010chamber view. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), systolic tricuspid lateral annular tissue velocity (S'), and RV fractional area change (FAC) were measured according to the published guideline.21 Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was assessed by the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet velocity, using the simplified Bernoulli equation and added this value to the estimated right atrial pressure.21\n2.4. Strain analysisBiventricular strain parameters were acquired by experienced echocardiographers who were blinded to the clinical information using 2D strain software (2D Cardiac Performance Analysis 1.2 for 2D\u2010STE; TomTec Imaging Systems, Unterschleissheim, Germany) according to the current recommendation.7 The endocardium was tracked automatically by the software throughout the entire cardiac cycle, and the endocardial border could be adjusted manually by the operator if necessary. The LV longitudinal strain (LS) was calculated as the average peak systolic longitudinal strain of the six segments of LV from apical four\u2010chamber views. RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) was calculated as the mean longitudinal peak systolic strain of the three segments of RV free wall from the apical four\u2010chamber RV\u2010focused view.2.5. Inter\u2010observer and intra\u2010observer reproducibilityTwenty five subjects were randomly selected to estimate intra\u2010observer and inter\u2010observer variability of LV LS and RVFWLS. Intra\u2010observer variability was assessed by the same observer remeasuring the same patients two weeks later. Inter\u2010observer variability was assessed independently by two researchers.2.6. Statistical analysisCategorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD), median, and inter\u2010quartile range (IQR). The normality of the data was evaluated by Shapiro\u2010Wilk test. Comparisons between critical and non\u2010critical COVID\u201019 patients were assessed by independent group t tests for normally distributed data, the Mann\u2010Whitney U test for non\u2010normally distributed data, and the \u03c72 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the association of plasma hs\u2010TNI levels with C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) levels. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors of death in COVID\u201019 Patients. Univariate predictors with P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 were selected to include into the multivariate logistic regression analysis. And the number of independent variables included in the multivariable model was constrained to yield roughly 10 events per variable to avoid overfitting of the model.22 Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were performed to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of strain parameters and identify their cutoff values (maximum Youden index) for predicting death. To investigate whether the combination of strain parameters and hs\u2010TNI had an incremental prognostic value for predicting death, we also calculated the resulting area under the curve (AUC) of ROC for the combination of hs\u2010TNI and LV LS or RVFWLS. Comparisons of AUC were performed using the Delong test.23 Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves were plotted to compare survival between the groups according to strain parameter alone, and the combination of strain parameter and hs\u2010TNI using the log\u2010rank test. The reproducibility was assessed using intra\u2010class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland\u2010Altman analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Chicago, IL USA) and STATA software version 10 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). All tests were 2\u2010tailed, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Clinical characteristicsThe clinical characteristics of the 160 patients were shown in Table\u00a01. The mean age was 62.1\u00b113.4 years. Eighty\u2010three (51.9%) patients were men. Compared with non\u2010critical patients, the critical patients were older, showed a significantly higher rate of male predominance and higher respiratory rate. And critical patients presented with more abnormal laboratory findings including lower Lymphocyte count, higher inflammation\u2010related indices (white blood cell counts, CRP, procalcitonin, IL\u20106, and D\u2010dimer), and further elevations in cardiac function indices (hs\u2010TNI, creatine kinase muscle\u2010brain, B\u2010type natriuretic peptide) than non\u2010critical patients. Additionally, critical patients were more likely to receive antibiotic, glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin, and mechanical ventilation therapy, admit to ICU, develop ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and coagulation dysfunction. Moreover, plasma hs\u2010TNI levels correlated with plasma IL\u20106 levels (spearman r\u00a0=\u00a0.58, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and CRP levels (spearman r\u00a0=\u00a0.40, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) (Figure\u00a01).TABLE 1Clinical characteristics of critical and non\u2010critical COVID\u201019 patientsVariablesAll Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0160)Critical (n\u00a0=\u00a050)Non\u2010critical (n\u00a0=\u00a0110)P Value\nClinical characteristics\nAge (years)62.1\u00b113.465.6\u00b112.160.5\u00b113.7.027Male, n (%)83(51.9)18(78.3)65(47.4).006Body mass index (kg/m2)\n23.7\u00b12.924.1\u00b12.923.4\u00b12.9.194Heart rate (beats/min)90.5\u00b116.792.0\u00b117.189.8\u00b116.5.433Respiratory rate (times/min)23(20, 30)25(20, 32)22(20, 30).028SBP (mm Hg)132(121, 144)131(120, 144)132(122, 144).970DBP (mm Hg)80(73, 87)79(73, 86)80(74, 89).254Smoker, n (%)9 (5.6)3(6.0)6(5.5)1.000\nComorbidities\nHypertension, n (%)67(41.9)25(50.0)42(38.2).160Diabetes, n (%)23(14.4)5(10.0)18(16.4).288Cardiac disease, n (%)27(16.9)14(28.0)13(11.8).011COPD, n (%)9(5.6)4(8.0)5(8.5).611Chronic kidney disease, n (%)4(2.5)1(2.0)3(2.7)1.000Chronic liver disease, n (%)8 (5.0)4(8.0)4(3.6).434Malignancy, n (%)11 (6.9)3(6.0)8(7.3)1.000\nLaboratory findings\nWhite blood cell( \u00d7 10\u2079/L)7.0(5.0, 10.0)8.9(6.2, 11.0)6.2(4.7, 9.2)<.001Lymphocyte count (\u00d7 10\u2079/L)1.01(.61, 1.42).64(.39, 1.07)1.12(.79, 1.50)<.001CRP (mg/L)26.3(3.7, 65.2)70.3(26.9, 121.4)12.3(2.4, 43.5)<.001PCT (ng/ml).09(.05, .20).15(.09, .28).07(.04, .16)<.001IL\u20106 (pg/ml)a\n4.3(2.2, 20.4)13.0(4.0, 44.6)3.9(1.7, 8.4)<.001D\u2010dimer (mg/L)1.5(0.6, 6.1)4.7(1.2, 8.0)1.1(.5, 3.8)<.001hs\u2010TNI (ng/L)5.2 (2.2, 33.8)34.9(8.0, 71.9)3.3 (1.6, 10.8)<.001CK\u2010MB (U/L)12.0(9.0, 26.0)20.5(10.0, 32.0)11.0(9.0, 16.0).001BNP( pg/ml)53.4(19.0, 176.4)162.5(62.4, 249.0)35.0(10.0, 96.6)<.001\nTreatments\nAntiviral therapy n (%)149(93.1)47(94.0)102(92.7)1.000Antibiotic therapy, n (%)120(75.0)47(94.0)73(66.4)<.001Immunoglobulin, n (%)54(33.8)31(62.0)23(20.9)<.001Glucocorticoid therapy, n (%)65(40.6)31(62.0)34(30.9)<.001ACE\u2010I/ARB, n (%)12(7.5)5(10.0)7(6.4).627Oxygen therapy, n (%)139(86.9)50(100.0)89(80.9).093High\u2010flow oxygen, n (%)84(52.8)47(94.0)37(33.9)<.001Mechanical ventilation37(23.1)37(74.0)0(.0)<.001IMV, n (%)27(16.9)27(54.0)0(.0)<.001NIMV, n (%)10(6.3)10 (20.0)0(.0).055ICU admission, n (%)29(18.1)29(58.0)0(.0)<.001\nComplications\nARDS, n (%)67(41.9)41(82.0)26(23.6)<.001Acute cardiac injury (%)49(30.6)31(62.0)18(16.4)<.001Acute kidney injury, n (%)20(12.5)14(28.0)6(5.5)<.001Coagulation dysfunction, n (%)30(18.8)19(38.0)11(10.0)<.001Open in a separate windowData are n (%), mean\u00b1SD, or median (IQR).

While the LV LS and RVFWLS were both significantly lower in critical patients than non\u2010critical patients (LV LS: \u201016.6\u00b12.4\u00a0vs \u201017.9\u00b13.0, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003; RVFWLS: \u201018.8\u00b13.6\u00a0vs \u201023.9\u00b14.4, P<.001). During a median follow\u2010up of 60 days, 23 (14.4%) patients died.

Prediction of the deathIn univariate analysis, sex, elevated hs\u2010TNI, ARDS, LV LS, and RVFWLS were associated with death (P<.05 for all) (Table\u00a03). To avoid overfitting and collinearity in the multivariate analysis, four separate models that included ARDS and one of ventricular strains (LV LS, RVFWLS); or ARDS, elevated hs\u2010TNI and one of ventricular strains (LV LS, RVFWLS) were constructed to predict death. The stepwise, multivariate analysis showed that LV LS and RVFWLS were the independent significant predictors of death after adjustment for ARDS and elevated hs\u2010TNI. And the multivariable model containing hs\u2010TNI and one of LV LS and RVFWLS had a significantly larger C\u2010index than the multivariable model containing only LV\u2010LS or RVFWLS (Table\u00a04). ROC analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff used to predict mortality was \u201016.5% for LV LS with sensitivity of 86.96% and specificity of 69.34%, \u201018.8% for RVFWLS with sensitivity of 73.91 % and specificity of 83.94%. Further, the accuracy for predicting death was greater for the combination of hs\u2010TNI levels with LV LS than separate LV LS (AUC: .91\u00a0vs .77, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), and separate hs\u2010TNI (AUC: .91\u00a0vs .83, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). Likewise, the combination of hs\u2010TNI levels with RVFWLS also had an incremental accuracy to predict mortality than RVFWLS alone (AUC: .89\u00a0vs .83, P\u00a0=\u00a0.041) (Figure\u00a03), and hs\u2010TNI alone (AUC: .89\u00a0vs .83, P\u00a0=\u00a0.047).TABLE 3Univariate logistic regression analysis for predicting the risk of death in COVID\u201019 patientsUnivariate AnalysisFactorsOR (95% CI)P ValueAge (\u226565\u00a0vs\u00a0<\u00a065) (years)2.336 (.929, 5.873).071Gender (male vs female)3.988 (1.401, 11.350).010Smoking (yes vs no)1.769 (.344, 9.097).495Hypertension (yes vs no)1.626 (.670, 3.947).282Diabetes mellitus (yes vs no).526 (.115, 2.413).408Cardiac disease (yes vs no)2.559 (.935, 7.005).067Chronic liver diseases (yes vs no).844 (.099, 7.200).877Chronic kidney disease (yes vs no)2.030 (.202, 20.406).548Malignancy (yes vs no)2.419 (.592, 9.887).219ARDS (yes vs no)20.772 (4.667, 92.453)<.001hs\u2010TNI (elevated vs normal)24.82 (6.897, 89.372)<.001D\u2010dimer (mg/L)1.057 (.919, 1.215).439LVEF (%)1.047 (.975, 1.126).207LV LS (%a)1.463 (1.179, 1.815)<.001TAPSE (mma).959 (.858, 1.071).456RV free wall S' (cm/sa)1.141 (.996, 1.337).057RVFAC( %a)1.019 (.935, 1.112).665RVFWLS (%a)1.424 (1.210, 1.676)<.001Open in a separate window\na\nPer 1 unit increase.

The intra\u2010observer and inter\u2010observer ICC for LV LS were .95 and .89, and RVFWLS were .96 and .91. 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the prognostic values of 2D STE\u2010derived biventricular longitudinal strain along with hs\u2010TNI in COVID\u201019 patients. The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) Critical patients were more prone to have larger right heart chamber, higher PASP, and lower LV LS and RVFWLS than non\u2010critical COVID\u201019 patients; (2) LV LS and RVFWLS were both mortality predictors independent from ARDS and elevated hs\u2010TNI; and (3) More importantly, combining decreased ventricular longitudinal strain with elevated hs\u2010TNI provided an incremental value for predicting mortality in COVID\u201019 patients.Recent studies reported that acute cardiac injury was an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID\u201019 patients, with the prevalence of acute cardiac injury varying from 7.2% to 37.5%.2, 3, 4, 16, 24, 25 In the present study, there were 49 out of 160 patients had cardiac injury confirmed by the elevated plasma hs\u2010TNI levels. Additionally, non\u2010survivors were more likely to develop acute cardiac injury than survivors. Although the exact pathophysiological mechanism of myocardial injury caused by COVID\u201019 is not fully understood, influenza infection and acute viral pneumonitis were known to be associated with the development of cardiac injury.26, 27, 28 Whether COVID\u201019 cardiac injury has a unique pathogenesis process is unknown. The ACE2 has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses and may lead to direct cardiac injury by the virus infection.29 Moreover, the systemic inflammatory response may result in indirect cardiac damage.30 Our study showed that patients with elevated hs\u2010TNI levels had significantly higher inflammatory indices including CRP and IL\u20106. In addition, plasma hs\u2010TNI levels were positively correlated with CRP and IL\u20106 levels, Meanwhile, histological examination presented interstitial inflammatory infiltrates of myocardial tissue obtained from deceased COVID\u201019 patients.With respect to cardiac structure and function, our study depicted the biventricular geometry and function at different levels of severity in COVID\u201019 patients. The conventional echocardiographic parameters revealed that right heart chamber was larger, and the PASP was higher in critical patients than non\u2010critical patients. As previous studies have pointed out, ARDS can cause an increase in RV afterload due to severe hypoxemia and the augmented pulmonary vascular resistance.31, 32 The presence of ARDS was more common in critical patients than non\u2010critical patients (82.0%\u00a0vs 23.6%) in our study, which can explain for the increase of RV afterload. Additionally, although there was no significant difference in LVEF and RVFAC between these two groups, the value of LV LS and RVFWLS were lower in critical patients. It reflected that longitudinal myocardial strain is capable of detecting subclinical impairment of ventricular function with greater sensitivity than conventional echocardiographic parameters, which was in alignment with previous studies.5, 6 Because the subendocardial layer of the myofibers contributes mainly to longitudinal strain which is more sensitive to myocardial injury.33 Our pathological assessment from autopsies also revealed interstitial or cardiomyocyte edema and necrosis of myocardial tissue, although the pathological specimens were small. The ability to achieve early detection of impaired myocardial function in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection by STE may help risk stratify patients, and the strain value can be easily obtained from bedside echocardiography. In addition, we used the LV LS that was derived from apical four\u2010chamber rather than LV global longitudinal strain from 4\u2010, 3\u2010 and 2\u2010 chamber considering the high risk of contagion to healthcare workers, as well as feasibility of image acquisition in the setting of respiratory illness and improve feasibility in performing strain analysis from bedside echocardiography. Further, previous study has proved the good feasibility, reproducibility of LV LS derived from apical 4\u2010chamber and demonstrated its strong correlation with LV global longitudinal strain from 4\u2010, 3\u2010 and 2\u2010 chamber. Therefore, it is reasonable to use LV LS to assess LV myocardial function during the outbreak of COVID\u201019.34\nRisk stratification of patients with COVID\u201019 can aid decision making in early patient triage and resource allocation. Previously, elevated hs\u2010TNI levels, lower LV LS and RVFWLS, respectively, were reported as predictors for death in COVID\u201019 patients.2, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 35 However, whether the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs\u2010TNI has an incremental prognostic value in COVID\u201019 patients has not been evaluated. Our study firstly confirmed the significant prognostic value of ventricular myocardial function. The multivariant logistic analysis revealed that LV LS and RVFWLS both were independent predictors for higher mortality in COVID\u201019 patients, which was in alignment with previous studies in various other diseases.7, 8, 9, 10 More importantly, the further combination of the decreased LV LS or RVFWLS with the elevated hs\u2010TNI could increase the accuracy for predicting mortality in COVID\u201019 patients, the lower strain values combined with elevated hs\u2010TNI levels resulted in an increased risk for death. Therefore, we demonstrated that the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs\u2010TNI can provide an incremental predictive value of death, which may help to stratify higher risk COVID\u201019 patients. 5.\u2003LIMITATIONSOur study had some limitations. First, this was a single\u2010center study, and the sample size was relatively small. Due to the limited number of events, we did not include all the potential factors associated with mortality in our study. Second, 2D\u2010STE technique was dependent on image quality, and the cutoff value of strain in our study may not apply to other software algorithms due to inter\u2010vendor variability. Third, we used the LV LS that was derived from apical 4\u2010chamber rather than LV global longitudinal strain from 4\u2010, 3\u2010 and 2\u2010 chamber considering the high risk of contagion to healthcare workers, as well as feasibility of image acquisition in the setting of respiratory illness. Fourth, the autopsy findings in deceased patients were based on a small sample size due to autopsy was unusual in the pandemic environment. Finally, as a retrospective study design, we did not acquire all the laboratory biomarker tests of our patients. Therefore, future studies with multi\u2010center involvement may strengthen the study power. 6.\u2003CONCLUSIONSOur study showed that LV LS and RVFWLS were both mortality predictors independent from ARDS and elevated hs\u2010TNI in COVID\u201019 patients. Furthermore, the combination of the elevated hs\u2010TNI and decreased LV LS or RVFWLS could help increase the predictive value for fatal outcome. Therefore, we highlight the combination of ventricular longitudinal strain with hs\u2010TNI may enhance risk stratification in COVID\u201019 patients.
