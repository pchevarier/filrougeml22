{"title": "The mouse ribosomal gene terminator consists of three functionally separable sequence elements", "pubDate": "1988", "PMCID": "PMC458401", "DOI": "", "PMID": "2900760", "abstract": "The structural requirements for 3' end formation of mouse pre-rRNA have been studied. Three sequence elements are shown to be required for accurate and efficient transcription termination by RNA polymerase I (pol I) assayed both in a cell-free transcription system and in vivo after transfection of rDNA minigene constructs into 3T6 cells. The essential termination signal is the previously identified 18-bp conserved element (AGGTCGACCAGATTANTCCG) that contains a SalI restriction site. This sequence motif (the 'Sal box') interacts with a specific nuclear protein that directs transcription termination. Here we demonstrate that the 'Sal box' sequence motif is sufficient for termination of pol I transcripts and the release of the nascent RNA chains from the template. However, in addition to this termination signal, pyrimidine-rich sequences flanking the box at the 5' and 3' side play a role in the efficient and correct formation of authentic pre-rRNA termini. Downstream sequences contribute to the efficiency of the termination reaction, whereas the position of 3' end formation (i.e. 21 bp upstream of the 'Sal box') is affected by 5' flanking regions. These flanking regions are recognized by at least two different nuclear factors which specifically bind to DNA sequences located upstream and downstream of the 'Sal box'.", "author": [{"author": "A Kuhn", "affiliation": ["Institut f\u00fcr Biochemie der Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrburg, FRG."], "href": "/?term=Kuhn+A&cauthor_id=2900760"}, {"author": "A Normann", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Normann+A&cauthor_id=2900760"}, {"author": "I Bartsch", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Bartsch+I&cauthor_id=2900760"}, {"author": "I Grummt", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Grummt+I&cauthor_id=2900760"}], "refPMID": ["2410138", "3527052", "4022007", "6326106", "3649563", "2411548", "3779846", "922889", "3779845", "3929071", "3458534", "3768960", "3456157", "498279", "3024969", "6269071", "3600650", "6700588", "6828386", "6684995", "4075406", "3774539", "3621348", "6294665", "6304717", "3453104", "3568131", "3785147", "3012322", "3025624", "6196192", "16453684", "6856465", "2580642", "2989774", "518835", "4705382", "6275366"], "citedInPMID": ["2900760", "33362980", "26847178", "25092870", "22805593", "19487567", "16524917", "9582279", "9396822", "9009277", "8417359", "8413256", "8356050", "8196643", "8099514", "7720715", "7597036", "3244359", "2779566", "2685755", "2395639"], "body": ""}
