Its effectiveness in improving oxygenation and reducing intubation rate and mortality, and its tolerability, timing, and optimal duration are unclear.\u2022 Awake prone positioning appears to be a safe and tolerable intervention for non-intubated patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure attributable to acute respiratory distress syndrome or COVID-19.\u2022 Potential benefits include improved oxygenation and mortality rate, but no significant effects on incidence of intubation or critical care admission were found.\u2022 Future research should explore the optimal frequency, duration, and appropriate population for application of awake prone positioning with noninvasive respiratory support. Large, well-designed trials are needed to explore the subject more rigorously and to confirm clinical effectiveness.\n\nProne positioning is an established evidence-based practice for mechanically ventilated patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),1 but it is a novel intervention in spontaneously breathing patients. Physiologically, prone positioning may promote lung recruitment of the posterior dorsal regions because of reversal of atelectasis.2 Proning may also generate a more homogeneous ventilation reducing lung strain attributable to changes in pleural pressure and pleural space distribution,3 and therefore favouring ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching4 and reducing shunting.5\nAwake prone positioning in hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) can be a feasible and safe intervention6\n,\n7 alongside noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow oxygen. Despite its anecdotal and theoretical benefit in improving oxygenation, it has not been widely applied in practice until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The unprecedented surge of patients requiring critical care support generated significant pressure on ICU capacity. Clinicians needed to balance local resources with the rapid demand, and awake prone positioning was initially a pragmatic approach with the goal to improve oxygenation, prevent intubation, and potentially reduce the need for ICU admission.8\n,\n9\nThe natural progression and the pathophysiological changes of ARDS and COVID-19 respiratory failure affect critically ill patients with different degrees of severity, and 42\u201358% will require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.10\n,\n11 Invasive mechanical ventilation may lead to additional risks, such as ventilation-associated pneumonia and ventilation-induced lung injury, and its associated mortality rate may reach 27\u201345%.11\n,\n12\nSeveral observational studies support the use of awake prone positioning to improve oxygenation for spontaneously breathing patients affected by respiratory failure.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Its effectiveness in reducing intubation rate and mortality remains unclear,19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and also its tolerability,24\n,\n25 timing, and optimal duration.26 A general potential concern is that APP may worsen self-inflicted lung injury and delay intubation and mechanical ventilation.19\n,\n27 It remains unclear if there is a specific window for awake prone positioning to improve oxygenation (in terms of both time and levels of hypoxia), or if there exist subgroups of responders and non-responders.This review and meta-analysis aims to further evaluate the hypothesis that awake prone positioning in spontaneously breathing patients with ARF is associated with improvement in oxygenation and rate of tracheal intubation and mortality. We also investigated potential risks and limitations associated with awake prone positioning. This work will inform future studies and allow evaluation of potentially effective interventions for improving the management of spontaneously breathing patients with ARF. MethodsThis study was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), and it is published under registration ID CRD42021250322.Search strategyTwo reviewers (BF and AP) independently identified all potentially relevant studies published from January 2010 to August 2021. The search strategy involved a combination of keywords as follows: (i) awake prone positioning, (ii) acute respiratory distress or ARDS or hypoxaemic respiratory failure, or (iii) coronavirus 2019 or COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. The search ran through electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, CINAHL, BMJ Best Practice, WHO SARS-CoV-2 Research Database, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and Cambridge University Press Coronavirus Free Access Collection. The references were identified against our inclusion criteria and duplicates removed, as shown in Figure\u00a01\n. There were no language restrictions. Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently in duplicate (BF and AP) for selection of full-text review. Both reviewers also independently reviewed the full text of relevant studies and decided on eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consensus with a third reviewer (ZP). The references retrieved were saved into a customised Excel (Microsoft 365\u00ae, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet. This report follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines.28\nOpen in a separate windowFig 1Search strategy flow diagram.Study inclusion criteriaWe selected all design studies, including at least 20 participants. Studies were not selected on methodological quality. Eligible studies included adult patients (age \u226518 yr old) with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure attributable to ARDS or COVID-19 who received PP alongside with any oxygen delivery device, including simple oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal oxygen, CPAP, and NIV. We included patients of any gender admitted to any ward or to ICU.We excluded studies (i) that applied prone position in intubated patients, (ii) that involved the application of prone positioning combined or mixed to lateral positioning, and (iii) with a follow-up shorter than 7 days.Data extraction and study qualityData extraction was undertaken independently and in duplicate (BF and AP) to avoid bias. Data abstracted were stored into a customised Excel database, including study design, patient characteristics, intervention, and outcomes.Observational studies were assessed for evidence of bias using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS),29 and RCTs were assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment), Development and Evaluation guidelines were used for rating the quality of evidence.30\nOutcomesWe analysed the following outcomes based on consensus. The primary outcome considered was the change in oxygenation pre and post PP reported as Pao2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio or SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio. The secondary outcomes included the rate of tracheal intubation, mortality, ICU admission, limitations, and adverse events (such as line displacement and pressure sores).Subgroup analysisA subgroup analysis was planned based on P/F ratio (P/F ratio <150 mm Hg vs P/F ratio >150 mm Hg) and length of prone positioning (PP <4 h vs PP >4 h).Study analysisWhere P/F ratio was not available, S/F ratio was transformed into P/F ratio following the validated standard formula.31\nWe reported dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio and continuous outcomes using mean difference (MD). If mean and standard deviation were not available, data were assessed in the median/inter-quartile range (IQR) and transformed into standard MD format for further comparison.32 The inverse variance method was used to pool the MDs to yield an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).For each analysis, studies were weighted using the inverse variance method, and data were pooled using a random effects meta-analyses model accounting for the incidence.33 We assessed clinical heterogeneity amongst studies qualitatively, and statistical heterogeneity using the \u03c72 test and I\n2 statistical measure.32\n,\n34\nP-value equal to 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant. We assessed publication bias by visually examining funnel plots of treatment effect vs study precision. All statistical data analyses were performed using the statistical software package Review Manager 5.4 (RevMan 5.4.1) from Cochrane Collaboration (Oxford, UK). ResultsA total of 417 studies were identified by the search strategy, and after removal of duplicates 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, as shown in Figure\u00a01. The study characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01\n. All studies were recent and published between 2020 and 2021, comprising patients with moderate-to-severe respiratory failure secondary to ARDS or COVID-19. In all, 2352 patients were included, of those 99% (n=2332/2352) had COVID-19. Amongst 1041 (44%) undergoing awake prone positioning, 1021 were SARS-CoV-2 positive.Table\u00a01Baseline characteristics of included studies.

The NOS found relatively high risk of bias with five studies of good quality, one study of fair quality, and six studies of poor quality (refer to the Supplementary table). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool reported potential for unclear and high risk of bias with particular loss of precision regarding the\u00a0blinding of personnel, as seen in the Supplementary materials.Primary outcomeThe MD in Pao2/FiO2 ratio before and after APP was \u201323.10 (\u201334.80 to \u201311.39; P<0.0001; I\n2=26%) using outcomes from the five studies that reported this information (see Fig.\u00a02\n). A subgroup analysis was performed for proning duration of >4 or <4 h. There was a difference in Pao2/FiO\n2 ratio of \u201316.91 (\u201325.25 to \u20138.31; P<0.0001; l\n2=0%) in those placed in prone position <4 h compared with a larger improvement in Pao2/FiO2 ratio of \u201337.47 (\u201356.70 to \u201318.23; P<0.0001; l\n2=0%) in those placed in the prone position >4 h. Considering, however, the limited number of studies per subgroup with 87 and 102 patients each, respectively, we were unable to draw substantial conclusions from this analysis.Open in a separate windowFig 2Primary outcome: changes in oxygenation.

CI, confidence interval; PP, prone position; sd, standard deviation.Despite all patients included the fitting criteria for moderate-to-severe ARDS (Pao2/FiO2 <200 mm Hg),35 we were unable to evaluate the specific Pao2/FiO2 threshold at which one might benefit most from awake proning, and this remains unclear.Secondary outcomesWe only included studies with a control group, including patients in supine position only, as qualitative heterogeneity between studies was too large to report a meaningful meta-analysis of outcomes using generic inverse variance. This resulted in a meta-analysis, including studies with patients who only have COVID-19.Intubation The odds ratio (OR) for intubation was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.43\u20131.22; P=0.220; I\n2=75%) for patients who had awake prone positioning compared with supine controls, showing a non-significant benefit and large heterogeneity (see Fig.\u00a03\n). There was a pooled intubation rate of 38.3% for patients with awake prone positioning amongst 12 studies reporting this information. The subgroup analysis of those placed in the prone position >4 h showed an OR for intubation of 1.15 (0.66\u20131.99; P=0.630; I\n2=70%), whereas those placed in the prone position <4 h had an OR of 0.30 (0.18\u20130.49; P<0.001; I\n2=0%). We observed large differences in heterogeneity between these analyses, so we would advise caution in interpreting these results. A small RCT found no difference within 30-day mortality when comparing patients placed in prone position for a median of 3.4 h vs a median of 9 h (cumulative hours per day).Open in a separate windowFig 3Secondary outcome: intubation.

The OR for mortality was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.36\u20130.93; P=0.02; I\n2=51%), indicating a statistically significant improvement in prone compared with supine patients (see Fig. 4\n). A subgroup analysis of patients placed in the prone position >4 h revealed an OR for mortality of 0.30 (0.10\u20130.92; P=0.0001; I\n2=86%). Only one study reported mortality rate in patients placed in the prone position <4 h, preventing further subgroup analysis. The small RCT reported no difference was seen in patients placed in the prone position for a cumulative median of 3.4 h compared with those placed in the prone position for 9 h (HR 2.29 [0.57; 9.14]; P=0.300).Open in a separate windowFig 4Secondary outcome: mortality. Forest plot demonstrating pooled data of mortality across studies with comparator group using a random effects model. CI, confidence interval.ICU admission Only four studies reported incidence of critical care admission, and this was mainly amongst those with no control group. A study observing a selected cohort of patients undertaking awake prone positioning in the emergency department reported 41% (9/22;) incidence of ICU admission. A retrospective cohort study that compared a prone and supine group observed no difference in critical care admission rate (HR 1.14 [0.96, 1.34]; P=0.183). Higher incidence of ICU admission has been noted in patients placed in the prone position for less than 1 h compared with those placed in the prone position for more than 1 h (APP <1 h: 83%, 10/12 vs APP >1 h: 41%, 14/34; P=0.011). A recent RCT found no difference in rate of ICU admission between patients placed in the prone position for a cumulative median of 3.4 h compared with those placed in the prone position for 9 h (P=0.580).Time and duration of prone positioning All studies considered different time of enrolment for APP; therefore, stratification based on S/F ratio or P/F ratio was not possible (see Supplementary files). Similarly, authors used various oxygen delivery interface alongside APP, making a subgroup analysis not feasible.Amongst the studies, the duration of prone positioning varied from less than 1 h up to 16 h day\u22121. Median duration of APP was 3 h (IQR: 2\u201316 h), but was not reported in four studies. Awake proning was not tolerated in 15% of patients across six studies reporting this information.Respiratory changes during and after prone positioning Only six studies (42%) reported changes in ventilatory frequency (VF) pre- and post-PP. Data are equally divided, with 50% (three of six studies) reporting a statistically significant reduction in VF, or conversely no significant difference was observed after pronation (refer to Supplementary files).Adverse events No significant adverse events were reported, but common limitations were back pain (6%), intolerance (5%), anxiety (3%), discomfort (2%), refusal (2%), pressure sores (2%), hypoxaemia (1%), and accidental lines removal (1%). The small RCT reported two cardiac arrests in patients placed in the prone position for a median of 9 h (2/36), and one cardiac arrest in the control group (1/39) placed in the prone position for a median of 3.4 h, but none were attributable to or associated with awake prone positioning. DiscussionOur systematic review and meta-analysis pooled results from 12 observational studies from international settings, including 1156 non-intubated patients with ARF caused by ARDS or COVID-19 respiratory failure. The primary meta-analysis revealed significant improvement in Pao2/FiO2 ratio and lower mortality, but intubation ratio was unchanged in the prone positioning group.The specific effects of awake prone positioning in patients with ARF are not yet fully understood. The improvement in oxygenation would suggest that awake prone positioning may follow similar pathophysiological consideration as for intubated patients, irrespective of the nature triggering the underlying lung injury. Several physiological mechanisms may explain the improvement in oxygenation in viral pneumonia (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 or influenza) or ARDS. In prone positioning, the application of a gravitational weight shifts local forces and gradient reopening non-aerated or poorly aerated areas (baby lung concept)2; therefore, lung recruitment of the posterior dependent lung regions is promoted by reversal of atelectasis. When spontaneously breathing patients are placed in prone positioning, a more homogeneous ventilation is promoted by reduced lung stretch and strain with changes in pleural pressure and pleural space distribution throughout lung regions.3\n,\n36 The improvement in ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching may be attributable to better distribution of physical forces (i.e. changes in pleural pressure gradients and gravitational forces and distribution of transpulmonary pressure) and reduced the \u2018pendelluft phenomenon\u2019 (i.e. the displacement of gas from a more recruited non-dependent lung region to a less recruited dependent lung region).4 Although lung aeration becomes more homogeneous, shunting can be reduced as the perfusion pattern remains relatively constant.5 These may be the reasons why this short-term intervention would be beneficial and improve patient-centred outcome, such as mortality. The results of this study are consistent with previous systematic reviews supporting that PP in intubated patients with severe ARDS significantly reduced mortality.37\n,\n38\nThe value of awake prone positioning39 alongside NIV40 in reducing intubation is questionable, and our results uphold this. Some observational studies have reported decreased VF and excessive work of breathing amongst those awake and placed in the prone position, resulting in a trend towards reduced intubation rate.9\n,\n14\n,\n17\n,\n18 On the contrary, a prospective observational study found no benefit in reducing the risk of intubation, but rather showed a trend for delay.20 A decrease in VF in awake prone positioning may be the result of the decrease in respiratory strain, and this is of clinical importance in avoiding tracheal intubation. We would recommend that future studies report VF as a matter of routine.In non-intubated patients, a short improvement in oxygenation with awake prone positioning without reducing vigorous spontaneous inspiratory efforts may potentially aggravate lung damage, leading to patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI).41\n,\n42 P-SILI remains hypothetical, and its clinical implication is yet to be established. This concept has polarised clinicians into different ideological positions, and for some, it is a cause of concern for which advocating for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation to be \u2018performed as soon as possible\u2019 to prevent disease progression.43\n,\n44 However, no difference has been found in mortality or duration of mechanical ventilation comparing critically ill patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who were intubated early with those intubated late.45 Therefore, P-SILI should not be a justification for performing intubation, and the harm associated with elective early intubation may outweigh the theoretical benefit.46 Further research should explore the hypothesis if a clear threshold for undertaking intubation and mechanical ventilation exists, and mechanical ventilation should not be the sole solution investigated.A recent small RCT showed no reduction in intubation or 30-day mortality rate.47 However, the neutral results may be explained by underpowered analysis, awake prone positioning combined with lateral position, and awake prone positioning largely used in the control group. The true impact of intubation and mechanical ventilation on ARDS and COVID-19 respiratory failure is still not entirely understood, and further research is warranted.44 We should be cautious about liberal intubation recommendations, and clinical decisions should be patient specific. Use of intubation and mechanical ventilation are associated with severe complications and increased mortality,48\n,\n49 and need greater resources, including not only ventilators, but also adequately trained clinicians. In future studies, we recommend reporting the incidence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia and, if numbers permit, analysis by differing oxygen delivery interfaces.Overall, we found minimal consistency regarding application of awake proning, and there is no clarity about the timing when to start and the optimal duration. Further research is needed to understand when awake prone positioning should be commenced and specifically at what stage (mild vs moderate hypoxia).Tolerance is a major limitation,47 and it is not feasible aiming for a similar duration of awake prone positioning (>16 h day\u22121) as per intubated patients.1 The effect of prone positioning may be time dependent and stage dependent (mild vs severe respiratory failure),50 but no difference has been found in intubation or mortality rate comparing awake prone positioning for 3.4 h vs 9 h.47 Ultimately, protocols should target for awake prone positioning more than 1 h, as less has been found to be associated with higher critical care admission and intubation rate.9\n,\n14\nAwake proning appears safe, and a further advantage is that it allows patients to interact with families during hospitalisation, favouring humanisation of care. Patient compliance is key and may be influenced by common factors, such as back pain, intolerance, and anxiety, which make refusal and non-compliance likely. Additional important limiting factors may be obesity (especially central obesity), pregnancy, and most of all the assistance of dedicated healthcare practitioners that can prevent further injuries to the patient. The management of a conscious but rapidly deteriorating patient can be extremely difficult at the ward level; therefore, awake proning requires close input from doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists to ensure it is successful especially during initial sessions. Patients must be aware of the procedure and be cooperative, and clinicians should be mindful of practical considerations, such as optimisation of analgesia, adequate communication, and assistance to improve comfort, adherence, and proper positioning.Our review is unique as the first to establish a series of important analyses to reflect contemporary application of prone positioning in non-intubated patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. The paucity of evidence available consists of the main limitation of this review, as the majority of the studies included are observational in nature. Our review generates the hypothesis if further high-quality evidence is needed. The initial interest surrounding APP was the expectation that this may be a safe and effective strategy able to optimise ventilator shortage during the surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Awake prone position may be a potential beneficial and effective intervention, but it may not be significant until applied in the optimal time and duration and to the right population. Awake prone position is a low-cost strategy and practical tool to manage deteriorating patients, but it should be applied by trained practitioners and intubation should not be delayed when clinically indicated. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying a responsive target population and mastering the specifics of the approach and execution of the intervention. These should be the focus of future studies. Larger and well-designed studies (ideally RCTs) are needed to explore the subject more rigorously. ConclusionsAwake prone positioning may be a promising therapy for non-intubated patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure attributable to ARDS or COVID-19. Potential benefits include improvement in oxygenation and mortality rate, but there is no significant effect on incidence of intubation or critical care admission. The optimal frequency, duration, and criteria for starting or stopping proning remain unclear. Although no significant adverse events attributable to awake prone positioning were reported, awake prone positioning is not without limitations, and it is associated with intolerance, discomfort, and anxiety.
