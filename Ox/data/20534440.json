Progression of Pol II through these stages is modulated by the interplay of numerous factors. Of the various mechanisms that regulate transcription, promoter-proximal pausing during early elongation has recently gained recognition as a widespread rate-limiting step in metazoans (1, 2). Genomewide analyses have revealed that thousands of genes in higher eukaryotes contain transcriptionally engaged Pol II concentrated at their promoters, indicating a postinitiation regulatory mechanism (3\u20135). In human cells, global analysis of nuclear run-on products detected paused Pol II on numerous genes (6). In Drosophila, promoter-proximal pausing was first identified on the uninduced hsp70 gene (7, 8). Permanganate genomic footprinting reveals that pausing typically occurs 20\u201350\u00a0nt downstream of the transcription start site in a large number of genes (9). Paused polymerase was observed in promoters of many genes controlling Drosophila development, suggesting the importance of this process in regulating gene expression during complex developmental events (5, 10, 11).Two protein complexes, DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), are involved in promoter-proximal pausing in vivo (12) and have been shown to cooperatively repress transcription elongation in vitro (13). A widely accepted model proposes that the kinase P-TEFb alleviates this repression by phosphorylating Pol II and DSIF (14\u201316). This model is supported by ChIP results showing that during heat shock induction, P-TEFb is recruited to the heat shock genes (17).NELF is a multisubunit complex that is known to regulate transcription of many genes. For example, it was found to attenuate transcription of some genes induced by the estrogen receptor (18). NELF is also involved in pausing Pol II on the HIV provirus, and depletion of NELF causes loss of paused Pol II and increased virus production (19). RNAi mediated knockdown of NELF was shown to cause a significant reduction in the expression of numerous Drosophila genes that had paused Pol II, and it was proposed that the paused Pol II prevented nucleosomes from assembling over the core promoter region (4).NELF is thought to inhibit elongation by binding the nascent transcript when it exits the Pol II, thereby restricting further extrusion of RNA (12). The NELF-E subunit has an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which binds RNA, and mutation of the RRM renders NELF unable to repress elongation in vitro (16). Another model, based on the sequence similarity between NELF-A and the hepatitis delta virus antigen posits that the NELF-A subunit associates with the clamp domain of Pol II (20, 21). This association could alter the active site of the Pol II in a way that inhibits elongation (1).DSIF was initially discovered as a factor that rendered Pol II transcription sensitive to DRB, a nucleoside analog (22). DSIF is composed of two subunits called Spt4 and Spt5. DRB inhibits P-TEFb, causing transcription to be sensitive to pausing by DSIF and NELF. DSIF colocalizes with Pol II at numerous loci on Drosophila polytene chromosomes (12, 23), and ChIP analyses show that DSIF is distributed across the body of transcribed genes (23, 24). Thus, DSIF is viewed as a transcription elongation factor with both positive and negative properties. In the context of promoter-proximal pausing, it is thought to stabilize the Pol II-NELF interaction (16). However, some studies have indicated that DSIF may play a more significant role in pausing. On the human A20 gene, pausing of Pol II at the promoter was reported to involve DSIF, but not NELF (25). In Caenorhabditis elegans, which has DSIF, but lacks NELF, promoter-proximal pausing occurs in response to starvation (26).In this study, we analyzed the interactions of Drosophila DSIF and NELF with the Pol II elongation complex, using a purified in vitro system (27). We found that NELF associates with the Pol II elongation complex only in the presence of DSIF. Surprisingly, we discovered that DSIF, not NELF, contacts the nascent RNA as it emerges from Pol II. This DSIF-RNA contact could be a decisive step in pausing the polymerase. ResultsPurification of Active FLAG NELF Complexes. The NELF complex consists of four subunits: NELF-A, NELF-B, NELF-D, and NELF-E. To purify the Drosophila NELF complex, we made transgenic flies that expressed FLAG-tagged versions of the B, D, or E subunits. Nuclear extracts were prepared from embryos and subjected to immunoaffinity purification using anti-FLAG beads. All four subunits of NELF were detected upon analysis of the purified samples on a Coomassie-stained, SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.\u00a01A, lanes 2\u20134). Comparison of these protein samples to a mock purified protein sample from non-FLAG expressing Drosophila nuclear extract (Fig.\u00a01A, lane 1) revealed some proteins that bind the FLAG column nonspecifically (marked with asterisks), and also some that appeared to copurify with the NELF complex. The identities of these NELF-associated proteins are being investigated. The FLAG NELF-D complex showed the best yield so it was used in the following experiments. Western blot analysis of the FLAG NELF-D complex detected all four NELF subunits (Fig.\u00a01B).Open in a separate windowFig. 1.Purification of Drosophila NELF. (A) Nuclear extracts were prepared from transgenic fly embryos expressing FLAG-NELF subunits and fractionated using anti-FLAG Sepharose (Sigma). Eluates (10\u00a0uL) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (lanes 2\u20134). Arrows indicate positions of the NELF subunits. Lane 1 (Control) shows 10\u00a0uL of eluate from a mock purification of nuclear extract from nontransgenic embryos. Asterisks denote proteins that bind nonspecifically to the FLAG column.

(C) Silver-stained gel with Pol II purified from Drosophila embryo nuclear extract and Coomassie blue-stained gel with DSIF purified from baculovirus. The prominent band migrating just above Rpb3 is an unidentified contaminant.To evaluate the activity of our NELF and DSIF preparations, we set up an in vitro elongation system (Fig.\u00a02A) using a tailed template and purified Drosophila Pol II (Fig.\u00a01C), as described previously (27). As outlined in Fig.\u00a02B, Pol II was allowed to transcribe to the end of a 22-nt-long G-less cassette and stalled by the absence of GTP. The stalled elongation complexes were incubated with buffer, purified DSIF (Fig.\u00a01C), NELF, or both proteins together. GTP was then added to the reaction to resume elongation beyond the G-less cassette, and transcript lengths were monitored at different times. As shown in Fig.\u00a02C, adding DSIF or NELF alone had no effect on the elongation rate relative to buffer alone (compare lanes 2\u20135 with lanes 10\u201313 or 14\u201317). In contrast, addition of both DSIF and NELF inhibited transcription and caused appearance of shorter transcripts at all the time points (lanes 6\u20139). These results indicate that DSIF and NELF are active and are both required for transcription inhibition.Open in a separate windowFig. 2.NELF and DSIF inhibit transcription elongation. (A) Schematic representation of the in vitro elongation system. RNA Pol II initiates transcription with UpG on the tailed template and stalls before the four Gs located at the end of the G-less cassette when GTP is absent. Upon addition of GTP, Pol II is able to resume elongation and generate a runoff transcript. (B) Outline of the experiment to measure the elongation rate of Pol II in the presence or absence of DSIF and NELF. (C) Analysis of elongation rates. Prior to addition of GTP, the stalled elongation complexes were incubated with buffer (lanes 2\u20135), DSIF (lanes 10\u201313), NELF (lanes 14\u201317), or DSIF and NELF (lanes 6\u20139). Lane 1 shows transcripts isolated from the stalled elongation complex before addition of proteins and GTP.DSIF and NELF Associate Stably with the Pol II Elongation Complex. We used a native gel-shift assay to analyze the association of DSIF and NELF with the Pol II elongation complex. A complex containing a 70-nt-long radioactive transcript, template DNA, and Pol II (EC70) was visualized on a native gel (Fig.\u00a03A, lane 1). Addition of DSIF caused a concentration-dependent shift in the migration of the Pol II complex (lanes 2\u20134), while addition of NELF did not (lanes 5\u20137), indicating that DSIF can bind the Pol II elongation complex alone, but NELF cannot. When both DSIF and NELF were added to EC70, the complex migrated slower than the DSIF-bound complex, indicating that the binding of NELF requires DSIF (lane 11). The binding of DSIF and NELF appears to be cooperative as formation of a complex containing both proteins is evident at a low amount of DSIF that fails to stably associate with the elongation complex by itself (Fig.\u00a03B). This demonstrates clearly that DSIF and NELF associate stably with a Pol II elongation complex.Open in a separate windowFig. 3.DSIF and NELF form a stable complex with the Pol II elongation complex. (A) Native gel analysis of elongation complexes. Lane 1 shows a complex of Pol II with a 70-nt radiolabeled nascent transcript and the tailed template (EC70). Approximately 100\u00a0ng (\u223c0.25\u00a0pmol) of Pol II was present in each sample. Elongation complexes stalled at the end of the G-less cassette were incubated with increasing amounts of purified DSIF (approximately 0.5\u00a0pmol, 1\u00a0pmol, and 2\u00a0pmol of DSIF; lanes 2\u20134) or purified NELF (approximately 0.15\u00a0pmol, 0.3\u00a0pmol, and 0.6\u00a0pmol of NELF; lanes 5\u20137). Lanes 8 and 9 show elongation complexes incubated with 0.5\u00a0pmol of DSIF and 0.15\u00a0pmol of NELF, respectively, and lane 10 shows a complex with both proteins added (0.5\u00a0pmol of DSIF and 0.15\u00a0pmol of NELF). The concentrations of all proteins were judged by comparing intensities of their bands to that of known amounts of protein markers on a Coomassie-stained gel. Therefore, these concentrations are only estimates and merely indicate that none of the proteins are present in large excess over the others. (B) Evidence for cooperative binding by DSIF and NELF. Approximately 100\u00a0ng (\u223c0.25\u00a0pmol) of Pol II was present in each sample. Lane 1 shows EC70 alone. Lane 2\u20135 have 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0\u00a0pmol of DSIF and no NELF. Lanes 6\u20139 have 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2\u00a0pmol NELF and 0.25\u00a0pmol of DSIF. Lanes 10\u201313 have 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2\u00a0pmol NELF and 0.5\u00a0pmol of DSIF.To verify that the slower migrating complex contained Pol II, DSIF, and NELF, we added antibodies for each of these proteins and tested if the resulting complex was supershifted. Adding preimmune serum did not affect migration of the complex (Fig.\u00a0S1, lane 3), but addition of antibodies against Pol II (Rpb3), DSIF (Spt5), NELF-D, and FLAG resulted in supershifted complexes (Fig.\u00a0S1, lanes 4, 7\u201310), indicating that NELF and DSIF bound to the Pol II elongation complex.Binding of DSIF Depends on the Length of the Nascent Transcript. Since one model by which NELF and DSIF inhibit elongation posits that NELF associates with the nascent transcript (12), we wanted to determine if the length of the nascent transcript influences binding of these proteins. We modified the length of the G-less cassette in our tailed template, to generate 31, 27, 22, 18, or 14-nt-long nascent transcripts (Fig.\u00a04 A and B). DSIF alone or in combination with NELF bound to elongation complexes with a 22-nt-long RNA (Fig.\u00a04C, lanes 1\u20134) but showed almost no binding to a complex with an 18- or a 14-nt-long RNA (lanes 5\u201312). Binding of DSIF and NELF was also observed to EC31 and EC27 (Fig.\u00a0S2). These results show that the transcript must be longer than 18\u00a0nt for these proteins to bind. Since the RNA is about 18\u00a0nt long when it begins to emerge from the body of the polymerase (28), our results suggest that DSIF and NELF bind to the newly emerged RNA.Open in a separate windowFig. 4.Binding of DSIF and NELF depends on the length of the RNA. (A) Schematic showing elongation complexes with different lengths of the nascent RNA generated by modifying the length of the G-less cassette. (B) Analysis of RNA produced by transcription on templates containing 70-, 31-, 27-, 22-, 18-, or 14-nt-long G-less cassettes on a denaturing gel. (C) Binding of DSIF and NELF to elongation complexes with different lengths of nascent transcripts. Elongation complexes containing 22-, 18-, or 14-nt-long nascent transcripts were analyzed on a native gel (lanes 1, 5, and 9). Each complex was incubated with 1\u00a0pmol of DSIF (lanes 2, 6, and 10) or 0.3\u00a0pmol of NELF (lanes 3, 7, and 11) or 1\u00a0pmol of DSIF and 0.3\u00a0pmol of NELF (lanes 4, 8, and 12).DSIF Cross-Links to the Nascent Transcript. Since DSIF alone exhibited binding to EC22 (Fig.\u00a04C, lane 2), it was possible that DSIF contacted the nascent transcript as it emerged from the elongation complex. To test this, we performed protein-RNA cross-linking studies on the elongation complexes that were bound to DSIF and NELF. Transcription reactions were assembled as before on the tailed template, except that the UV cross-linkable UTP analog 5-bromo UTP and 32P-CTP were used. When DSIF and NELF were absent, we detected two bands corresponding to Rpb1 and Rpb2 cross-linked to the RNA in the EC31 complex (Fig.\u00a05A, lane 2). When DSIF and NELF were present, we detected another band corresponding to the size of the Spt5 subunit of DSIF (lane 4; Spt5 migrates slightly slower than Rpb2). Similar results were obtained with the EC27 and EC22 complexes (Fig.\u00a0S3). In contrast, the RNA in EC18 did not cross-link to Spt5, although Rpb1 and Rpb2 cross-linking were seen (lanes 6 and 8). None of the NELF subunits were seen to cross-link to any of these complexes. Previously reported UV cross-linking studies have shown that the nascent RNA contacts the Rpb7 subunit of human Pol II when it is between 26\u201332\u00a0nt long (29). The predicted molecular weight of Drosophila Rpb7 is approximately 19\u00a0kDa, and we detected a faint band in this region of the gel in the EC31 complex but not the EC18 complex (Fig\u00a05A, lane 2, asterisk).Open in a separate windowFig. 5.Spt5 contacts the nascent RNA. (A) Results of UV cross-linking of transcription complexes EC31 and EC18. The complexes were left untreated (lanes 2 and 6) or incubated with DSIF and NELF (lanes 4 and 8) before cross-linking. Samples were then treated with RNase A and DNase I, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4%\u201320% gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7 represent non-cross-linked samples. The band marked with the asterisk may be Rpb7 (see text). (B) Immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked EC31 complex bound to DSIF and NELF. The antibodies used are shown above each lane. The Rpb1 antibody, 8WG16, associates with the CTD of Rpb1. Forty percent of the inputs were loaded in lane 1. The samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. The sequence of the nascent transcript in EC31 and EC18 is shown at the bottom. The cross-linkable Us are underlined, and the radioactive Cs are marked with asterisks.The cross-linked EC31 complex was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Pol II, Spt5, or NELF-E to verify the identity of the cross-linked bands (Fig.\u00a05B). Immunoprecipitations were carried out under conditions that would disrupt protein-protein interactions (details in Materials and Methods). In the input (lane 1), bands of expected mobility corresponding to Rpb1, Rpb2, and Spt5 were detected. The Rpb1 and Spt5 bands were recovered after immunoprecipitation with the respective antibodies (lanes 2 and 3). No bands corresponding to NELF-E were seen in the input or immunoprecipitated lanes (lanes 1 and 4). These results confirm that the Spt5 subunit of DSIF contacts the nascent transcript.Both DSIF and NELF Contact the RNA in EC70. The human NELF-E subunit has been shown to have RNA binding activity (16). Since we did not detect NELF-E or any other NELF subunits cross-linked to the nascent transcript that was 22\u201331\u00a0nt long, we tested if a longer RNA allowed binding to NELF. Adding NELF to an EC70-DSIF complex resulted in cross-linking of a polypeptide of the size of NELF-E (Fig.\u00a06A, compare lanes 1 and 2). When NELF was added alone, no band corresponding to NELF-E was observed, indicating that free NELF did not bind nonspecifically to the RNA (Fig.\u00a0S4, compare lanes 2 and 4). Immunoprecipitation using NELF-E antibody verified the identity of NELF-E (Fig.\u00a06B, lane 4 and Inset). These results suggest that NELF contacts the nascent transcript farther from the 3\u2032 end than DSIF.Open in a separate windowFig. 6.NELF-E contacts the RNA in EC70. (A) UV cross-linking of transcription complex EC70 bound to DSIF only (lane 1) or DSIF and NELF (lane 2). (B) Immunoprecipitation of EC70 by different antibodies. (Inset) Part of the gel with enhanced contrast to display the NELF-E band more clearly. Image processing was done using the curves tool in Adobe Photoshop. The sequence of the nascent transcript in EC70 is shown and annotated as described in Fig.\u00a05. DiscussionDSIF and NELF are key factors in pausing Pol II in the promoter-proximal region of genes in Drosophila and human cells (12, 16, 22). To gain insight into the mechanism by which DSIF and NELF contribute to promoter-proximal pausing, we developed a system in which we could monitor the physical interaction of DSIF and NELF with a Pol II elongation complex using a native gel electrophoresis assay. Previously, we had demonstrated that DSIF alone could associate with the Pol II elongation complex (27). Here, we have developed a method to purify Drosophila NELF, thus allowing us to explore the interplay of DSIF and NELF with the elongation complex.DSIF and NELF Bind Cooperatively to the Pol II Elongation Complex. Our results show that the association of NELF with the elongation complex is dependent on the presence of DSIF (Figs.\u00a03A and \u200band44C). Previous work provided evidence that NELF associated with preformed complexes of DSIF and Pol II in nuclear extracts but the interaction of DSIF and Pol II was not dependent on NELF (16). These interactions were likely occurring outside the context of an elongation complex and were relatively weak because the bulk of DSIF, NELF, and Pol II exist independent of each other in nuclear extracts. In contrast, our results show that NELF can significantly influence the binding of DSIF to Pol II within the context of an elongation complex when limiting amounts of DSIF are present (Figs.\u00a03 A and B and \u200band44C). Since Pol II, DSIF, and NELF have been shown to interact individually with each other (16, 30), it is likely that this network of interactions contributes to stable association of these proteins in the context of the elongation complex.The Nascent Transcript Significantly Impacts Binding of DSIF and NELF. Our binding assays show that the length of the nascent transcript affects the association of DSIF and NELF with the elongation complex. While binding of DSIF alone or in combination with NELF to the elongation complex was evident for an elongation complex with a nascent transcript of 22\u00a0nt, no binding was detected when the nascent transcript was 18\u00a0nt long (Fig.\u00a04C). These results are consistent with the finding that human DSIF and NELF require transcripts \u226518\u00a0nt long to inhibit transcription (31), and also a recent study showed human DSIF preferentially bound elongation complexes containing transcripts that were at least 25\u00a0nt long (32). The 5\u2032 end of an 18-nt-long nascent transcript just begins to emerge from the surface of Pol II (28, 33). Exposure of four additional nucleotides appears to be sufficient for binding of DSIF alone or with NELF. Notably, the association of DSIF with the elongation complex is not simply due to nonspecific interaction with the RNA or DNA because previous experiments show that binding of DSIF to the elongation complex requires specific contacts with Pol II (27).One way in which nascent transcript length could affect the association of DSIF and NELF is by providing an additional binding site in the elongation complex. Previous results have directed attention at an RRM in NELF-E (16). Mutations in this RRM impair the capacity of NELF to inhibit elongation in the presence of DSIF. However, these experiments focused on elongation over distances greater than 100\u00a0nt. Our finding that DSIF associates with EC22 but not EC18 suggests that DSIF rather than NELF might be interacting with the nascent transcript, and our RNA-protein cross-linking data support this hypothesis. The Spt5 subunit of Drosophila and human DSIF contains five Kyprides, Ouzounis, Woese (KOW) domains. An isolated KOW domain from Aquifex aeolicus NusG has been shown to associate with RNA (34), so it is possible that one of these domains in Spt5 is contacting the nascent transcript as it emerges from the elongation complex.Our cross-linking analysis detected contact between NELF-E and the nascent transcript in EC70 (Fig.\u00a06) but not in EC31 (Fig.\u00a05). The 5\u2032 end of the nascent transcript contacts Rpb7 when its length is between 26 to 32\u00a0nt (29). Therefore it is possible that a longer nascent transcript is required to allow contact with NELF. Given that promoter-proximal pausing can occur before Pol II transcribes 30\u00a0nt (35), we propose that the RRM of NELF-E is not involved in promoter-proximal pausing. Its role could be limited to processes involving longer nascent transcripts such as regulation that appears to involve the transactivation response element of HIV (36) or 3\u2032 end formation of histone mRNAs (37).Insights into Promoter-Proximal Pausing. The finding that DSIF and NELF associate with EC22 but not with EC18 is very relevant to the process of promoter-proximal pausing. Permanganate genomic footprinting of over 60 different promoters reveals that Pol II pauses in the promoter-proximal region 20 to 50\u00a0nt downstream from the transcription start site (9). Those cases where the Pol II appeared to be pausing closer to a transcription start site were found to have the start sites inaccurately mapped (38). Thus, the promoter-proximal limit for the range where Pol II pauses is likely to be dictated by the minimum length of RNA required for DSIF to associate with the elongation complex.From the results presented here, we propose that the first step in promoter-proximal pausing involves binding of DSIF to the nascent transcript. NELF subsequently associates to form a stable complex. Importantly, this complex alone is not sufficient to stably pause the Pol II as our results (Fig.\u00a02C) and those of others (15) show that elongation is slowed but not halted in reactions involving only these three proteins. Hence other factors that remain to be identified are likely to act in concert with this core complex of DSIF, NELF, and Pol II to stably pause Pol II in the promoter-proximal region of genes. Since transcription in vivo occurs on chromatin, nucleosomes may cooperate with DSIF and NELF in setting up the paused polymerase (39, 40). The experimental approach described here could serve as a way to identify additional factors involved in pausing. Materials and MethodsTransgenic Flies. cDNA sequences of NELF-B, NELF-D, or NELF-E were amplified from the plasmids pRMHA3.FLAG NELF-D, pRMHA3.FLAG NELF-B and pA5c\u0394P.FLAG NELF-E and inserted downstream of the hsp83 promoter in pCaSpeR-hs83 (41). The resulting plasmids encoded NELF-D and NELF-B with two C-terminal FLAG tags and NELF-E with a single N-terminal FLAG tag. Drosophila transformation was done by standard methods (Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc.).Purification of NELF and DSIF. Large populations of transgenic flies expressing FLAG-tagged NELF-B, NELF-D, or NELF-E were used for making nuclear extracts. Drosophila nuclear extracts were prepared from approximately 40\u00a0g of embryos as described previously (42) and dialyzed against 100\u00a0mM KCl-HEMG (25\u00a0mM Hepes pH 7.6, 12.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA pH 8, 10% glycerol), supplemented with 1\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5\u00a0mM sodium bisulfite, and 0.1\u00a0mM PMSF until the conductivity of the extract matched that of 180\u00a0mM KCl-HEMG. The extract (8\u00a0mL at \u223c24\u00a0mg/mL protein) was incubated with 300\u00a0\u03bcL of anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) for 4\u00a0h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The beads were washed with 5\u00a0mL of 180\u00a0mM KCl-HEMG, three times for 10\u00a0min each and then with 5\u00a0mL of 100\u00a0mM KCl-HEMG, two times for 5\u00a0min each at 4\u2009\u00b0C. FLAG NELF complexes were eluted with 300\u00a0\u03bcL of 100\u00a0mM KCl-HEMG containing FLAG peptide (100\u00a0ng/\u03bcL, Sigma) for 30\u00a0min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Purification of DSIF is described in ref.\u00a027. This involves tandem FLAG and HA-tag affinity purifications of coexpressed FLAG-Spt5 and HA-Spt4 from baculovirus-infected cells. Spt5 in this preparation can be phosphorylated with P-TEFb and methylated with PRMT1 indicating that some portions of these potential modification sites in Spt5 are unmodified.Purification of RNA Pol II from Drosophila Embryos. Purification of RNA Pol II was based upon a previously described protocol (43), which was used because the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II remained intact during purification. Five 10-g portions of 0- to 12-h embryos, which had been previously dechorionated and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C, were processed in succession. Each portion was homogenenized in 40\u00a0mL of 0.3\u00a0M HGAED/pc with 10\u00a0strokes in a motorized dounce homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. HGAED/pc corresponds to 25\u00a0mM Hepes pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTT, 1\u00a0mM PMSF, 16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Benzamidine HCl, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Pepstatin A, 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Leupeptin, 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the molar concentration that precedes this refers to the concentration of ammonium sulfate. DTT and all protease inhibitors were added fresh. Homogenates from 10-gram portions were filtered through one layer of Miracloth. The total homogenate from 50\u00a0g of embryos was distributed equally among eight Oak Ridge ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 45,000\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0h at 4\u2009\u00b0C in a 70Ti rotor. The clear liquid located between a top white layer and a gelatinous pellet was collected with a large bore syringe. This yielded \u223c165\u00a0mL of extract.The lysate was diluted with an equal volume of 25\u00a0mM Hepes pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, and 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA and loaded at 5\u00a0mL/\u00a0min onto a 300-mL DEAE cellulose column previously equilibrated with 0.12\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc (0.1\u00a0pc indicates that the concentration of protease inhibitors was reduced tenfold). The column was washed with 900\u00a0mL of 0.12\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc, and proteins were eluted with a 1,400\u00a0mL 0.12 to 0.45\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc gradient. Pol II activity was assayed as described (43) and observed to elute in two distinct peaks. The second peak of Pol II activity, which had the highest specific activity, was diluted with 0\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc to a conductivity that matched 0.2\u00a0M HGAED and then loaded onto an 8-mL POROS heparin column previously equilibrated with 0.2\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc. The column was washed with 20\u00a0mL of 0.2\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc, and Pol II was eluted with a 40-mL gradient from 0.2 to 0.6\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc at a flow rate of 2\u00a0mL/\u00a0min. The peak of Pol II activity was diluted with 0\u00a0M HGAED/0.1\u00a0pc to a conductivity that matched 0.2\u00a0M HGAED and was loaded onto a Mono Q 10/10 column previously equilibrated with 0.2\u00a0M HGKED/0.1\u00a0pc (HGKED contains potassium chloride instead of ammonium sulfate). The column was washed with 30\u00a0mL of 0.35\u00a0M HGKED/0.1\u00a0pc, and Pol II was eluted with an 80-mL gradient from 0.35 to 0.6\u00a0M HGKED/0.1\u00a0pc. SDS-PAGE analysis of the Pol II indicated that CTD of the largest subunit of Pol II was intact.DNA Templates. Templates were PCR amplified from a plasmid containing a G-less cassette. The forward primer included a BglII site and was modified to amplify different lengths of the G-less cassette. The same reverse primer was used for generating all lengths of template. The PCR products had a 70-, 31-, 27-, 22-, 18-, or 14-nt-long G-less cassette followed by 80-nt DNA sequence containing all four nucleotides. These were digested with BglII [New England Biolabs (NEB)], dephosphorylated with Antarctic phosphatase (NEB), and ligated to a 5\u2032-phosphorylated oligonucleotide with the sequence GATCAAAAAAAATTA. The resulting 11-nt overhang served as an initiation site for Pol II in the presence of the starting dinucleotide UpG (Sigma).Generation of Stalled Elongation Complexes. Transcription reactions (15\u00a0\u03bcL) contained 50\u00a0mM Hepes pH 7.6, 200\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM MnCl2, 12% glycerol, 0.5\u00a0mM DTT, 0.5\u00a0mM UpG, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 100\u00a0ng of template, and \u223c100\u00a0ng of purified Drosophila Pol II. The template was preincubated with Pol II for 5\u00a0min in the transcription buffer, and then transcription was initiated by adding a 5\u00a0\u03bcL NTP mix, yielding final concentrations of 0.1\u00a0mM ATP, 0.1\u00a0mM CTP, 5\u00a0\u03bcM UTP, 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2032O-methyl GTP, and 1\u00a0\u03bcCi/reaction of [\u03b1-32P] UTP. Each reaction was incubated at 21\u2009\u00b0C for 25\u00a0min.Binding of Proteins to the Elongation Complexes. Purified DSIF and NELF were added to the transcription reactions and allowed to bind to the Pol II elongation complex for 15\u00a0min. Five micrograms of yeast RNA was then added to the reactions to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins to the nascent transcript. In cases where antibodies against different proteins were used, the antibodies were added to the reactions after the 15-min incubation with the proteins and further incubated for 10\u00a0min. The samples were analyzed on native gels, processed for UV cross-linking, or used for RNA extraction.Analyses of Elongation Complexes by Native Gel Electrophoresis. Gel running buffer (RB) contained 50\u00a0mM Tris pH 8.5, 0.38\u00a0M Glycine, 2\u00a0mM EDTA, and 5\u00a0mM MgCl2. Sixty milliliters of the 4% acrylamide gel mix were made using 6\u00a0mL of 40\u22361 acrylamide:bis solution, 12\u00a0mL of 5X RB, 1.5\u00a0mL of 100% glycerol, and 30\u00a0\u03bcL of 1\u00a0M DTT. One hundred fifty milliliters of 25% ammonium persulfate and 55\u00a0\u03bcL of N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethylenediamine were used to polymerize the gel mix overnight. Gels (20\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.5\u00a0mm) were prerun at 100\u00a0V at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min. Samples were loaded onto the gels without the addition of dye. A Bromophenol Blue-Xylene Cyanol dye mix was loaded in an adjacent lane to track the progress of the electrophoresis. Gels were run at 200\u00a0V for 4\u00a0h at 4\u2009\u00b0C, transferred to paper, dried, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager.Analyses of Transcripts. Transcription reactions were stopped with 40-\u03bcL stop buffer (20\u00a0mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.2\u00a0M NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.25\u00a0mg/mL yeast RNA, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL proteinase K). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10\u00a0min and then extracted once with 60\u00a0\u03bcL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (25\u223624\u22361). The RNA was ethanol precipitated and analyzed on an 8% denaturing gel. The gels were dried on paper and analyzed using a PhosphorImager.Protein-RNA UV Cross-Linking. In vitro transcription reactions were carried out using 0.1\u00a0mM ATP, 0.1\u00a0mM Bromo-UTP, 5\u00a0\u03bcM CTP, 5\u00a0\u03bcM 3\u2032O-methyl GTP, and 1\u00a0\u03bcCi/reaction of [\u03b1-32P] CTP. Protein-bound complexes were UV cross-linked on ice for 10\u00a0min, using a 300-nm wavelength lamp. The samples were then treated with DNase I (1 unit) and RNase A (1\u00a0\u03bcg) for 15\u00a0min at room temperature to digest the template and RNA that was not bound to protein. This results in tagging of proteins with a small piece of radioactive RNA. The protein-RNA complexes were trichloroacetic acid precipitated or immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Immunoprecipitation of Cross-Linked Complexes. Cross-linked samples were treated with DNase I and RNase A and then supplemented with SDS and DTT to final concentrations of 1% and 10\u00a0mM, respectively. The samples were heated to 55\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. Immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50\u00a0mM Hepes pH 7.5, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail) was added to the reactions such that the final concentration of SDS in the samples was reduced to 0.1%. Antibodies (8WG16, Spt5 or NELF-E) were then added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by incubation with Protein A Sepharose beads (GE) for 4\u00a0h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Beads were washed three times for 10\u00a0min each with IP buffer at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Samples were boiled for 4\u00a0min in 1X SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Transcription Elongation Analyses. Stalled elongation complexes were generated as described above, with the following modifications. Each reaction was scaled up to 60\u00a0\u03bcL and contained 10\u00a0\u03bcM ATP and CTP and 1\u00a0\u03bcM UTP. O-methyl GTP was excluded, so that transcription beyond the G-less cassette could be resumed upon addition of GTP. After 25\u00a0min of transcription to generate stalled elongation complexes, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 3\u00a0mM. We found that the presence of Mg2+ during the elongation reaction increased the sensitivity of transcription to inhibition by DSIF and NELF possibly because it increases the nucleotide specificity of the Pol II (44). The reactions were then incubated with buffer or protein for 15\u00a0min. Ten-microliter samples were transferred to tubes containing 40\u00a0\u03bcL of stop buffer before and after incubation with buffer or proteins (corresponding to -15\u2032 and 0\u2032 time points). Finally, GTP was added to the remaining reaction to a final concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10-\u03bcL aliquots were removed 2, 4, and 8\u00a0min after the addition of GTP. RNA was extracted from all the samples, and transcripts were analyzed on an 8% denaturing gel.
