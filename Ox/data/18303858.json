{"title": "NELF-E RRM undergoes major structural changes in flexible protein regions on target RNA binding", "pubDate": "2008", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1021/bi702429m", "PMID": "18303858", "abstract": "The E subunit of the human heterotetrameric negative transcription elongation factor (NELF-E) contains a canonical betaalphabetabetaalphabeta RNA recognition motif (RRM) that binds to a wide variety of RNA sequences. These induce very similar conformational changes in the RRM as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Although the RNA binding interface of a canonical RRM is mainly located at its beta-sheet surface, for NELF-E RRM large chemical shift perturbations are observed for residues in the flexible C-terminal region and the loop between beta 3 and alpha 2, and both regions are distant from the interface. We determined the solution structure of single-stranded transactivator responsive element (TAR) RNA-bound NELF-E RRM. This structure clearly shows that RNA binding to NELF-E RRM induces formation of a helix in the C-terminus. The RNA-bound form of NELF-E RRM is very similar to the RNA-bound form of U1A RRM, although the C-terminus of the NELF-E RRM is unstructured in the free protein, whereas it is helical in the U1A protein. Thus, RNA binding to NELF-E RRM induces a conformational change toward the U1A structure, resulting in highly similar RNA binding conformations for both proteins.", "author": [{"author": "Jampani Nageswara Rao", "affiliation": ["Lehrstuhl Biopolymere and Research Center for Bio-Macromolecules, Universit\u00e4t Bayreuth, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany."], "href": "/?term=Rao+JN&cauthor_id=18303858"}, {"author": "Kristian Schweimer", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Schweimer+K&cauthor_id=18303858"}, {"author": "Sabine Wenzel", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Wenzel+S&cauthor_id=18303858"}, {"author": "Birgitta M W\u00f6hrl", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=W%C3%B6hrl+BM&cauthor_id=18303858"}, {"author": "Paul R\u00f6sch", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=R%C3%B6sch+P&cauthor_id=18303858"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["18303858", "27282391", "26920110", "24453987", "23397568", "21955496", "20926394", "18830703"], "body": ""}
