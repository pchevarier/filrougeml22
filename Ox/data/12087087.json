{"title": "RNA polymerase II transcription complexes may become arrested if the nascent RNA is shortened to less than 50 nucleotides", "pubDate": "2002", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1074/jbc.M201145200", "PMID": "12087087", "abstract": "A significant fraction of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes become arrested when halted within a particular initially transcribed region after the synthesis of 23-32-nucleotide RNAs. If polymerases are halted within the same sequence at a promoter-distal location, they remain elongation-competent. However, when the RNAs within these promoter-distal complexes are truncated to between 21 and 48 nucleotides, many of the polymerases become arrested. The degree of the arrest correlates very well with the length of the RNA in both the promoter-proximal and -distal complexes. This effect is also observed when comparing promoter-proximal and promoter-distal complexes halted over a completely different sequence. The unusual propensity of many promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II complexes to arrest may therefore be recreated in promoter-distal complexes simply by shortening the nascent RNA. Thus, the transition to full elongation competence by RNA polymerase II is dependent on the synthesis of about 50 nt of RNA, and this transition is reversible. We also found that arrest is facilitated in promoter-distal complexes by the hybridization of oligonucleotides to the transcript between 30 and 45 bases upstream of the 3'-end.", "author": [{"author": "Andrea Ujv\u00e1ri", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA."], "href": "/?term=Ujv%C3%A1ri+A&cauthor_id=12087087"}, {"author": "Mahadeb Pal", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Pal+M&cauthor_id=12087087"}, {"author": "Donal S Luse", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Luse+DS&cauthor_id=12087087"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["12087087", "34551438", "33811916", "31628251", "31591205", "30035655", "24606919", "22982364", "22404626", "21354388", "21292158", "21081187", "18832375", "18830703", "18775328", "18538654", "18369138", "18162559", "18086705", "16648491", "16537373", "16214896", "15767671", "15082542", "12719526"], "body": ""}
