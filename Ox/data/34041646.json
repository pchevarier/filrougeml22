{"title": "CircANKRD36 Knockdown Suppressed Cell Viability and Migration of LPS-Stimulated RAW264.7 Cells by Sponging MiR-330", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s10753-021-01480-5", "PMID": "34041646", "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with sepsis. In this study, we attempt to investigate the molecular mechanism of circANKRD36 underlying sepsis-induced ALI/ARDS in vitro. We first detected the altered circRNAs in serums of patients with sepsis-induced ARDS using circRNAs microarray. CircANKRD36 expression in serums and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells was measured using qRT-PCR. CCK-8, cell migration, ELISA, and qRT-PCR were applied to the evaluation of cell biological behavior and inflammation reaction. The results showed that circANKRD36 expression was significantly elevated in serum of patients with sepsis-induced ARDS. Knockdown of circANKRD36 inhibited cell viability and migration and alleviated inflammation of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated (LPS-stimulated) RAW264.7 cells. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that circANKRD36 serves as a sponge for miR-330 and ROCK1 was directly targeted by miR-330. Furthermore, knockdown of circANKRD36 repressed ROCK1 expression by targeting miR-330. In short, circANKRD36 knockdown suppressed cell viability and migration of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in vitro via sponging miR-330, which may provide new ideas for the treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS.", "author": [{"author": "Qiqing Lin", "affiliation": ["Department of Emergency Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, No. 18, Zhongshan Second Road, Yooujiang District, Baise City, 533000, China. linqi_yjmh@163.com."], "href": "/?term=Lin+Q&cauthor_id=34041646"}, {"author": "Qiong Liang", "affiliation": ["Respiratory Department, The Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise City, 533000, China."], "href": "/?term=Liang+Q&cauthor_id=34041646"}, {"author": "Chunyan Qin", "affiliation": ["Respiratory Department, The Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise City, 533000, China."], "href": "/?term=Qin+C&cauthor_id=34041646"}, {"author": "Yueyong Li", "affiliation": ["Department of Interventional Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University for Nationalities, Baise City, 533000, China."], "href": "/?term=Li+Y&cauthor_id=34041646"}], "refPMID": ["17948334", "20934212", "26903337", "25746834", "21440206", "17018693", "30066828", "18276918", "11257452", "27197967", "31793082", "23446346", "30903189", "12673949", "20073554", "17275323", "25404635", "22713281", "11846609", "12904813", "31825519", "31405989", "15516488", "32554046", "22797452", "16236739", "26903338", "27739534", "33205602"], "citedInPMID": ["34041646", "34956235"], "body": ""}
