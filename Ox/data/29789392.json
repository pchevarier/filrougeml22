REV7 acts as an interaction module in several cellular pathways. One of its functions is as a component of DNA polymerase \u03b6, where it serves as bridge between the Pol \u03b6 catalytic subunit REV3L and the REV1 protein. A dimer of REV7 binds to two adjacent sites in REV3L by grasping a peptide of REV3L with a \u201csafety\u2010belt\u201d loop (Hara et\u00a0al, 2010; Tomida et\u00a0al, 2015). REV7 protein is an order of magnitude more abundant than REV3L (Tomida et\u00a0al, 2015) and has additional functions and protein partners including chromatin\u2010associated and post\u2010translational modification proteins (Medendorp et\u00a0al, 2009; Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010; Itoh et\u00a0al, 2011; Listovsky & Sale, 2013; Pirouz et\u00a0al, 2013; Hara et\u00a0al, 2017). Complete ablation of REV7 gives rise to mice with defects in primary germ cells (Pirouz et\u00a0al, 2013; Watanabe et\u00a0al, 2013). Recently, studies uncovered a function of REV7 as a DNA resection inhibitor, limiting genomic repair by an unknown mechanism (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015). Although BRCA1\u2010mutant cells are defective in homologous recombination, these studies found that one mode to partially restore recombination activity is by inactivation of REV7. It was proposed that REV7, together with 53BP1 and RIF1, inhibits 5\u2032 DNA end resection to promote non\u2010homologous end\u2010joining at the expense of homologous recombination.To investigate novel functions and pathways involving REV7, we identified proteins associated with REV7 in\u00a0vivo. We report here an analysis of a previously uncharacterized REV7\u2010interacting protein, FAM35A. We discovered that FAM35A is a novel factor that modulates the DNA damage sensitivity of normal and BRCA1\u2010defective cells. Our analysis reveals that the C\u2010terminal half of FAM35A contains three OB\u2010fold domains similar to those in the single\u2010stranded DNA\u2010binding protein RPA large subunit. FAM35A has a disordered N\u2010terminal portion, containing sites of DNA damage\u2010dependent post\u2010translational modification. Moreover, the FAM35A gene is deleted at an unusually high rate in prostate cancers, and in cells from at least one well\u2010studied BRCA1\u2010defective breast cancer case. FAM35A is more weakly expressed in metastatic prostate cancers, suggesting it as an important marker for outcome and therapeutic decisions. Results and DiscussionFAM35A interacts with REV7, 53BP1, and RIF1 in\u00a0vivo\nTo isolate proteins associated with REV7, we engineered HeLa S3 cells that stably express REV7 with a C\u2010terminal FLAG\u2013HA epitope tag (REV7\u2010FH). REV7\u2010FH was sequentially immunoprecipitated from nuclear extract using FLAG and HA antibody beads (Ikura et\u00a0al, 2007). This purified complex was separated by gradient gel electrophoresis, and associated proteins from gel sections were identified by LC\u2010MS/MS. We confirmed association with previously identified REV7\u2010binding proteins including GLP (Nakatani & Ogryzko, 2003; Pirouz et\u00a0al, 2013), G9A (Pirouz et\u00a0al, 2013), CAMP (Itoh et\u00a0al, 2011), GTF2I (Fattah et\u00a0al, 2014), POGZ (Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010), and HP1\u03b1 (Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2010) (Fig\u00a01A and Table\u00a01). The highest\u2010ranking previously unstudied association was with the uncharacterized FAM35A protein (Fig\u00a01A).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Identification of REV7\u2010 or FAM35A\u2010associated proteinsProtein complexes were sequentially immunoprecipitated (using FLAG and HA antibody beads) from nuclear extracts of HeLa S3 cell lines stably expressing C\u2010terminally FLAG\u2013HA\u2010tagged REV7 (REV7\u2010FH) or (N\u2010terminally FLAG\u2013HA\u2010tagged\u2010FAM35A (FH\u2010FAM35A). \nA, BREV7 complex (A) and FAM35A complex (B); associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The FH\u2010FAM35A complex was purified from HeLa S3 nuclear extracts after 18\u00a0h exposure to MMC (100\u00a0ng/ml). Proteins labeled in blue are previously published REV7\u2010binding partners. Proteins labeled in red are involved in end\u2010joining pathways of DSB repair. 4\u201320% gradient gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby.CFH\u2010FAM35A was co\u2010transfected into human 293T cells with GFP empty vector (control), GFP\u201053BP1 or GFP\u2010RIF1. Forty\u2010eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were made and used for immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody beads. After electrophoretic transfer of proteins, the membrane was cut into three sections to separate proteins >\u00a0250\u00a0kDa (GFP as GFP\u201053BP1 and GFP\u2010RIF1), 37\u2013250\u00a0kDa (\u03b1\u2010tubulin), and <\u00a037\u00a0kDa (GFP as control) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Results for the input and immunoprecipitation (IP) product after gel electrophoresis are shown. The asterisk (*) in the IP lane marks degraded or truncated forms of 53BP1 and RIF1.\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nTable 1Identification of FAM35A with previously reported proteins in a REV7\u2010associated complexProteinAccession number (UniProtKB)Molecular weightSpectral countsUnique peptidesREV7{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q9UI95\",\"term_id\":\"12643889\"}}Q9UI95|MD2L2_HUMAN24\u00a0kDa45315FAM35A{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q86V20\",\"term_id\":\"74750445\"}}Q86V20\u20102|FA35A_HUMAN92\u00a0kDa7423GLP{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q9H9B1\",\"term_id\":\"325511404\"}}Q9H9B1|EHMT1_HUMAN141\u00a0kDa96G9A{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q96KQ7\",\"term_id\":\"116241348\"}}Q96KQ7|EHMT2_HUMAN135\u00a0kDa75CAMP{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q96JM3\",\"term_id\":\"114149935\"}}Q96JM3|ZN828_HUMAN89\u00a0kDa12729GTF2IB4DH52|B4DH52_HUMAN112\u00a0kDa178088POGZ{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q7Z3K3\",\"term_id\":\"143811442\"}}Q7Z3K3| POGZ_HUMAN154\u00a0kDa14731HP1\u03b1{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"P45973\",\"term_id\":\"1170338\"}}P45973|CBX5_HUMAN22\u00a0kDa83Open in a separate windowThe immunoprecipitated sample was separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and proteins from gel sections of approximately equal size were identified by LC\u2010MS/MS. FAM35A was a top specific hit, together with previously identified REV7\u2010associated proteins. GTF2I (TFII\u2010I) is likely a non\u2010significant association as it is an abundant protein frequently found in control experiments with agarose supports and Flag\u2010His tags (http://www.crapome.org), but it is included here for reference, as it was previously reported to interact with REV7 (Fattah et\u00a0al, 2014).To validate the association, a reciprocal experiment was performed by constructing a HeLa S3 cell line stably expressing FAM35A with an N\u2010terminal FLAG\u2013HA tag (FH\u2010FAM35A). Cells were exposed to mitomycin C (MMC, 100\u00a0ng/ml) for 18\u00a0h or mock\u2010exposed. Following sequential immunoprecipitation with FLAG and HA antibody beads, proteins were separated and identified by mass spectrometry (Fig\u00a01B). DNA repair proteins associating with FAM35A included REV7, RIF1, BLM, and TOP3A (Table\u00a02), with relatively more RIF1 peptides and 53BP1 identified following MMC exposure (Table\u00a03).Table 2DNA repair proteins identified in the FAM35A complexProteinAccession number (UniProtKB)Molecular weightSpectral countsUnique peptidesFAM35A{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q86V20\",\"term_id\":\"74750445\"}}Q86V20\u20102|FA35A_HUMAN92\u00a0kDa17037REV7{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q9UI95\",\"term_id\":\"12643889\"}}Q9UI95|MD2L2_HUMAN24\u00a0kDa52RIF1{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q5UIP0\",\"term_id\":\"68565701\"}}Q5UIP0\u20102|RIF1_HUMAN272\u00a0kDa64BLMH0YNU5|H0YNU5_HUMAN144\u00a0kDa64TOP3A{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q13472\",\"term_id\":\"2501242\"}}Q13472|TOP3A_HUMAN112\u00a0kDa53Open in a separate windowProteins immunoprecipitating with exogenously expressed FAM35A were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and proteins from gel sections of approximately equal size were identified by LC\u2010MS/MS.

The gel sections were approximately equal size with the exception of a wider segment for the FAM35A bait. The top associated hits were RIF1 and REV7. All other known DNA repair\u2010related proteins that were detected are shown. Ku70 and Ku80 may be non\u2010significant associations as they are found frequently in control experiments with agarose supports and Flag\u2010His tags (http://www.crapome.org), but they are included here as they were not detected with significance in the complex from non\u2010damaged cells (Table\u00a02).Although REV7 is known to cooperate functionally with 53BP1 to limit resection at DNA breaks, REV7 was not detected in 53BP1 immunocomplexes, and it is unknown how REV7 connects with 53BP1 in\u00a0vivo (Xu et\u00a0al, 2015). To verify an association of FAM35A with 53BP1 and the additional DNA end resection control factor RIF1, FH\u2010FAM35A was co\u2010transfected with GFP\u2010RIF1 or GFP\u201053BP1 and expressed in 293T cells. All proteins were expressed at the predicted molecular weights (Fig\u00a01C, \u201cinput\u201d lanes). Following immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody beads, FAM35A co\u2010immunoprecipitated with recombinant RIF1 or 53BP1 (but not with the control vector, Fig\u00a01C). These interactions suggest that FAM35A may functionally bridge 53BP1 and REV7 in human cells, directly or via interactions with other proteins.FAM35A is an OB\u2010fold protein that changes localization following DNA damageWe found FAM35A orthologs are present in vertebrate genomes, but not in invertebrates or plants. Multiple protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing are annotated in genomics databases for human (UniProt accession number {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"Q86V20\",\"term_id\":\"74750445\"}}Q86V20) and mouse FAM35A. Isoforms 1 and 2 are the most common, encoding 904 and 835 amino acid proteins, respectively. They arise by differential splicing of one in\u2010frame exon (Fig\u00a02A). Both mRNA isoforms of FAM35A are ubiquitously expressed in different cell and tissue types (http://www.gtexportal.org).Open in a separate windowFigure 2\nFAM35A is an OB\u2010fold protein with an N\u2010terminal disordered region\nDomain schematic of human FAM35A derived from sequence prediction modeling. An N\u2010terminal disordered region includes post\u2010translational modification sites. Locations of the three OB\u2010fold domains A, B, and C are shown, with a Zn\u2010ribbon containing conserved Cys residues. One exon is absent in isoform 2 compared to isoform 1, deleting 69 aa from OB domain B.Multi\u2010species alignment of a segment of FAM35A protein in the predicted Zn\u2010ribbon. The four Zn\u2010coordinating Cys residues (CxxC, CxxC), homologous to those in human RPA1, are evolutionarily conserved.\nBLAST searches for sequence homologs did not reveal significant primary sequence similarity to gene products other than FAM35A. We therefore analyzed the FAM35A protein sequence using structure prediction servers based on PSI\u2010BLAST. The N\u2010terminal half of the protein is predicted to be disordered up until about residue 420 (Fig\u00a02A), and this region is likely to interact with other proteins, as found commonly for disordered regions of polypeptides (Receveur\u2010Brechot et\u00a0al, 2006). The N\u2010terminal region contains previously identified post\u2010translational modification sites, including a conserved ubiquitin modification (Kim et\u00a0al, 2011) and a conserved SQ site (Matsuoka et\u00a0al, 2007) in which residue S339 is phosphorylated after exposure to ionizing radiation or UV radiation (Matsuoka et\u00a0al, 2007). With high significance, the C\u2010terminal portion of FAM35A is predicted to contain three OB\u2010fold domains structurally homologous to those in the 70\u00a0kDa subunit (RPA1) of the single\u2010stranded DNA\u2010binding protein RPA (Figs\u00a02A and EV1). The three OB folds are similar to DNA\u2010binding domain folds A, B, and C of RPA (Bochkareva et\u00a0al, 2002; Fan & Pavletich, 2012). OB\u2010fold domain C is predicted to include four conserved cysteine residues (Fig\u00a02B) at the core of a zinc\u2010binding ribbon, homologous to a loop in the same position in RPA (Fig\u00a0EV2). Together, the OB folds and Zn\u2010ribbon form the elements of DNA\u2010binding and orientation\u2010enabling RPA1 to simultaneously bind to protein partners and to single\u2010stranded DNA in an 8\u201310\u00a0nt binding mode (Lin et\u00a0al, 1998; Bochkareva et\u00a0al, 2002; Arunkumar et\u00a0al, 2003). The region including the 4\u2010Cys Zn\u2010ribbon identifies the domain of unknown function (PF15793) that is conserved in FAM35A homologs as annotated by the Pfam database. C\u2010terminal helices are predicted present following OB domains A and B, in positions corresponding to helices involved in multimerization of the OB folds in RPA subunits (Bochkareva et\u00a0al, 2002; Fan & Pavletich, 2012; Fig\u00a0EV2).Open in a separate windowFigure EV1Partial model of the OB\u2010fold domains of FAM35AA view of a model generated by Phyre2 is shown for FAM35A isoform 1 residues 402\u2013904, using template 4GOP (chain C, the RPA 70\u00a0kDa subunit from Ustilago maydis). The\u00a0model includes OB folds with five\u2010stranded beta barrels for OB domain A and OB domain B. The first three beta strands of OB domain C are modeled, with the Zn\u2010ribbon that occurs in a loop between OB fold C beta strands 1 and 2 (Fig\u00a0EV2). The Phyre2 coordinates were rendered in PyMOL using spectrum coloring.Open in a separate windowFigure EV2Secondary structure element assignment for the ordered region of human FAM35AThe secondary structure assignment is derived from the Phyre2 model of human FAM35A isoform 1 (Fig\u00a0EV1) and largely coincides with features in the three functional DNA\u2010binding domains (dbdA, B, and C) of RPA1 (PDB: 4GOP, 1FGU), with a few differences. In FAM35A, a C\u2010terminal helix is predicted to be present at the end of both OB\u00a0folds\u00a0A and B, unlike in RPA1 where this helix only follows OB domain B. Beta strands 4 and 5 of OB domain C were not modeled by Phyre2 but candidate beta strands\u00a0are\u00a0present in appropriate positions, as noted. The exon that is absent in FAM35A isoform 2 results in 69 fewer residues (red box), deleting structural elements of OB domain B.We constructed a human U2OS cell line stably expressing GFP\u2010FAM35A. Cells were exposed to MMC (100\u00a0ng/ml, 24\u00a0h) or mock\u2010exposed and then fixed and stained with DAPI and anti\u2010GFP. In cells exposed to DNA\u2010damaging agent, GFP\u2010FAM35A was concentrated into foci in the nucleus (Fig\u00a03A), suggesting a direct involvement in DNA repair.Open in a separate windowFigure 3\nFAM35A is a DNA damage response gene\nA GFP\u2010FAM35A forms nuclear foci upon DNA damage. A U2OS cell line stably expressing GFP\u2010FAM35A was exposed to MMC (100\u00a0ng/ml, 24\u00a0h) (right) or to mock treatment (left). The following day, cells were fixed and stained for DAPI and anti\u2010GFP. Scale bars: 6\u00a0\u03bcm.B Two pseudogenes (FAM35DP and FAM35BP) with >\u00a098% identity to FAM35A are located on chromosome 10q22. Both FAM35DP and FAM35BP are present in genomes of apes and old\u2010world monkeys, but not in other mammalian genomes. By inference, these pseudogenes arose by whole gene duplication in the common ancestor of the catarrhines about 25\u201330 million years ago. A third pseudogene (not shown) is FAM35CP, an inactive spliced product of reverse transcription (>\u00a095% identity) that was integrated into an intron of the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene on chromosome 14q31.3. FAM35CP is present in apes but not old\u2010world monkeys, indicating a more recent evolutionary origin.C Acute depletion of FAM35A causes hypersensitivity to several DNA\u2010damaging agents but not to olaparib.

Three pseudogenes are also present in the human genome, two of them on 10q22 (Fig\u00a03B) with high (>\u00a098%) sequence identity to FAM35A. Precise nuclease\u2010mediated knockout of human FAM35A is therefore challenging, as simultaneous targeting of pseudogenes would likely cause chromosome rearrangements and deletion. siRNA was used to acutely deplete FAM35A from human HEK293 cells and investigate its role in DNA repair. FAM35A\u2010depleted HEK293 cultures were hypersensitive to MMC and etoposide, with sensitivity comparable to that conferred by depletion of Fanconi anemia FANCA and FANCD2 gene expression (Fig\u00a03C). In HEK293 cells, FAM35A\u2010siRNA did not sensitize to the PARP inhibitor olaparib (Fig\u00a03C), suggesting that homologous recombination repair is still active in the absence of FAM35A, as it is in cells with suppressed REV7 activity (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015).We investigated the impact of acute depletion of FAM35A on other markers of DNA damage responses in HEK293 cells. Cells with >\u00a05 \u03b3H2AX foci, >\u00a05 FANCD2 foci, or >\u00a05 RAD51 foci were quantified after MMC exposure (100\u00a0ng/ml, 24\u00a0h) and in control cells. MMC exposure induced cellular \u03b3H2AX foci as expected; there was no significant change in this pattern in cells depleted for FAM35A, indicating intact signaling leading to \u03b3H2AX formation (Fig\u00a03D). The Fanconi anemia signaling pathway (FANCD2 foci) was also functional in FAM35A\u2010depleted cells, showing about 1.5\u2010fold more foci after MMC exposure (Fig\u00a03E). RAD51 foci, a readout of homologous recombination pairing, were formed in FAM35A\u2010defective cells, with a twofold elevated frequency in non\u2010damaged cells (Fig\u00a03F).Depletion of REV7 reduces the efficiency of non\u2010homologous end\u2010joining (NHEJ; Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015) by promoting resection that channels repair of DNA double\u2010strand breaks into homologous recombination and other pathways. Because of the association between FAM35A and the resection control factors REV7, RIF1, and 53BP1 (Fig\u00a01A\u2013C), we investigated whether FAM35A depletion affects end joining, using a plasmid integration assay (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015). REV7, 53BP1, and RIF1 depletion decreased integration ratio in this assay. We confirmed efficient knockdown of FAM35A mRNA and protein in 293T cells using qPCR (Fig\u00a04A) and immunoblot analysis (Fig\u00a04B). The plasmid integration ratio decreased significantly after FAM35A depletion (Fig\u00a04C), suggesting that FAM35A is involved in modulating double\u2010strand break repair pathway choice. Expression of FAM35A isoform 1 in 293T cells (Fig\u00a04D) restored NHEJ to normal levels (Fig\u00a04E). This is consistent with increased resection in the absence of FAM35A, causing NHEJ to be less effective, which may account for the increased sensitivity of FAM35A\u2010depleted cells to MMC and etoposide.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Suppression of FAM35A reduces random DNA integration by non\u2010homologous end\u2010joining\nA, BDepletion of endogenous FAM35A mRNA (A) and protein (B) from 293T cell lines carrying shRNA to FAM35A.

We therefore hypothesized that FAM35A depletion from BRCA1\u2010mutant cells would increase resistance to a DNA strand\u2010breaking agent. We engineered a BRCA1\u2010mutant cell line (MDA\u2010MB\u2010436) expressing FAM35A shRNA. Efficient knockdown was verified by qPCR (Fig\u00a05A). The FAM35A\u2010depleted BRCA1\u2010mutant cells and controls were assayed for sensitivity to camptothecin using a colony\u2010forming assay. FAM35A depletion from the BRCA1\u2010mutant cell line significantly alleviated the sensitivity to camptothecin (Fig\u00a05A). Following exposure to ionizing radiation, a BRCA1\u2010mutant cell line transfected with control siRNA did not form RAD51 foci, as expected (Johnson et\u00a0al, 2013). However, the BRCA1\u2010mutant cells formed damage\u2010dependent nuclear RAD51 foci following FAM35A depletion, suggesting that 5\u2032 end resection was more active in the absence of FAM35A (Fig\u00a05B).Open in a separate windowFigure 5\nFAM35A depletion/KO in BRCA1\u2010deficient cells enhances markers of homologous recombination\nQuantification of depletion of endogenous FAM35A mRNA and protein from 293T cell lines carrying shRNA to FAM35A.

In HCC1937 BL, endogenous FAM35A mRNA expression level was detectable. PCR primers for amplification of genomic DNA were designed in exon 1 (forward; primer 1) and exon 2 (reverse; primer 2). The predicted PCR product size is 1,794\u00a0bp.\n\nSource data are available online for this figure.\nWe investigated a further widely used cell line, HCC1937, which has a known inactivating mutation in BRCA1 (Fig\u00a05C). Multiple studies have noted that HCC1937 is anomalously resistant to PARP inhibitors in comparison with other BRCA1\u2010mutant cell lines, for unknown reasons (Drew et\u00a0al, 2011; Lehmann et\u00a0al, 2011; Pierce et\u00a0al, 2013). In HCC1937, RAD51 foci (a marker of DNA end resection) are generated after DNA damage exposure (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2004; Hill et\u00a0al, 2014), and homologous recombination is partially active despite BRCA1 mutation (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2004). We found that FAM35A mRNA expression is absent in HCC1937 cells (Fig\u00a05D). FAM35A expression was present in HCC1937BL, an EBV\u2010immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line from the same patient (Fig\u00a05D). HCC1937BL is heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutation, indicating loss of heterozygosity for both FAM35A and BRCA1 in the HCC1937 mammary cancer patient.Genomic analysis of DNA from HCC1937 and MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 cells showed that FAM35A DNA flanking exons 1 and 2 were not present in HCC1937 cells (Fig\u00a05E). This is consistent with a deep deletion at the FAM35A locus, notated by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE, Broad Institute) in HCC1937 cells (Fig\u00a0EV3A). Reported genes related to PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1\u2010mutant cells\u00a0include 53BP1, MAD2L2/REV7, RIF1, BLM, CHD4, and PTIP (Bunting et\u00a0al, 2010; Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015; Patel et\u00a0al, 2017). None are deleted in HCC1937 (Fig\u00a05C). DNA double\u2010strand break repair factors ATM (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015), NBS1 (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015), and RNF8 (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015) are also preserved in HCC1937 according to the CCLE.Open in a separate windowFigure EV3Potential FAM35A alterations in human cancer cell lines\nCell lines annotated in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia with deep deletion of FAM35A.

A region of chromosome 10q (red box) is expanded below to show calls for deep deletion (dark blue), shallow deletion (light blue), or amplification (red).Quantification of endogenous FAM35A mRNA expression. Endogenous FAM35A mRNA from HCC1937 (BRCA1 mutant), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (BRCA1 mutant), and LNCaP clone FGC cell lines was quantified using qPCR. Data represent mean \u00b1 SEM. n\u00a0=\u00a03.\nThese data suggest an involvement of FAM35A in resection inhibition in parallel with REV7, 53BP1, and RIF1 (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015). Like 53BP1\u2010depleted BRCA1 mutants (Bunting et\u00a0al, 2010; Densham et\u00a0al, 2016), FAM35A\u2010depleted BRCA1\u2010mutant cells acquire camptothecin resistance. As HCC1937 cells can form 53BP1 foci and Mre11 foci (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2004) following DNA damage (Hill et\u00a0al, 2014), FAM35A appears to operate downstream of these factors and may serve as a link between 53BP1 and REV7. It is notable that the HCC1937 cell line relies on Pol \u03b8\u2010dependent alternative end\u2010joining for survival, perhaps unusually so for a BRCA1\u2010defective cell line (Mateos\u2010Gomez et\u00a0al, 2015). A likely explanation is that the excessive DNA end resection activity arising from the FAM35A defect channels a substantial fraction of breaks into repair by DNA polymerase \u03b8\u2010mediated alternative end\u2010joining (Wyatt et\u00a0al, 2016).FAM35A alterations and implications for cancersCurrently, there are two major models to account for PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1\u2010mutant cells: (i) 5\u2032 resection through dysfunction of 53BP1, RIF1, or REV7 (Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015; Xu et\u00a0al, 2015) and (ii) deletion of recruiters (PTIP, CHD4, and PARP1) of enzymes that degrade newly synthesized DNA (Chaudhuri et\u00a0al, 2016). Our discovery of FAM35A deletion in HCC1937 alongside reported evidence suggests a plausible mechanism of FAM35A\u2010associated PARP inhibitor resistance in line with the first model, via 5\u2032 resection.We investigated the incidence of FAM35A alterations in cancer using cancer genomics databases. Mutations and copy number changes are found in FAM35A at a relatively low level (<\u00a05% of cases) in most cancer types. Strikingly, however, prostate cancer (PCa) data show deletion of FAM35A in a high fraction (6\u201313%) of cases (Fig\u00a06A). Prostate cancers are the only cancer type with this level of FAM35A deletion (for cancers with at least 40 cases per dataset). The PTEN gene, frequently deleted in PCa, is located on 10q23.2 about 0.5\u00a0Mb distal of FAM35A (Fig\u00a03B). Some cases of FAM35A deletion are independent of PTEN deletion (Fig\u00a06B). A meta\u2010analysis of six datasets containing FAM35A mRNA expression data was performed to compare metastatic and primary tumors in prostate cancer. FAM35A mRNA expression is significantly reduced in metastatic prostate cancer (Fig\u00a06C). In prostate cancers, deletion of FAM35A is essentially exclusive from mutation or deletion of BRCA1. From the data presented here, tumors with FAM35A deletion might be predicted to be susceptible to treatment with DNA cross\u2010linking or double\u2010strand break inducing agents, but not to olaparib. Finally, we note that some other commonly used cancer cell lines harbor genetic deletion for FAM35A as annotated in the CCLE, although each must be confirmed experimentally. We found that prostate cancer cell line LNCaP clone FGC still expresses FAM35A mRNA (Fig\u00a0EV3B).Open in a separate windowFigure 6\nFAM35A is a candidate tumor/metastasis suppressor gene in prostate cancer\nPrevalence of FAM35A deletion in prostate cancer (PCa) genomes analyzed via the cBioPortal.

The P\u2010value for a gene is its P\u2010value for the median\u2010ranked analysis. The enumerated studies are Chandran Prostate (Chandran et\u00a0al, 2007), Grasso Prostate (Grasso et\u00a0al, 2012), Lapointe Prostate (Lapointe et\u00a0al, 2004), Taylor Prostate (Taylor et\u00a0al, 2010), Vanaja Prostate (Vanaja et\u00a0al, 2003), and Varambally Prostate (Varambally et\u00a0al, 2005).\nThe data presented here strongly implicate FAM35A in inhibition of DNA end resection following strand breakage (Fig\u00a07). In BRCA1\u2010mutant cells, knockout of FAM35A allows recombination and/or alternative end\u2010joining repair pathways to be utilized more efficiently and helps explain the relative resistance to PARP inhibitors. Recently, a comprehensive survey of proteins associated with 53BP1 (Gupta et\u00a0al, 2018) uncovered REV7\u2010binding proteins including FAM35A (designated RINN2). siRNA\u2010mediated suppression of BRCA1 in human U2OS cells increased their sensitivity to olaparib. When FAM35A/RINN2 was suppressed in these BRCA1\u2010defective cells, olaparib sensitivity was alleviated. This result is consistent with our interpretation outlined here, from analysis of FAM35A suppression in human cells and absence of expression in PARP inhibitor\u2010resistant HCC1937 tumor cells. Based on the\u00a0protein interactions uncovered here and our prediction of single\u2010stranded DNA\u2010binding activity, a mechanism of action of FAM35A can be proposed whereby the protein interacts directly with single\u2010stranded DNA via its OB\u2010fold domains. In this way, FAM35A may directly block activity of resection enzymes (BLM\u2010DNA2, BLM\u2010EXO1, and MRE11) or associate with BLM to prevent the interaction of BLM with DNA2 or EXO1.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Influence of FAM35A on end resectionDuring DNA replication, exposure to camptothecin or PARP inhibitors can block replication forks, sometimes producing a one\u2010ended DSB. FAM35A, in concert with REV7, RIF1,\u00a053BP1, and other proteins, is proposed to be involved in suppressing the resection at a DSB that produces 3\u2032 single\u2010stranded DNA. Cells lacking BRCA1 are unable to counter the inhibition mediated by this protein complex. In FAM35A\u2010defective cells, 5\u2032 end resection can occur even in BRCA1 mutants, activating homologous recombination. This may be one mechanism of acquiring resistance to PARP inhibitor in BRCA1\u2010mutant cells. However, excessive end resection can block the action of NHEJ.\u00a0As an OB\u2010fold protein, FAM35A may interact with single\u2010stranded DNA and then block nucleases or interactions with other proteins.

Human HeLa S3 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. All cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert detection kit (Lonza). Cell lines were validated by STR DNA fingerprinting by the Cell Line Identification Core of the MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Forty\u2010eight hours after transfection (for FH\u2010FAM35A and GFP, GFP\u201053BP1, or GFP\u2010RIF1) in 293T cells, the cells were harvested. Each cell pellet was suspended with 300\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.5B (500\u00a0mM KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM PMSF, 0.1% Tween\u201020, 10\u00a0mM 2\u2010mercaptoethanol), frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice, and sonicated. After centrifugation, 900\u00a0\u03bcl of 2B (40\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 20% glycerol, 0.4\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.2% Tween\u201020) was added to the supernatant and incubated with 10\u00a0\u03bcl of GFP agarose (MBL) for 4\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. The bound proteins were washed with 700\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1B (100\u00a0mM KCl, 20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1\u00a0mM PMSF, 0.1% Tween\u201020, 10\u00a0mM 2\u2010mercaptoethanol), three times and eluted with 30\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00d7 SDS loading buffer (100\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 4% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, 200\u00a0mM DTT). These samples were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and detected with the indicated antibodies and ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Protein identification was performed by LC\u2010MS/MS mass spectrometry of gel slices as described previously (Takata et\u00a0al, 2013). Protein identifications were checked for agreement with the molecular mass predicted from the relevant gel slice. Protein identification established >\u00a099.9% protein probability assigned by the Protein Prophet\u00a0algorithm, with a minimum of two peptides at 95% peptide probability. Abundant proteins found commonly in immunoprecipitation experiments with these epitope tags and agarose were eliminated from consideration (Takata et\u00a0al, 2013). These included lamins, importins, chaperones, and ribosomal proteins.Random plasmid integration assayThe plasmid integration assay was performed as described (Lou et\u00a0al, 2004; Galanty et\u00a0al, 2012; Boersma et\u00a0al, 2015). Plasmid transfections were performed with Polyethylenimine 25kD linear from Polysciences (cat# 23966\u20102) as described (Lee et\u00a0al, 2014). Briefly, 24\u00a0h after transfection (with linearized pDsRed\u2010Monomer\u2010Hyg\u2010C1 (Clontech; #632495) with SmaI or XhoI) in FAM35A\u2010depleted 293T cell lines and control cells, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells were plated into replicate 10\u2010cm dishes for Hygromycin B treatment and 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0102 cells were plated into replicate 10\u2010cm dishes for plating efficiencies. The next day, Hygromycin B 300\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was added to the dish, and the cells were incubated until the appearance of colonies (10\u201314\u00a0days). Cells were then fixed, stained, and counted.

From Cell Signaling Technology, monoclonal anti\u2010HA (C29F4) was used at 1:1,000.DNA constructsHuman FAM35A cDNA (Clone ID: 6146593) was obtained from Thermo Scientific. Isoform 2 cDNA was PCR amplified from FAM35A cDNA as a XhoI\u2010NotI fragment with 5\u2032FAM35A (XhoI) primer (5\u2032\u2010 CCGCTCGAGATGAGTGGAGGATCTCAAGTCCAC) and 3\u2032FAM35A (NotI) primer (5\u2032\u2010TAAAAGCGGCCGCTCAGAGACGGGCATTGGCTCCATGC) to clone into pETDuet\u20101 and pRSFDuet\u20101 (Novagen). Full\u2010length REV7 cDNA was cloned into pETDuet\u20101 (Tomida et\u00a0al, 2015). The XhoI\u2010NotI fragments from FAM35A and REV7 were inserted into pOZN and pOZC (Nakatani & Ogryzko, 2003; kindly provided by Hank Heng Qi, Children's Hospital, Boston) and pCDH\u2010FH (Tomida et\u00a0al, 2015). Flag\u2010HA\u2010mouse FAM35A isoform 1 expression vector was PCR amplified from FAM35A cDNA as a XhoI\u2010NotI fragment with 5\u2032mFAM35A (XhoI) primer (5\u2032\u2010CCGCTCGAGATGAGTCAAGGATCACAAGTTCAC) and 3\u2032mFAM35A (NotI) primer (5\u2032\u2010TAAAAGCGGCCGCTCACTCCTTCCCAGGAATGCCTCC) to clone into pCDH\u2010FH. After construction, expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pDESTpcDNA5\u2010FRT/TO\u2010eGFP\u2010Rif1 and pcDNA5\u2010FRT/TO\u2010eGFP\u201053BP1 were gifts from Daniel Durocher (Addgene plasmid # 52506 and # 60813, respectively; Escribano\u2010Diaz et\u00a0al, 2013; Fradet\u2010Turcotte et\u00a0al, 2013).DNA damage sensitivity in FAM35A\u2010depleted cell linesTo analyze sensitivity to chemical DNA\u2010damaging agents, HEK293 were plated into white 96\u2010well plates (1,250\u00a0cells/well). The next day, various concentrations of MMC, etoposide, and olaparib were added to the wells, and the cells were incubated for 48\u00a0h. The cells were lysed and a reagent that luminesces in the presence of ATP was added (ATPLite One Step, Perkin Elmer). Luminescence was measured using a plate reader (Biotek Synergy II) and normalized to undamaged control. For the clonogenic assay, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 cells were plated in 10\u2010mm culture plates and incubated for 24\u00a0h prior to DNA damage induction. Groups of plates were exposed to camptothecin (20\u00a0nM). After 24\u00a0h, medium was changed, and cells were incubated until the appearance of colonies (14\u201321\u00a0days). Cells were then fixed, stained, and counted. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t\u2010test (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Foci analysis by microscopyImmunofluorescence photography used a Leica DMI6000B microscope as described previously (Takata et\u00a0al, 2013). U2OS cells stably expressing GFP\u2010FAM35A were plated into an 8\u2010well chamber slide. Cells were exposed to MMC (100\u00a0ng/ml, 24\u00a0h) and were fixed the following day with paraformaldehyde and stained for DAPI and GFP (Tomida et\u00a0al, 2013). To measure the formation of DNA double\u2010strand breaks and downstream signaling, FAM35A acutely depleted and control HEK293 cells were plated in 8\u2010well chamber slides, treated with MMC (100\u00a0ng/ml 24\u00a0h), fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained for DAPI and \u03b3H2AX or FANCD2 (Song et\u00a0al, 2010). \u03b3H2AX or FANCD2 foci numbers were counted and plotted. FAM35A\u2010depleted BRCA1\u2010mutant cells were plated in 4\u2010well chamber slides and exposed to X\u2010rays the following day (10\u00a0Gy, 2\u00a0Gy/min, 160\u00a0kV peak energy with a Rad Source 2000 irradiator, Suwanee, GA). Six hours later, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained for DAPI and RAD51 (Song et\u00a0al, 2010; Johnson et\u00a0al, 2013).Genomic PCRTotal DNA was isolated from HCC1937 and MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 cells using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total DNA (400\u00a0ng) was used as a template for genomic DNA amplification of FAM35A exons 1 and 2 by PCR with primer 1 (5\u2032\u2010ACGGGCGGCCGGATTTGCCCGGAGG) and primer 2 (5\u2032\u2010CTTAATCTTTTGACCATCAAGG). Control primers were REV3L\u2010F (5\u2032\u2010ACAGCTTCAGAGGAAAGCCA) and REV3L\u2010R (5\u2032\u2010GTTACCGATCGTGTCCGTTT).Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assayTotal RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol including on\u2010column DNase treatment. Total RNA (1\u00a0\u03bcg) was used as a template to synthesize cDNA with the High\u2010Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). qPCR was then performed on the ABI 7900HT Fast Real\u2010Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan primers and the probe sets for hFAM35A were purchased from Thermo Fisher (assay ID Hs04189036_m1). The absolute quantity (AQ) of transcripts for hFAM35A was determined using the generated standard curves. Standard curves for each gene were determined using the plasmid pRSFDuet\u20101 carrying one of hFAM35A. Each reaction was performed in triplicate.BioinformaticsAnalysis of predicted protein disorder used the DisEMBL (http://dis.embl.de), Pondr (http://pondr.com), and Phyre2 web\u2010based servers (Kelley et\u00a0al, 2015). Protein structure prediction was cross\u2010checked using multiple tools. Several structure prediction servers identified models corresponding to OB domain A. ModWeb (https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu) predicts high confidence similarity (sequence identify 18%) of FAM35A residues corresponding to OB fold A with PDB code 2K50 (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum RPA protein OB fold) and other with other RPA models. SwissModel (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) identified homology of FAM35A 904 aa isoform residues 583\u2010735 (OB fold B) with human RPA1 OB\u2010fold PDB code 1FGU. When the C\u2010terminal 480 amino acids of FAM35A were submitted to Phyre2 for structure prediction, the highest scoring template was PDB code 4GOP (71% coverage, 99.4% confidence). OB folds A, B, and the first part of OB folds C were modeled from 4GOP. The OB fold C model and is consistent with a partial OB fold predicted for FAM35A residues 736\u2010836, PDB code 3U50.Cancer genome data and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data were accessed from the cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org) for Cancer Genomics (Gao et\u00a0al, 2013). Oncomine (Rhodes et\u00a0al, 2007) (http://www.oncomine.com) was used for meta\u2010analysis of six datasets containing FAM35A mRNA expression data (all six datasets are microarrays) with comparisons between metastatic and primary tumor in prostate cancer. Total patient numbers and detailed information regarding published datasets and associated publications are indicated in Fig\u00a04B.
