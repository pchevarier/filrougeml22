{"title": "Epithelial NELF guards intestinal barrier function to ameliorate colitis by maintaining junctional integrity", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41385-021-00465-9", "PMID": "34697434", "abstract": "Well-orchestrated transcriptional programs in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are essential for maintenance of optimal mucosal barrier functions, whereas the contribution of elongation-related mechanisms to barrier function remains unknown. Here, a combination of genetic and genomic approaches defined a critical role of IEC-intrinsic negative elongation factor (NELF) complex in maintenance of epithelial homeostasis. By direct occupancy at endogenous gene loci, NELF sustained expression of a subset of genes related to junctional integrity. As a result, epithelial NELF deficiency results in subdued levels of these junction-related genes and excessive IEC necroptosis in vivo secondary to commensal microbial invasion. In a colitis model, NELF-deficient mice exhibited severely impaired barrier integrity characterized by increased intestinal permeability and significantly exacerbated intestinal inflammation with lethal consequences. Our findings reveal the protective function of the NELF complex against intestinal damage and inflammation and suggest that elongation represents a biologically important step in defining IEC transcriptome.", "author": [{"author": "Jiayao Ou", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.", "Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China.", "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Ou+J&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Xiaoxing Guan", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China.", "Department of Pathology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, 100045, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Guan+X&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Jiali Wang", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.", "Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Wang+J&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Tianjiao Wang", "affiliation": ["School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Wang+T&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Bin Zhang", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.", "Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China.", "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Zhang+B&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Rong Li", "affiliation": ["Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Medicine School of Medicine & Health Sciences, The George Washington University, 2300 I Street NW, Washington, DC, USA."], "href": "/?term=Li+R&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Huji Xu", "affiliation": ["Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.", "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China."], "href": "/?term=Xu+H&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Xiaoyu Hu", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. xiaoyuhu@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China. xiaoyuhu@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China. xiaoyuhu@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. xiaoyuhu@tsinghua.edu.cn."], "href": "/?term=Hu+X&cauthor_id=34697434"}, {"author": "Xue-Kun Guo", "affiliation": ["Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. guoxk@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China. guoxk@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "Beijing Key Laboratory for Immunological Research on Chronic Diseases, Beijing, China. guoxk@tsinghua.edu.cn.", "School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. guoxk@tsinghua.edu.cn."], "href": "/?term=Guo+XK&cauthor_id=34697434"}], "refPMID": ["24566914", "25727289", "29904082", "19855405", "32005980", "27353478", "23445808", "22782113", "27049583", "33195251", "18039951", "32103191", "17545772", "25693130", "24050178", "22986266", "29740129", "10199401", "33548202", "32385332", "18628398", "23062713", "17473169", "17994019", "23706736", "25773599", "19820169", "19596240", "27322654", "24766888", "23950223", "32958874", "17910036", "32651553", "17353361", "21921917", "21804564", "20805871", "26627550", "8099141", "6407889", "28067908", "25186904", "23498934", "19340312", "33013873", "31053533", "29297498", "19329995", "3322381", "25751142", "18798982", "25765347", "27079975"], "citedInPMID": ["34697434", "34773107"], "body": ""}
