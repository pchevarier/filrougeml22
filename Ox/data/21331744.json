{"title": "In vitro antitumor mechanism of a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKI-83", "pubDate": "2012", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1007/s10637-011-9641-5", "PMID": "21331744", "abstract": "Cancer is regarded as a proliferative disorder. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are the key regulators of the cell-cycle and RNA transcription, represents an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we report the cellular mechanistic investigation of CDKI-83, a K (i)-nanomolar CDK9 inhibitor. The compound shows effective anti-proliferative activity in human tumour cell lines with GI(50) <1 \u03bcM, and is capable of inducing apoptosis in A2780 human ovarian cancer cells as determined by the activated caspase-3, Annexin V/PI double staining and accumulated cells at the sub-G1 phase of cell-cycle. While A2780 cells were arrested in G(2)/M phase with CDKI-83 treatment, phosphorylation at Thr(320) of PP1\u03b1 was significantly reduced, indicating CDK1 inhibition. Importantly, this compound reduced phosphorylation at Ser-2 of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by inhibiting cellular CDK9 activity, and down-regulated Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. These results suggest that combined inhibition of CDK9 and CDK1 may result in the effective induction of apoptosis and CDKI-83 has the potential to be developed as an anti-cancer agent.", "author": [{"author": "Xiangrui Liu", "affiliation": ["School of Pharmacy and Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK."], "href": "/?term=Liu+X&cauthor_id=21331744"}, {"author": "Frankie Lam", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Lam+F&cauthor_id=21331744"}, {"author": "Shenhua Shi", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Shi+S&cauthor_id=21331744"}, {"author": "Peter M Fischer", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Fischer+PM&cauthor_id=21331744"}, {"author": "Shudong Wang", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Wang+S&cauthor_id=21331744"}], "refPMID": ["14561402", "15261277", "3495884", "15937216", "19383288", "18423896", "10627292", "19568282", "9585508", "8578590", "19234140", "16818887", "16603719", "15882121", "16982772", "17404098", "15972445", "15145350", "12213657", "11927285", "21035734", "8628007", "8313913", "14513048", "15027857", "12923533", "8755249", "14701750", "19043447", "11597333", "16427012", "10647931", "15315761", "17003373", "4202581", "20462263", "12070027", "17700700", "12432547", "11413462"], "citedInPMID": ["21331744", "31024205", "21997795"], "body": ""}
