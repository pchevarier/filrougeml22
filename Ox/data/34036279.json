Many patients with HRF will also develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by reduced lung compliance, and bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on lung imaging which are not predominantly due to heart failure (3). Patients who develop ARDS have considerable attributable morbidity and mortality (1, 2, 4, 5). Approximately 40% will not survive to hospital discharge (1\u20133, 5, 6). Those who survive suffer significant long-term functional disability (4, 7). Patients with ARDS consume significant critical care and healthcare resources (4, 8).Life-saving therapies for HRF and ARDS exist (e.g., lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning) but are not consistently provided (1, 2). Guidelines endorsing the use of these therapies also exist; however, implementation remains inconsistent owing to challenges with diagnosis (particularly for ARDS) and ineffective knowledge translation (1, 9\u201317). Furthermore, use of unproven, invasive, and resource intensive therapy (e.g., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators) rather than proven and less resource intensive therapies (e.g., prone positioning) is common (1, 2, 18).Implementation of evidence-informed best practice is challenging. The Institute of Medicine has recommended standardized care processes to improve the reliability and safety of care (19). One strategy is the use of pathways, protocols, and bundles which are associated with reduced practice variation and improved adherence to evidence-informed therapy (20\u201325). Standardized management of care has been used in other areas of critical care including delirium, traumatic brain injury, and sepsis to improve outcomes (26\u201329). Evidence suggests a standardized approach to identifying and treating HRF and ARDS could yield similar benefits (30\u201335). Despite a 2016 call from the American Thoracic Society for more studies on Implementation Science, a rigorously developed pathway for the management of ARDS does not exist (36).We hypothesize that a rigorously developed stakeholder-informed care pathway will increase adherence to evidence-informed HRF and ARDS management and improve outcomes. With this goal, we conducted a modified Delphi consensus process with a multidisciplinary expert panel of ICU clinicians to create a pathway of care for identification and management of HRF and ARDS. We validated this pathway in a larger group of ICU clinicians from 17 ICUs. MATERIALS AND METHODSDelphi ProcessExpert Panel. We recruited a multidisciplinary panel of 30 clinicians from five Medical-Surgical or subspeciality (postcardiac-surgical and neurotrauma) ICUs in Alberta. All invited panelists were critical care clinicians with experience and interest in caring for patients with HRF and ARDS. Panelists were purposively invited by the core study team (authors) to ensure varying professions (physicians [MDs], registered nurses [RNs], respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurse practitioners [NPs]) as well as practice setting (community vs academic) were represented in the Delphi process.Literature Search and Development of Statements and Qualifying Criteria for Evaluation. A focused literature search was conducted to identify published expert opinion and clinical practice guidelines reflective of HRF and ARDS management best practice (9, 10). Initially, 90 pathway elements were identified for consideration in the first round. Potential pathway elements included diagnosis and therapeutic management of both HRF and ARDS, as well as delineation of multidisciplinary roles and responsibilities. For 27 of these statements, associated threshold values were proposed (qualifying criteria). These qualifying criteria addressed relevant time points (initial and interval) and oxygenation (PF ratio and Fio2 requirement) for initiating diagnostics and therapeutics.Rating Process. The rating process consisted of three rounds of iterative review and revision of the statements and associated qualifying criteria. In all three rounds, panelists were asked to independently rate whether each of the statements should be included in an HRF and ARDS care pathway using a nine-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 9 = strongly agree). Qualifying criteria were presented as multiple choice questions, and panelists were asked to select one value from a range of options.Between September 2017 and October 2017, rounds one and two surveys were distributed to all panelists via e-mail using an online platform (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA). The round one e-mail included the following: recently published clinical practice guidelines and expert opinion on managing ARDS (9, 10, 37) and a unique-user link to an online survey with 90 statements and 27 associated qualifying criteria. The \u201cround two\u201d e-mail was sent to panelists with 1) their individual responses alongside overall group medians for statements not reaching consensus in round and 2) a unique-user link to an online survey with 52 one statements. Both surveys contained several fields for panelist comments.Following the two online rounds, in November 2017, an in-person consensus panel meeting was held in Calgary, Canada, to evaluate statements not reaching consensus and associated qualifying criteria. The format of the meeting was an all-day workshop in which each nonconsensus item remaining from the first two online rounds was reviewed, discussed, and rated. Each panelist was provided with: 1) their responses and overall group medians for statements rated as uncertain in round two, 2) a paper survey with 36 statements and 26 associated qualifying criteria, and 3) an informed consent document. At the meeting, one additional statement and three qualifying criteria were suggested and evaluated.Analysis. The 91 statements were rated on a nine-point Likert scale. A score of 7\u20139 indicated agreement, 1\u20133 indicated disagreement, and 4\u20136 indicated uncertainty. Responses were summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR). In rounds one and two, consensus to include a statement was achieved when greater than or equal to 70% of panelists agreed with the statement (e.g., rated the statement 7\u20139); consensus to exclude a statement was achieved when greater than or equal to 70% of panelists disagreed with the statement (e.g., rated the statement 1\u20133). Statements that did not achieve consensus for agreement or disagreement were considered to have rated as uncertain and were included in the next round of review. In round three, consensus to include a statement was achieved when the median score was 7\u20139; consensus to exclude a statement was achieved when the median score was 1\u20133. The statement was considered uncertain if the median score was 4\u20136.In rounds one and three, qualifying criteria were evaluated in addition to the statements. If the statement linked with a qualifying criterion was excluded, the qualifying criterion was also excluded. If the statement linked to a qualifying criterion was included and one multiple choice value for the qualifying criterion had greater than or equal to 70% agreement, the qualifying criterion was included. In round three, if the qualifying criteria value did not reach greater than or equal to 70% agreement, qualifying criteria responses were combined from different responses to meet a threshold of greater than or equal to 70% agreement, along with consideration of panelist comments and evidence. For example, recruitment maneuvers every 2 hours (40%) and every 4 hours (40%) were combined for an 80% agreement. The final interval was chosen as every 4 hours.Development of the Pathway. After the completion of all three surveys, statements and associated qualifying criteria agreed upon by panelists (i.e., included statements) were collated, analyzed, and developed into a multidisciplinary HRF and ARDS screening and management pathway (the pathway).Validation SurveyTo externally evaluate the face validity of the pathway, a survey was administered to clinicians in all 17 adult medical-surgical and subspecialty ICUs across Alberta. Between March 13, 2018, and May 9, 2018, a unique-user link to the online validation survey was e-mailed to critical care (MDs), registered RTs, RNs, and NPs using an online platform (SurveyMonkey). The validation survey was sent to clinicians working in 17 adult ICUs across Alberta in a variety of hospital settings: five tertiary, seven community, and five regional. To encourage participation, we sent weekly electronic survey reminders for 4 weeks. The survey was piloted by the multidisciplinary study investigator team to assess clarity, length, and completeness prior to distribution.The validation survey evaluated 46 pathway elements divided into five main sections: 1) screening for HRF and ARDS, 2) goals and early management, 3) monitoring, 4) basic interventions, and 5) advanced interventions. Recipients were asked if they agreed or disagreed (or were unable to rate) with the pathway elements. A threshold of 75% agreement was established as indicating support. Additionally, we asked seven questions about participant demographics and resource availability at their primary ICU. Patients and families were not included in this step; however, they are to be included in future work to improve patient and family friendly educational material for ARDS.Analysis.Validation survey responses were summarized for those who agreed, disagreed, and were unable to answer using frequencies with percent. For the primary analyses, agreement with the pathway elements was calculated among those able to rate. It was determined that a sample size of 400 surveys would provide 95% binomial CIs with a margin of error of \u00b1 5% conservatively assuming an estimated agreement of 50%.EthicsThe study was approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (REB 17-1053). RESULTSDelphi ProcessCharacteristics of Panelists. Thirty stakeholders were invited to be panelists for the Delphi process, and 100% agreed to participate. The panel was comprised of clinicians from five ICUs and included four RNs (13%), 10 RTs (34%), 15 intensivists (50%), and one NP (3%) who reported an overall median of 17 years of practice (IQR, 13\u201321).

Panelists evaluated a total of 91 statements and associated qualifying criteria over three rounds. Statements and qualifying criteria described whether a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention should be used, the healthcare providers who were responsible for suggesting and ordering, as well as the threshold for implementing. The progression of the statements through the Delphi rounds is illustrated in Figure \u200bFigure11. In round one, 30 participants (100%) evaluated 90 statements and 27 qualifying criteria. Consensus (\u2265 70% agreement) was achieved to include 34 statements and exclude four statements. In round two, 28 panelists (93%) participated and evaluated 52 statements from round one that did not achieve consensus. In round two, consensus was achieved to include nine statements, exclude eight statements, with 35 statements not achieving agreement. In round three, a total of 25 panelists (83%) participated in the in-person meeting. During the meeting, one statement and three qualifying criteria were added and evaluated for a total of 36 statements, and 26 qualifying criteria evaluated. During the meeting, agreement was reached to include nine statements and 13 qualifying criteria and exclude 26 statements and 13 qualifying criteria. Only one statement remained uncertain. Upon completion of all three rounds, consensus was reached to include 52 statements (with 15 qualifying criteria) and exclude 38 statements and 15 qualifying criteria. Supplementary Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/CCX/A622) details the included statements and qualifying criteria. One statement did not reach consensus and was excluded.

In Round 1 and Round 2, consensus was reached (include or exclude) if statements met a threshold of 70% panelist agreement. Statements with less than 70% panelist agreement were deemed \u201cuncertain\u201d and were reevaluated in the next round. In the final round, consensus by median was accepted for statements, that is, a statement with a median of 1\u20133 was excluded, 7\u20139 was included, 4\u20136 was considered uncertain.Included Statements. The number of included statements with a median greater than or equal to 7 was 51 (98%) for MDs/NP, 50 (96%) for RTs, and 37 (71%) for RNs (Supplementary Digital Content 7, http://links.lww.com/CCX/A622). After three rounds, six statements did not meet a greater than or equal to 70% threshold of agreement and were included based on median scores; these included provider with primary responsibility for interventions (esophageal balloon, sedation strategy, and proning) and the routine assessment of recruitment maneuvers. Following the consensus process, the included statements and qualifying criteria were developed into a comprehensive HRF and ARDS care pathway.Validation SurveyIn order to externally validate the statements within the pathway, a survey was sent out to clinicians (RTs, RNs, MDs) in 17 ICUs across the province of Alberta (Table \u200b(Table11 for details). This included regional, community, and academic-tertiary ICUs as well as medical-surgical and subspecialty ICUs (neurotrauma, postoperative cardiac surgical). A total of 692 survey responses were received. Respondents included four NPs (1%), 410 RNs (59%), 229 RTs (33%), and 49 MDs (7%). Respondents derived from ICUs in tertiary hospitals (49%), community hospitals (36%), and regional hospitals (15%). The characteristics of survey respondents and their ICUs are shown in Table \u200bTable1.1. The percentage of agreement among respondents able to rate is detailed in Tables \u200bTables22 and \u200b33. Agreement of greater than 75% was achieved on 43 of 46 elements in the pathway. The three elements not meeting this threshold are: 1) time intervals to perform optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) studies (73%), 2) time intervals for recruitment maneuvers (68%), and 3) oxygenation thresholds necessitating prone positioning (71%). Although all disciplines had agreement of greater than 75% for most elements in the pathway (44 for MDs/NPs, 42 for RTs and all 46 for RNs), there were differences between disciplines in the proportion who were able to rate each element (Supplementary Digital Content 8, http://links.lww.com/CCX/A622).

DISCUSSIONUsing a modified Delphi consensus methodology with a multidisciplinary expert panel of critical care practitioners, we rigorously constructed, developed, and refined a HRF and ARDS diagnosis and treatment pathway. Using survey questionnaires, this pathway was validated by multidisciplinary clinicians in tertiary, community, and regional ICUs across Alberta with high validity. The pathway is comprehensive and addresses 1) \u201cscreening,\u201d 2) \u201cgoals and early management,\u201d 3) \u201cmonitoring,\u201d 4) \u201cbasic interventions,\u201d and 5) \u201cadvanced interventions\u201d and in addition defines team member roles as well as timing of diagnostics and interventions.Our pathway is the first to be created for ARDS management in a multidisciplinary fashion and rigorously validated by a broad group of front-line clinicians. This rigorous process addresses gaps from existing guidelines and pathways and complements them with the necessary details to operationalize these guidelines. For example, although several guidelines exist for the management of ARDS, most of these guidelines address only certain aspects of ARDS management (Table \u200bTable44) and do not address team member roles or timing of diagnostics and therapeutics (9, 10, 15, 16). By conducting a multidisciplinary Delphi process with stakeholders across a broad geography, establishing agreement on elements of the pathway along with clarification of roles and streamlining the process of care will mitigate potential barriers to adherence and implementation of best practice. Role clarity will also enhance implementation fidelity of the pathway and facilitate future audit and feedback. For example, the Delphi process highlighted three diagnostic or therapeutic steps where there was low agreement on which team member had primary responsibility for the intervention step despite strong agreement that the intervention should be conducted (esophageal balloons, sedation strategy, and proning). This underscores the importance of a pathway that addresses both evidenced-based therapies and coordination of multidisciplinary roles. The use of pathways for HRF and ARDS is associated with reduced mortality; however, these previously described pathways were not created using guidelines or a formal consensus process, and they are described in limited detail suggesting that there are opportunities to further enhance their efficacy (34, 38\u201344). None report their interventions using suggested guidelines (e.g., Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies) (45), thus significantly limiting the ability to externally scale and spread these pathways. By conducting a modified Delphi consensus process and describing the pathway elements and roles in detail, it will facilitate future scale and spread.TABLE 4.Characteristics of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Guidelines and Expert OpinionDiagnostics and TherapeuticsGuidelines and Expert OpinionFan et al (9) (Clinical Practice Guideline)Chiumello et al (10) (Expert Opinion)Griffiths et al (15) (Guideline)Papazian et al (16) (GuidelineParhar et al (current study) (Pathway)Screening for ARDS\u2713Professional role identification for interventions\u2713Daily reassessment of ARDS management\u2713\u2713Noninvasive ventilation\u2713Addresses or defines oxygenation goals\u2713\u2713Mode of invasive ventilation\u2713\u2713\u2713Low tidal volumes\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Limit inspiratory pressures (plateau pressures)\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Driving pressure\u2713\u2713Positive end-expiratory pressure strategy\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Consider measurement of esophageal pressure\u2713\u2713High-frequency oscillatory ventilation\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Conservative fluid balance\u2713\u2713Sedation\u2713\u2713Recruitment Maneuvers\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Neuromuscular blockade\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Prone positioning\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Inhaled vasodilators\u2713\u2713\u2713Corticosteroids\u2713Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713\u2713Extracorporeal Co2 removal\u2713\u2713Tracheostomy\u2713Weaning\u2713Open in a separate windowARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome, \u2713 = treatment was evaluated in the guideline or review.The pathway created is distinct from previous pathways and addresses known issues in ARDS knowledge translation. Under recognition of ARDS along with underutilization of evidence-informed therapies for ARDS is common (1, 2, 12, 46, 47). This pathway addresses both of these issues. Under recognition of ARDS is addressed by formalizing a screening and identification process for all ARDS patients. Diagnosis and screening for ARDS is not addressed in any of the four existing major guidelines for ARDS (Table \u200b(Table4).4). Our pathway requires all patients who have had mechanical ventilation for over 24 hours to be screened, and if they meet criteria, they are directed into evidence-based treatment (12\u201314, 46). This was felt to be very important among panelists with statements in the \u201cscreening and goals and early management\u201d categories receiving a high level of consensus to be included in the earlier rounds of the Delphi process: 11 of 23 \u201cscreening\u201d statements (48%) and 11 of 13 \u201cgoals and early management\u201d statements (85%) reached consensus to include in Round 1 (Supplementary Digital Contents 2 and 3 http://links.lww.com/CCX/A622). Underutilization of evidence-based therapeutics (e.g., lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning) will likely be enhanced through integration and coordination on how to escalate therapies. Although guidelines are usually clear about which therapeutics should be used, there is minimal description on integration and implementation. By assigning role clarity, it facilitates multidisciplinary coordination and empowers all members of the healthcare team to apply evidence-informed practice. Furthermore, by having over 500 clinicians from ICUs across the broad geography of Alberta participate in the validation of this pathway, it enhances its potential to be acceptable among front-line clinicians.Pathway elements that were not validated in the validation survey highlight aspects of ARDS care that have significant equipoise about their use and utility. On the validation survey, only three of 46 pathway elements did not meet the prespecified agreement threshold on inclusion in the final pathway: 1) PEEP study timing (73% agreement), 2) recruitment maneuver frequency (68% agreement), and 3) oxygenation thresholds for prone positioning (71% agreement). This lower degree of consensus observed among validation survey respondents reflects areas of ARDS management associated with variability in practice, supported by less robust evidence and where future research is needed. Surprisingly, despite high-level primary evidence and guideline endorsement, there was a reluctance to accept prone positioning at the thresholds that are recommended. This has also been seen in observational studies which demonstrated low utilization of prone positioning in eligible and appropriate patients (2, 11, 48). Further studies using implementation science methodology will be required to define barriers to prone positioning and specifically target them in future implementation science studies.Our study has several strengths. \u201cRounds 1 and 2\u201d of the Delphi process as well as the validation survey were presented in aggregate allowing the opinions of different disciplines with varied seniority to have equal weight. The iterative nature of the Delphi process allowed participants to reevaluate their responses after receiving feedback from other panelists allowing informed convergence to pathway elements. The multidisciplinary composition of the expert panel and validation respondents and the pathway itself acknowledge that HRF and ARDS management is complex and requires a team approach. The province-wide validation survey with over 500 responses with high agreement from varied ICU settings validates pathway content and suggests wide applicability. Our study must also be interpreted in the context of its limitations. Panelists were invited by the study team and although every effort was made to cover a wide variety of experience and practice settings, selection bias may be present, although the more broadly inclusive validation survey process may have mitigated some of this bias potentially. Survey respondents had to self-identify if they lacked content knowledge for specific pathway elements, and if not done appropriately could lead to a bias in accepting or rejecting elements. Our expert panel and validation surveys were limited in only considering opinions in one provincial healthcare jurisdiction and did not include patients or family. Finally, feasibility and pilot testing of the pathway has yet to be demonstrated. CONCLUSIONSA comprehensive, evidence-based, stakeholder-informed multidisciplinary HRF and ARDS pathway that has been validated has the best chance of improving knowledge translation for patient care. Future work is needed to test feasibility of implementing the pathway and its impact on patient care.
