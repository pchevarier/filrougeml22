Purpose To assess chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 up to 1 year after symptom onset. Materials and Methods Patients were enrolled if they were admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 and underwent CT scans during hospitalization at two isolation centers between 27 January and 31 March 2020. In a prospective study, three serial chest CTs were obtained at approximately 3, 7, and 12 months after symptom onset and longitudinally analyzed. The total CT score of pulmonary lobe involvement from 0 to 25 was assessed (score 1-5 for each lobe). Uni-/multi-variable logistic regression tests were performed to explore independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities after one year. Results 209 study participants (mean age: 49\u00b113 years, 116 women) were evaluated. At 3 months, 61% of participants (128 of 209) had resolution of CT abnormalities; at 12 months, 75% (156 of 209) had resolution. Of chest CT abnormalities that had not resolved, there were residual linear opacities in 25/209 (12%) and multifocal reticular/cystic lesions in 28/209 (13%) participants. Age\u226550 years, lymphopenia, and severe/ARDS aggravation were independent risk factors for residual CT abnormalities at one year (odds ratios of 15.9, 18.9, and 43.9, respectively; P<.001, each). In 53 participants with residual CT abnormalities at 12 months, reticular lesions (41 of 53, 77%) and bronchial dilation (39 of 53, 74%) were observed at discharge and were persistent in 53% (28 of 53) and 45% (24 of 53) of participants, respectively. Conclusion One year after COVID-19 diagnosis, chest CT showed abnormal findings in 25% of participants, with 13% showing subpleural reticular/cystic lesions. Older participants with severe COVID-19 or acute respiratory distress syndrome were more likely to develop lung sequelae that persisted at 1 year.

AbstractOpen in a separate window SummaryOne year after COVID-19 diagnosis, chest CT showed persistent abnormalities in\n25% of adult subjects.Key Results209 individuals who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 underwent serial\nchest CT examinations (at approximately 3, 7 and 12 months).One-year CT follow-up showed one of three patterns: complete resolution\n(75%), residual linear opacities (12%), or multifocal reticular/cystic\nlesions (13%).Independent risk factors for chronic chest CT changes at one year\nincluded age \u2265 50 years, lymphopenia, and severe/ARDS aggravation\n(ORs of 15.9, 18.9, and 43.9, respectively;\nP<.001, each). IntroductionSince the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than a hundred million\npeople have been infected, resulting in over three million deaths globally [1]. Several of the beta coronaviruses have many\nsimilarities in their clinical course, laboratory, radiological, and pathological\nfeatures. These coronaviruses include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19. [2-5]. However, SARS-CoV2 has\nproven more contagious than other coronaviruses, thus resulting in a far higher\nnumber of cases and a global pandemic [1,6].Previous chest CT observations of COVID-19 have demonstrated a typical radiological\ncourse from initial bilateral and subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) to a more\nextensive consolidation, with slow but gradual absorption of the lung lesions in\nsurvivors [7-11]. However, residual pulmonary lesions such as GGOs and parenchymal\nbands have been observed in more than ninety percent of patients at hospital\ndischarge [7,9]. Because coronavirus infection can result in diffuse alveolar\nexudation and lead to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\npost-infection sequelae such as lung fibrosis are a concern [12,13]. Focal lung\nfibrosis in chest CT has been observed in patients who have recovered from SARS,\neven after a 7-year follow-up [14,15]. Although lung lesions mostly resolve in\nCOVID-19 with mild to moderate severities, an autopsy study has confirmed lung\norganization and fibrosis in patients with fatal COVID-19, raising the possibility\nof permanent lung fibrosis sequelae in survivors with severe infection [7,16]. In\nsome patients with COVID-19, fibrotic sequelae including traction bronchiectasis,\nparenchymal bands, and \u201choneycombing\u201d have been observed in more than\none-third of participants with severe COVID-19 six months after symptom onset [7,17].\nHowever, it is unknown whether or not COVID-19 survivors develop lung fibrosis after\na long follow-up period and if risk factors at presentation are predictive of\nlong-term loss of function. If so, chest CT could potentially identify participants\nthat might benefit from early anti-fibrotic therapy [18]. The purpose of our study was to evaluate serial chest CT\nexaminations for the one-year temporal evolution of radiological findings after\nCOVID-19 infection. Materials and MethodsThis study was approved by the Ethics of Committees of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical\nCollege, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. 2020-0026) and followed\nthe 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Informed consent was\nobtained from all study participants. Study SampleWe prospectively evaluated participants with COVID-19 consecutively discharged from\ntwo isolation centers (Western Campus and Zhuankou Fangcang Shelter Hospitals,\naffiliated to Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science\nand Technology) between 27 January and 31 March 2020. This cohort included\nparticipants reported in a previous study only involving data at admission and\ndischarge for the longitudinal analysis in our study [7]. The criteria of diagnosis, therapy, and discharge followed the\nnationally standardized protocols [19].\nPatients with respiratory rate >30 breaths/min or oxygen saturation (SpO2)\n\u226493% on room air were classified as severe COVID-19, while ARDS was diagnosed\nwith arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2)\n\u2264300 mmHg [19-21]. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Age \u226518\nyears; 2. No medical history of pulmonary, autoimmune, or malignant disease; 3.\nCOVID-19 survivors who underwent hospitalized treatment; 4. Chest CT performed at\nadmission and discharge; 5. Chest CT at discharge demonstrated residual lung lesions\nrelated to COVID-19; 6. Gave voluntary, written informed consent for chest CT\nfollow-up. Participants that dropped out of the study had a subsequent positive\nCOVID-19 nucleic acid test or acquired an additional lung infection following\ndischarge were excluded. Chest CT Scanning ProtocolNon-contrast chest CT examinations were performed using the same commercial CT\nscanner (Philips Ingenuity Core128, Philips Medical Systems). Images were obtained\nduring breath-holding at full inspiration. The fixed tube voltage was set to 120kVp\nwith adaptive current modulation resulting in a volume CT dose index of\n7.1\u00b12.2 mGy (range: 3.1-12.2 mGy) and a dose length product of\n286.0\u00b197.2 mGy\u00b7cm (range: 99.2-506.3 mGy\u00b7cm). Other acquisition\nparameters included a pitch of 0.999, collimation of 64\u00d70.625 mm, a gantry\nrotation time of 0.75 s, and a DoseRight index of 18. From the raw data, axial CT\nimages were reconstructed with a matrix size of 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512\n(thickness of 1.5 mm and interval of 1.5 mm) using iterative reconstruction (iDose\nlevel 5, Philips Healthcare). Serial chest CT assessmentsChest CT data at admission and discharge were retrospectively collected from the\ninstitutional PACS system (Vue PACS, version 11.3.5.8902; Carestream Health). In\naddition, three serial chest CT examinations were carried out after 3-, 7-, and\n12-month periods since initial symptom onset. Visual assessments were performed by\nthree senior radiologists (C.Z, B.L. and L.Y., with 27, 26 and 23 years of clinical\nexperience in thoracic radiology, respectively) independently. Afterwards, any\ndisagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. Three radiologists were\nblinded to the clinical progress of all participants. Abnormalities were described\nusing the standard terminology defined in the Fleischner Society glossary and\npeer-reviewed literature (Figure\nE1) [7,8,11,17,22-24]. Complete resolution was\ndefined as the disappearance of any lung abnormalities on chest CT related to\nCOVID-19 [7]. The distribution of lung lesions\nwas categorized as a subpleural, diffuse, or random distribution [8]. Following the methods in previous studies of\nCOVID-19, we used the same semi-quantitative CT score system to estimate the\ninvolvement of the lung lesions in each lobe from 0 to 5 points: 0, no lesion; 1,\n<5%; 2, 5% to 25%; 3, 26% to 49%; 4, 50%-75%; 5. >75% [8,17,25]. The sum of the CT score\nin each lobe was calculated as the total CT score ranging from 0 to 25. At 12 months\nafter symptom onset, participants with or without residual CT abnormalities were\ncompared.Open in a separate windowFigure E1.Different lung abnormalities in this cohort. (a) Subpleural\nground-glass opacities (GGOs) with inter- and intra-lobular septum\nthickening (so-called \u201ccrazy-paving patterns\u201d) at admission of\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). (b) Subpleural\nconsolidation as the progression of COVID-19. (c) Residual\nlesions at discharge, including parenchymal bands and GGOs, with the\nsurrounding pleural thickening. (d) Reticular lesions at 12\nmonths, demonstrated as subpleural reticular-like attenuation.\n(e) Reticular lesions with small subpleural cystic lesions,\nsurrounding parenchymal-band traction and bronchial dilation (arrow).\n(f) Volume loss, indicated by linear consolidation and\ncrowding of dilated bronchus (arrow) and vessels. All images were obtained\nwith the same window level of -600 and window width of 1600. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Software (version\n26; IBM). Quantitative and counting data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard\ndeviation with range and the percentage of the total, respectively. Mann-Whitney\ntests were performed to estimate continuous variables between different groups\naccording to the non-normal distribution assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk tests.\nChi-square tests were performed to evaluate categorical variables between different\ngroups. Fisher's exact test was performed instead of Chi-square test if\nexpected count less than five. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression\ntests (Forward Conditional Method) were used to investigate the independent risk\nfactors for chronic CT changes after 1 year and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence\ninterval (95%CI) was calculated. Linear mixed models of repeated measures were\nestablished to estimate the fixed effects of the time and participant grouping on\nthe number of involved lung lobes and total CT score by using Type III tests.\nFurther inter-time point comparisons were performed by using Bonferroni adjustments.\nA statistical significance was defined at a P value <.001\nlevel (two-tailed). ResultsCharacteristics of Study Sample2171 patients discharged from the hospital were screened for our study, of which\n209 participants were included in the final analysis. 1063 patients were\nexcluded owing to the lack of chest CT at admission, and 285 patients were\nexcluded due to complete resolution of CT abnormalities at discharge (Figure 1). In the follow-up,\n15 and 3 participants were excluded owing to study dropout and occurrence of\nsecondary lung infection, respectively (Figure 1). The average age of participants was\n49\u00b113 years (range: 20-82 years) with a 1:1.25 male-to-female ratio. 20%\nof participants (41/209) had prior comorbidities, including hypertension,\ntype-II diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. 4 participants (4/209,\n1.9%) had a history of smoking. The mean interval between symptom onset and\nadmission was 6.9\u00b14.4 days (range: 1.0-18.0 days). 107 (51%), 80 (38%),\nand 22 (11%) participants were diagnosed with pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and\nARDS, respectively. All participants who developed ARDS received mechanical\nventilation therapy in an intensive care unit. The mean hospitalized period was\n24.8\u00b113.3 days (range: 5.0-80.0 days). The chest CT examinations at\nadmission and discharge were performed at 6.3\u00b14.5 days and\n28.3\u00b113.8 days after symptom onset, respectively. The detailed\ninformation is summarized in Table\n1.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Flowchart of participant inclusion. Abbreviations: ARDS, acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome.Table 1.Basic Characteristics of Study SampleOpen in a separate windowVisual CT assessmentsThe complete resolution rate gradually increased over time from 61% (128/209) at\n3 months to 75% (156/209) at 12 months after symptom onset (Figure 2a and Table E1). At admission GGOs (201/209, 96%),\nconsolidation (124/209, 59%) and crazy-paving (53/209, 25%) were the most common\nfindings (Figure 2b and\nTable E1). Thereafter,\nconsolidation and crazy-paving gradually improved over time, whereas other\npulmonary abnormalities, including GGOs, parenchymal bands, reticular lesions,\nbronchial dilation and volume loss, tended to increase after admission but start\nto resolve after discharge (Figure\n2b and Table\nE1). However, at 3 months after symptom onset, CT\nabnormalities had stabilized except for GGOs and parenchymal bands, which\ngradually resorbed (Figure\n2b and Table\nE1). Nevertheless, GGOs were the predominant radiological\npattern throughout (Figure\n2c and Table\nE1). The mean total CT score and the number of involved lung\nlobes gradually decreased from admission (9.7\u00b17.0 and 3.7\u00b11.5) to\n12 months (1.8\u00b13.9 and 0.9\u00b11.7) after symptom onset\n(P<.001, both) (Figure 2d and Table E1). After 3 months, the decrease in mean\ntotal CT score and mean number of involved lung lobes became non-significant\n(P\u2265.33 and P \u2265.06,\nrespectively) (Figure\n2d).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Dynamic CT changes over time.

In participants with complete resolution, no\nrecurrent pulmonary abnormalities were observed in further follow-up after\ncomplete resolution was initially achieved (Figure 3). Age, prior comorbidities, COVID-19\nseverities, time of admission from symptom onset, hospitalized period,\nlymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, number of involved lobes and\ntotal CT score at admission all demonstrated differences between the two groups\n(P\u2264.001, each) (Table 2 and Table 3). Age \u2265 50 years, lymphopenia and\nsevere/ARDS aggravation were independent risk factors for residual CT\nabnormalities at one year (odds ratios of 18.9, 15.9 and 43.9, respectively;\nP<.001, each) (Table 4).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Typical CT findings over time for Participants with complete resolution.\nImages are of a 60-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n(a) 11 d after symptom onset showing bilateral,\npredominantly subpleural, ground-glass opacity (GGO) with foci of\nconsolidation and crazy-paving (*).

At discharge,\ncomplicated CT abnormalities including reticular lesions, bronchial dilation and\nvolume loss were more commonly observed in participants with residual CT\nabnormalities than participants with complete resolution, whilst predominant GGO\nwas common to both groups (Table\n3). Over time, the total CT score and number of involved\nlung lobes gradually decreased with significant improvements at 3 months (Figure 6) but were higher in\nparticipants with residual CT abnormalities than participants with complete\nresolution (Table E2).\nNoticeably in participants with complete resolution, reticular lesions (21/156,\n14%) and bronchial dilation (18/156, 12%) were observed at discharge but had\nalmost completely resorbed at 3 months (Figure 6 and \u200bandE2).E2). In participants with residual CT\nabnormalities, reticular lesions (41/53, 77%) and bronchial dilation (39/53,\n74%) observed at discharge were incompletely resorbed and persisted in 53%\n(28/53) and 45% (24/53) of participants at 12 months, respectively (Figure 4\u20136).Open in a separate windowFigure 6.Dynamic CT changes over time between participants with complete\nresolution and residual CT abnormalities at 12 months.

All images have the same window\nlevel of -600 HU and window width of 1600 HU.Different residual abnormalities at 12 monthsBased on the different residual CT abnormalities at 12 months, participants could\nbe further divided into two subgroups (Table E3): participants with residual linear\nopacities (25/53, 47%) and with multifocal reticular/cystic lesions (28/53,\n53%). Participants with residual linear opacities demonstrated gradual\nresolution of pulmonary lesions since discharge, leaving residual parenchymal\nbands or thin linear opacities (Figure\n4, \u200b,E3E3,\n\u200b,E5E5 and Table E4). In contrast,\nparticipants with multifocal reticular/cystic lesions presented persistent\nsubpleural reticular or cystic lesions in the follow-up (Figure 5, \u200b,E4,E4, \u200b,E5E5 and Table E4). At 12 months, the total CT score was\n3.9\u00b12.6 vs. 10.1\u00b14.3, and the number of involved lung lobes was\n2.6\u00b11.0 vs. 4.5\u00b11.2 in participants with residual linear opacities\nand multifocal reticular/cystic lesions, respectively\n(P<.001, both) (Table E3 and \u200bandE4).E4). However, the improvements of total CT scores\nin both subgroups were observed at 3 months after symptom onset\n(P<.001) (Figure E5).Table E3.Comparison of Participants with Residual Linear Opacities and with\nMultifocal Reticular/Cystic LesionsOpen in a separate windowOpen in a separate windowFigure E3.Absorption of subpleural cystic lesions 3 months after symptom onset.\nImages are of a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with severe pneumonia of\ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Based on the CT findings at 12 months, participants\ncould be categorized into three groups: complete resolution (156 of 209, 75%),\nresidual linear opacities (25 of 209, 12%) and multifocal reticular/cystic lesions\n(28 of 209, 13%). Complete resolution mainly occurred in the first 3 months after\nsymptom onset (128 of 209, 61%). After 3 months, residual lesions became\nincreasingly persistent, highlighted by the insignificant decrease in total CT score\nfrom 2.7\u00b14.6 to 1.8\u00b13.9 at 3 and 12 months, respectively\n(P=0.33). Compared with participants with complete resolution,\nparticipants with residual linear opacities or multifocal reticular/cystic lesions\ndemonstrated extensive and diffusive pulmonary involvement at admission (total CT\nscore: 16.0\u00b16.5 vs. 7.5\u00b15.8, P<.001).\nIndependent risk factors for these residual CT abnormalities at one year included\nage\u226550 years, lymphopenia, and severe/ARDS aggravation.Similar to previous reports, bilateral subpleural GGOs with partial consolidation and\nGGOs with parenchymal bands were the most frequent CT findings at admission and\ndischarge, respectively [7-9,11].\nAny consolidation at admission had been gradually absorbed, typically with a\n\u201cmelting sugar\u201d pattern of resorption whereby the density of\nconsolidation gradually decreases to GGO but the lesion volume initially enlarges\n[7,17]. After 1 year, complete resolution was observed in 98% of\nparticipants with moderate pneumonia (105 of 107) but only in 50% of participants\nwith severe pneumonia or ARDS (51 of 102) (P<.001),\ncorroborating the findings of a previous study [7]. We found that old age, lymphopenia, and severe/ARDS aggravation,\nwhich correlated with mortality, were risk factors of residual CT abnormalities\n[4,10,26,27]. The presence of multifocal reticular/cystic lesions at\ndischarge was persistent in 28 participants and accompanied by bronchial dilation in\n24 of them (24/28, 86%). Although some articles prompted a potential correlation\nbetween mechanical ventilation and these changes, we observed that a high proportion\nof these participants (12/28, 43%) did not undergo mechanical ventilation therapy\n[12,17,28,29]. So, our results suggest multiple factors contribute to the\ndevelopment of these interstitial lesions, and mechanical ventilation and ARDS are\nnot the only factors.In a previous study involving 114 participants with severe COVID-19, residual CT\nabnormalities (including GGO, bronchial dilation, parenchymal bands, and\nhoneycombing) were observed in 62% of recovered participants (71 of 114) after 6\nmonths [17]. These CT abnormalities were the\ntypical manifestations of interstitial fibrosis [22,30,31]. Our study found a lower rate of 25% (53 of 209) of\nparticipants demonstrated CT abnormalities after 1 year [17]. Several reasons could explain this difference. First, the\nprevious study only included severe COVID-19, but we had participants with different\nseverities [17]. However, the number of\nsevere pneumonia or ARDS participants was similar between the two studies (83 vs. 80\nand 31 vs. 22, respectively) [17]. Second, we\nexcluded participants with prior chronic lung disease; their inclusion in the\nprevious study may lead to misjudgments of the lung sequelae not genuinely caused by\nCOVID-19. As a potential indicator of this, predominant reticular lesions (14%),\nbronchiectasis (11%), and honeycombing (1.8%) at admission were reported previously,\nwhich we did not corroborate. Our study also found that focally subpleural\nreticular/cystic lesions and bronchial dilation could be observed at discharge in\n30% of the participants (62/209) but resolved in more than half of participants\nwithin the first 3 months, indicating remodeling of immature fibrosis [12,23].\nReversal of these CT abnormalities has also been observed in SARS, other diffuse\nalveolar damage, and organizing pneumonia [23,32,33]. Similar to the findings in SARS, we observed persistent\nbut very focally reticular or cystic lesions only in a small portion of participants\nwith severe COVID-19 and ARDS [15].\nHowever, the differentiation of true, irreversible fibrosis from\nreversible lesions is far from straightforward, and the limited follow-up period\nin previous studies might result in the overdiagnosis of fibrosis\n[13,34,35]. For these reasons, we\navoided radiological terms such as \u201ctraction bronchiectasis\u201d,\n\u201choneycombing\u201d, and \u201creticular pattern\u201d for their\nassociation with genuine lung fibrosis. Instead, we used the term \u201cbronchial\ndilation\u201d, \u201csubpleural cystic lesions\u201d, and \u201creticular\nlesions\u201d, which were reported to be partially reversible [12,17,22,24].Our study has limitations. First, there were selection biases. Thousands of\ndischarged participants were excluded due to a lack of chest CT data at admission.\nThe high mortality of critically ill participants with COVID-19 had led to the\nenrollment of only 22 survivors of ARDS (22 of 209, 11%) [36]. Because of the exclusion of participants with prior\npulmonary disease, a relatively young cohort (a mean age of 49 years) with rare\nsmoking history (1.9%) was reported. While our approach permitted lung abnormalities\nto be more definitively attributed to COVID-19, we may underestimate the long-term\nimpact of COVID-19 on the general population, especially on old patients and\npatients with a smoking history or prior lung diseases who probably have more common\nor more severe lung sequelae [37]. Second, it\nis unknown whether these CT abnormalities will regress after a longer follow-up\nmeriting further clinical and radiological follow-up. However, considering residual\nlesions rarely change after 1 year in SARS, these CT abnormalities in COVID-19 are\nlikely permanent [15,38]. Third, systematic use of pulmonary function testing was\nnot performed, owing to use restrictions during the pandemic. This limits our\nunderstanding of the functional consequences of CT findings.In conclusion, one year after COVID-19 diagnosis, three chest CT patterns including\ncomplete resolution, residual linear opacities and multifocal reticular/cystic\nlesions could be observed, with complete resolution being the most common. Some of\nthe fibrotic lung changes demonstrated at discharge partially resorbed over time,\npredominantly between discharge and 3 months following the onset of symptoms.\nPersistent chest CT abnormalities were more likely to occur in older patients with\nsevere pneumonia, ARDS and lymphopenia. Further studies are needed to determine if\nthese chest CT findings one year after COVID-19 infection are associated with a\npermanent loss of lung function.
