INTRODUCTIONHigh throughput transcriptome analyses have revealed that pervasive transcription is more frequent than previously anticipated (reviewed in [1\u20133]). Pervasive transcription initiates at cryptic sites and results in short non-coding RNAs collectively known as Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs). CUTs are rapidly degraded by the exosome, but the factors and mechanisms that regulate their expression are not fully understood. Here, we report that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the CENP-B protein Abp1 prevents pervasive transcription of repetitive DNA elements. CENP-B is a sequence-specific DNA binding factor that derives from the domestication of pogo-like transposases, an event that occurred independently in mammals and S. pombe [4\u20136]. In contrast to mammals that generally have a single CENP-B, the S. pombe genome contains three CENP-B homologues (Abp1, Cbh1 and Cbh2) that play largely redundant functions, although Abp1 usually shows stronger effects [5, 7\u201310]. Originally identified as a centromere-associated protein [11\u201313], CENP-B is important for de novo centromere assembly in mammalian artificial chromosomes [14\u201318], and for heterochromatin formation and silencing in S. pombe [19]. Also in S. pombe, CENP-B contributes to silencing of Tf2 retrotransposons [20], regulates directionality of mating-type switching [21\u201323] and stabilizes stalled replication forks [24, 25]. Our results show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation of CUTs. These CUTs are mostly produced from Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats. We also show that, in the absence of Abp1, RNAPII gains access to multiple internal cryptic sites in Tf2 retrotransposons and, most remarkably, in rDNA repeats. Altogether, these results suggest that, in the absence of Abp1, strong cryptic transcription of Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats takes place, overloading the exosome degradation pathway and resulting in CUTs accumulation. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Strains and MediaS. pombe cells were grown in complete medium (YES) or Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM), according to standard procedures. Strains used in these experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. abp1\u0394::KAN, abp1\u0394::NAT, cbh1\u0394::NAT and cbh2\u0394::NAT were obtained by replacing the entire ORF of the corresponding gene with PCR products carrying KanMX6 or NatMX6 markers obtained from pFA6a plasmids [26, 27]. Abp1 was tagged with 3HA using plasmids pFA6a\u20133HA [26, 28]. The abp1\u0394dis3-54 strain was obtained using conventional genetic crosses.2.2. Short RNAs purification and analysesTotal RNA from S. pombe cells was obtained by acid-phenol extraction as described in [29] and quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Capillary gel electrophoretic analyses of total RNA were performed at the Functional Genomics facility of IRB (Barcelona) using the RNA 6000 Nano kit for the Bioanalyzer 2100 capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent). For purification of short RNAs, 3 \u03bcg of total RNA were loaded on a 1% TAE-low melting point agarose gel. After electrophoretic separation, RNAs of sizes lower and higher than 500nt were selected, eluted from the gel by digestion with gelase (Epicentre) and purified according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The fraction of purified RNAs of sizes < 500 nt was used to estimate the levels of Tf2 and 28S rRNA CUTs, while the fraction of purified RNAs > 500 nt was used to estimate the RNAs levels of sizes bigger than CUTs, including the full-length transcripts. After digestion by the gelase, total cDNA was prepared using 5\u03bcL of the purified RNAs using hexamer primers and the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). qPCR reactions were performed by using the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche). Primers used for RT-qPCR amplification are listed in Supplementary Table S2.For the sequencing of the short RNAs (RNAseq) a single sequencing run was performed, using two biological replicates per condition. Library construction, cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina GAII Genome Analyzer followed the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (www.illumina.com). In brief, total RNA was quantified by Qubit fluorometer using the Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Using Illumina\u2019s small RNA Sample Prep Kit v1.5, 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 adapters were ligated to 5 \u03bcg of total RNA, followed by reverse transcription and 12 cycles of amplification. Amplification products between 125 to 250 nt size were resolved in a 4% agarose gel and purified. Libraries were quantified by Qubit fluorometer using the Quant-iT DNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Using Illumina\u2019s Cluster Generation Kit, libraries were subjected to cluster generation at 8 pM concentration as one sample per lane. Sequencing-by-synthesis was performed for 38 cycles.2.3. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experimentsChIP assays of Abp1 and PolII-Ser5P were essentially performed as previously described [30, 31], using an Abp1-HA tagged strain (SpA129) for Abp1 ChIPseq, and wt (spA64) and abp1\u0394 (spA160) strains for PolII-Ser5P ChIPseq. In brief, formaldehyde was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1% for 15 min. After quenching with 125mM Glycine, cells were harvested and lysed with a FastPrep cell disrupter (FP120, Bio101 Thermo Savant). DNA was sheared to a range of 250\u2013400bp with a Bioruptor Standard (Diagenode). Monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody [12CA5] (Abcam16918) was used to retrieve HA-tagged Abp1 combined with Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies). For PolII-Ser5P ChiPseq we used \u03b1PolIIser5 monoclonal antibody (Abcam/ab5131). After reversing the crosslinks DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform and precipitated with LiCl and isopropanol. One sequencing ChIPseq run was performed for HA-tagged Abp1 and PolII-Ser5P respectively, using one immunoprecipitated sample per condition, together with their respective input samples. For ChiP-qPCR, triplicates for at least 3 biological replicates were analyzed following the \u0394\u0394Ct method (see Supplementary Table S2 for primers used in each experiment). ChIPseq analyses were performed with 10 ng of ChIP/Input DNA as previously described [32].ChIP assays were performed on the following histone modifications: H3K9Ac (antibody AB4441, Abcam); H3K14Ac (antibody AB52946, Abcam) and H3K36Me3 (antibody AB9050, Abcam) using the strains ZB1396 (wt), ZB1397 (abp1\u0394), and ZB1655 (clr3\u0394) grown at 32\u00b0C and ZB295 (clr6-1) grown at 26\u00b0C. A volume of 200 mL cells grown to OD600 =0.8 were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of glycine to 125 mM, for 5 min. The cell pellets were washed with 5 ml of TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 700 \u03bcl of FA-lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM PMSF). Cells were lysed in a mini-bead beater (MiniBeadBeater-16, Model: 607). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and 13,000rpm. The crude chromatin pellet was washed with 1 mL of FA-lysis buffer and resuspended in 2 mL of FA-lysis buffer. Chromatin was sonicated for 10 cycles for 30s with 30s intervals in FA lysis buffer in a Bioruptor (Diagenode). Samples were spun at 13,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. FA lysis buffer was added to each supernatant to a final volume of 9.5 mL and 1 mL sample was used for immunoprecipitation. Chromatin was pre-cleared then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with pre-bound antibody and beads. The antigen-antibody complex was washed successively with 1 ml each of FA-lysis buffer, FA-lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, ChIP wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM EDTA), and TE buffer. The beads were incubated with 10 \u03bcg of DNase-free RNase (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at 42\u00b0C followed by 20 \u03bcg Proteinase K (Thermo Scientific) for 1hr at 55\u00b0C. The crosslinks were reversed by overnight incubation at 65\u00b0C in the same buffer. Samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of linear acrylamide. DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 \u03bcl H2O and used as template for qPCR amplification. For ChiP-qPCR, 3 biological replicates were analyzed following the \u0394\u0394Ct method (see Supplementary Table S2 for primers used in each experiment).2.4. Analysis of nucleolar sizeNucleolar size was determined by fluorescence microscopy, using the non-ribosomal protein Gar2-GFP as a marker [33, 34]. Gar2-GFP was expressed from the endogenous locus. Cells were grown in YES medium at 30\u00b0C and, without fixation, visualized with an epifluorescence microscope Nikon E1000 using the 100X objective with MetaMorph image analysis software. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342. The relative nucleolar size was determined as the ratio of the Gar2-GFP area to the total nuclear area determined as the sum of the Hoechst and Gar2-GFP areas together.2.5. Bioinformatics and Biostatistics analysesIllumina ChIPseq data for Abp1 and RNAPII-Ser5, together with their respective Input samples, and strand-specific RNAseq data for short RNAs from wt and abp1\u0394 cells were aligned against the reference S. pombe genome (Sanger release 09052011) using Bowtie 0.12.5, allowing for 2 (ChIPseq) and 0 (RNAseq) mismatches in the read seed. In order to compare read proportions to estimate enrichment and depletion in feature types with multiple copies along the genome (i.e. transposons, rRNA units), all possible alignments for multiple hits were considered for all samples and controls. For ChIPseq data, strand shift bias and duplicated reads were estimated and removed with the htSeqTools package [35] using the filterDuplReads functions with default options, and significantly enriched regions were detected with the enrichedRegions function, considering only regions within the IP sample with a coverage above 2.5 times the first quartile, and using a Benjamini Hochberg p-value threshold of 0.05. Afterwards the enrichedPeaks function was used to detect significantly enriched peaks (putative binding sites), setting the minimum coverage difference between IP and Input at 200. For RNAseq data, abp1\u0394 and wt replicates were pooled, and significantly enriched regions in short RNAseq in abp1\u0394 and wt samples independently (without control) were detected using the enrichedRegions function from the htSeqTools package, using the one tailed option and a Benjamini Hochbergh pvalue threshold of 0.05, and leaving the other settings as default. Afterwards, significantly enriched and depleted regions in small RNAseq in abp1\u0394 mutant against wt (thus, up and down-regulated short RNAs in abp1\u0394) were detected using the enrichedRegions function from the htSeqTools package, using the two tailed option and a Benjamini Hochbergh pvalue threshold of 0.05, and leaving the other settings as default.Annotation of all resulting enriched/depleted regions (RNAseq) and putative binding sites (ChIPseq) against the S. pombe annotation 294 v2.20 [36] was performed using the AnnotatePeakInBatch function from the ChIPpeakAnno package [37], and setting the maxgap parameter at 100 bp. ChIPseq (IP/Input) and short RNAs (abp1\u0394/wt) log2 ratios were computed in R, and peak location, mean coverage and coverage ratio plots were produced with the PeakLocation, plotMeanCoverage and RegionsCoverage functions of the htSeqTools package respectively, normalizing with respect to the mean value across genomic feature length when necessary. Unless otherwise stated, all downstream statistical analysis of ChIPseq and RNAseq data was performed in R version 2.15.3. Microarray data for abp1\u0394 de-regulated probesets was retrieved from NCBI GEO accession {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE39404\",\"term_id\":\"39404\"}}GSE39404 and probeset chromosomal location was annotated against the S. pombe annotation 294 v2.20 genome. 3. RESULTS and DISCUSSION3.1. abp1\u0394 cells accumulate CUTs from Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeatsCapillary gel electrophoresis analyses of total RNAs obtained from abp1\u0394 cells showed an accumulation of short RNA molecules of sizes ranging between 50 nt and 200 nt (Figure 1). No such increase was observed upon deletion of the other two S. pombe CENP-B homologs cbh1 or cbh2 (Figure 1). Furthermore, no synergistic effects were detected in abp1\u0394/cbh1\u0394 or abp1\u0394/cbh2\u0394 double mutants (Figure 1), suggesting that Cbh1/2 have only minor effects on this accumulation.Open in a separate windowFigure 1abp1\u0394 cells show increased levels of short RNAs.

B) Quantitative analysis of the results shown in A. The percentage of short RNAs respect to total RNA is presented for the indicated strains. The data presented are the averages of at least 4 biological replicates. Error bars indicate SEM. P values report significance by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test (**P<0.01, ***P<0.001).RNAseq analyses showed that, as expected from their length, a significant proportion of short RNAs detected in abp1\u0394 corresponded to short non-coding RNAs species, such as 5S and 5.8S rRNAs, and tRNAs (Figure 2A). In addition, we also detected short RNAs corresponding to genomic features of larger size, such as protein-coding genes and, in particular, Tf2 retrotransposons and 28S and 18S rDNAs, their full-length forms being respectively of 4000 nt, 3485 nt and 1842 nt (Figure 2A), suggesting that a large proportion of these short RNAs corresponded to CUTs species. Note that, although the highest proportion of short RNAs mapped to protein-coding genes (~55%), we detected them in only <5% of the S. pombe protein-coding genes (not shown). From the RNAseq data we defined significantly enriched regions in short RNAs in abp1\u0394 and wt samples (see material and method). The short-RNAs enriched regions found in abp1\u0394 were smaller in size than the one found in wt (Supplementary Figure S3A). We observed that ~65% of the genomic regions enriched in short RNAs were detected in both abp1\u0394 and wt cells and 35% (169) were present in abp1\u0394 only (Figure 2B). Compared with wt and abp1\u0394, the 169 short-RNAs enriched regions specific to abp1\u0394 contained a higher proportions of regions mapping to tRNA but were depleted in regions corresponding to the rDNA repeats (Supplementary Figure S3B). Overall, the short RNAs were generally enriched in abp1\u0394 cells in comparison to wt cells (Figure 2C), with the highest accumulation corresponding to Tf2 retrotransposons and 28S rDNAs (Figure 2C). We confirmed this accumulation by RT-qPCR analyses on gel purified-RNAs of sizes <500 nt (Figure 2D). Tf2 and rDNA constitute two major types of repetitive DNA elements in the S. pombe genome, which contains thirteen Tf2 copies scattered along the genome [38] and approximately 100\u2013150 rDNA repeats located at both ends of chromosome III [39]. CUTs are usually degraded through the exosome pathway [1\u20133]. Indeed, we observed that dis3-54, a mutation that impairs ribonuclease activity of the essential Dis3 exosome subunit [40], and deletion of cid14, a poly(A)polymerase targeting nuclear RNAs to the exosome [41], showed synergistic effects with abp1\u0394 regarding the accumulation of CUTs from both Tf2 and rDNA elements (Figure 2E). Altogether, these results suggest that Abp1 prevents the accumulation of CUTs from repetitive DNAs, mainly Tf2 and rDNA elements. Abp1 has recently been shown to collaborate with Set1 to silence sense and antisense Tf2 transcription [42]. We tested whether Set1 had an effect on the accumulation of short RNAs seen in the abp1\u0394 strain but we saw no increase in CUTs proportion in set1\u0394 compared to wt or in the double mutant set1\u0394/abp1\u0394 compared to abp1\u0394 (Supplementary Figure S2A and B), indicating that the Abp1-mediated silencing of cryptic transcription is independent of Set1.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Loss of Abp1 results in the accumulation of CUTs produced from Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats.

D) and E) Primers amplify a 3121\u20133193 bp region of the Tf2 transcript and a 673\u2013756 bp region of the 28S rRNA transcript.ChIPseq analyses showed a significant co-occurrence of CUTs with Abp1 binding sites (Fisher\u2019s test p< 10\u221242) (Figure 3A), suggesting a direct contribution of Abp1 to their regulation. Actually, ~50% of CUTs-enriched regions localized at Abp1 binding sites (Figure 3B). The other ~50% of the CUTs don\u2019t appear to be directly associated with an Abp1 binding sites, either because we could not detect the binding sites or because Abp1 was acting on the CUTs production from a bigger distance. In particular, Abp1 binding was detected at the LTRs of Tf2 elements (Figure 3C, left) [20, 25] and all along the rDNA repeats (Figure 3C, right). ChIP-qPCR experiments confirmed binding of Abp1 at LTRs of Tf2 elements and at the 28S rDNA gene (Figure 3D). Abp1 binding was also detected at tRNA and 5S rDNA genes, and at ~10% of the S. pombe protein-coding genes (Supplementary Figure S1A). Except in the rDNA repeats, Abp1 binding was generally restricted to the 5\u2032 region of the corresponding genomic feature (Supplementary Figure S1B).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Abp1 binding correlates with the pattern of CUTs accumulation.

In the absence of Abp1, RNAPII transcribes Tf2 and rDNA elements from multiple internal cryptic sitesAt Tf2 elements, CUTs were enriched along the entire element including the LTRs (Figure 4A). Similarly, CUTs enrichment was also detected all along the rDNA repeats (Figure 5A), with the highest enrichment observed at the 28S rDNA gene. Notice that at Tf2 elements CUTs were mostly sense, with antisense CUTs restricted to the LTRs (Figure 4A). On the other hand, in rDNA repeats, we detected both sense and antisense CUTs, the later being slightly more abundant (Figure 5A). Furthermore, in ChIPseq experiments, we detected the active RNAPolII form phosphorylated in Serine 5 (RNAPII-Ser5P), which is normally restricted to promoters (reviewed in [43]), all along Tf2 elements (Figure 4B). Most remarkably, we also detected RNAPII-Ser5P across rDNA repeats, which are normally transcribed by RNAPI [44] (Figure 5B). ChIP-qPCR analyses confirmed these results (Figures 4C and \u200band5C).5C). Altogether these results suggest that, in the absence of Abp1, RNAPII initiates transcription from multiple internal cryptic sites distributed along Tf2 elements and rDNA repeats.Open in a separate windowFigure 4In abp1\u0394 cells, CUTs originate across the entire Tf2 element.

The data presented are the averages of at least 3 biological replicates. Error bars indicate SEM. P values report significance of differences with wt by Tukey\u2019s HSD test.We observed that most differentially expressed Abp1 target genes were upregulated in abp1\u0394 cells (Supplementary Figure S1C). A third of the differentially affected genes were not localized near an Abp1-binding site (Supplementary Figure S1C), suggesting that the absence of Abp1 could also have an indirect role on gene expression, for example through it\u2019s ability to regulate nuclear organization ([20, 42]). Transcription from internal cryptic sites generally occurs when genes are actively transcribed [45, 46]. In this regard, full-length Tf2 mRNA levels increased in abp1\u0394 cells (Figure 2D, left) [20, 47]. Abp1 has been shown to repress transcription by promoting histone deacetylation through the recruitment of the HDACs Crl3 and Clr6 [20, 42, 47, 48]. Thus, the function of Abp1 in preventing cryptic transcription of Tf2 elements might reflect its role in establishing a repressive chromatin state. Consistent with this hypothesis, CUTs also accumulated in crl3\u0394/clr6\u0394 mutants as well as in the hip1\u0394 and hip3\u0394 mutants, which are histones chaperones belonging to the HIRA complex involved in nucleosome assembly and repressing Tf2 and cryptic transcriptions [45, 49] (Figures 4D and 4E). The extent of CUTs accumulation generally correlated with the extent of Tf2 activation (Figures 4D and 4E). We explored the state of H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation in Tf2 (Figures 4F and 4G), but did not observe an increase in acetylation in the abp1\u0394 mutant. H3K9Ac was nevertheless increased within the coding sequence of Tf2 in the clr6-1 mutant, indicating that this chromatin mark could mediate the increased transcription of CUTs in this strain (Figure 4E). Increased RNAPII transcription in abp1\u0394 might recruit Set2, resulting in H3K36me deposition that in turn could recruit the Clr6 complex II to repress CUT expression [50, 51]. This model could potentially explain the unexpected lack of increased H3 acetylation in abp1\u0394. We measured the presence of H3K36me on Tf2 elements, but observed no changes in abp1\u0394, clr3 or clr6 mutants. This suggests that the short abortive transcription of CUTs does not stably recruit Set2, possibly because RNAPII does not reach a ser2-phosphorylated elongating form.In contrast to Tf2, expression of full-length 28S RNAs was unaltered in abp1\u0394 cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that transcription by RNAPl was not affected. However, as shown above (Figure 5B), CUTs accumulation at rDNA repeats is associated with cryptic transcription by RNAPII, which normally is not detected at rDNAs repeats. H3K14ac is significantly increased over the rDNA gene in abp1\u0394, supporting a model of Abp1-mediated recruitment of Clr3 to repress CUTs (Figure 5F) [52]. However, neither clr3 nor clr6 mutants phenocopied abp1\u0394 in this respect, and unlike clr3\u0394 [52], abp1\u0394 mutants do not lose silencing of a ura4+ reporter gene embedded in the rDNA (See Supplementary Figure S3). Altogether this indicates that other HDACs might be implicated in Abp1-mediated CUT repression in rDNA. Also, in contrast to the case of Tf2, rDNA genes accumulated high levels of H3K36me (Figure 5G). Together, these results suggest that abp1 represses CUT expression through different mechanisms in Tf2 and rDNA.Moreover, we observed that nucleolus size is enlarged by ~20% in abp1\u0394 cells (Figure 5D). The augmentation in nucleolus size in abp1\u0394 is not due to an increase in rDNA copy number, because the length of the rDNA repeats on chromosome III remains unchanged in abp1\u0394 ([25] and our unpublished results). Altogether these results suggest that nucleolus organization is disturbed in the absence of Abp1 and that this alteration does not affect RNAPI transcription but results in deregulated RNAPII binding and transcription. Interestingly, although normally transcribed by RNAPI, cryptic RNAPII transcription of rDNAs genes has been reported in both budding and fission yeasts, and is believed to be important for stability and expression of the rDNA array [53, 54]. The nucleolus constitutes a highly structured nuclear compartment [55]. However, the factors and mechanisms that determine nucleolus organization are still poorly understood. In this regard, our results suggest a contribution of Abp1 to the structural organization of nucleolar chromatin. Interestingly, Abp1 is known to mediate clustering of Tf2 elements [20] and it locates at 5S rRNA and tRNA genes that, being transcribed by RNAPIII, also form clusters in S. pombe [56\u201358]. Altogether these observations suggest that Abp1 might play a general structural role in the organization of the S. pombe genome.3.3. ConclusionsHere, we have shown that deletion of abp1 induces the accumulation of CUTs from Tf2 and rDNA repeats. These CUTs are product of RNAPII transcription, initiate at multiple internal cryptic sites and are degraded by the exosome pathway. Altogether, these results suggest that Abp1 prevents pervasive RNAPII transcription at Tf2 elements and rDNA repeats. Abp1 is also detected at promoters of ~10% of protein-coding genes, and at most 5S rRNA and tRNA genes. Whether Abp1 is also preventing pervasive transcription at these sites remains to be determined.
