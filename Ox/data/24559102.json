Extension of this methodology\nshould be helpful in determining the site and mode of action of numerous\nadditional cofactors and in reducing unwanted side effects. Steroid hormones, acting through\ntheir cognate receptors, are critical regulators of gene expression\nduring development, differentiation, homeostasis, and endocrine therapies\nfor numerous inflammatory diseases and lung development in premature\ninfants.1\u22123 Typically, steroids enter the cell by passive diffusion\nand bind to cognate intracellular receptors to cause activation and\nan increased residency of the receptor\u2013steroid complex in the\nnucleus, where the complex binds to DNA at biologically active hormone\nresponse elements (HREs) to induce or repress gene transcription.\nMore than 350 cofactors have been described to modify the maximal\nactivity (Amax) of steroid-regulated gene\nactivation.4,5 Many of these cofactors have been found\nto interact with HRE-bound receptors or other factors at the transcriptional\nstart site (TSS).6 Of those cofactors that\nhave been examined, most also modulate both the concentration of the\nagonist steroid required for half-maximal induction, or EC50, and the residual partial agonist activity of antisteroids.7\u221210 However, despite the dramatic advances over the past two decades,\nboth the precise molecular action of each DNA-associated cofactor\nand where it acts in the overall sequence of events remain mostly\na matter of speculation.Recently, our attention has been drawn\nto factors involved in steps\nof steroid-modulated gene activation that are downstream of the TSS.\nOne particularly attractive, potential control point for many genes\nthat has emerged over the past few years involves paused RNA polymerase\nII.11\u221216 Paused polymerase is usually located 25\u2013100 bp downstream\nof the TSS.11,12,16,17 Pol II is held at this position by the poorly\ndefined actions of several proteins, including the heterotetrameric\nnegative elongation factor (NELF) complex and DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF).12,16,18,19 Release of the paused polymerase is proposed to be a rate-limiting\nstep and is initiated by signals that allow the polymerase-bound mediator\ncomplex to recruit \u201csuper-elongation complexes\u201d (SECs)\ncontaining, among other proteins, eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia\n(ELL) and positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb).15,16,20 Our interest in paused polymerase,\nand associated factors, was heightened by our recent findings that\ntwo NELF complex components, NELF-A and NELF-B, each inhibit GR-regulated\ngene expression by acting at two separate sites in the sequence of\nsteps leading to an increased level of gene expression. One site does\nnot appear to involve the NELF complex.21 Of the numerous factors that are associated with the release of\npaused polymerase and could participate in the second site of action\nof NELF-A and NELF-B, ELL and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), which\nis the catalytic subunit of P-TEFb, were of particular interest to\nus.ELL was first reported to be required for full induction\nof heat\nshock genes in Drosophila and to be\ninvolved in the regulation of paused polymerases.16,22 However, ELL also has other activities, such as transcription elongation\nand cotranscriptional RNA processing.23,24 ELL was also\nreported to display specificity among steroid receptors.25 Thus, ELL increased the Amax of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) transactivation and\nreduced the EC50 by a factor of \u224810 to cause a left\nshift in the position of the dose\u2013response curve. In contrast,\nELL had no effect on androgen or progesterone receptors but decreased\nthe level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transactivation by an undetermined\nmechanism while binding to GR. Interestingly, the actions of ELL on\nMR and GR are even more divergent because the L214V mutant of ELL\ndisrupts its activity as a coactivator with MR but not its corepressor\nproperties with GR.25P-TEFb is thought\nto be the critical factor for the escape of paused\npolymerase into the productive elongation phase of transcription.16\u221219,26 This occurs following the actions\nof the kinase subunit of P-TEFb, Cdk9, which phosphorylates both the\nNELF and DSIF complexes, to cause the release of NELF from the paused\npolymerase, and the Ser-2 residues of the CTD of pol II, to permit\ntranscriptional elongation by pol II. Cdk9 has been reported to have\nother targets, such as the kinase-independent actions of Cdk9 during\nrepression of B-Myb transactivation activity (27) and in transcriptional elongation once the pol II complex is released\nfrom the pause site.28 Cdk9 has also been\nfound to bind to estrogen receptor \u03b129 and to phosphorylate androgen receptors.30,31The reports described above suggest that factors well-known\nto\nbe involved in the status of paused RNA polymerase II may have other,\nless common activities. A recently developed theory and associated\ncompetition assay9,10,32,33 would be helpful in continuing our characterization\nof the actions of NELF-A and -B.21 This\ncompetition assay has advantages in that it yields information about\nboth the kinetically defined mechanism of action and the relative\norder of factor action without the knowledge of the precise biochemical\nmechanisms involved. Factors that have been previously examined and\ncould be eliminated as direct functional targets of NELF-A and -B\nare (a) GR, which binds to NELF-B but acts upstream of the NELFs,\n(b) transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), which acts after\nthe NELFs, and (c) CREB-binding protein (CBP), which exerts its effects\ndownstream of the NELFs.21The purpose\nof this study is to examine whether other potential\ninteracting factors could reverse the effects of the NELFs. Because\none site of action of the NELFs could still be via the NELF complex,\nwe considered two factors that are known to be involved in the release\nof the paused polymerase (ELL and Cdk9), one of which (Cdk9) phosphorylates\nthe NELF complex to cause its dissociation.16,17,26 Interestingly, we find that both ELL and\nCdk9 are competitive decelerators9 that\nimpede GR transactivation. Unexpectedly, Cdk9 does not hinder the\nactions of NELF-A and NELF-B but rather cooperates to cause an increased\nlevel of inhibition. Even more surprising is that Cdk9 kinase activity\nis not involved in the ability of Cdk9 to attenuate GR transactivation.\nThese studies thus document new activities of NELFs, ELL, and Cdk9\nthat impact GR-controlled gene activation in manners that differ from\ntheir better known mechanisms of action in the release of paused RNA\npolymerase II. Experimental ProceduresUnless otherwise\nindicated, all cell growth occurred at 37 \u00b0C\nand all other operations were performed at 0 \u00b0C.ChemicalsDexamethasone (Dex), 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole\n(DRB), and flavopiridol hydrochloride\nhydrate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes\nand T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and\nthe dual-luciferase reporter assay was from Promega (Madison, WI).PlasmidsRenilla-TS reporter, rat GR (pSG5-GR), GREtkLUC,\npSG5-TIF2, and GAL/GR525C have been previously described.34 FR-LUC reporter is from Stratagene (La Jolla,\nCA). Human NELF-A (missing the first 11 residues) and chimeric Flag/NELF-B35 were from R. Li (University of Texas Health\nScience Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX). Full length wild-type\n(wt) NELF-B and mutants of wt NELF-A and -B, in which four amino acids\nof the NELF domain in each protein have been changed to alanine, have\nbeen described elsewhere.21 pCMV-XL6/ELL\n(K. Gardner, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health),\nRc/CMV-dnCkd9 (D167N) (X. Grana, Temple University, Philadelphia,\nPA), and Flag/K44,48R Cdk9 (AcMtCdk9) (M.

The rabbit anti-ELL antibody was generously provided by\nK. Gardner. Western blots were prepared, probed, and visualized by\nECL detection reagents as described by the manufacturer (Amersham\nBiosciences).Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and\nReporter AnalysisMonolayer cultures of U2OS, U2OS.rGR, COS-7,\nCV-1, and 293 cells\nwere grown as described previously.34,36,37 Briefly, triplicate samples of cells were seeded\ninto 24-well plates at a density of 20000 cells/well and transiently\ntransfected the following day with luciferase reporter and DNA plasmids\nby using 0.7 \u03bcL Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or Fugene 6 (Roche)\nper well according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The\nlevel of total transfected DNA was adjusted to 300 ng/well of a 24-well\nplate with pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). The molar amount of plasmids\nexpressing different protein constructs was kept constant with added\nempty plasmid or plasmid expressing human serum albumin.34 Renilla-TS (10 ng/well of a 24-well plate) was\nincluded as an internal control. After transfection (32 h), cells\nwere treated with medium containing appropriate hormone dilutions.\nThe cells were lysed 20 h later and assayed for reporter gene activity\nusing dual luciferase assay reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by an EG&G\nBerthold\u2019s luminometer (Microlumat LB 96P). The data were normalized\nto Renilla null luciferase activity and expressed as a percentage\nof the maximal response with Dex before being plotted \u00b1 the standard\nerror of the mean, unless otherwise noted.Two-Factor Competition\nAssaysThe predictions of the\nmechanism and site of action of the factors were accomplished using\na two-factor competition assay.9,32,33 This assay is based on a theory of steroid-mediated gene induction\nthat exploits the property that the dose\u2013response curve for\nthe amount of gene product as a function of the added steroid precisely\nfollows a Michaelis\u2013Menten (MM) function (see the Supporting Information). Mathematically, this\nis unexpected for the sequence of complex forming reactions that is\npresumed to exist in gene transcription. However, it has been shown\nthat if the individual reactions in the sequence each possess a MM\ninput\u2013output relationship, then the dose response of an arbitrarily\nlong sequence of events will have a MM dose\u2013response curve.32 Biochemically, this constraint can be satisfied\nif the formed complexes are short-lived. A formula for the dose\u2013response\ncurve can then also be explicitly computed. The action of the factors\nin the sequence can be classified in terms of activators and inhibitors\nas they are in enzyme kinetics. To avoid confusion with the commonly\nused terms coactivator and corepressors, we have adopted the terms\naccelerators and decelerators for enzymatic activators and inhibitors,\nrespectively.9 It should be noted that\nthe action of an accelerator or decelerator is with respect to only\nthe specific reaction in which it acts and does not pertain to its\nglobal effect on the final gene product. The advantage of this classification\nsystem is that the predicted mechanism is not context-dependent. In\nthe presence of two factors, a distinct formula (parametric statistical\nmodel) can be written down for each combination of factor type and\nlocation with respect to each other and a distinguished step, called\nthe concentration-limiting step (CLS). The CLS is the step in the\nsequence beyond which the concentration of bound factors is negligible\nwith respect to the free concentrations. Given that the experimental\nmeasurements are taken after the system has reached dynamic equilibrium,\nthere are no fluxes through the system but the CLS can be considered\nthe equilibrium analogue of a rate-limiting step. The CLS has been\nfound to be the invariant site of action of the reporter gene, acting\nas an accelerator, and thus is a marker in the reaction scheme of\nsteroid receptors about which all other factors can be organized.9,21The individual parametric models can be compared directly\nto the data to make predictions about the actions of the factors.\nThis task can be simplified because the formulas for the parametric\nmodels all have a fractional linear form and are thus completely specified\nby the potency (EC50) and maximal induced activity (Amax). Hence, instead of direct curve fitting,\ngraphical analyses of the behavior of combinations of EC50 and Amax will give equivalent predictions.\nA full description has been published.9,10,33 A flowchart is given as Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Briefly, the effect of\nfour concentrations of each of two factors (total of 16 combinations)\non the maximal induced activity (Amax)\nand EC50 is determined from directly fitting a Michaelis\u2013Menten\ncurve to the average (n = 3) value of induced luciferase\nactivity from transiently transfected reporter (GREtkLUC) with EtOH\nand three subsaturating concentrations of Dex (192 total samples).\nThe curve fitting for the dose\u2013response curves is extremely\ngood for a first-order Hill plot [R2 for\n368 randomly selected curves = 0.997 \u00b1 0.004 (standard deviation)].\nGraphs of 1/EC50 and Amax/EC50 (and EC50/Amax when\nthe plot of Amax/EC50 is decreasing)\nversus the concentration of one cofactor are constructed at each of\nthe concentrations of the second factor. In all cases, though, it\nis critical to make corrections if Western blots show that expression\nof the transiently transfected protein (at constant levels either\nof total cellular protein or of an internal standard, such as \u03b2-actin)\nis nonlinear. This is because the interpretation of the graphs is\npredicated on the x-axis being a linear scale. To\ndetermine the linear equivalent of the expressed plasmid, the nonlinear\nplot of OD versus the nanograms of transfected plasmid is first fit\nto a Michaelis\u2013Menten plot ofThe functional equivalent\nof the transfected plasmid that gives\na linear OD versus plasmid plot is then obtained from the formulaThe x-axis\nvalue of the amount of plasmid in the\nvarious graphs is then this \u201ccorrected plasmid\u201d value.\nThese same Western blots are used to determine the relative amount\nof endogenous factor (in units of nanograms of factor plasmid) when\ndealing with an accelerator. It is not necessary to quantitate the\nrelative amount of an endogenous factor that displays decelerator\nactivity. If an experiment used n concentrations\nfor each cofactor, then there would be a total of four to six graphs,\neach with n separate curves. The shape of the curves\nand how they change with the other cofactor are then compared to Table\nS1 of the Supporting Information to determine\nthe kinetically defined mechanism of action and site of action, relative\nto each other and to the CLS. Our Table S1 is an updated version of\nTable S1 of ref (33). Many of the entries in Table S1 of the Supporting\nInformation require an estimate of the intersection point of\na set of linear regression fits to the graphs. For a family of lines\nof the form y = a + bx, an unbiased estimate of the intersection can be obtained from \u201ca versus b plots\u201d, which are a linear\nregression on the graph of a versus b to give a new plot of the form a = y\u2032 + x\u2032b, where y\u2032 is the y-axis value of the intersection\npoint of the family of lines in the original graph and the negative\nvalue of x\u2032 corresponds to the x-axis value of the intersection point.Statistical AnalysisUnless otherwise noted, all experiments\nwere performed in triplicate multiple times. KaleidaGraph version\n3.5 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to determine a least-squares\nbest fit of the experimental data to the theoretical dose\u2013response\ncurve, which is given by the equation derived from Michaelis\u2013Menten\nkinetics of y = [free steroid]/[free steroid + dissociation\nconstant (Kd)] (where the concentration\nof total steroid is approximately equal to the concentration of free\nsteroid because only a small portion is bound), to yield a single\nEC50 value. The values of n independent\nexperiments were then analyzed for statistical significance by the\ntwo-tailed Student\u2019s t test using InStat version\n2.03 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The Mann\u2013Whitney\ntest or the Alternate Welch t test is used when the\ndifference between the standard deviations of two populations is statistically\nsignificant. The Bayesian Information Criterion was used to determine\nthe better of two types of fits for a particular graph (e.g., linear\nvs quadratic). ResultsApplication of the Competition\nAssay To Determine the Mechanism\nand Site of Cofactor ActionThe competition assay was selected\nto determine whether any one factor, assayed in combination with NELF-A\nor -B, affects the competitive decelerator activity of NELF-A or -B\nduring GR-regulated transactivation of an exogenous reporter (GREtkLUC)\nin transiently transfected U2OS cells. If the selected factor is found\nto reverse the actions of the NELF protein by acting at the same site\nas the NELF protein, we can propose that the activity of the factor\nin question directly counters the step inhibited by NELF. Conversely,\nif the factor is found to function before or after the site of NELF\naction, then that factor\u2019s actions cannot be the direct target\nof NELF even if the factor is able to reverse the inhibitory activity\nof NELF.The competition assay consists of determining the dose\u2013response\ncurves for dexamethasone (Dex) induction of GR-controlled expression\nof luciferase activity from a GREtkLUC reporter under all 16 possible\ncombinations of four concentrations of each of the two factors being\nexamined (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information for a flowchart). A series of graphs are constructed, as described\nin Experimental Procedures, and then matched\nwith the possible graphs in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information). Each graph in Table S1 is associated\nwith one or more mechanistic descriptions. After the mechanistic descriptions\nfrom all graphs for each factor have been compared, a single consistent\nmechanism is identified.9,10,21NELF-A and -B Act at Two Sites in GR-Regulated TransactivationThe NELF complex, composed of the four subunits NELF-A, -B, -C/D,\nand -E, plays a pivotal role in immobilizing RNA polymerase II shortly\nafter the start of transcription.11\u221216,19 NELF-A and -B are particularly\ninteresting because each protein has been found to act as a competitive\ndecelerator of GR transactivation at two sites before or at the CLS.21 Two forms of NELF-B (full length protein and\na chimera lacking the 30 C-terminal amino acids) were initially examined\nto eliminate the functional relevance of the C-terminal sequence.\nSubsequently, they were used interchangeably because they had identical\nproperties with two key components (GR and the reporter gene, GREtkLUC)\nin the mechanistically sensitive competition assay. At least one site\nof action appears to be independent of polymerase pausing.21The critical feature of two-site action\nis upward curving plots of EC50/Amax versus NELF. Panels A and B of Figure \u200bFigure11 reconfirm the identical behavior of chimeric (Figure \u200b(Figure1A)1A) and full length (Figure \u200b(Figure1B)1B) NELF-B. Plots of EC50/Amax versus NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure1C)1C) display the same\nupward curvature. The theory of the competition assay says that a\npolynomial fit of order \u201cn\u201d to these\nplots is diagnostic of a competitive decelerator acting at n sites before or at the CLS (abbreviated as = C at n sites \u2264 CLS) (see the Supporting\nInformation for a theoretical explanation). This was tested\ndirectly for panels B and C of Figure \u200bFigure1,1, which\nare averaged plots from four and six normalized experiments, respectively.\nBayesian Information Criterion analysis was used to determine the\ngoodness of fit of linear (data not shown) versus quadratic plots\nfor the data depicted in panels B and C of Figure \u200bFigure1.1. That plot with the lower score is to be preferred. Quadratic\nfits gave a much lower score than linear fits for both Figure \u200bFigure1B1B (32.7 vs 113.2) and Figure \u200bFigure1C1C (104 vs 1863). These results rigorously support the preference\nof quadratic versus linear fits, which is also indicated by the higher R2 value of quadratic versus linear fits for\nall three graphs of Figure \u200bFigure11 (data not shown).\nThus, the quadratic fits in Figure \u200bFigure11 are diagnostic\nof each factor acting as a C at 2 sites \u2264 CLS. A competitive\ndecelerator acting at only one site before or at the CLS gives a linear\nplot with a positive slope in graphs of EC50/Amax. Conversely, an accelerator gives a decreasing plot\nfor EC50/Amax, and an increasing\nplot for Amax/EC50, versus\nfactor.9,33 Factors acting at two sites are especially\nvaluable in mechanistic studies because the elimination of just one\nsite of action has to be selective and cannot result from general\ninactivation of the protein or reaction system.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Full length and chimeric\nNELF-B and full length NELF-A similarly\ninfluence GR transactivation by acting at two sites. Graphical analyses\nof competition assays with four amounts of chimeric NELF-B (A), full\nlength wild-type NELF-B (B), and NELF-A (C) plasmids each with four\nconcentrations of GREtkLUC were conducted in U2OS cells and a constant\namount of transfected GR plasmid as described in Experimental Procedures. Plots of EC50/Amax vs NELF were best fit with quadratic equations.\nSimilar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments\nfor chimeric NELF-B. Panels B (wild-type NELF-B) and C (NELF-A) are\naveraged data (\u00b1standard error of the mean) of four and six experiments,\nrespectively, after normalization to the LUC activity with the smallest\namount of GREtkLUC reporter and the largest amount of NELF plasmid.It should be realized that the\nactions of NELF-A and -B are additive\nand thus may be at different steps.21 Finally,\nwe note that the corrections for nonlinear expression of NELF-B in\nthe previously reported graphs21 do not\ncause the upward curvature because it is still evident in panels A\nand B of Figure \u200bFigure11 with NELF-B plasmid concentrations\nthat give linear protein expression.Cdk9 Augments NELF Inhibition\nof GR TransactivationCdk9 has been shown to cause the release\nof paused polymerase, apparently\nbecause of the phosphorylation of DSIF, the NELF complex, and pol\nII.16\u221219,26 In view of the activity of both\nNELF-A and NELF-B at two sites described above, we used the competition\nassay to ask if exogenous Cdk9 can inhibit or reverse the effects\nof either NELF protein at either step. Unexpectedly, the competition\nassay revealed that Cdk9 further reduced Amax in the absence or presence of exogenous NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A). This shows that Cdk9 augments, rather than attenuates,\nNELF-A inhibitory activity. This response is not due to some net decrease\nin the amount of Cdk9 because Western blots establish that the total\namount of Cdk9 protein increases with added Cdk9 plasmid (data not\nshown). Western blot analysis further revealed both that Cdk9 expression\nis linear up to 18\u201320 ng of Cdk9 plasmid (so that no correction\nis needed for nonlinear expression) and that endogenous Cdk9 in U2OS\ncells is equal to 9.0 \u00b1 2.6 ng (standard deviation; n = 2) of the Cdk9 plasmid. This last point is especially significant\nbecause it establishes that the effects of added Cdk9 in Figure \u200bFigure22 are seen with relatively small increases in total\nCdk9 protein (i.e., \u2264122% above endogenous Cdk9)Open in a separate windowFigure 2Cdk9 is a decelerator\nthat does not reverse the effects of NELF-A\nor NELF-B and is not inactivated by chemical inhibitors. (A\u2013G)\nCdk9 augments the inhibitory effects of NELF-A and NELF-B. Competition\nassays of Cdk9 with NELF-A (A\u2013E) or NELF-B (F and G) were performed\nwith the indicated amounts of Cdk9 and NELF plasmids. Graphs of Amax vs NELF-A (A) or NELF-B (F) illustrate the\nadditive effects of Cdk9 with each NELF. The other graphs were plotted\nas in Figure \u200bFigure1.1. Similar results were obtained\nin five additional independent experiments. (H\u2013K) Chemical\ninhibitors of Cdk9 do not block decelerator activity of Cdk9. Assays\nwere performed as described in the legend of Figure \u200bFigure11 with the indicated amounts of Cdk9 and DRB (H and I) or flavopiridol\n(J and K) and plotted as Amax/EC50 (H, I, and K) or 1/EC50 (J). The amount of GREtkLUC reporter\nwas 100 ng in all panels except for F and G, which used 30 ng. Similar\nresults were obtained in two to five additional independent experiments.The graphs of 1/EC50 versus Cdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure2B)2B) and Amax/EC50 versus\nCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure2C)2C) display the characteristic\nnonlinear declining curves, with a decreasing position in the presence\nof increasing NELF-A, that define Cdk9 as a competitive decelerator.\nThe linear graph of EC50/Amax versus Cdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure2D)2D) further specifies\nCdk9 actions as a C acting at one site \u2264 CLS. At the same time,\nthe quadratic fit for the graph of EC50/Amax versus NELF-A, with higher curve positions with increasing\namounts of NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure2E),2E), indicates that\nNELF-A continues to act as C at two sites \u2264 CLS. Similarly,\nCdk9 is active as C \u2264 CLS in competition assays without and\nwith added NELF-B, as shown by the nonlinear decreasing graphs of Amax (Figure \u200b(Figure2F),2F), 1/EC50 (data not shown), and Amax/EC50 (data not shown) and the increasing plots of EC50/Amax (data not shown) versus Cdk9. In\nthe presence of added Cdk9, the plots of EC50/Amax versus NELF-B have less curvature (Figure \u200b(Figure2G).2G). This indicates that Cdk9 has a stronger inhibitory\naction in the presence of NELF-B, thereby weakening the influence\nof NELF-B at one of its two sites of action.One restriction\nis that if Cdk9 acts as a C at the CLS (abbreviated\nas = C = CLS), then NELF-A (and NELF-B) must be a C before the CLS\n(abbreviated as = C < CLS) and vice versa. This is because two\nC\u2019s cannot act at precisely the same step.33 In either case, however, increased concentrations of Cdk9\ndo not act as an accelerator to reverse the competitive decelerator\neffects of NELF-A or NELF-B. Furthermore, Cdk9 exhibits unequal effects\nin the presence of NELF-A and NELF-B by being a stronger decelerator\nwith added NELF-B.Classical Inhibitors of Cdk9 Do Not Prevent\nthe Competitive\nDecelerator Activity of Cdk9To determine the biochemical\nmechanism of Cdk9 competitive decelerator action in panels A and F\nof Figure \u200bFigure2,2, we asked if Cdk9 action in U2OS\ncells could be blocked with either of two well-known inhibitors of\nCdk9 kinase activity: 5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole\n(DRB)38 and flavopiridol.39 Interestingly, DRB concentrations of \u226440 \u03bcM\nhave little to no effect on either Amax/EC50 versus DRB (Figure \u200b(Figure2H)2H) or\n1/EC50 versus DRB (data not shown), while higher concentrations\n(50\u2013150 \u03bcM) display the telltale nonlinear decreasing\ncurves in plots of 1/EC50 (data not shown) and Amax/EC50 versus DRB (Figure \u200b(Figure2I)2I) of a competitive decelerator.33 Thus, DRB does not prevent, but rather amplifies at high\nconcentrations, the effects of Cdk9 in this system. This may be due\nto the fact that DRB is known to have different targets in these two\nconcentration ranges: Cdk9 at \u223c3 \u03bcM DRB and TFIIH at\n\u223c30 \u03bcM DRB.40\u221242Flavopiridol is regarded\nas a more selective inhibitor of Cdk9 activity with an apparent IC50 of <1 \u03bcM.39 In our system,\nflavopiridol weakly decreases the maximal luciferase activity (data\nnot shown). At the same time, however, our analysis shows that flavopiridol\nacts as an accelerator (A) of some step after CLS in the concentration\nrange of 1\u201350 nM, as seen by the linear, positive slope plots\nof 1/EC50 and Amax/EC50 versus flavopiridol33 (Figure \u200b(Figure2J,K).2J,K). This is an example of the well-documented\nsituation in enzyme kinetics43,44 in which a factor can\ndecrease Amax and still be what we define\nas an accelerator.9 Further analysis of\nthe other graphical plots yields the consistent conclusion that flavopiridol\nis an accelerator after the CLS and Cdk9 is a competitor before flavopiridol.\nThis last conclusion indicates that even though flavopiridol has been\nshown to bind tightly to, and inactivate, Cdk9,39 its action in our system occurs after those of Cdk9. Therefore,\nflavopiridol\u2019s ability to reduce the effects of Cdk9 cannot\nresult from inactivating Cdk9 kinase activity and must reflect interactions\nwith either a different function of Cdk9 or some other unidentified\ntarget. Interestingly, at concentrations of >40 nM, flavopiridol\nreverses\nits effects to act as a competitive decelerator and augment Cdk9 activity\n(data not shown). Collectively, the results with DRB and flavopiridol\nsuggest that the inhibitory effects of Cdk9 are, unexpectedly, independent\nof Cdk9 kinase activity.Mutant Cdk9 Retains Competitive Decelerator\nActivityInterpretations based on chemical inhibitors can\nbe misleading because\nof frequent side effects. A potentially more selective probe of how\nCdk9 increases NELF-A and -B activities is a point mutation that prevents\nCdk9 kinase activity. HA-tagged D167N Cdk9 is a dominant negative\nmutant.45 We confirmed that this mutant\n(dnCdk9) has negligible kinase activity in a whole cell assay of serine\n2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by Cdk9 with or without dnCdk9\n(data not shown). Surprisingly, in a competition assay with NELF-A,\ngraphs of Amax versus dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure3A)3A) suggest that dnCdk9 is just as active as a competitive\ndecelerator as wt Cdk9 (cf., Figure \u200bFigure2A).2A). Similar\nresults were observed with dnCdk9 in competition assays with NELF-B\n(data not shown).Open in a separate windowFigure 3Dominant negative kinase-dead Cdk9 has activity identical\nto that\nof wt Cdk9. (A) dnCdk9 augments the inhibitory effects of NELF-A.\nCompetition assays with the indicated amounts of dnCdk9 and NELF-A\nplasmids were performed and plotted as in Figure \u200bFigure1.1. Similar results were obtained in four additional independent\nexperiments. (B and C) Competition assays were performed as in Figure \u200bFigure11 with 0, 3, 6, and 10 ng each of wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9\nplasmids and a constant amount of GR (0.5 ng) and GREtkLUC (100 ng)\nplasmids. After adjustment for the 3-fold higher level of protein\nexpression of dnCdk9 compared to that of wt Cdk9, plots of Amax/EC50 (A) and EC50/Amax (B) vs the combined amounts of wt and dnCdk9\nwere constructed as described in the text. Similar results were obtained\nin a second independent experiment.A competition assay of dnCdk9 versus wt Cdk9 was then performed\nto determine whether the dnCdk9 would reduce the competitive decelerator\nactivity of wt Cdk9 in GR induction of the luciferase enzyme from\nthe GREtkLUC reporter. Again, both dnCdk9 and wt Cdk9 appear to have\nidentical activities (data not shown). A stringent test of this conclusion\nis to see if the activities are additive. Western blot analysis revealed\nthat wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 are linearly expressed up to at least 20 ng\nof transfected plasmid and that the expression level of dnCdk9 is\n\u223c3-fold higher than that of wt Cdk9 (data not shown). Therefore,\nwe calculated the total relative amount of expressed Cdk9 as wt Cdk9\n+ 3 \u00d7 dnCdk9 and plotted Amax/EC50 versus the total expressed Cdk9. As shown in Figure \u200bFigure3B,3B, a single well-behaved nonlinear decreasing plot\nis obtained, indicating that the combined wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 species\nare acting as a single, uniformly active competitive decelerator.To determine where the combined Cdk9 species are acting, the data\nwere replotted as EC50/Amax versus total expressed Cdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure3C).\nThe3C).\nThe resulting linear plot is diagnostic of the combined population\nof wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 acting in concert as competitive decelerators\nbefore or at the CLS.33 Similar results\nwere observed in 293 cells (data not shown). Therefore, the ability\nof wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 to display identical activities is not limited\nto U2OS cells. These data support and extend the conclusion described\nabove that the competitive decelerator activity of Cdk9 on GR transactivation\nis independent of Cdk9 kinase activity.Mutant Cdk9s Retain the\nAbility To Augment NELF-A ActionsWhile Figure \u200bFigure33 indicates that dnCdk9 has\nwild-type activity with regard to the inhibition of GR transactivation,\nit was not evident whether dnCdk9 would also have wild-type activity\nwith the NELFs when the other types of competition assay plots are\nexamined. Therefore, we next asked if dnCdk9 could also increase the\ndecelerator activity of NELF-A. Using amounts of dnCdk9 and NELF-A\nthat are in the linear range of expression, the behavior with added\ndnCdk9 is indistinguishable from that with wt Cdk9 (data not shown).\nMost importantly, plots of EC50/Amax versus NELF-A with increasing dnCdk9 retain the same upward\ncurvature with dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4A)4A) that is seen\nwith wt Cdk9 in Figure \u200bFigure2E.2E. This shows that\nNELF-A still acts as C at two sites before or at the CLS with dnCdk9,\njust as is seen with wt Cdk9. Identical experiments were performed\nin human 293 cells to determine the generality of this response. Panels\nB and C of Figure \u200bFigure44 show that there is no significant\ndifference in the activities of wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 with NELF-A in\n293 cells. Thus, the ability of NELF-A to act as a C at two sites\nbefore or at the CLS in competition assays with Cdk9 and the ability\nof Cdk9 to act as C before or at the CLS are independent both of the\nkinase activity of Cdk9 and of the cells used.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Kinase-defective Cdk9\nmutants retain activity of wt Cdk9 with NELF-A\nand NELF-B in different cells. Competition assays were performed and\nplotted as in Figure \u200bFigure11 with the indicated amounts\nof dnCdk9 and NELF-A plasmids in U2OS cells (A) or 293 cells (B and\nC), with AcMtCdk9 and NELF-A plasmids in U2OS cells (D), with NELF-B\nin U2OS cells with dnCdk9 (E) or AcMtCdk9 (F), and with NELF-B in\n293 cells with wt Cdk9 (G) or dnCdk9 (H). The amount of reporter plasmid\nwas always 100 ng. The amount of GR plasmid used was 0.5 ng in U2OS\ncells and 5 ng in 293 cells. The range of linear expression of wt\nCdk9 (\u226440 ng), dnCdk9 (\u226420 ng), and NELF-B (\u226420\nng) is higher in 293 than in U2OS cells (data not shown). Similar\nresults were obtained in one to four additional independent experiments\nexcept for that for NELF-B with AcMtCdk9 in U2OS cells (F), which\nwas performed only once.To further test this equivalence of wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9, we\nexamined\nanother Cdk9 mutant that cannot be acetylated at the position needed\nto yield the activated kinase, i.e., K44/48R Cdk9 (or AcMtCdk9).46 Just as with wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9, the graph of\nEC50/Amax versus NELF-A with\nincreasing AcMtCdk9 displays the same progressively greater upward\ncurvature as with wt Cdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4D),4D), which\nis diagnostic of NELF-A again acting as C at two sites \u2264 CLS.\nThus, two different kinase-deficient mutants of Cdk9 possess the same\nactivities in U2OS cells as wt Cdk9 with NELF-A.Mutant Cdk9s\nRetain the Ability To Augment NELF-B ActionsAs seen above\nin Figure \u200bFigure2G,2G, NELF-B works\npredominantly at one site as a C \u2264 CLS in U2OS cells in the\npresence of additional wt Cdk9. This contrasts with NELF-A, which\nstill acts as C at two sites \u2264 CLS in the absence or presence\nof exogenous Cdk9 (see Figure \u200bFigure2E).2E). We therefore\nasked whether the action of NELF-B at the second site \u2264 CLS\nmight be restored, or the one site of action eliminated, in the presence\nof either the dnCdk9 or AcMtCdk9. Interestingly, as determined by\nthe linear plots of EC50/Amax versus NELF-B with added Cdk9, NELF-B still appears to function\nas C at just one site \u2264 CLS because of the stronger decelerator\nactivity of both dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4E)4E) and AcMtCdk9\n(Figure \u200b(Figure4F)4F) in the presence of NELF-B. These\nsame graphs, and others not shown, identify the actions of dnCdk9\nand AcMtCdk9 as C \u2264 CLS. Thus, as for NELF-A, the two kinase-defective\nCdk9 mutants evoke the same increasingly pronounced responses with\nNELF-B as seen with wt Cdk9. This is further evidence that the effects\nof added Cdk9 are independent of Cdk9 kinase activity.Actions of\nNELF-B Are Cell Line-Dependent but Still Independent\nof Cdk9 Kinase ActivityIn marked contrast with the nearly\nlinear plots of EC50/Amax versus\nNELF-B with added Cdk9 in U2OS cells (Figure \u200b(Figure2G),2G), the same plots for 293 cells are now curved upward (Figure \u200b(Figure4G).4G). However, this difference may be simply a matter\nboth of NELF-B protein being expressed \u223c9-fold more efficiently\nin 293 cells and of using more NELF-B plasmid in 293 cells, thereby\nmaking the curvature more evident. Nevertheless, this upward curvature\nin plots of EC50/Amax versus\nNELF-B, which is unique for a factor acting as C at two sites \u2264\nCLS, is retained in dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4H).4H). Thus,\nonce again, the actions of Cdk9 are independent of its kinase activity.Mutation of the NELF Domain Has Equal Effects on Activity with\nwt Cdk9 and dnCdk9Earlier studies identified a \u201cNELF\ndomain\u201d that is shared by all four subunits of the NELF complex\nand is required for full competitive decelerator activity of both\nNELF-A and NELF-B at two sites in competition assays with GR and GREtkLUC.21 Similarly, the graphs of EC50/Amax that are quadratic and upward curving for\nwt NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure2E)2E) change to what is generally\nbest fit by linear plots for the 4mtNELF-A mutant, in which four residues\nin the NELF domain of NELF-A have been changed to alanine (Figure \u200b(Figure5A).5A). The linear fits of EC50/Amax mean that the actions of 4mtNELF-A with varying wt\nCdk9 are predominantly that of a C acting at one site before or at\nthe CLS. Thus, as with varying levels of GR and GREtkLUC,21 the mutations of the NELF domain have also eliminated\nmost of the ability of NELF-A to act at one of the two sites before\nor at the CLS in the presence of added wt Cdk9. The nonlinear decreasing\ngraphs of 1/EC50 versus both 4mtNELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure5B)5B) and wt NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure5C)5C) approach a flat plot with large amounts of NELF-A. The underlying\nequations of the competition assay specifically ascribe this particular\ngraphical behavior to a defined relative ordering of two competitive\ndecelerators that are both initially characterized as acting before\nor at the CLS. More specifically, it means that the single site of\naction for 4mtNELF-A and the two sites of action with wt NELF-A are\nstill after wt Cdk9.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Wild-type and mutant NELF-A and -B activities are not\naltered by\nmutations that destroy Ckd9 kinase activity. Competition assays were\nperformed with 0.3 or 0.5 ng of GR plasmid and 30 ng of GREtkLUC,\nand the results are plotted as in Figure \u200bFigure11 with\nthe indicated amounts of wt Cdk9 and 4mtNELF-A (A and B) or wt NELF-A\n(C) plasmids or dnCdk9 and 4mtNELF-A (D and E) or wt NELF-A (F) plasmids,\nin U2OS cells. Similar results were obtained from five to eight independent\nexperiments. (G and H) 4mtNELF-B has reduced potency, relative to\nthat of wt NELF-B, in competition assays with dnCdk9. Competition\nassays were performed with 0.5 or 5 ng of GR plasmid and 100 ng of\nGREtkLUC, and Amax/EC50 vs\nNELF-B was plotted as in Figure \u200bFigure11 with the\nindicated amounts of wt Cdk9 and wt NELF-A (G) or 4mtNELF-A (H) plasmids.\nThe gray bar with the extending line represents the standard error\nof the mean and average amount of plasmid required for half-maximal\nreduction of Amax/EC50 from\nsix experiments. To compensate for the 2.09-fold more efficient expression\nof 4mtNELF-B protein, compared to that of wt NELF-B [as determined\nby Western blots (not shown)], the x-axis values\nof panel H should be multiplied by 2.09. Similar results were obtained\nfrom five additional independent experiments.The activities of 4mtNELF-A and wt NELF-A with the dnCdk9\nmutant\nare very similar to those with wt Cdk9. The graph of EC50/Amax versus NELF-A again changes from\na quadratic plot with wt NELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure4A)\nto4A)\nto a linear graph with 4mtNELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure5D),\nindicating5D),\nindicating that 4mtNELF-A also functions with added dnCdk9 at only\none site as a C before or at the CLS. The graphs of 1/EC50 versus both 4mtNELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure5E)5E) and wt\nNELF-A (Figure \u200b(Figure5F),5F), like those of panels B\nand C of Figure \u200bFigure55 with wt Cdk9, become flatter\nwith increasing dnCdk9, which places dnCdk9 action before both 4mtNELF-A\nand wt NELF-A. We therefore conclude that the loss of Cdk9 kinase\nactivity in dnCdk9 does not alter the actions of either wt NELF-A\nor 4mtNELF-A from what they are with wt Cdk9.We next compared\nthe actions of wt NELF-B and 4mtNELF-B with wt\nCdk9 vs dnCdk9. No difference was observed between wt NELF-B and 4mtNELF-B\nwith wt Cdk9. As with wt NELF-B (Figure \u200b(Figure2G),\nthe2G),\nthe graphs of EC50/Amax versus\n4mtNELF-B with increasing wt Cdk9 are fit well by linear plots (data\nnot shown) that define a C acting at one site before or at the CLS.\nThe increasingly flat plots of 1/EC50 versus NELF-B again\nindicate that Cdk9 is a C acting before NELF-B (data not shown). However,\ngraphs of Amax/EC50 (Figure \u200b(Figure5G,H)5G,H) illustrate that wt NELF-B and 4mtNELF-B do\ndisplay quantitatively different abilities to reduce Amax/EC50. After correction has been made for\nthe 2.1-fold more efficient expression of 4mtNELF-B (data not shown),\nin which case 4 ng of 4mtNELF-B in Figure \u200bFigure5H5H corresponds to 8.4 ng of wt NELF-B plasmid, 4mtNELF-B is seen to\nbe 1.9 \u00b1 0.5-fold (standard error of the mean; n = 23; P = 0.0003) less potent than wt NELF-B with\ndifferent concentrations of dnCdk9. Thus, again with mutants of NELF-A\nand -B, the kinetically defined mechanism and site of action are relatively\ninsensitive to whether Ckd9 possesses kinase activity. These results\nargue strongly that Cdk9 has some new, yet undefined, kinase-independent\naction in GR-regulated gene induction.Cdk9 Acts after GR and\nbefore or at the Site of Reporter ActionIn an effort to\ndefine further the novel actions of Cdk9 described\nabove, we performed a competition assay with wt Cdk9 and the reporter\nGREtkLUC in U2OS cells. In all of the combinations of factors that\nwe have examined to date, GREtkLUC always acts as an accelerator (A)\n= CLS.9 Similarly, in competition with\nCdk9, the average slope (0.00192 \u00b1 0.00428, standard deviation; n = 24) in graphs of 1/EC50 versus GREtkLUC (Figure \u200b(Figure6A),6A), with curve position decreasing with added Cdk9,\nindicates that GREtkLUC again acts as A = CLS while Cdk9 = C. The\nlinear plots of EC50/Amax versus\nCdk9, with decreasing position for increasing GREtkLUC (Figure \u200b(Figure6B),6B), are diagnostic of Cdk9 = C at one site \u2264\nCLS. These graphs, together with the others in the analysis of the\ndata,33 uniquely determine that GREtkLUC\n= A = CLS and Cdk9 = C \u2264 CLS.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Cdk9 is a competitive decelerator acting\nafter the site of action\nof GR and before that of the reporter gene. Competition assays with\nthe indicated amounts of (A and B) Cdk9 and GREtkLUC reporter, (C)\nCdk9 and GR, and (D) dnCdk9 and GR plasmids were performed in U2OS\ncells and the results plotted as in Figure \u200bFigure1.1. Similar results were obtained in five additional (for A and B)\nand two additional (for C and D) independent experiments.To further restrict the site of action of Cdk9,\nwe allowed Cdk9\nto compete with GR, which is known to act before the CLS.9,21 The defining graph here is 1/EC50 versus GR. It shows\nan intersection point that is slightly more negative than that without\nadded GR, which corresponds to no GR when one subtracts the small\namount of endogenous GR in U2OS cells (Figure \u200b(Figure6C).6C). This behavior, in conjunction with the other graphs (data not\nshown), places the site of Cdk9 action as being after GR.33 Similar results and conclusions were obtained\nfor GR versus dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure6D).6D). We therefore\nconclude that wt Cdk9 and dnCdk9 both act as C \u2264 CLS and after\nGR.Cdk9 Acts before ELLELL, like Cdk9, is a component\nof the super-elongation complexes, which is associated with the release\nof paused polymerases.15,16,20 This suggested that ELL might antagonize the inhibitory actions\nof Cdk9 in our assay, even though, in different systems (RC.SV3 and\nCos1 cells), ELL was reported to decrease the level of GR transactivation\nby an undetermined mechanism.25 We therefore\ntested this hypothesis by allowing ELL to compete with Cdk9. The graphs\nof EC50/Amax versus ELL (Figure \u200b(Figure7A)7A) are linear with increasing position as more Cdk9\nis transfected. The plots of EC50/Amax versus Cdk9 and EC50/Amax versus ELL are almost identical (data not shown), from\nwhich we can conclude that both ELL and Cdk9 are C at one site \u2264\nCLS. The graphs of 1/EC50, however, are different, with\nthat versus ELL being especially informative (Figure \u200b(Figure7B7B and data not shown). As mentioned above, the mathematics\ndescribing nonlinear decreasing curves that become flat, but continue\nto shift to a lower position, at higher levels of Cdk9 uniquely describes\nCdk9 acting before ELL, with both manifesting their actions \u2264\nCLS. The identical behavior is observed in competition assays of ELL\nwith dnCdk9 (Figure \u200b(Figure7C,D).7C,D). Thus, both the mode\nand position of action of Cdk9 relative to ELL are preserved regardless\nof whether Cdk9 kinase activity is retained.Open in a separate windowFigure 7Competitive decelerator\nactivity of ELL that is augmented by Cdk9\nin a manner independent of Cdk9 kinase activity and reversed by accelerators.\nCompetition assays with 0.5 or 1 ng of GR plasmid, 100 ng of GREtkLUC,\nand the indicated amounts of (A and B) Cdk9 and ELL, (C and D) dnCdk9\nand ELL, (E and F) CBP and ELL, and (G and H) TIF2 and ELL plasmids\nwere performed in U2OS cells and the results plotted as in Figure \u200bFigure1.1. Wild-type Cdk9, dnCdk9, and ELL are linearly expressed\nwith up to 20 ng of transfected plasmid; CBP is linearly expressed\nwith up to 80 ng of plasmid, so no corrections are needed. TIF2 expression\nis corrected as described in the text. Similar results were obtained\nin five (A and B), two (C and D), one (E and F), and three (G and\nH) additional independent experiments.ELL Acts before CBP and TIF2The mechanism of ELL action\nwas further probed in competition assays with two accelerators: CBP9 and TIF2.33 The competition\nassays of ELL versus CBP involved eight concentrations of ELL and\ntwo concentrations of CBP, instead of the usual 4 \u00d7 4 setup,\nbecause of the relatively small changes in EC50 with added\nELL under these conditions. Two plots were particularly revealing.\nThe plot of EC50/Amax versus\nELL (Figure \u200b(Figure7E)7E) displays the linear plots with\ndecreasing slope in the presence of added CBP that is diagnostic of\nELL being a competitive decelerator before or at the CLS with CBP\nbeing an accelerator. The plot of 1/EC50 versus ELL (Figure \u200b(Figure7F)7F) shows decreasing curves that increase in position\nwith more CBP and for which the shape of the curve does not become\nsignificantly flatter with no added CBP. In conjunction with the results\ndepicted in Figure \u200bFigure7E,7E, the interpretation of\nFigure \u200bFigure7F7F is limited to ELL being a competitive\ndecelerator before or at the CLS while CBP is an accelerator after\nthe CLS. All of the other graphs (not shown) are compatible with this\nconclusion.We next examined the competition of ELL with the\naccelerator TIF2.10,21,32,33 A critical graph is EC50/Amax versus ELL (Figure \u200b(Figure7G),7G), which shows the linear plots with decreasing slopes that are\ndiagnostic of ELL acting as C \u2264 CLS and TIF2 = A. The behavior\nof ELL is confirmed, and that of TIF2 specified, by the linear plot\nof Amax/EC50 versus TIF2 (Figure \u200b(Figure7H).7H). The average intersection point of all of the\nlines is x = \u221220.8 \u00b1 7.3 ng of TIF2 plasmid\nand y = \u221210.7 \u00b1 6.6 (standard deviation; n = 4). This point is very close to y =\n0, in view of the range of y values for the various\npoints, and much more negative than x = \u22121.17,\nwhich corresponds to the point at which the level of endogenous TIF2\n[determined from Western blots to be equivalent to 1.17 \u00b1 0.31\nng (standard deviation; n = 3) of TIF2 plasmid] would\nbe equal to zero. These characteristics of Figure \u200bFigure7H7H define TIF2 = A > CLS and ELL = C \u2264 CLS. The other\ngraphs (data not shown) are entirely consistent with this interpretation. DiscussionThis report describes the use of a recently developed\ncompetition\nassay9,10,21,33 to uncover novel activities in GR-regulated gene\ninduction of two cofactors known to participate in the early stages\nof gene transcription: Cdk9 and ELL. Cdk9 is widely considered to\nrelease pol II from the paused state, caused in part by the NELF and\nDSIF complexes, by phosphorylating the CTD of RNA pol II and the NELF\nand DSIF complexes.16,26 ELL is a constituent of the super-elongation\ncomplexes that assist in the release of paused polymerases.15,16,20 Thus, additional Cdk9 and ELL\nwere predicted to facilitate GR transactivation and antagonize the\neffects of NELF. Unexpectedly, both Cdk9 and ELL are found to be competitive\ndecelerators of GR transactivation activity and do not interfere with\nthe inhibitory activity of NELF-A and NELF-B. Exhaustive analysis\nof the kinetically defined activity, and site of action, of ELL and\nespecially Cdk9 yields the internally consistent results that both\nfactors are competitive decelerators acting at one site, with Cdk9\nacting before ELL, which acts before or at the CLS. Cdk9 actions in\nthese assays appear to be atypical because they are independent of\nCdk9 kinase activity, as shown by equivalent effects by two Cdk9 mutants\n(dnCdk9 and AcMtCdk9) with little or no kinase activity and the inability\nto be directly antagonized by two classical inhibitors of Cdk9 kinase\nactivity: DRB and flavopiridol. Low concentrations (\u226440 \u03bcM)\nof DRB that are reported to inactivate Cdk9 kinase activity40\u221242 were essentially inactive. Flavopiridol inactivates Cdk9 kinase\nactivity by forming an essentially irreversible complex with Cdk9.39 Flavopiridol can reverse the effects of Cdk9\nin our system but does so downstream of Cdk9, in which case it cannot\nbe exerting the observed effects via a covalent complex with Cdk9.\nTherefore, it is not known if the ability of flavopiridol to counter\nthe effects of Cdk9 reflects the different activity of Cdk9 in our\nsystem, which flavopiridol is preventing at a downstream site, or\nan activity of flavopiridol that is unrelated to Cdk9. Finally, the\nsame responses to wt and mutant Cdk9s are seen in two different cell\nlines in the presence of a variety of other factors. We therefore\nconclude that these new activities of Cdk9 are not restricted to a\nunique cell line or combination of cofactors.The analysis of\ncompetition assays of Cdk9, ELL, and several other\nfactors establishes the following ordered sequence of where each factor\nacts during the overall reaction sequence: GR < Cdk9 < ELL,\nNELF-A, and NELF-B \u2264 GREtkLUC < TIF2 and CBP. This ability\nto order the site of factor action is unique and provides the beginnings\nof a previously unavailable logical framework for manipulating GR\ntransaction outcomes under physiologically relevant conditions. Particularly\nattractive in the clinical setting is the prospect that modifying\nsteps far downstream of GR and reporter action will have fewer side\neffects. This is because there would be fewer branch points from a\nfar downstream step, and a reduced number of subsequent steps, that\ncould further influence the final outcome. Such a reduction of side\neffects is the holy grail of steroid endocrinologists47 and would greatly increase the number of clinical applications\nof glucocorticoid therapies.Complete validation of the conclusions\ndescribed above, and our\napproach in general, will require knowledge of all of the steps in\nsteroid-regulated gene expression followed by careful examination\nof how a specific factor alters the rate or frequency of the affected\nstep. While such confirmation is theoretically possible, the required\nknowledge of each reaction step does not currently exist. In the meantime,\nthe internally consistent mechanistic conclusions that are accumulating\nfor various factors under different experimental conditions9,10,21,32,33,48 provide a\nless rigorous cross-check on the legitimacy of the competition assay\nand its underlying theory.We have recently presented evidence\nthat NELF-A and NELF-B each\nact at two sites to repress GR transactivation. We concluded that\nat least one action of each protein is independent of the NELF complex\nand depends upon the integrity of a \u201cNELF domain\u201d for\nfull activity at both sites.21 However,\nthe second site of action of NELF-A and/or -B could proceed via the\nNELF complex. In this case, we would expect Cdk9 to inhibit some of\nthe activity of one or both NELF proteins. Instead, we find that Cdk9\nincreases the inhibitory activity of both NELF-A and -B (Figure \u200b(Figure2A,F).2A,F). This argues that neither site of action of\nNELF-A or -B involves the NELF complex. Because Cdk9 and ELL augment\nthese new, NELF complex-independent activities of NELF-A and -B, we\nconclude that the effects of Cdk9 and ELL presented here are also\nindependent of the NELF complex. In fact, polymerase pausing has not\nbeen observed under the conditions used here for a reporter that is\nwithout chromatin structure and introns49\u221251 and does not require\nsynchronized expression during development and differentiation.52 Thus, these conditions would facilitate the\nobservation of new activities with Cdk9 and ELL.The activities\nthat we see result from relatively low levels of\noverexpression that do not appear to saturate the system. The amounts\nof Cdk9 plasmid used typically cause a no more than 2.2-fold increase\nin total cellular Cdk9 protein after 48 h with wt Cdk9 plasmid and\nno more than 3-fold with dnCdk9 plasmid (data not shown). The average\nfold increase for the other factors was only 8.5 \u00b1 4.5 (standard\ndeviation; n = 6 factors). This does not include\nNELF-B because the commercially available antibody did not recognize\nthe endogenous protein. We cannot eliminate the possibility that endogenous\nfactor levels are already maximal and any added factor results in\nsquelching. For example, HEXIM1 both forms a complex with 7SK small\nnuclear RNA and P-TEFb and binds by itself to GR to inhibit GR transactivation.53 Elevated levels of Cdk9, and maybe even dnCdk9,\ncould sequester free HEXIM1, but this should cause an increase in\nthe level of GR transactivation, in contrast to the observed decrease\nin panels A and F of Figure \u200bFigure22 and panel A of\nFigure \u200bFigure3.3. Furthermore, the fact that well-behaved\nplots for each factor are obtained over the entire range of concentrations,\nincluding very low levels of transfected factor plasmid, is consistent\nwith the added factors simply increasing the strength of the response\nof the endogenous factor. Cdk9, as part of P-TEFb, is known to bind\nligand-bound estrogen receptor \u03b1 and is required for estrogen\nreceptor \u03b1-dependent transcriptional elongation of the Myb proto-oncogene.29 This behavior is diametrically opposed to what\nwe see for the effect of Cdk9 on GR transactivation. Ckd9 has also\nbeen observed to enhance androgen receptor transactivation by phosphorylating\nthe receptor protein.30,31 A similar mechanism cannot be\noperative in our experiments with GR because Cdk9 is inhibitory and\ntwo kinase-defective Cdk9 mutants are still active. Thus, the activities\nof Cdk9 with GR appear to be unique and are clearly independent of\nthe kinase activity associated with most of the actions of Cdk9.Cdk9 is best known for its kinase activity. However, other activities\nof Cdk9 have been reported. Cdk9 represses B-Myb transactivation activity\nin a manner that is independent of Cdk9 kinase activity. This response\nappeared to be due to a direct interaction of Cdk9 alone with the\ncarboxyl terminus of the B-Myb protein. The authors speculated that\nsimilar binding could negatively regulate other transcription factors.27 If such a mechanism is operative in our system,\nit could explain why the Cdk9 inhibitors DRB and flavopiridol do not\nhave the expected effects. Alternatively, the inactivity of DRB and\nflavopiridol may be attributed to the intronless reporter gene, GREtkLUC,\nused in our study. CDK9 inhibitors drastically affect the elongation\nof transcription of the \u03b2-actin gene but have little effect\non the transcription of short intronless genes, such as the U2 snRNA\ngenes.54 Finally, although Cdk9 is present\nin the P-TEFb complex that travels with elongating pol II, its CTD\nkinase activity is no longer required once the pol II complex is released\nfrom the pause site.28 It will be interesting\nto see whether future studies identify the new activity of Cdk9 of\nour study as being the same or different from any of the previously\nreported mechanisms.Reports that ELL, in addition to its role\nin the super-elongation\ncomplex, has different effects on various steroid receptors argue\nagainst a common role in gene transcription. ELL induces an increase\nin mineralocorticoid basal activity in a manner that requires the\nN-terminal AF-1b domain, but not AF-1a or ligand binding domain, of\nmineralocorticoid receptors. This response is receptor specific, though,\nbecause ELL has no effect on androgen receptor or progesterone receptor\nactivity and decreased the level of GR transactivation while binding\nto GR.25 Also, the N-terminus of ELL is\nthought to have inhibitor activity for pol II.55 Therefore, excess ELL could form premature complexes with\npol II prior to entering the preinitiation complex, which could disrupt\nassembly.It is important to realize that the results from the\ncompetition\nassays do not include any information about the binding site or biochemical\nactivity of the factor. Only the site of biological activity is identified,\nand this need not be the same as the binding site. One alternative\nwould be that the factor initiates a sequence of \u201cside\u201d\nreactions that produces a \u201cproduct\u201d that participates\nin the main transcription sequence. This is allowable in the theory\nbehind the competition assay as long as the dose response between\nthe factor and product of the side reaction has a Hill plot coefficient n equal to 1. For example, cofactors that cause acetylation\nor methylation of nucleosomal histones are thought to be influential\nin gene transcription. However, it is highly probable that the act\nof acetylation or methylation is not the \u201caction\u201d, as\ndefined by our model,33 of these cofactors\nthat alters gene transactivation. Instead, the ability of the modified\nhistones to interact with or recruit other proteins is thought to\nbe the first of several additional biochemical steps (not yet defined),\nof which one is where the cofactor actually \u201cexpresses\u201d\nits activity in a currently unknown manner. In this respect, the site\nof cofactor action will be several steps downstream from the site\nof cofactor binding, and the cofactor may act in either a \u201ccis\u201d or \u201ctrans\u201d mode.It should be noted that the positioning of GR, TIF2, and CBP relative\nto GREtkLUC, which acts at the CLS, is the same as seen previously\nunder different conditions.9,10,33 This observation thus again raises the useful mechanistic hypothesis\nthat the sites of action of numerous cofactors in GR-regulated gene\ninduction may be constant under a variety of conditions.9,10,33In summary, our competition\nassay has unveiled new activities of\nCdk9 and ELL. This is possible because of two features of the assay.\nFirst, it involves transiently transfected reporter genes, the responses\nof which are easier to interpret because of their usually more robust\nand reproducible responses. While the utility of exogenous reporters\nhas been questioned because of the lack of chromosomal structure,49 this does not appear to a major issue for GR-regulated\ngene induction. From 80 to 95% of endogenous GR-regulated genes already\nhave an open chromatin conformation,56\u221258 and the kinetically\ndefined actions of several transcription factors are found to be the\nsame in GR induction of exogenous and endogenous genes.10,21,33 Second, virtually all studies\nof cofactor action look only at the total activity, or Amax. When one includes the EC50, dramatically\nmore and usually novel information becomes available.32,33,59 We suspect that incorporating\nboth Amax and EC50 into studies\nof steroid hormone action, not to mention gene transcription in general,\nwill reveal a wealth of new, physiologically relevant information\nsuch as that included in this study.
