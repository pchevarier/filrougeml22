The evolutionary conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways transduce a large variety of external signals, leading to a wide range of cellular responses, one of which is the innate immune response to infection. The three parallel MAPKs cascades, the JNK, p38, and ERK cascades, contribute to subsequent inflammatory and innate immune responses by regulating the expression of numerous effector genes at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels (Yang et\u00a0al, 2003). Therefore, to counteract host immunity, pathogenic bacteria have evolved virulence strategies that intercept the MAPK signaling, mostly by injecting virulence effector proteins through their type III secretion system (T3SS) into the host cell (Shan et\u00a0al, 2007). In an earlier study, we showed the Shigella bacterial species, a causal agent of bacillary dysentery in humans, delivered the T3SS virulence effector OspF in host epithelial cells, to directly inactivate both ERK and p38 MAPK signaling in the nucleus of infected cells (Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007). OspF inactivates MAPKs through a phosphothreonine lyase activity (Li et\u00a0al, 2007) and therefore belongs to a small family of bacterial effectors harboring phosphothreonine lyase activity like SpvC from Salmonella and HopAI1 from Pseudomonas syringae (Zhang et\u00a0al, 2007; Mazurkiewicz et\u00a0al, 2008). This phosphothreonine lyase activity irreversibly inactivates the dual-phosphorylated host MAPKs (pT-X-pY) through beta elimination of the phosphate group, converting the phosphothreonine residue required for MAPK activity into a dehydrobutyrine (Dhb). The newly formed Dhb residue is irreversibly dephosphorylated because of the missing OH group (for review, Brennan & Barford, 2009). We previously showed that bacterially injected OspF principally located to the nucleus of infected cells to inactivate MAPK nuclear signaling, thereby causing a transcriptional repression of a limited number of host immune genes (Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007). From microarray analysis, we identified a narrow set of OspF target genes encompassing the immediate-early genes and some NF-\u03baB responsive genes, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that OspF precisely blocks nuclear MAPK induced histone H3 phosphorylation at the promoter of its target immunes genes. Therefore, OspF acts as an epigenetic regulator reprogramming the host transcriptional response by irreversibly inactivating nuclear MAPKs, which results in an immunosuppressive environment favorable for the bacterium life at the mucosal surface.Regulation of transcription involves post-translational histone modifications controlling the recruitment of epigenetic regulators, among which are the Heterochromatin Protein 1 family members (HP1\u03b1, HP1\u03b2 and HP1\u03b3 in humans) that specifically recognize and bind histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 through their \u201chistone reader domain\u201d called the chromodomain. Although initial studies revealed a key role for HP1 proteins in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, recent progress has shed light on a positive role for HP1 in euchromatic gene expression. As a matter of fact, the HP1\u03b3 isoform plays an unexpected role in active transcription on a large range of promoters (for review, Kwon & Workman, 2011). For example, on the HIV1 LTR and the survivin promoter, HP1\u03b3 is most abundant after activation of transcription at a time when HP1\u03b1 and HP1\u03b2 are evicted (Smallwood et\u00a0al, 2007; Mateescu et\u00a0al, 2008). Consistent with this, HP1\u03b3 concentrates in the coding region of active genes and interacts with the elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the pre-mRNA (Vakoc et\u00a0al, 2005; Lomberk et\u00a0al, 2006). At these intragenic positions, HP1\u03b3 may stabilize ongoing transcription and/or participate in RNA maturation. Genome-wide analyses implicate HP1\u03b3 in both alternative splicing and co-transcriptional RNA processing, presumably by favoring the recruitment of the splicing machinery (Saint-Andr\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2011; Ameyar-Zazoua et\u00a0al, 2012; Smallwood et\u00a0al, 2012). Overall, these studies suggest that HP1 proteins are transcriptional regulators, their functional impact on gene expression depending on their association with various partner proteins. The search for additional mechanisms regulating the functional outcome of HP1 protein on transcription points out the implication of HP1 post-translational modifications. Notably, phosphorylation of HP1\u03b3 at serine 83 (S83) located within the hinge of the protein defines a subpopulation exclusively located to euchromatin, targeted to the site of transcriptional elongation, and with abrogated HP1\u03b3 silencing activity in a transcriptional reporter assay (Lomberk et\u00a0al, 2006). This infers the existence of a second layer of transcriptional regulation on top of the histone code, earlier referred to as a \u201cHP1 subcode\u201d, governed by the dynamic of nuclear kinases phosphorylating HP1\u03b3 and with a fundamental impact on its bioactivity.Interestingly, a phosphoproteome analysis performed on macrophages stimulated by LPS in vitro showed that TLR4 activation had a strong impact on the cellular phosphorylation state, with sub-data analysis revealing multiple phosphorylation sites on HP1\u03b3, including S83 (Weintz et\u00a0al, 2010). Nevertheless, the regulation of HP1\u03b3 by HP1 kinases remains weakly characterized in living cells and, upon innate immune challenge, the modulation of HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation state poorly investigated.In this report, we provide the seminal observation that the bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri modulates HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in the colon. Notably, colonic infection with the proinflammatory non-invasive mxiD Shigella mutant that does not assemble the T3SS needle and therefore does not secrete T3SS effectors, dramatically up-regulated HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation, while a weaker induction was observed in response to the wild-type (WT) invasive Shigella strain. Our in vitro approach identified the T3SS virulence effector OspF as a modulator of HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation. We showed that OspF directly interacted with HP1\u03b3 and inactivated the ERK-downstream kinase MSK1 that we identified as a major HP1 kinase. A transcriptome analysis of HP1\u03b3 null cell lines re-complemented or not with HP1\u03b3 revealed that many genes known to be under the transcriptional control of OspF during Shigella infection are dependent on HP1\u03b3 for their regulation. Stimulation of the cells with an activator of the MAPK pathway further showed that HP1\u03b3 seems to function as a moderator of the amplitude of the innate immune response, while also promoting specificity in the signaling, properties that makes it a very likely target for bacterial takeover. Finally, an S83A mutation in HP1\u03b3 confirmed that phosphorylation at this position is important for the normal function of the protein, but is insufficient to abolish its role in the innate immune response. ResultsShigella modulates HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation state in vivoTo investigate in vivo the impact of bacterial challenge on HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation, we used a guinea pig model of Shigellosis in which bacterial infection induces a severe and acute rectocolitis, reproducing human bacillary dysentery (Shim et\u00a0al, 2007). Guinea pigs were administered intrarectally either with PBS (control group), the S.\u00a0flexneri 5a (WT) strain, or the non-invasive mxiD that does not assemble the T3SS needle and therefore does not secrete effectors. Eight hours post-infection, the animals were sacrificed. Both bacterial challenges induced a potent inflammatory infiltrate composed of PMN in the submucosa and laminar propria, or at proximity of the bacterial infiltrate, providing evidence for the activation of the immune response (Supplementary Fig S1). To follow HP1\u03b3 in the colon, the tissues were double stained with monoclonal anti-HP1\u03b3 or polyclonal anti-phospho S83 HP1\u03b3 (HP1\u03b3S83p) antibodies, and with DAPI to visualize DNA, then examined by fluorescent confocal microscopy. While both anti-HP1\u03b3 antibodies displayed a nuclear signal, the anti-HP1\u03b3S83p staining showed a unique punctuate pattern co-localizing with DAPI-light euchromatic regions, in agreement with the strictly euchromatic localization of HP1\u03b3S83p (Supplementary Fig S2). HP1\u03b3 expression was detected in the lamina propria and in the epithelial cells, while the most differentiated enterocytes in the upper part of villi were devoid of HP1\u03b3 staining (Fig\u200b(Fig1A).1A). Phosphorylation at HP1\u03b3S83 was weak in the control groups (PBS), but increased strongly upon bacterial challenge with the non-invasive mxiD strain, the most intense signals being observed at the lamina propria, and the epithelial layer (Fig\u200b(Fig1A).1A). The WT Shigella strain also induced the HP1\u03b3S83p signal, albeit weaker in intensity, as shown by the quantification of the HP1\u03b3S83p/HP1\u03b3 total ratio, with signals being mostly located at the lamina propria (Fig\u200b(Fig1A1A and B). Thus, we conclude that bacterial challenge promoted HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in the colon, this effect being substantially alleviated upon invasive Shigella challenge.Open in a separate windowFigure 1HP1\u03b3 immunostaining in the distal colon of guinea pigs following intra-rectal challenge with Shigella flexneri strainsSamples of the distal colon were taken 7\u00a0h after infection with the T3SS defective mxiD Shigella pGFP(e\u2013h), WT Shigella pGFP (i\u2013l) or PBS treated as control (a\u2013d) and co-stained with anti-HP1\u03b3 (a, e, and i) or anti-HP1\u03b3S83p (b, f, and j) antibodies and merged with DAPI (d, h, and l).

The star indicated the submucosa, and the arrow showed the terminally differentiated columnar absorptive enterocytes devoid of HP1\u03b3.Fluorescence intensity ratios between HP1\u03b3S83p and total HP1\u03b3. HP1\u03b3S83p staining was quantified on HP1\u03b3-positive nuclei in each field. The intensity of fluorescence for each channel of interest was measured, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity between HP1\u03b3S83p and total HP1\u03b3 signals was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Statistical analysis was performed as described in Materials and Methods.Shigella targets HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation at S83 through the injection of the phosphothreonine lyase OspFWe further develop an in vitro approach to identify bacterial mechanisms modulating the HP1\u03b3S83p signal in cells. Initially, we observed that activation of protein kinase C upstream of the MAPK pathway with a phorbol ester (PMA) resulted in increase phosphorylation at HP1\u03b3S83p (Fig\u200b(Fig2A,2A, lanes 1\u20135). The inducibility of this phosphorylation event was substantially altered when cells were pre-infected with a wild-type (WT) Shigella flexneri strain (Fig\u200b(Fig2A,2A, lanes 6\u201310). Furthermore, PMA-induced HP1\u03b3S83p was impaired by the MEK inhibitor U0126, indicating that the ERK pathway drives formation of HP1\u03b3S83p in this experimental setting (Fig\u200b(Fig2B,2B, compare lanes 6\u20137). OspF is a virulence effector irreversibly inactivating MAPK though a phosphothreonine lyase activity (Li et\u00a0al, 2007). To examine the impact of this bacterial effector on HP1\u03b3S83p level, we infected HeLa cells with either a WT or an ospF-deficient Shigella strain (ospF strain). Immunoblot analysis showed that the ospF mutant strain induced formation of HP1\u03b3S83p signal as efficiently as did a PMA treatment, while the Shigella WT strain had no effect (Fig\u200b(Fig2C,2C, compare lanes 2\u20135 to 6\u20139). Overall, these data indicated that OspF blocks formation of HP1\u03b3S83p, while conversely, MAPK activators promotes this phosphorylation event. We have previously shown that OspF localizes into the nucleus of infected cells (Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007). Therefore, we hypothesized that OspF interacts with HP1\u03b3 to block a nuclear MAPK signaling cascade controlling HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation. To explore this, we immunoprecipitated endogenous HP1\u03b3 from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells transiently expressing the virulence effector. This resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of OspF (Fig\u200b(Fig2D).2D). GST pull-down experiments indicated that this interaction was direct and dependent of the C-terminal HP1 chromoshadow domain (CSD) (Supplementary Fig S3). The functional impact of this interaction on HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation was illustrated by an extensive dephosphorylation at HP1\u03b3S83 when HP1\u03b3 was co-immunoprecipitated with OspF (Fig\u200b(Fig2E,2E, compare lanes 1 to lanes 2). Overall, these results show that OspF directly interacted with HP1\u03b3 causing its dephosphorylation in Shigella-infected cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 2The virulence effector OspF blocks formation of HP1\u03b3S83p in Shigella-infected cellsShigella inhibits PMA-induced formation of HP1\u03b3S83p.

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids and cellular extract immunoprecipitated with HP1\u03b3 antibody in the absence or the presence of DNase I. Western blots were performed with anti-HP1\u03b3S83p, anti-HP1\u03b3, anti-OspF, or anti-ERK antibodies.Source data are available online for this figure.OspF is chromatin-bound and modulates HP1\u03b3 association to its target genesHP1\u03b3S83 phosphorylation was reported to target HP1\u03b3 to sites of transcriptional elongation (Lomberk et\u00a0al, 2006). We therefore investigated the impact of OspF on the recruitment of HP1\u03b3 to the chromatin of its target genes. We first characterized OspF chromatin binding properties. We noticed that treating the nuclear extracts with DNase I that favors recovery of the nucleosome-associated fraction of HP1\u03b3 resulted in more efficient co-immunoprecipitation of OspF, suggesting that OspF bound chromatin (Fig\u200b(Fig1E,1E, compare lane 2\u20133). To further characterize OspF chromatin association, we forced expression of OspF in HeLa cells and used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with an anti-OspF antibody to show that OspF WT was bound to chromatin at the promoter of the target gene IL8 upon stimulation of the cells with TNF (Fig\u200b(Fig3A).3A). In contrast, OspF was not detected at the promoters of the NFKBIA, or CD44 genes not regulated by the bacterial effector (Fig\u200b(Fig3A3A and Supplementary Fig S4). Therefore, OspF was recruited at the genes it specifically regulated. Next, we looked at the impact of OspF on HP1\u03b3 chromatin association at those genes. This was best followed using non-cross-linked HeLa chromatin in \u201cnative ChIP\u201d assays. In these assays, infection with WT Shigella, although it resulted in approx. Tenfold transcriptional activation of the IL8 promoter (Supplementary Fig S4), caused either no change or a moderate decrease in the levels of HP1\u03b3 recruitment. Only infection with the mutant ospF strain that does not interfere with HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation induced accumulation of this protein on the IL8 promoter and coding regions. This is consistent with a requirement for HP1\u03b3S83 phosphorylation for reaching association of HP1\u03b3 with active genes. Importantly, the WT Shigella strain had no impact on HP1\u03b3 accumulation at a series of non-OspF target genes including NFKB1, NFKBIA, or CD44 (Fig\u200b(Fig3B).3B). Overall, these results showed that OspF bound to selected chromatin sites and, in consistence with its ability to dephosphorylate HP1\u03b3, interfered with normal association of this protein with its target genes.Open in a separate windowFigure 3OspF is chromatin-bound and modulates HP1\u03b3 chromatin association at its target immune genesHeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and stimulated by TNF at the indicated times.

Enrichment in chromatin was quantified by qPCR using indicated primers at the IL8, NFKB1, and NFKBIA genes (Pr, proximal promoter; e2, exon 2). Enrichment values are the mean of three independent experiments. Significance of the differences was estimated using Student's t-test with a threshold at 5%.MSK1 is a new HP1 kinase regulating HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation state in Shigella-infected cellsWe next sought to identify the MAPK-activated kinase responsible for HP1\u03b3S83 phosphorylation. A possible candidate was MSK1 known to phosphorylate histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10). This kinase is immediately down-stream of ERK and its activation by phosphorylation at serine 360 (P-Ser360 MSK1) was, as expected, blocked in cells infected by a WT Shigella strain and restored when the ospF mutant strain was used instead (Fig\u200b(Fig4A).4A). Interestingly, treatment of HeLa cells with the MSK1-specific inhibitor H89 blocked phosphorylation at both H3S10 and HP1\u03b3S83 upon activation of the MAPK pathway with PMA (Fig\u200b(Fig2B,2B, compare lanes 3\u20134). Furthermore, in MSK1/2 double null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), levels of HP1\u03b3S83p were markedly reduced when compared to WT MEFs (Fig\u200b(Fig4B,4B, lanes 9\u201310). In these WT MEFs, infection with the WT Shigella strain resulted in decreased levels HP1\u03b3S83p, while this phosphorylation was induced when using the ospF mutant strain, consistent with our data collected with HeLa cells (Fig\u200b(Fig4B,4B, compare lanes 1\u20133, and 4\u20135, and densitometric analysis). By contrast, in the MSK1/2 double null MEFs, neither infection with the WT nor the ospF mutant Shigella strain had an impact on accumulation of the HP1\u03b3S83p signal (Fig\u200b(Fig4B,4B, compare lanes 6 to 7\u201310), while the ability of the ospF mutant strain to induce ERK phosphorylation remained intact (Fig\u200b(Fig4B,4B, compare lanes 7\u20138 to lanes 9\u201310). In vitro kinase assays revealed that MSK1 directly phosphorylated both HP1\u03b1 and HP1\u03b3 but not HP1\u03b2 (Fig\u200b(Fig4C).4C). Mutation to alanine of HP1\u03b3S83 and neighboring serines (S85, S87, S89, and S92) further showed that under these conditions, HP1\u03b3S83, a residue conserved in HP1\u03b1 and HP1\u03b3 isoforms but not HP1\u03b2, was the predominant residue modified by MSK1 thus confirming the specificity of the reaction (Fig\u200b(Fig4D,4D, compare lane 4 to lanes 5\u20138). Importantly, OspF did not inhibit the ability for MSK1 to induce HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay (Supplementary Fig S5). Overall, these data indicated that the MSK kinases play a major role in the modulation of the HP1\u03b3S83p signal in Shigella-infected cells and that OspF targeting of this nuclear MAPK signaling pathway was the main mechanism by which this bacterial effector altered HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation state.Open in a separate windowFigure 4The MSK1 kinase drives HP1\u03b3S83p formation in Shigella-infected cellsA\u00a0OspF leads to the accumulation of a dephosphorylated and inactive form of MSK1 into Shigella-infected cells.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with either anti-P-Ser360 MSK1 or anti-HP1\u03b3 antibodies in HeLa cell extracts showed that HP1\u03b3, ERK, and activated MSK1 form a tri-complex enriched upon PMA stimulation (Fig\u200b(Fig5A).5A). Use of an anti-HP1\u03b3S83p antibody strongly improved detection of ERK in the co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that in the tri-complex, HP1\u03b3 is phosphorylated (Fig\u200b(Fig5B,5B, compare lane 3\u20136). Consistent with this, confocal microscopy showed a high coincidence of immunostaining between HP1\u03b3S83p and the active form of MSK1 (P-Ser360 MSK1) (mean overlap coefficient of 0.83, the mean value obtained with an irrelevant protein such as p53 being <\u00a00.1, Fig\u200bFig5C5C and Supplementary Fig S6A). Also, a co-localization was detectable upon bacterial infection between MSK1 and HP1\u03b3S83p when the HP1\u03b3S83p signal was triggered by the ospF mutant strain (mean overlap coefficient of at 0.84, Fig\u200bFig5D5D and Supplementary Fig S6B). Pull-down experiments finally showed that GST-MSK1 directly interacted with full-length recombinant HP1\u03b1 and HP1\u03b3 proteins, in a CSD-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig S7). Overall, these data identified MSK1 as a novel kinase phosphorylating HP1\u03b3 at S83 in the context of a molecular tri-complex between the phosphorylated pool of HP1\u03b3 and the ERK/MSK1 kinases.Open in a separate windowFigure 5MSK1 forms a molecular complex with the phosphorylated pool of HP1\u03b3 in cellsPMA stimulation leads to the formation of molecular tri-complex between the HP1\u03b3 and the ERK/MSK1 kinases.

To investigate this, we isolated nuclear-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions from either WT or HP1\u03b3 null MEFs, as previously described (Zhao et\u00a0al, 1998). PMA stimulation of the cells resulted in rapid accumulation of a pool of MSK1 in the chromatin-bound fraction with a peak at 30\u00a0min, and this phenomenon was strongly intensified in the presence of HP1\u03b3 (Fig\u200b(Fig6A,6A, lanes 9\u201316). At the same time, a pool of HP1\u03b3 phosphorylated at S83 also appeared in the chromatin-bound fraction, consistent with this compartment being highly transcriptionally active (Xu et\u00a0al, 1986). A depletion experiment with siRNAs finally confirmed that recruitment of MSK1 to the IL8 promoter in HeLa cells was also dependent on HP1\u03b3 (Fig\u200b(Fig6B6B and Supplementary Fig S8). Altogether, these results indicated that HP1\u03b3 was required for optimal recruitment of MSK1 to its target genes and thereby played a not previously described role in assisting MAPK signal transduction.Open in a separate windowFigure 6HP1\u03b3 bridges MSK1 at the chromatin and regulates the expression of specific genesWT and HP1\u03b3 null mouse fibroblasts were stimulated by PMA at the indicated times. Nuclear extract were processed as indicated in Materials and Methods. Western blots were performed with anti-MSK1, anti-HP1\u03b3S83p, and anti-histone H3 antibodies.HeLa cells were transfected with siHP1\u03b3 or, as a control, siGAPDH and stimulated by PMA (40\u00a0min). ChIPs were performed using anti-HP1\u03b3 or anti-MSK1 antibodies, or unrelated mouse IgGs as a control. Results are expressed as fold induction versus IgG for each point (**P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Enrichment values are the mean of two independent experiments. Significance of the differences was estimated using Student's t-test with a threshold at 5%.Source data are available online for this figure.To acquire a more global insight in the role of HP1\u03b3 in signal transduction, we established mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-derived HP1\u03b3 null cell lines stably re-complemented with either wild-type HP1\u03b3, or a HP1\u03b3S83A mutant not phosphorylatable at S83 (Supplementary Fig S9A). These cells were then used to examine the effect HP1\u03b3/PMA stimulation on genome-wide transcription by next generation sequencing. Approximately 2,000 transcripts were up- or down-regulated 1.5-fold or more when re-complemented with wild-type HP1\u03b3 (Supplementary Fig S9B and C). As anticipated, many of the down-regulated transcripts were encoded by repeated DNA sequences known to be silenced by HP1 proteins. Transcripts encoded by the interferon-inducible IFI44, IFIT3, and OAS1b genes previously described as HP1\u03b3 targets were also repressed by re-expression of HP1\u03b3 (Lavigne et\u00a0al, 2009) (Supplementary Fig S9D). These observations that were confirmed by RT-PCR validated our cellular system as suitable for the study of the impact of HP1\u03b3 on transcription.A large population of the transcripts regulated by HP1\u03b3 WT was also regulated by HP1\u03b3S83A, although approximately 500 transcripts were affected only by HP1 WT, and 1,761 additional transcripts were affected only by HP1\u03b3S83A, confirming that the phospho-mutant was affected in its activity (Supplementary Fig S9B and C). Upon stimulation of the cells with PMA, 973 transcripts were affected only in the absence of WT HP1\u03b3 (Fig\u200b(Fig7A).7A). As a large fraction of these transcripts were encoded by DNA repeats, this observation illustrates the importance of HP1 proteins in keeping vestigial viral sequences in check. Inversely, mapping of annotated genes to KEGG pathways interestingly showed that several pathways remained unaffected by PMA stimulation in the absence of HP1\u03b3 (Fig\u200b(Fig7B).7B). For example, only in the presence of HP1\u03b3 did we observe up-regulation of a significant number of genes within the DNA Replication KEGG pathway. A similar observation was made for the Pyrimidine Metabolism or Cell Cycle KEGG pathways. In addition, when pathways were affected by PMA in the absence of HP1\u03b3, re-introduction of HP1\u03b3 seemed to oppose this effect. This was in particular seen for MAP Kinase Signaling and Base Excision Repair KEGG pathways. Finally, we noted that HP1\u03b3 had a very coherent effect within each significantly affected pathway, causing either solely activation or solely repression (with the exception of the p53 signaling pathway). Together, these observations suggested that HP1\u03b3 broaden the impact of PMA stimulation while simultaneously fine-tuning its specificity and attenuating the amplitude of its effects. We noted also that HP1 WT and HP1\u03b3S83A had similar effects on most pathways, suggesting that the S83A mutation only partially altered the ability of HP1\u03b3 to respond to PMA.Open in a separate windowFigure 7HP1\u03b3 affects the transcriptional impact of PMAMEF-derived cells either HP1\u03b3 null or re-complemented with either HP1\u03b3 WT or HP1\u03b3S83A were either not stimulated or exposed to PMA for 1\u00a0h. Total RNA was depleted from ribosomal RNA then sequenced by Next Generation sequencing with a 50+ bp standard.\nVenn diagram showing the number of transcripts regulated by PMA stimulation in HP1\u03b3 null (blue), HP1\u03b3 WT (red), and HP1\u03b3S83A (green) MEF-derived cell lines (\u2265\u00a01.5-fold change in expression, \u2265\u00a020 reads, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).KEGG functional categories significantly enriched (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for genes differentially expressed in the indicated conditions, depicted according to their P-value [\u2212log10(P-value)].Fold induction by PMA of a subset of OspF target genes (\u2265\u00a02-fold change in expression in HP1\u03b3 null) in each of the indicated cell lines. Data and P-values are provided in Supplementary Table S1.To particularly explore the effect of HP1\u03b3 on OspF targets, we selected 64 genes previously characterized as activated by S.\u00a0flexneri infection only in the absence of OspF, having unambiguous mouse homologs, and being transcriptionally affected in the MEF HP1\u03b3 null cells upon re-complementation with either HP1\u03b3 or HP1\u03b3S83A. A majority of these genes were unaffected by the reintroduction of HP1\u03b3 at basal levels (Supplementary Table S1, green lane). In contrast, all these genes except 3 were transcriptionally activated by the PMA treatment, illustrating the similarities between PMA stimulation and ospF infection, and suggesting that many MAPK targets are conserved in the MEF-derived cells (Supplementary Table S1). In agreement with the conclusions from the KEGG pathway analysis, HP1\u03b3 opposed the transcriptional activation of a large majority of the 64 genes upon stimulation of the cells by PMA (compare red and blue bars Fig\u200bFig7C).7C). A similar effect was observed with HP1\u03b3S83A (compare red and green bars Fig\u200bFig7C).7C). These effects were validated by RT-qPCR for a series of genes (Supplementary Table S2). This series of validation experiments also allowed us to further verify on a subset of these genes that there was a similarity between the response of the cells to PMA and that observed upon S.\u00a0flexneri infection (Supplementary Table S2). DiscussionIn this study, we provide the first evidence that bacteria such as the enteropathogen Shigella flexneri control the epigenetic of their host by altering the activity of a chromatin reader, the HP1 protein. In an in vivo model of rectocolitis, we showed that the non-invasive\u2014albeit proinflammatory\u2014mxiD Shigella mutant promotes pronounced HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in the colon when compared to wild-type Shigella. A phosphoproteome analysis of Toll-like receptor-activated macrophages reported that LPS caused major dynamic changes in the cell phosphorylation state, with sub-data analysis indicating multiple phosphorylation sites on HP1\u03b3, including S83 (Weintz et\u00a0al, 2010). In the context of our in vivo model of colonic infection, one can reasonably conceived that bacterial challenge might directly\u2014through LPS release\u2014or indirectly initiated proinflammatory signaling cascade(s), leading to increase HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation at multiple residues, including the S83 residue monitored in our study. As such, phosphorylation at S83 (S93 in mice) can be envisaged as a biomarker reflecting the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways targeting HP1\u03b3 at multiple phosphorylation sites. The modulation of this biological event by invasive Shigella was somehow consistent with the known ability of Shigella to develop strategies dampening inflammation for its own survival. From our in vitro analysis, we identified the T3SS virulence effector OspF, a phosphothreonine lyase targeting nuclear MAPK signaling, as the main cause leading to HP1\u03b3 dephosphorylation. Our data further indicated that OspF exhibited gene-specific chromatin-bound properties and directly interacted with HP1\u03b3, thereby dephosphorylating and reducing HP1\u03b3 association to the chromatin template. HP1 proteins are histone code readers that recognize and specifically bind methylated histone H3 through their conserved chromodomain. HP1 was first discovered in Drosophila as a dominant suppressor of position-effect variegation and a major component of heterochromatin that represses gene activity (Eissenberg et\u00a0al, 1990). However, these proteins are extensively modified in a manner analogous to histones, by phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, formylation, sumoylation, and others (LeRoy et\u00a0al, 2009), and experimental evidence indicates that post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and sumoylation at the central region of the protein (the hinge regions), which is rich in serine and lysine residues, modulate their sub-nuclear location and bioactivity. For example, SUMOylated lysines in HP1\u03b1 were shown to target this HP1 to pericentric heterochromatin. Inversely, HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation at S83 defined a strictly euchromatic subpopulation, associated with the elongated form of the RNAPII and with an abrogated silencing activity in a transcriptional reporter assay (Lomberk et\u00a0al, 2006; Maison et\u00a0al, 2011). Various consensus sites for protein kinases such as casein kinases, PKA and PKC, have been identified and mutation of the corresponding phospho-residues were shown to reduce HP1 silencing activities in Drosophila (Zhao et\u00a0al, 2001). Overall, these studies suggested that multiple kinase pathways might phosphorylate and therefore modulate the bioactivity of this epigenetic regulator. However, the regulation of HP1\u03b3 by HP1 kinases remained poorly characterized in living cells and virtually unexplored in the context of host\u2013pathogen interaction. Our work identified MSK1 as an HP1 kinase, playing a major role in the modulation of the HP1\u03b3S83p signal in Shigella-infected cells. MSK1 is a nuclear kinase phosphorylating transcription factors such as CREB, ATF1, and the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB as well as components of the nucleosomal response like histone H3 and HMG-14 (Wiggin et\u00a0al, 2002; Vermeulen et\u00a0al, 2003). Consequently, in response to mitogen or pro-inflammatory stimuli, MSK1 positively regulates the expression of early responsive genes and a subset of immune NF-\u03baB genes such as IL6. On the other hand, MSK1/2 invalidation demonstrated that MSK1/2 is important for the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules such as the MAPK phosphatase DUSP1 (MKP-1) and the cytokine IL-10, thereby limiting the extend of the inflammatory response in various mice models of acute and chronic inflammation (Ananieva et\u00a0al, 2008; Bertelsen et\u00a0al, 2011). Therefore, MSK1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of various classes of immune genes, which somehow reflects its ability to interact with and phosphorylate various transcriptional regulators. Our work showed that active MSK1 formed a tight nuclear complex with the epigenetic regulator HP1\u03b3 that aimed at stabilizing MSK1 on the chromatin template of its immune target genes. Such ability for HP1 to \u201cbring\u201d a kinase to the chromatin template is reminiscent of the S.\u00a0pombe HP1 homologue Swi6 that recruits the protein kinase Hsk1-Dfp1 to positively regulate replications origins at pericentromeric region (Bailis et\u00a0al, 2003). Therefore, our work extends the function of HP1\u03b3 as a chromatin integrator for nuclear kinases in higher eukaryotes.A direct functional consequence of the MSK1/HP1\u03b3 molecular interplay was the induction of HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation at S83 that was impeded by the virulence effector OspF. Once injected by the T3SS into host cells, OspF bound chromatin at its target genes, providing a mechanisms sustaining gene selectivity, while the molecular identity of the anchoring system remains elusive. Our study identified HP1\u03b3 as a new OspF interactant and showed that OspF dephosphorylated HP1\u03b3 chiefly by inactivating the MAPK/MSK1 pathway. Consistent with the requirement for HP1\u03b3S83 phosphorylation to reach association of HP1\u03b3 to sites of transcription elongation, OspF uncoupled recruitment of HP1\u03b3 from transcriptional activation. Thus, nuclear MAPK inactivation by OspF has two consequences at the chromatin level, one previously demonstrated consisting in decreasing the content of histone marks permissive for transcription (reduction in the content of phospho-acetylated histone H3) (Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007), the second being to impair HP1\u03b3 signaling at OspF target gene (Fig\u200b(Fig8,8, model A/B). We interrogated the impact of HP1\u03b3 and its phosphorylation on gene regulation by RNA seq, using HP1\u03b3 null cell lines rescued with HP1\u03b3 either WT or with a S83A mutation. This showed that, as a \u201cversatile\u201d transcriptional regulator, HP1\u03b3 is operating either as a repressor or a transcriptional activator. However, the RNAseq data also indicated that within a functional group, all genes affected by HP1\u03b3 were regulated in a same way (all up, or all down) illustrating the very coherent impact of this protein. Furthermore, HP1\u03b3 re-complementation resulted in a significant enrichment in targets related to regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, purine metabolism, DNA replication and repair, these pathways being not statistically enriched in the PMA-stimulated HP1\u03b3 null cells. Previous reports have detected high levels of HP1\u03b3 protein associated with enhanced cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon, breast, and cervical cancers (Takanashi et\u00a0al, 2009; Abe et\u00a0al, 2011; Slezak et\u00a0al, 2013). Also, HP1\u03b3 S83 was reported enriched at the mitotic spindle, suggesting an additional role in proper mitotic cell division (Grzenda et\u00a0al, 2013). Our in vivo analysis indicated that terminally differentiated columnar absorptive enterocytes were devoid of HP1\u03b3, while the expression was detectable in the basal level of the crypt that contained the proliferative cell compartment. Overall, these observations convey the idea that HP1\u03b3 is an important factor for cell division, with a potential impact on crypt regeneration, especially in the context of immune stimuli, which triggers HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation in the colon.Open in a separate windowFigure 8Model: OspF targets the nuclear MAPK/HP1\u03b3 signaling pathway and reveals the function of the MSK1/HP1\u03b3 cross talkIn unstimulated cells (ns), HP1 is brought to the promoter by histone H3K9 methylation and acts as a transcriptional repressor.Shigella flexneri infection results in activation of the MAPK/MSK1 pathway, but this activation is rapidly dampened by OspF that dephosphorylates ERK. The combined effect of these two events is a moderate transcriptional activation of IL8. This causes HP1\u03b3 to leave the promoter, while inactivation of ERK prevents it from getting phosphorylated and join the transcription machinery. Consequently, accumulation of HP1\u03b3 at the IL8 gene drops.Upon ospF Shigella infection or treatment with PMA, the MAPK nuclear pathway is fully triggered, levels of histone H3 marks permissive for transcription are increased (H3S10), and the transcription machinery is recruited. Activation of the MAPK nuclear pathway induces HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation and allows for its recruitment to IL8 and other similarly regulated immune genes.In MEF KO cells, the loss of HP1\u03b3 eliminates an important checkpoint in the control of immune gene activation, leading to a deregulated possibly excessive gene expression in response to MAPK activation.We further looked at the impact of HP1\u03b3 re-complementation on immune gene expression, with a particular focus on the OspF target genes that we identified in an earlier study (Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007). As a global picture, we found that both HP1\u03b3 WT and HP1\u03b3S83A protein exerted similarly effect on gene expression, notably by reducing gene inducibility in response to PMA stimulation. Clearly, in the context of PMA or bacterial stimulations, a single phospho-mutation was not sufficient to abrogate the biological impact of HP1\u03b3, this suggesting that multiple phosphorylation sites modified upon cell activation control the biological activity of the protein. In this context, an extensive proteomic analysis is required to elucidate the additional phospho-residues or modifications involved in the control of HP1 bioactivity and to determine how these new modifications are targeted upon Shigella infection.Our model predicts that HP1\u03b3 recruitment is required for fine-tuning of immune gene expression upon cell activation (Fig\u200b(Fig8,8, Model C). HP1\u03b3 was reported to decrease the RNAPII elongation rate at the CD44 gene to facilitate inclusion of alternative exons (Saint-Andr\u00e9 et\u00a0al, 2011), and it is tempting to speculate that HP1\u03b3 slowing down RNAPII might alter gene promoter activity by affecting the speed with which the polymerase moves away from the promoter and makes room for the binding of the next polymerase. Importantly, our model implies that loss of HP1\u03b3 eliminates an important checkpoint in the control of immune gene activation, leading to the super-induction of the gene (Fig\u200b(Fig8,8, Model D).In conclusion, our work showed that bacteria such as the enteropathogen, Shigella flexneri, in addition to their effect on histone modifications, controls the epigenetic of their host by altering the activity of chromatin readers like HP1. The development of in vivo models targeting HP1\u03b3 will be essential for understanding the transcriptional impact of this epigenetic regulator in the context of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, our study illustrates the ability for some bacterial effector to modulate chromatin-borne information, providing invaluable tools to integrate these events in the field of innate immunity. As such, the modulation of HP1\u03b3 phosphorylation upon bacterial challenge in the colon suggested functional links with mucosal defense or repair. Thus, the development of in vivo approaches targeting HP1\u03b3 and its phosphorylation in the intestine is the next challenge to be taken up to solve these important physiological issues. Materials and MethodsCell culture and bacterial strainsMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from HP1\u03b3 null mice were provided by Dr. Florence Cammas (IRCM, Montpellier, France). Stable recomplementations of the MEF HP1\u03b3 null mice were obtained by retroviral transduction according to the method of Nakatani and Ogryzko (Nakatani & Ogryzko, 2003), using the retroviral pOZ-N backbone vector. The human HP1\u03b3 cDNA was subcloned between XhoI and NotI restriction sites of the pOZ-N vector and the S83A mutant obtained by the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). MEF MSK1/2 null mice were provided by Dr. Simon Arthur (School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, UK). MEF and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Bacterial strains and cellular infectionThe wild-type Shigella flexneri serotype 5a strain (WT), the ospF-deficient (ospF), and the T3SS defective mxiD Shigella mutant strains have been previously described (Allaoui et\u00a0al, 1993; Arbibe et\u00a0al, 2007). Cells were infected with the Shigella strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35. Infection was initiated by synchronization step for 10\u00a0min. After incubation for 15\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, gentamycin was added in the medium to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml to kill extracellular bacteria.Cytokines, inhibitors, and antibodiesRecombinant human TNF-\u03b1, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), SB203580, and PD98059 were purchased from Alexis Corporation (Lausen, Switzerland); U0126 was supplied by Promega Biotec (Madison, WI), and H89 obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International (San Diego, CA).

Quality control of the HP1\u03b3 antibodies was also checked by the loss of signal detection upon knockdown of the corresponding protein in the immunoprecipitate and input (Supplementary Fig S10B).

For nativeChIP, the chromatin was incubated for 3\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C with 1\u00a0\u03bcg of indicated antibodies (or non-immune IgG as negative control). Saturated magnetic beads coupled to protein A or G or to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Dynabeads) were used to recover the complexes. After 2\u00a0h of incubation, beads were washed extensively and nucleic acids were purified. DNA bound to the immunoprecipitated proteins was quantified by qPCR. Primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table S3.Immunofluorescence stainingThe EasyLink Cy5 Conjugation kit was used to conjugate the polyclonal anti-phospho Ser360-MSK1 with Cy5 (Abcam, ab102877). Immunofluorescence analysis on HeLa cells was performed after 20\u00a0min of fixation with paraformaldehyde and 10\u00a0min of permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were first labeled with the polyclonal anti-HP1\u03b3S83p (ab45270) and in a second step with the Cy5 phospho MSK1 conjugated antibody. The goat anti-human MSK1 antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (AF2518). The images were acquired and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The analysis is based on the evaluation of color components of the selected pair of channels (red, green) in a selected region of interest (the nucleus). The background was corrected, and a coefficient was produced by the software to estimate the degree of co-localization. The approximate estimation of co-localization was presented in a two-dimensional scatter gram.Intrarectal S.\u00a0flexneri inoculation and colon immunostainingsYoung guinea pigs (Hartley, <\u00a0150\u00a0g) were infected intrarectally with PBS as control, or 1010\u00a0CFU exponentially grown Shigella flexneri pGFP or mxiD Shigella pGFP as described (Shim et\u00a0al, 2007). In total, 15 guinea pigs were assigned randomly to three groups (each group 5 animals) and experiments were performed on two independent occasions. Infection occurred during 7\u00a0h before animals were sacrificed and the distal colon collected. Following 60\u00a0min PFA 4% fixation, infected guinea pig colon samples were washed in PBS, incubated at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 12% sucrose overnight, then in PBS with 18% sucrose overnight, and frozen in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) formulation (Sakura) on dry ice. Seven-micrometer sections were obtained using a cryostat CM-3050 (Leica). Sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% saponine in PBS for 15\u00a0min, and washed three times in PBS. Samples were fixed with 3% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1\u00a0h, then washed three times in PBS. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal to HP1\u03b3 (1:500, ab56978, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal to phosphoserine 83 HP1\u03b3 (1:500, ab45270, Abcam), diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated for 90\u00a0min. Sections were washed three times in PBS, and secondary antibodies were used: anti-mouse cy5 (1:1,000; GE Healthcare), anti-rabbit cy3 (1:1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch), diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated for 1\u00a0h. DAPI (1:2,000; Life Technologies) was also added to stain nuclei and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody to detect polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Fluorescently labeled tissues were observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica SP5). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually around HP1\u03b3 positive nuclei on each field. Three to 6 fields were analyzed per sample, and 25\u201337 ROIs were drawn per field (same number of ROI per field per condition). The intensity of fluorescence for each channel of interest was measured, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity between phosphoserine 83 HP1\u03b3 and total HP1\u03b3 was calculated. Unpaired t-test with Welch correction was used to analyze the ratio of fluorescence intensity between phosphoserine 83 HP1\u03b3 and total HP1\u03b3. Values of P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant.RNA sequencingMEF-derived cells either HP1\u03b3 null or re-complemented with either HP1\u03b3 WT or HP1\u03b3S83A were either not stimulated or exposed to PMA for 1\u00a0h. Total RNA was depleted from ribosomal RNA then sequenced by Next Generation sequencing with a 50+ bp standard. Sequencing was performed by the IGBMC Microarray and Sequencing platform, member of the France Genomique program. RNA Seq data analysis was performed by GenoSplice (http://www.genosplice.com). First, reads were aligned onto the mouse genome (mm9) using STAR v.2.3.0, with an exon\u2013exon junction database built using annotations from version 2013_2 of FAST-DB (see http://www.easana.com). For each gene present in FAST DB v2013_2, reads aligning on constitutive regions (that are not prone to alternative splicing) were counted. Based on these read counts, normalization and differential gene expression were performed using DESeq (v1.12.0 on R v3.0.0). EASANA was used for visualization of results (http://www.easana.com). The RNA seq data have been submitted to the GEO database, and the accession number is {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE60283\",\"term_id\":\"60283\"}}GSE60283.
