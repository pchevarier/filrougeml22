Our results provide evidence for an extensive cross talk between transcription, mRNP biogenesis, and export. They also uncover new factors that potentially are involved in these interconnected events. The expression of protein-encoding genes in eukaryotic cells is a multistep process in which the genetic message is transcribed from DNA into a pre-mRNA molecule that undergoes 5\u2032-end capping, splicing, 3\u2032-end cleavage, and polyadenylation before being assembled into a ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) and exported to the cytoplasm for translation. Genetic and biochemical studies, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism in particular, suggest that the various mRNA processing and packaging events known as mRNP biogenesis are coupled physically and functionally to transcript elongation. The current view is that the nascent transcript emerging from the transcription elongation complex is coated sequentially with a variety of proteins that ensure its integrity and mediate its maturation and transport from the site of transcription to the nuclear pore for export (2, 29, 68). The cotranscriptional assembly of export-competent mRNPs seems to be facilitated by the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), which serves as a platform for the sequential recruitment of various factors. Among the general factors that are important for the production of export-competent mRNPs in yeast, the four-subunit THO complex (Hpr1p, Mft1p, Tho2p, and Thp1p) associates with RNAP II at early steps of transcription elongation and facilitates the loading onto the nascent transcript of two mRNP export factors, Yra1p and Sub2p (1, 7, 71). The hexameric complex formed by THO, Yra1p, and Sub2p, termed the transcription and export complex (TREX) (64), recruits the heterodimeric export receptor Mex67p-Mtr2p, which guides mRNPs through the nuclear pore.The production of mature export-competent transcripts also is under the surveillance of quality control steps that are interconnected with transcription and mRNP assembly (12, 15). Aberrant mRNA molecules resulting from inappropriate or inefficient processing and packaging reactions are detected readily by the surveillance mechanisms leading to their retention at the transcription sites, where they are degraded by the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the nuclear exosome (51, 63, 67). The exosome-mediated mRNA surveillance was shown to accompany the transcription complex during elongation in Drosophila melanogaster, and a physical interaction between the exosome and the transcription elongation factors Spt6 and Spt5 was reported (3). This coupling between transcription and mRNA surveillance also was highlighted by a genetic interaction found between a component of the general transcription factor TFIIH (Rad3p) and the exosome-mediated mRNA quality control in yeast (22). Further analyses of this genetic interaction have shown that the efficiency of nuclear mRNA surveillance is modulated by the rate of transcript elongation by RNAP II (21). Also, genetic and biochemical studies have revealed a functional link between the TREX complex and the exosome, especially its nucleus-specific subunit Rrp6p (21, 24, 33, 35, 71). The mutation of any component of the TREX complex leads to the inhibition of nuclear mRNA export and the sequestration of de novo-synthesized heat shock mRNAs at their site of transcription. Such mRNA nuclear retention and degradation can be suppressed by the loss of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p.A large part of our current knowledge of the interdependence between transcription elongation and mRNA processing, packaging, quality control, and export comes from the use of mutant alleles of some components of either the TREX complex or the mRNA 3\u2032-end formation machinery (21, 24, 35, 38). These artificially induced defects in mRNP biogenesis have been widely exploited to decipher the precise role of the nuclear exosome in mRNA surveillance. Recently, such studies have led to the identification of a new complex, termed TRAMP, that cooperates with the nuclear exosome in the processing and degradation of aberrant mRNAs (50, 70). However, despite extensive investigations in the last decade, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that define the export competence of mRNPs as well as the understanding of the dynamic interactions between the transcription elongation complex and the protein factors that connect mRNA synthesis to translation remain a major challenge. Furthermore, although several factors that are implicated in the various steps of mRNP biogenesis and export have been identified and characterized, it is widely recognized that numerous others still await identification, either because they belong to the nearly 20% of yeast open reading frames (ORF) whose functions remain unknown or because they perform multiple functions inside the cell.To address some of these fundamental questions, we sought to implement an original assay that monitors the interplay between RNAP II-dependent transcription and mRNP biogenesis in yeast. The assay is based on the perturbation of gene expression induced by a heterologous RNA processing factor that was expected to act as a competitor at one or several steps of mRNP biogenesis. An interesting protein that fulfills this commitment is the bacterial Rho factor. Rho protein, which has no known functional homolog in eukaryotes, belongs to the family of ring-shaped hexameric helicases and is involved in 50% of the transcription termination events in Escherichia coli (8, 44, 45). The mechanism by which Rho induces transcription termination involves a primary interaction of the protein with a naked portion of the nascent transcript, followed by ATP-driven translocation and the disruption of the transcription elongation complex at downstream sites. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies in our laboratory have shown that a well-defined Rho-dependent terminator is not an absolute prerequisite for Rho activity; any RNA sequence with adequately spaced C residues or certain RNA structures such as hairpins can serve as efficient loading sites for Rho (18, 58). Also, Rho is able to compete with other proteins for binding to a transcript, a process used in prokaryotic gene regulation (66). Upon productive interaction, Rho functions as a powerful molecular motor that tracks along an RNA chain and can melt nucleic acid base pairs or disrupt RNA-protein complexes present on its path (57, 69). Given these functional features, we surmised that, once in the yeast nucleus, Rho could bind to nascent transcripts by competing with the endogenous mRNA processing and packaging factors and even displace them during its translocation. Such action could lead to the production of prematurely terminated transcripts, aberrantly processed mRNAs, or export-incompetent mRNPs that are depleted of some crucial packaging proteins.Our results show that the conditional expression of Rho in S. cerevisiae leads to a dose-dependent growth defect phenotype that can be modulated by mutations in RNAP II that increase or decrease the rate of RNA synthesis. By a combination of genetic and molecular analyses, we have demonstrated that Rho expression induces the production of aberrant mRNA transcripts that are degraded through the exosome-mediated nuclear quality control system. Guided by these findings, we have conducted a screen for dosage suppressors of the Rho-induced growth defect. The hunt revealed several genes whose functions cover a large spectrum of mRNP biogenesis and export, as well as other ORFs with both known functions in transcription regulation and unknown functions. MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast strains and media. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. The rrp6\u0394 strain was created by using standard procedures of PCR-based gene deletion and modification in S. cerevisiae (34). The RRP6 ORF was amplified from strain BMA41\u03b1 and replaced with the E. coli kanamycin resistance (Kanr) gene by using primers RRP6-Kan1 (5\u2032-GATAGACGAAATAGGAACAACAAACAGCTTATAAGCACCCAATAAGTGCGTTCCCGGCCAGCGACATGGAGGCCCAG) and RRP6-Kan2 (5\u2032-GCCCTTGGTCCATTACTATCGCTAGATGATGGGTCGAATCTCCTTTTCCGAATCG ACAGCAGTATAGCGACCAGGCT) (RRP6 sequences are underlined). To construct the RNAP II mutant strains, the plasmids pRP212, pRP2-10, and pRP2-7 (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) were extracted from strains CKY 289, CKY 374, and CKY 379, respectively, and used individually to transform strain DDT-ct2 (rpb2\u0394::kanMX4 and pRP2-4L). The pRP2-4L plasmid was ejected from the transformants by nonselective growth to create the strains CMY 289, CMY 374, and CMY 379. Strains were grown on YEP plates (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% agar) or synthetic complete medium (SC) with bases and amino acids omitted as necessary. Media were supplemented with an appropriate carbon source (2% glucose or 1.95% galactose-0.05% glucose). Bicyclomycin was kindly provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals Co., Osaka, Japan.Plasmids. The plasmids used in the study are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material. The Rho-nuclear localization signal (Rho-NLS) coding sequence was obtained by PCR amplification from pCB111 (generously provided by J. Richardson) with oligonucleotides Rho3 (5\u2032-GAAGGAGATATACCCATGGATCTTACCG-3\u2032; the NcoI site is underlined, and the Rho sequence is in boldface) and Rho2 (5\u2032-CCTTATTCAGTTAGCTAGCTTAGGCAACCTTTCTCTTCTTCTTTGGTGGTGAGCGTTTCATCATTTCGAAG-3\u2032; the NheI site is underlined, simian virus 40 NLS sequence is in italics, and Rho sequence is in boldface). The DNA fragment was cloned behind the GAL1 promoter of pYX243 at the NcoI and NheI sites (Research and Development Systems). The resulting plasmid was manipulated to restore the Asn at position 2 in the Rho protein. Subsequent hydrolysis with BstEII and BsaI was performed to clone the GAL1-Rho-NLS sequence into the pRS415 vector (61), creating pYCM8. The K352E amino acid substitution in rho was generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides Rho6 (5\u2032-CTCCATCACTCGTCTGGCGCGCGCTTACAACACCG-3\u2032; +795 to +829 in the Rho coding sequence; the BssHII site is underlined) and Rho7 (5\u2032-GTAGTCGATAGCCGGGAAGACGCGTTCTTCAG-3\u2032; +1080 to +1049 in the Rho coding sequence; the MluI site is underlined). This Rho-KE fragment was cloned into pYCM8 that had been hydrolyzed by MluI and BssHII, generating pYCM8-Rho-KE. To express Rho-NLS or Rho-KE-NLS under the tetracycline promoter, the coding sequence of each allele was amplified from pYCM8 or pYCM8-Rho-KE with primers Rho18 (5\u2032-GGAGAAAAAACCCCGGATGCGGCCGCACCATG-3\u2032; the NotI site is underlined) and Rho22 (5\u2032-CGTTCATTGTTCCTTATTCAGGCGGCCGCCTTAGGCAACC-3\u2032; the NotI site is underlined). Following NotI hydrolysis, the PCR fragments were cloned into the pCM185 and pCM188 vectors to create pCM185-Rho-NLS, pCM185-Rho-KE-NLS, pCM188-Rho-NLS, and pCM188-Rho-KE-NLS. The NLS of pCM188-Rho-NLS was deleted by the amplification of the Rho gene with primers Rho18 and Rho23 (5\u2032-GGCAACCTTTCTCTTCGCGGCCGCTTATGAGCGTTTCATCATTTCG-3\u2032; the NotI site is underlined, and the Rho sequence is in boldface). The amplified DNA fragment was hydrolyzed with NotI and cloned into the NotI site of pCM188, generating pCM188-Rho-\u0394NLS.To construct the pHR81-X plasmids, the different ORFs were amplified from strain BMA41\u03b1 with appropriate primers containing the BamHI or SacI restriction site. After the hydrolysis of the PCR fragment with BamHI or SacI, the DNA was cloned into pHR81. The pAG425GPD-ORF constructs were realized by Gateway cloning using pDONR plasmids from Harvard (http://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/). To construct plasmid pRS413-RPB9, the RPB9 gene was amplified from BMA41\u03b1 genomic DNA with primers Rpb9 reverse (5\u2032-CCAGATAGAAGAAGATCTCTTCGCTAGAATTCGTAAGGAC-3\u2032) and Rpb9 forward (5\u2032-CATCTTTCTTCATTAATTGGATCCTGAACATATACGCAT-3\u2032) containing the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR fragment was hydrolyzed by EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pRS413.Dosage suppressor screen. The BMA41 strain harboring the Rho expression plasmid (pCM185-Rho-NLS) was transformed with the yeast genomic DNA library (39) (see Table S2 in the supplemental material), and the cells were plated onto selective agar medium containing 1 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (Dox). After 3 days at 25\u00b0C, the transformants were toothpicked individually onto selective Dox-free medium. The surviving colonies were replica-plated onto selective medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to discard nonplasmidic suppressors of Rho-induced lethality. Eventually, the episomal plasmid from the colonies growing on Dox-free medium was extracted, amplified in E. coli, and analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The ORF conferring the suppressing activity was recovered after the subcloning of the individual ORFs from the genomic insert into pHR81 or pAG425GPD-ccdB vector as described above. The yeast BMA41 cotransformants harboring pCM185-Rho-NLS and either pHR81-ORF or pAG425GPD-ORF were analyzed as described in Results.RNA isolation and analysis. BMA41 cells transformed with the appropriate plasmids were grown at 25\u00b0C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 to 0.8, and then total RNAs were extracted by the hot phenol method (56). For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel (48). The separated RNAs were blotted by capillarity and UV cross-linked to the membrane at 0.120 J/cm2 (BIO-LINK-BLX; Fisher Bioblock Scientific). RNAs were detected sequentially using either 5\u2032-end-labeled probes or a PMA1 random-primed probe (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). To perform a second hybridization, the radioactive probe was stripped off from the membrane by incubation at 75\u00b0C for 1 h in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5).RNase H mapping was carried out as described previously (53). Briefly, 10 \u03bcg of total RNAs was annealed with 300 ng of oligonucleotide N1 (between positions 3059 and 3082 of the PMA1 ORF) and 300 ng of oligo(dT)18 whenever necessary. Upon incubation with RNase H, RNAs were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gel, blotted onto a membrane by semidry blotting using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD apparatus, and UV cross-linked. To detect the PMA1 3\u2032 ends, the membrane was probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotide N2 (between positions 3117 and 3140 of the PMA1 ORF). The amount of PMA1 mRNA in each lane was normalized using 5.8S rRNA as a control. Hybridization signals were quantified with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were processed with Imagequant software, version 2005.Western blotting. BMA41 cells transformed with Rho-expressing plasmid were grown at 25\u00b0C to an OD600 of 1 in liquid medium containing various Dox concentrations. Proteins in whole-cell extract were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels along with a purified bacterial Rho protein (kindly provided by M. Boudvillain) and analyzed by Western blotting according to standard procedures (54). The Rho protein was detected with anti-Rho antibodies (a custom preparation from Eurogentec) and visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate; Pierce) according to standard procedures. RESULTSExpression of E. coli Rho factor is toxic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To study the effects of the bacterial termination factor under the dynamic conditions of transcription in living eukaryotic cells, we have expressed the E. coli Rho protein in the yeast nucleus under the control of a Dox-regulated TetO2 promoter within a centromeric plasmid harboring the constitutively expressed transactivator tTA. The gene encoding E. coli wild-type Rho was cloned by PCR amplification using appropriate primers that were devised to add an NLS at the C terminus of the protein. The growth of S. cerevisiae strain BMA41 containing the empty vector or the Rho expression construct (Rho-NLS) was studied by serial dilutions on selective agar plates in the presence (noninduced) or in the absence (induced) of the effector, Dox. In the effector-containing medium, cells harboring either plasmid grew equally well, whereas in the absence of Dox the growth of cells containing the Rho expression plasmid was inhibited (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A).1A). These results indicate that the expression of Rho protein in yeast is toxic and that the extent of Rho expression in our plasmid system can be lowered to a subtoxic level or switched off by Dox addition at an appropriate concentration (1 \u03bcg/ml). The tight regulation of the expression system and the toxic effect of Rho were revealed further by monitoring yeast growth in liquid medium containing different concentrations of the effector. As shown in Fig. \u200bFig.1B,1B, the gradual activation of the Tet promoter by decreasing the Dox concentration in the medium from 1 to 0.02 \u03bcg/ml progressively slowed the growth of yeast cells harboring the Rho expression plasmid. The growth inhibition trend parallels the amount of Rho protein produced in the yeast cells, as revealed by Western blot experiments (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1C1C).Open in a separate windowFIG. 1.Rho expression in the nucleus of yeast cells induces a dose-dependent growth defect. (A) Nuclear expression of Rho causes a growth defect in yeast. Strain BMA41 was transformed with the empty vector (pCM188) or the Rho expression constructs harboring the Rho gene fused with or deleted of the NLS (pCM188-Rho-NLS or pCM188-Rho-\u0394NLS) and the Rho mutant variant (pCM188-Rho-KE-NLS). Tenfold serial dilutions of transformants grown selectively in liquid medium at 25\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg/ml Dox (noninduced conditions) were spotted on Rho-repressing (+Doxy) or Rho-inducing (\u2212Doxy) plates. The plates were photographed after 3 days at 25\u00b0C. (B) Rho-induced toxicity is dose dependent. BMA41 cells transformed with pCM188-Rho-NLS were grown selectively at 25\u00b0C overnight in liquid medium with Dox concentrations ranging from 1 to 0.02 \u03bcg/ml for the progressive induction of Rho. Relative growth, which was set arbitrarily to 100 for the sample under Rho-repressing conditions, corresponds to the OD600 measured after 16 h of growth. (C) Rho production as a function of Dox concentration. BMA41 cells transformed with pCM185-Rho-NLS were grown at 25\u00b0C overnight in liquid medium. Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer, and the same amount of extract was resolved on each of two gels; one was stained with Coomassie blue, and the other one was analyzed by Western blotting. Lane 1, purified bacterial Rho protein; lane 2, low-molecular-weight-SDS marker (Amersham). Lanes 3 to 6 correspond to the yeast protein extracts from cells grown with 1, 0.08, 0.04, and 0.02 \u03bcg/ml Dox, respectively. (D) The Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin (bicyclo) relieves Rho-induced growth defect in yeast. BMA41 cells containing the pCM188-Rho-NLS expression vector were grown at 25\u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg/ml Dox to an OD600 of 0.6. Cells were washed, and equal amounts of cells were resuspended in repressive (+Doxy) or inducible (\u2212Doxy) liquid medium containing (+) or lacking (\u2212) bicyclomycin at a final concentration of 60 \u03bcg/ml. Relative growth, arbitrarily set to 100, corresponds to the OD600 measured after 12 h of growth under repressing conditions in medium lacking bicyclomycin.Conceivably, there are several possible mechanisms by which the heterologous expression of Rho could have generated a dose-dependent toxic effect in yeast. In an attempt to exclude any effect unrelated to the functional features of the termination factor, we performed growth measurements in the presence of the Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin. This antibiotic is known to inhibit Rho-dependent transcription termination in bacteria by binding to the functional hexameric form of the Rho factor and interfering with its ATPase activity (44, 62, 72). As shown in Fig. \u200bFig.1D,1D, the addition of bicyclomycin to the yeast culture fully relieved the growth defect of the strain expressing Rho and did not have any noticeable effect on the growth of the strain under repressing conditions or on that of the strain harboring the control vector. We next examined whether Rho-induced toxicity stems from a metabolic process arising within the nucleus, which is expected if Rho factor interferes with transcription. To this end, the DNA sequence encoding the NLS was deleted from the Rho expression plasmid, and the newly created construct (Rho-\u0394NLS) was introduced into the BMA41 yeast strain. The transformant spotted on agar plates recovered a full capacity to grow under inducing conditions (Fig. \u200b(Fig.1A).1A). Taken together, these results indicate that Rho-induced toxicity in yeast relies on the nuclear localization of the protein and presumably is linked to its functional characteristics in the bacterial transcription termination process.Rho-induced toxicity in yeast parallels its functional integrity as a transcription termination factor in bacteria. Among the various Rho mutants defective in bacterial transcription termination, the replacement of lysine 352 by glutamic acid in the rhosuA1 allele was shown to decrease the secondary-site RNA binding activity of hexameric Rho in vitro, leading to a defect in its ATPase and helicase activities (42, 46). Consistently with this, RhosuA1 has a reduced ability to terminate transcription in vitro and in vivo, presumably because its translocation along the RNA transcript is partially impaired. To evaluate whether Rho factor could function in yeast by a mechanism reminiscent of the Rho-dependent transcription termination process in bacteria, we tested whether the K352E replacement could diminish or suppress Rho toxicity. The wild-type rho allele in the Rho-NLS construct was replaced by the rhosuA1 allele (referred to as rho-KE), yielding the plasmid Rho-KE-NLS, which was introduced into the BMA41 strain. The growth test on selective agar plates was performed with this newly created plasmid in parallel with the two control plasmids (empty vector and the plasmid expressing wild-type Rho). As shown in Fig. \u200bFig.1A,1A, inducing the expression of Rho-KE protein in the yeast cells no longer was toxic compared to the expression of wild-type Rho, yet the growth was not fully restored compared to that of the empty vector. This intermediate effect (the mild growth defect phenotype) induced by the rho-KE allele was reproduced by monitoring cell growth in liquid medium at different concentrations of Dox. Moreover, as for wild-type Rho, Western blot analyses revealed a correlation between the observed growth lag and the amount of Rho-KE protein produced in the yeast cells. Additional Rho mutants with no marked effects on transcription termination in bacteria also were tested. The results indicated that the mutations that do not impair Rho activity in bacteria do not alleviate its toxic effect in yeast (data not shown).Rho expression in yeast affects steady-state mRNA levels. The ability of Rho factor to dissociate paused RNAP II ternary complexes in vitro (31) and the fact that the toxic effect induced by the expression of the protein in yeast requires its nuclear localization suggested that Rho toxicity is linked to its action on the transcription of one or several essential genes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured the steady-state abundance of different RNAs produced in cells harboring the Rho expression plasmid and grown at different concentrations of Dox (from 1 to 0.02 \u03bcg/ml). The levels of a set of RNA species were examined by Northern blot analyses (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2).2). The steady-state levels of RNAP I-transcribed rRNAs (18S and 5.8S) remained stable even when maximal Rho induction was achieved (0.02 \u03bcg/ml Dox), which is consistent with the lack of Rho effect during in vitro transcription with RNAP I (31). Similarly, the amounts of RNAs synthesized by RNAP III (scR1, 5S, and tRNAMet) were unchanged under Rho expression conditions. We note, however, that these steady-state measurements cannot exclude a small effect of Rho on transcription driven by RNAP I and RNAP III due to the high stability of the corresponding RNAs. In contrast, the steady-state levels of transcripts synthesized by RNAP II clearly were affected by increasing the extent of Rho expression. The greatest effect of Rho expression on the accumulation of RNAP II-dependent transcripts varied between a 60% reduction in the case of PMA1 transcript and a 30 to 40% reduction for the three other mRNAs tested (ACT1, PGK1, and FBA1). These observations lend support to our hypothesis that the toxic effect of Rho in yeast stems from its action on the expression of some essential genes transcribed by RNAP II. However, so far these results do not allow us to distinguish between a direct action of Rho on the transcription elongation complex that would lead to the premature termination of the transcripts and an effect of Rho associated with the production of defective mRNPs that subsequently would be identified and eliminated by the mRNA quality control system (see below).Open in a separate windowFIG. 2.Toxic effect of Rho is linked to its action on RNAP II-dependent transcription. Northern blot analyses of total RNAs extracted from cultures of BMA41 cells transformed with the empty vector or the Rho expression plasmid grown with various concentrations of Dox. Samples of total RNAs (6 \u03bcg) were fractionated on an agarose gel and transferred to a membrane, and the steady-state levels of specific RNAs were detected sequentially using the 5\u2032-end-labeled probes ACT1, PGK1, FBA1, 18S, 5.8S, scR1, 5S, and tRNAMET or a PMA1 random-primed probe (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).Rho-KE expression in yeast phenocopies hypersensitivity of transcription elongation mutants to nucleotide-depleting drugs. Mutations within RNAP II or transcription factors that cause transcript elongation defects can be revealed in yeast by growing the cells in the presence of nucleotide-depleting drugs such as mycophenolic acid (MPA) or 6-azauracil (6-AU). The reduction of cellular nucleotide pools leads to a decrease in both the rate and the processivity of RNA synthesis, which exacerbates transcription elongation defects (14, 37, 60).We hypothesized that if the growth defect induced by Rho in yeast results from its action on RNAP II-dependent transcript elongation, this effect should be aggravated in the presence of nucleotide-depleting drugs. The effect of the drugs was tested in a strain expressing the plasmidic rho-KE allele. This allele is particularly convenient for that purpose, since its intermediate effect (the mild growth defect phenotype) allows us to monitor cell growth by searching for synergistic sensitivity effects. To determine the effect of reducing nucleotides pools in cells expressing the rho-KE allele under the TetO2 promoter, a culture of transformed strain BMA41 was spotted on agar plates in the presence or absence of Dox and containing 0, 10, or 20 \u03bcg/ml MPA. Under Rho-KE expression conditions, an increased sensitivity to the nucleotide-depleting drug was observed, as evidenced by the inhibition of cell growth in the presence of MPA even at the lowest concentration tested (10 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. \u200b(Fig.3A).3A). Interestingly, the growth defect was alleviated significantly by the addition of guanine to the MPA-containing medium, confirming that the rho-KE allele renders the cells hypersensitive to the nucleotide-depleting drug through a transcription-related process. Similar results were obtained when the growth tests were performed with 6-AU at a concentration of 75 \u03bcg/ml (data not shown). These data show that the rho-KE allele in yeast phenocopies the MPA and 6-AU hypersensitivity of mutants with transcription elongation defects.Open in a separate windowFIG. 3.Rho-induced growth defect is aggravated in a slow RNAP II background. (A) The rho-KE allele phenocopies the MPA sensibility of elongation mutants. The BMA41 strain transformed with the plasmid expressing the rho-KE allele was grown under repressing conditions until an OD600 of 0.6. Tenfold serial dilutions were spotted for growth at 25\u00b0C under repressing (+Doxy) or inducing (\u2212Doxy) conditions with 0, 10, or 20 \u03bcg/ml MPA. When necessary, guanine (Gua) was added at 100 \u03bcg/ml. Plates were incubated for 2 days (\u2212MPA) or for 4 days (+MPA) at 25\u00b0C. (B) The mild growth defect induced by the rho-KE allele is exacerbated in slow RNAP II elongation mutants. Yeast cells harboring the wild-type isogenic strain and rpb2 mutant alleles were transformed with plasmids carrying the rho allele, the rho-KE allele, or the empty vector. The cells grown selectively under repressing conditions were serially diluted and spotted for growth at 25\u00b0C under inducing (\u2212Doxy) or repressing (+Doxy) conditions for 3 days.RNAP II mutants defective in transcription elongation exacerbate the Rho-KE-induced mild growth defect. If the hypersensitivity to MPA and 6-AU observed with the expression of Rho-KE protein is reminiscent of a deficiency in transcription elongation, then combining this mild growth defect allele with an RNAP II mutant defective in elongation should produce a synergistic severe growth defect phenotype similar to the phenotype observed with the expression of wild-type Rho. This idea was tested with a set of three isogenic mutant strains (rpb2-7, rpb2-10, and rpb2-4) having single-amino-acid substitutions in the second largest subunit of RNAP II and that have been well characterized in vitro and in vivo (9, 32, 37, 43). The rpb2-10 and rpb2-4 alleles encode catalytically slow forms of RNAP II that are characterized by an approximately twofold decrease in the elongation rate, low processivity, and an increase in transcriptional pausing. Conversely, no marked elongation defects were found for the rpb2-7 allele, suggesting that this mutation affects other steps in the transcription cycle, such as initiation (43). The growth tests depicted in Fig. \u200bFig.3B3B confirmed our hypothesis. As for the isogenic yeast cells harboring the wild-type RPB2 allele, the three mutant strains were sensitive to the expression of wild-type Rho protein. Interestingly, the growth of the catalytically deficient rpb2-10 and rpb2-4 mutants expressing the Rho-KE protein was severely impaired, whereas under the same conditions, no growth impairment was observed for both the wild-type RPB2 and the mutant rpb2-7 strains. These results indicate that the mild growth defect induced by the expression of Rho-KE is aggravated in a slow RNAP II mutant, leading to a synergistic severe growth defect phenotype. To exclude the possibility that the observed synergistic sensitivity is linked exclusively to mutations within the RPB2 subunit, we tested the mutant rpb1-N488D, which has an amino acid substitution in the largest subunit of RNAP II that leads to a decrease in the rate of RNA synthesis in vitro (36). Again, we found that the mild growth defect induced by the expression of Rho-KE is aggravated in this slow RNAP II mutant (results not shown).Increasing the elongation rate of RNAP II or decreasing its pausing propensity alleviates Rho-induced toxicity. Because the data described above indicate that the mild growth defect of the rho-KE allele is aggravated in a strain with a decreased RNAP II elongation rate, we reasoned that an increase in the elongation rate and/or a reduction in the pausing efficiency of the enzyme should circumvent Rho toxicity. To address this question, we tested two different yeast strains that have distinct mutations but similar phenotypes (i.e., fast RNAP II).A mutation in the gene encoding the largest subunit of RNAP II that significantly increases the RNA polymerization rate of the enzyme in vitro has been isolated recently in two independent screens (26, 36). This mutation (rpb1-E1103G) affects a residue located within the G loop, a highly conserved region close to the active center of the enzyme. Cells were transformed with plasmids expressing both the Rho and the rho-KE alleles under the galactose-dependent Gal1 promoter (the Gal system was used for selection convenience). As shown in Fig. \u200bFig.4A,4A, the expression of the Rho-KE protein did not induce any marked growth defect in the fast RNAP II mutant and the isogenic wild-type strains. Most importantly, the more severe growth defect resulting from the expression of the wild-type Rho protein in the wild-type yeast cells (RPB1) is partially relieved in the rpb1-E1103G genetic background, which indicates that this fast RNAP II is less sensitive to Rho action than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4A4A).Open in a separate windowFIG. 4.Rho-induced growth defect is alleviated in fast RNAP II mutants. (A) The fast RNAP II mutant (GRY 3028) and the isogenic wild-type strain (GRY 3020) were transformed with plasmids expressing Rho or the Rho-KE variant under the GAL1 promoter. The transformants were grown selectively under repressing conditions (glucose [Glu]), serially diluted, and spotted for growth at 25\u00b0C under inducing (galactose [Gal]) or repressing (glucose) conditions for 5 days. (B) The rpb9\u0394 strain was cotransformed with either the p-RPB9 plasmid or the parental vector pRS413 and the Rho expression plasmid or the empty vector. Growth conditions were the same as those described in the legend to Fig. \u200bFig.1A,1A, except that the spots with the rpb9\u0394 strain were photographed after 7 days of growth at 25\u00b0C due to the slow-growth phenotype of the Rpb9p-depleted cells.The second fast mutant tested is a strain lacking Rpb9p, a nonessential RNAP II subunit that was implicated in transcription elongation and transcriptional fidelity in vivo (19, 40). In vitro transcription experiments have shown that Rpb9-deficient RNAP II synthesizes RNA at the same velocity as the wild-type enzyme but stops less frequently at DNA sequences that promote the pausing of the transcription complex. This lower efficiency of pausing by Rpb9-deficient RNAP II leads to an increase of the overall rate of elongation by the polymerase (4).The plasmid expressing the wild-type Rho allele driven by the TetO2 promoter as well as the empty vector were transformed into an rpb9\u0394 strain, and growth tests were performed on selective agar plates under noninducing and inducing conditions. The results clearly show that, in the absence of the Rpb9p subunit, the expression of the bacterial Rho factor no longer is toxic to the yeast cells (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4B).4B). Moreover, the complementation of the rpb9\u0394 strain with a centromeric plasmid expressing the RPB9 gene under its own promoter severely reduced cell growth under Rho expression conditions, which is expected if Rho factor interferes with transcript elongation by the fully reconstituted RNAP II (Fig. \u200b(Fig.4B4B).Depletion of the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p relieves Rho-induced toxicity and restores the steady-state abundance of mRNAs to normal levels. If the reduction in the amount of full-length mRNA species observed for the four representative RNAP II-dependent transcripts (Fig. \u200b(Fig.2)2) results from Rho-induced premature transcription termination, this should be accompanied by the production of truncated mRNAs. However, we repeatedly failed to detect any prematurely terminated mRNAs by Northern blotting, even when using probes that cover the most 5\u2032-proximal parts of the transcripts. Moreover, the extent of full-length mRNA reduction observed for the representative transcripts was similar whether the blots were hybridized with a 5\u2032-proximal or a 3\u2032-proximal probe (results not shown). A possible explanation for these results could be that truncated transcripts do not accumulate because they are targeted by exosome-mediated degradation. In an attempt to stabilize the putative truncated transcripts, we expressed Rho protein in a yeast strain in which the gene encoding the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p was deleted. Surprisingly, growth test experiments revealed that Rho expression in yeast cells lacking Rrp6p is no longer toxic (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5A).5A). Western blot analyses indicated that the amount of Rho protein produced in the cells was unaffected by the Rrp6p depletion (results not shown), which excludes the possibility that the relief of the growth defect induced by the RRP6 knockout is linked to a decrease in Rho expression. Furthermore, as shown for one representative transcript (PMA1), the steady-state abundance of full-length mRNA in the rrp6\u0394 strain expressing Rho was restored to more than 95% of the normal level (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5B).5B). Numerous studies have shown that aberrantly processed transcripts are targets for nuclear exosome-mediated degradation (see Introduction and reference 67). In light of these previous findings, our results imply that the toxic effect of Rho in yeast stems from its interference in some mRNA processing and/or packaging events, leading to the production of defective mRNPs that are targeted and degraded by the nuclear quality control system. In support of this conclusion, the deletion of both AIR1 and AIR2 genes, which encode two components of the exosome-activating complex (TRAMP), likewise leads to relief of the Rho-induced growth defect as well as a complete restoration of PMA1 steady-state mRNA abundance (Fig. 5A and B).Open in a separate windowFIG. 5.Depletion of exosome components Rrp6p or Air1p and Air2p alleviates the Rho-induced growth defect and restores the level of steady-state PMA1 mRNA. (A) The rrp6\u0394 and air1\u0394 air2\u0394 mutants and the corresponding wild-type (WT) isogenic strains were transformed with the empty vector or the Rho expression plasmid. Growth tests were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. \u200bFig.1A.1A. (B) Northern blot analyses were performed as described in the legend to Fig. \u200bFig.2,2, with 10 \u03bcg of total RNAs extracted from the cells harboring the Rho expression plasmid and grown in the presence of 1, 0.08, and 0.02 \u03bcg/ml Dox. The membrane was hybridized sequentially with a PMA1 random-primed probe and a 5\u2032-end-labeled oligonucleotide for 18S rRNA, which serves as an internal control. (C) For the analysis of PMA1 mRNA 3\u2032 ends, total RNAs were annealed with oligonucleotide N1, which is specific to the PMA1 gene, and then treated with RNase H. Where specified, oligo(dT) was included to remove the poly(A) tails. After fractionation on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and transfer onto a nylon membrane, PMA1 mRNAs were visualized using radiolabeled oligonucleotide N2. nt, nucleotide.The Rho-induced decrease of the PMA1 steady-state mRNA level and its restoration in the rrp6\u0394 strain also was assessed by RNA 3\u2032-end examination following RNase H cleavage (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5C).5C). As expected, the analysis revealed that in the steady-state pool of mRNAs, a fraction still is polyadenylated with apparent size heterogeneity in the poly(A) tails. Interestingly, the poly(A) tails of mRNAs extracted from the rrp6\u0394 strain grown under Rho expression conditions appear to have a more pronounced heterogeneity, with a slight shift toward longer tails (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5C,5C, compare lanes 4 and 5). Given that a portion of the transcripts in the pool actually is defective but has not been degraded by the compromised exosome, this trend may reflect the Rho-induced mRNA aberrancies previously observed in the case of the TREX mutants (24, 33). The quantification of the steady-state abundance of the mRNAs obtained after poly(A) ablation [oligo(dT) treated] is in agreement with the Northern blot analysis of the full-length transcripts (Fig. \u200b(Fig.5C,5C, lanes 6 to 9).Screen for dosage suppressors of Rho-induced growth defect identifies numerous factors involved in transcription regulation, mRNA processing, and export. We reasoned that if Rho-induced toxicity in yeast results from its interference in mRNA processing and/or packaging events through a competition with the participating factors, the overexpression of some of these factors should alleviate the growth defect. To evaluate this idea, a yeast genomic library made within a high-copy-number plasmid was transformed into a yeast strain harboring the Dox-regulated Rho expression system. To increase the stringency of the screen, the Rho gene was driven by the strong TetO7 promoter instead of the TetO2 promoter. The transformed cells first were plated on Dox-containing medium (repressing conditions) to select for transformants, then replicated to Dox-free plates (inducing conditions) and screened for surviving colonies. Approximately 40,000 colonies were screened manually, and a total of 20 positive candidates were isolated, including one candidate that was isolated twice. The candidates were investigated by rescuing the plasmids in E. coli and analyzing the inserted genomic DNA. Subsequently, the ORFs contained within the suppressing genomic DNA fragments were cloned and tested individually for the dosage suppression of the Rho-induced growth defect in yeast. Based on the extent of growth defect alleviation, the 19 positive ORFs were categorized as strong, medium, and weak suppressors (Table \u200b(Table1).1). As shown with representative examples in Fig. \u200bFig.6,6, relief of the Rho-induced growth defect by the suppressors is accompanied by a partial restoration of the PMA1 steady-state mRNA abundance. The data obtained with the full set of suppressors are depicted in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. In most cases, the extent of PMA1 mRNA restoration parallels the strength of the growth defect suppression. However, for a few suppressors, only faint or no significant mRNA restoration was observed even when the stringency of the assay was decreased by expressing Rho from a TetO2 promoter (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The mRNA restoration by the suppressors was not evaluated systematically for the other transcripts (ACT1, PGK1, and FBA1). The amounts of Rho protein produced by the yeast cells harboring the dosage suppressor genes were analyzed by Western blotting, and the results excluded the possibility of a direct effect of the suppressors on Rho expression that would lead to growth defect mitigation.Open in a separate windowFIG. 6.Growth defect relief and partial PMA1 mRNA restoration by nine representative dosage suppressors. (A) The Rho-induced growth defect is relieved in strains that overexpress RNA1, RNA14, TAF14, MEX67, PCF11, SXM1, PEX30, YDR520c, and YIL152w ORFs. BMA41 strains cotransformed with pCM185-Rho-NLS and the episomal plasmids bearing the indicated ORFs were grown selectively under repressing conditions and spotted for growth as described in the legend to Fig. \u200bFig.1A.1A. w/o, without. (B) Overexpression of the ORFs induces a partial restoration of the steady-state level of PMA1 mRNA.

The effects were evaluated under stringent conditions of Rho expression (i.e., the TetO7 promoter).bIsolated twice during the screen.Remarkably, the hunt revealed 13 suppressor genes whose proteins have relatively well-known or predicted molecular functions that cover a broad spectrum of mRNA metabolism, ranging from transcription regulation to mRNA processing, packaging, and export. TAF14 is among the strongest suppressors. It encodes a protein that is a component of a number of different complexes involved in transcription regulation (TFIID, TFIIF, and mediator) as well as chromatin remodeling and modification (NuA3 and SWI/SNF). Two other genes (RAD3 and RAD26), with weak suppressing phenotypes and a faint restoration of PMA1 mRNA, encode proteins that also are involved in processes linked to transcription (transcription regulation and transcription-coupled repair). Two genes having medium suppressing phenotypes (RNA14 and PCF11) are involved in mRNA 3\u2032-end processing and transcription termination, and they encode two subunits of cleavage and polyadenylation factor I (CFIA). Four suppressor genes (SUB2, MEX67, MTR2, and MLP2) encode well-known components of mRNP nuclear export complexes that connect mRNA synthesis to translation. Whereas SUB2, MEX67, and MLP2 exhibit medium to strong suppressing phenotypes with significant PMA1 mRNA restoration, MTR2 is a weak suppressor. In addition, three other suppressor genes (CTL1, SXM1, and RNA1) are predicted to play a role in mRNA export from the nucleus. CTL1 encodes a nonessential 5\u2032-triphosphatase related to mRNA capping enzyme that previously was isolated in a two-hybrid screen and suspected to have a nuclear export activity (23, 47). The protein encoded by SXM1 was found to be concentrated in the nucleus and the nuclear envelope, and its overproduction relieves the defects of mRNA export mutants (59). RNA1 encodes an activator of the small GTPase (Gsp1p) that is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and its mutation was shown to cause the accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nucleus (5). Finally, TIF3 encodes the yeast homologue of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF4B, which was shown to have an RNA annealing activity in vitro (41).The screen reveals new factors with ill-defined or unknown molecular functions. The Rho-based screen also identified six suppressor genes whose products are listed in the S. cerevisiae Genome Data Base as proteins with putative functions that are unrelated to mRNA metabolism or proteins with unknown molecular functions. CCT7 encodes a component of a multisubunit complex that mediates protein folding and that recently was found to interact with components of the nuclear pore complex (10). RAX1 encodes a predicted integral membrane protein involved in bud site selection (25). KIN3 encodes a nonessential protein kinase with an unknown cellular role. Although these three suppressors (CCT7, RAX1, and KIN3) show medium suppressing phenotypes, the PMA1 mRNA restoration was hardly observed. PEX30 encodes a peroxisomal integral membrane protein with unknown molecular function. This medium suppressor induces a significant restoration of PMA1 mRNA. In addition, two uncharacterized ORFs with medium suppression phenotypes were revealed by the screen. YDR520c and YIL152w are supposed to encode putative transcription factors based on the predicted presence of a zinc cluster domain and a glutamine-rich domain, respectively. Although the two ORFs exhibit similar suppression phenotypes, they differ by the extent of PMA1 mRNA restoration. Whereas a significant amount of PMA1 mRNA was restored by YDR520c, only a faint amount was observed in the case of YIL152w. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that the conditional expression of Rho protein in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae leads to a dose-dependent growth defect phenotype. The growth defect is modulated by mutations in RNAP II that increase or decrease the rate of RNA synthesis, and it is suppressed when the Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin is added to the yeast culture or when the NLS is removed from the protein. Moreover, a point mutation in Rho that impairs its helicase/translocase activities and consequently reduces its termination efficiency in bacteria (the rho-KE allele) mitigates the growth defect in yeast. Taken together, our findings indicate that the defect induced by the heterologous expression of Rho in yeast stems from its action on RNAP II-mediated transcription and is associated with its functional characteristics in the bacterial transcription termination process, which include binding to a nascent transcript, followed by 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 translocation along the RNA chain to reach and disrupt transcription elongation complexes located at downstream sites.Our initial expectation was that Rho action in yeast would produce predominantly truncated transcripts by inducing the premature dissociation of transcription elongation complexes, as occurs in bacteria. However, although minor Rho-dependent premature termination events that would generate short-lived truncated transcripts cannot be excluded, the molecular analyses of the steady-state abundance of representative RNAs support an alternative outcome in which Rho activity affects the integrity of seemingly complete transcripts, leading to their degradation by the nuclear exosome. This is revealed by the fact that the loss of full-length mRNAs observed in the presence of Rho factor is totally offset in yeast strains having compromised nuclear exosome activity (the rrp6\u0394 mutant or air1\u0394 air2\u0394 double mutant). The precise molecular features that make mRNAs targets for exosome-mediated degradation in the presence of Rho activity presently are unclear. Nevertheless, based on the functional characteristics of the bacterial factor, it is likely that the loading of Rho onto nascent transcripts and its subsequent tracking along the RNA chains outcompete the deposition of the endogenous processing and packaging factors. This should lead to the production of mRNPs that are improperly processed or depleted of some crucial proteins, and that will be recognized as export incompetent and eliminated by the exosome-mediated nuclear mRNA quality control system. Interestingly, the effects induced by Rho expression closely resemble those reported for yeast strains with defects in mRNA 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation or mRNP assembly and export machineries in which RNAP II-dependent transcription produces full-length, yet export-incompetent, transcripts that are targeted and degraded by the nuclear mRNA quality control system (21, 33, 38, 50). Recent studies of such mutant strains suggest that the recognition of defective transcripts by the quality control system is triggered by inefficient polyadenylation, a step preceding the commitment to nuclear export at which kinetic competition between mRNA 3\u2032-end processing and degradation will favor the removal of aberrant transcripts (49, 52). Whether a similar mechanism applies for the Rho-induced exosome sensitivity of the transcripts remains to be determined. In effect, our examination of the 3\u2032 ends of the PMA1 steady-state mRNA pool did not allow us to draw a clear conclusion as to a possible involvement of inefficient polyadenylation in the targeting of Rho-induced aberrant transcripts by the quality control system. Similar inconclusive results also were obtained in analyses of steady-state pools of the other mRNAs tested. A more conclusive study will require the use of a model transcription unit having an inducible promoter for closer analyses of the poly(A) tails within de novo-synthesized transcripts.Our experiments with RNAP II mutants and nucleotide-depleting drugs show a correlation between the rate of RNA synthesis and the severity of a Rho-induced growth defect. Slower-transcribing RNAP II complexes are more easily targeted by Rho, whereas faster-transcribing complexes seem to escape Rho action. The first implication of these results is that Rho action that leads to the production of exosome-sensitive mRNPs obviously is taking place during transcript elongation, which supports the current view of physical and functional interconnections between transcription elongation and mRNP biogenesis. This also indicates that there is probably a time window within which Rho can load onto a nascent transcript, and which is dependent on the overall speed of the transcribing polymerase. Notably, the relief of the Rho-induced growth defect in an rpb9\u0394 strain, in which transcribing RNAP II is known to have a lesser propensity to dwell at intrinsic pause sites, suggests that the time window for Rho loading is connected with the pausing of the transcription elongation complex. Candidates for such pausing events that may allow efficient Rho loading are the two well-documented transitions experienced by the transcription complex at the 5\u2032 end and the 3\u2032 end of the genes, where a dynamic exchange of factors around the nascent transcript occurs (6, 17, 55). Pausing at the promoter-proximal region serves to ensure the correct capping of the emerging transcript and the recruitment of the early mRNP assembly proteins, whereas pausing at the 3\u2032 end of the genes is required to recruit the termination and polyadenylation factors (27, 28, 30). The initial binding of Rho to the transcript may constitute the first interference in the mRNA processing and packaging events by a direct competition with the participating factors. However, a full interference in the mRNP biogenesis process requires the tracking of the protein along the RNA chain, as suggested by the growth defect mitigation induced by a point mutation in Rho that impairs somewhat its helicase/translocase activities (the rho-KE allele).How does Rho action affect cell growth? Since Rho has a fairly loose sequence requirement for its loading onto a transcript (see Introduction), it is expected to target a large spectrum of mRNAs. Indeed, a genome-wide survey of the yeast transcriptome by DNA microarray did not reveal any specific genes or a subset of genes as hotspots of the Rho-mediated effect (unpublished results). Apparently, Rho acts as a global disturber of gene expression in yeast. In this view, each Rho-induced interference that produces a defective mRNP will hinder the corresponding metabolic pathway, adding an extra impairment to normal cell physiology. The cumulative effect of all Rho-induced interferences should produce a growth defect phenotype that is modulated by varying the extent of Rho expression. This reasoning led us to screen a yeast genomic library for dosage suppressors of the Rho-induced growth defect, with the idea that the overproduction of a protein partner for which an mRNP was defective could shift its competition with Rho and thus provide a partial relief of the growth defect. The rationale of this Rho-based screen was largely validated by the fact that almost 50% of the suppressor genes identified (9 out of 19) encode proteins involved in mRNA 3\u2032-end formation or mRNP assembly and export. In effect, two suppressors (RNA14 and PCF11) are important components of the cleavage factor CFIA that are known to be recruited to the transcript at the 3\u2032 end of the genes. Four other suppressors (SUB2, MEX67, MTR2, and MLP2) are well-known factors that interact with the transcript and participate in the network of proteins linking mRNA synthesis to translation. Three additional suppressors (CTL1, SXM1, and RNA1) have been predicted by genetic and biochemical screens to play a role in mRNP nuclear export (5, 23, 47, 59). A common action of these suppressors could be to increase the speed at which the mRNPs are transported into the cytoplasm for translation. Such action would help defective mRNPs escape degradation by the nuclear quality control system.In addition to a direct validation of the assay, the Rho-based screen revealed three suppressors (TAF14, RAD3, and RAD26) that are known to be involved directly or indirectly in transcription regulation. The most robust suppressor, TAF14, encodes a subunit of the initiation factors TFIID, TFIIF, and mediator, and we speculate that its suppressing effect stems from a significant increase of both the transcription rate and the number of transcription events within the targeted genes. According to the model of cooperation between RNAP molecules transcribing in tandem (13), increasing the number of initiation events will decrease pausing efficiency and duration, and this will reduce the opportunity for Rho to load onto nascent transcripts. This anti-pausing effect of TAF14 also could be explained by its known participation in chromatin remodeling complexes. Although it has only a modest suppressing phenotype, RAD3 may act by a similar mechanism, as it encodes a subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH, and its genetic interaction with components of the mRNP assembly machinery was reported previously (21, 22). RAD26 encodes a DNA helicase that is involved in transcription-coupled repair, and its deletion results in a synthetic growth defect with the deletion of the exosome component gene RRP6, which suggests its connection with mRNA metabolism (20). This connection of transcription-coupled repair with mRNP biogenesis and export also was highlighted by a recent study (16).The Rho-based screen also revealed suppressors with ill-defined or unknown molecular functions. Three genes seem to encode integral membrane proteins (RAX1 and PEX30) or a protein interacting with the nuclear pore complex (CCT7). These intriguing findings could be explained within the framework of the emerging view that gene transcription and the concomitant mRNP biogenesis and export are linked physically to the nuclear envelope and the nuclear pore complex (11, 65). One possibility is that the overproduction of such suppressors helps the export of a subset of Rho-induced defective mRNPs that are otherwise translatable and thus will partake in the growth defect relief. The functions of two uncharacterized ORFs (YDR520c and YIL152w) identified by the screen remain to be determined. However, based on the prediction that they encode putative transcription factors, it is possible that their suppressing effect results from a mechanism similar to the one discussed for TAF14.In summary, our study shows that the use of bacterial Rho factor in yeast represents a valuable approach to examine the interplay between transcription, mRNP biogenesis, and export. The results clearly support the idea of functional and physical interconnections between the different activities of mRNA synthesis, processing, packaging, and export, and they provide a proof of principle of an assay that can be used to screen for new factors involved in these integrated processes. The Rho-based screen also provides a new tool to dissect the in vivo dynamics of known mRNA processing and binding proteins around the transcript, which will help us to comprehend the contributions of each factor in the network of interactions within an mRNP.
