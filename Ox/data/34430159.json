The United States has reported the largest number of cases, and as of July 13, 2021, there were 33,726,363\u00a0COVID-19 cases with 605,140 deaths [3]. Robust research has resulted in a better understanding of the natural history of the disease, characteristics of patients, and predictors of outcomes. Despite this, there is still a need for more evidence data regarding characteristics and outcomes of those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), particularly in the United States.\u00a0Preliminary studies suggest that up to 6% of COVID-9 patients in the US required ICU admission, conferring the highest mortality to this group [4].Allegheny Health Network (AHN) is one of the largest consortiums of academic urban and non-academic rural hospitals in Western Pennsylvania and has been at the forefront of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania [5-7]. Up to July 13, 2021, the state of Pennsylvania reported 1,214,654\u00a0COVD-19 cases with 27,769\u00a0deaths, however, characteristics specific to severely ill patients have not been published [8].\u00a0In this context; the present study was conducted to describe the initial experience with regards to the clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs across a large health system.\u00a0Factors associated with mortality in this population were also identified. Materials and methodsA retrospective study was conducted of consecutive patients diagnosed with a COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test via nasal swab admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort included patients transferred to ICU for escalation of care and direct admissions from the emergency department. For patients with readmissions, only index hospitalization due to COVID-19 is included in this study. Patient disposition to the ICU was determined by the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or the clinical judgment of providers. The severity of illness was determined by sequential organ assessment failure (SOFA) and the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation 2\u00a0(APACHE 2) scoring system.The AHN Institutional Review Board approved the study and waived the need for informed consent. Deidentified data collection was performed from the electronic health record system (Epic) and included patient demographics, medical history, home medications, clinical presentation characteristics, and treatment strategies.\u00a0The symptoms were grouped into the following categories: constitutional (anorexia, fever, chills, myalgia or arthralgia, and fatigue), upper respiratory tract (sore throat, nasal congestion, anosmia, and dysgeusia), lower respiratory tract (cough, dyspnea, sputum, hemoptysis), and others (chest pain, palpitation, lightheadedness, syncope, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, conjunctival injection, altered mental status, headache, and muscle weakness). Headache was included in the \u201cothers\u201d category, as it could be both a constitutional and a neurological symptom. Comorbidities were classified as follows: cardiovascular (congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, valvular disease, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, other cardiac diseases), pulmonary (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, other lung diseases), renal disease (chronic kidney disease, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis). Charlson-comorbidity index (CCI) was also calculated for analysis.The primary outcome was mortality during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included complications during the ICU stay (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, acute kidney injury, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), bleeding, and cardiac arrest), hospital length of stay, discharge disposition (home versus assisted care facility), and oxygen need at discharge. ARDS was defined using the Berlin Criteria (presence of acute respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to a fraction of inspired oxygen <300 with\u00a0>5 cm water of positive-end expiratory pressure, and absence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [9]. Acute kidney injury was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl, a percentage increase in serum creatinine of more than or equal to 50% (1.5-fold from baseline), or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than six hours) [10].Categorical outcomes are described in percentages and continuous variables with median and interquartile range (IQR). Univariate logistic regression analysis for mortality was performed for variables with at least 20 observations. Multivariate regression was not performed due to the small sample size and established interactions among different variables resulting in a model that may not add meaningful additional information to the existing results. Results are represented as odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for applicable variables. Statistical tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance was defined as\u00a0p-value\u2009<\u2009.05. Analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Since the analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and is prone to type-I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory. ResultsCharacteristics of patients admitted to ICUPatient characteristics are outlined in Table \u200bTable1.1. The cohort included 58 patients, with a median age of 62 years (IQR 54-73), and included 37 (63.8%) males. The majority of patients were non-Hispanic White (60.3%) followed by non-Hispanic Black (29.3%). Constitutional symptoms were reported by 91.4% while 87.9% reported lower respiratory tract symptoms, and 20.7% reported upper respiratory symptoms. Common comorbidities included cardiovascular disease (74.1%), obesity (53.5%), and diabetes (39.7%). The median CCI was 1 (IQR 0-2).Table 1Characteristics for patients admitted with COVID-19 to the ICUa Continuous variables are reported as median (IQR) and categorical variables as frequency (percentage).IQR=Interquartile Range;\u00a0HCP=Healthcare Provider; BMI=Body Mass Index; ACE=Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme; ARB=Angiotensin Receptor Blocker;\u00a0CXR=Chest X-Ray; AST=Aspartate Aminotransferase; ALT=Alanine Transaminase; APACHE 2=Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 2;\u00a0SOFA=Sequential Organ Assessment FailureCharacteristicsValue a\nAge (in years)62 (54-73) yearsMale37 (63.8%)Race\u00a0\u00a0Non-Hispanic White35 (60.3%)\u00a0Non-Hispanic Black17 (29.3%)\u00a0Hispanic2 (3.5%)\u00a0Other/Unknown4 (6.9%)Symptoms\u00a0\u00a0Constitutional53 (91.4%)\u00a0Lower respiratory symptoms51 (87.9%)\u00a0Upper respiratory symptoms12 (20.7%)\u00a0Other systems/nonspecific symptoms38 (65.5%)Comorbidities\u00a0\u00a0Cardiovascular43 (74.1%)\u00a0Obesity (BMI>30kg/m2)31 (53.5%)\u00a0Diabetes23 (39.7%)\u00a0Pulmonary9 (15.5%)\u00a0Renal\u00a08 (13.8%)Other23 (39.7%)ACE/ARB22 (37.9%)Smoking\u00a0\u00a0Active smoker23 (39.7%)Admission Vitals\u00a0\u00a0Temperature>38 degree-Celsius17 (29.3%)\u00a0Heart rate>100 beats per minute27 (46.6%)\u00a0Respiratory rate>20 breaths per minute38 (65.5%)\u00a0Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) < 90\u00a01 (1.7%)\u00a0Hypoxia at presentation39 (67.2%)Abnormal CXR (n=52)44 (84.6%)Hospital admission Abnormal Lab Findings\u00a0AST/ALT>40 U/L36 (62.1%)Absolute lymphocyte count<0.60k/mcl17 (29.3%)Hospital admission labs\u00a0\u00a0White blood cell count k/mcl6.8 (5.8-10.5)\u00a0Creatinine mg/dl1.1 (0.8-1.5)\u00a0Procalcitonin ng/ml (n=44)0.2 (0.1-0.4)\u00a0Lactate dehydrogenase U/l (n=34)503 (377-778)\u00a0D-dimer mg/ml (n=31)1.5 (1.1-3.8)\u00a0Pro-brain natriuretic peptide pg/ml (n=29)291 (131-2557)\u00a0C-reactive protein mg/dl (n=28)11.9 (6.4-17.4)Erythrocyte sedimentation rate mm/hour (n=6)51 (29-84)ICU Admission severity of illness\u00a0\u00a0APACHE 2 (40)11 (8.5-17.5)\u00a0SOFA (44)3 (2-5)Treatment Strategies received\u00a0Hydroxychloroquine45 (77.6%)Empiric antibiotics44 (75.9%)Mechanical ventilation34 (58.6%)Vasopressor use24 (41.4%)Steroids20 (34.5%)Neuromuscular blockade use11 (19.0%)Proning10 (37.9%)\u00a0Blood transfusion9 (15.5%)Renal replacement therapy5 (8.6%)Plasmapheresis4 (6.9%)Intravenous immunoglobulin3 (5.2%)Mechanical circulatory support1 (1.7%)Open in a separate windowUpon presentation, 65.5% patients were tachypneic, 67.2% were hypoxic, and 46.6% were tachycardic. Important admission laboratory abnormalities included transaminitis in 62.1% of patients, lymphopenia in 29.3%, and abnormal chest X-ray in 84.6% of patients among those who had the test performed.The most common abnormal chest X-ray finding was interstitial opacities in 86.3% (38 of 44 patients). Fourteen patients had admission chest computed tomography (CT) and were 100% abnormal. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer) were not obtained in all patients but were elevated in those measured.\u00a0The median APACHE 2 score at admission to ICU was 11 (IQR 8.5-17.5), and the sequential assessment of organ failure score was 3 (IQR 2-5). Table \u200bTable11 summarizes the characteristics of patients admitted to ICU.ICU treatmentsFollowing admission to the ICU, 58.6% required mechanical ventilation, 41.4% required vasopressor support, 8.6% needed renal replacement therapy, and one patient needed mechanical circulatory support (Table \u200b(Table1).1). Pharmacological treatment strategies included hydroxychloroquine in 77.6%, empiric antibiotics in 75.9%, steroids in 34.5%, plasmapheresis in 6.9%, and intravenous immunoglobulin in 5.2% of patients.ICU outcomes and predictors of inpatient mortalityOverall, inpatient mortality was 32.8% in our cohort. The major complications included: ARDS in 50.0%, shock in 41.4%, AKI in 41.4%, venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) in 7.0%, and bleeding in 6.9% patients. The median total length of stay for this cohort was 11.5 days (IQR 5-20). Median length of stay in the ICU was six days (IQR 3-16) to 13 days (4-21) for survivors versus five days (IQR 2-11) for non-survivors. Among survivors, 63.2% were discharged home\u00a0and 34.2% to assisted care facility. Additionally, 44.7% patients had a new oxygen requirement upon discharge.

The majority of patients had constitutional and lower respiratory tract symptoms at presentation, and more than 60% had respiratory distress at presentation [11-12,14,16-17]. Similarly, the cohort had abnormally elevated levels of inflammatory markers (D-dimer, CRP, ESR) at presentation. A definitive comparison of biomarkers in terms of risks for ICU admission or mortality cannot be made, as it was recognized late in the study period that admission and daily levels of these biomarkers were warranted in all patients [13]. Future studies\u00a0have reported that\u00a0older patients, the presence of type-2 diabetes, cancer, in-hospital complications (such as acute kidney injury, sepsis/septic shock, multiorgan dysfunction), and higher D-dimer > 5,000 ng/mL are associated with higher mortality.\u00a0Although the prevalence of lymphocytopenia is lower than previously reported (63%-70%), it is associated with increased mortality [11,13,16-19]. Our study also found a statistically significant relationship between tachypnea with mortality. These factors should be considered when risk-stratifying patients.A higher rate of comorbidities (58-86%) has been reported in this patient group [12,15,19-20]. Common comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Early studies from China, Italy, and New York on COVID-19 patients have shown an association of case fatality with medical comorbidities, and investigators from Italy demonstrated the potential relationship of comorbidities such as hypertension with mechanical ventilation parameters [12,15,19-20]. In the current study, comorbidities were not associated with mortality, however, the cumulative effect of comorbidities in terms of CCI and age were associated with increased mortality [17,20-21]. The lack of direct correlation between types of comorbidities and outcomes could present a type-1 error, again, due to the small sample size of this study.Once admitted to the ICU, patients suffered a multitude of complications, including ARDS, shock, and renal failure, which increased the risk for mortality similar to other studies [18,21]. The mortality in the present study was 33%. The rates for critically ill COVID-19 patients from other centers are variable, as follows in descending order:\u00a067% (Seattle, Arentz\u00a0et al.), 62% (China, Yang\u00a0et al.), 50% (Seattle, Bhatraju et al.), 40% (New York, Cummings et al.), 39% (Italy, Grasselli et al.), 39% (China, Wang et al.), 38% (China, Huang et al.), 31% (Atlanta, Sara et al.), and 14% (California, Ferguson et al.) [11-12,14-18,21-22]. The association of mechanical ventilation, the need for vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy with mortality may simply indicate the effect of the multiorgan failure but also suggests that despite aggressive management, there is a high risk for treatment failure leading to death. Other studies from the US and Italy also indicate a high incidence of ARDS and a high rate of mechanical ventilation (60%-88%) [1,11-12,14-15,21,22]. Mechanical ventilation rates were lower in early studies from China:\u00a015% (Huang et al.), 42% (Yang et al.), and 47% (Wang et al.) [13,16,18]. This variability could represent the differences in population characteristics, as well as the provision of care, including the use of non-invasive ventilation strategies. There is also a possibility that analyses in several of the above-cited studies included patients who were still admitted to the hospital at the time of the study, resulting in underestimation of mortality and morbidity.\u00a0Nearly half of patients required oxygen at discharge, however, the long-term need for oxygen is unknown, as is the ultimate impact on pulmonary physiology. Specific aspects of treatment such as strategies used for mechanical ventilation, types, and doses of vasopressors\u00a0are beyond the scope of this study.Lastly, since this study represents patients admitted during the earlier phases of COVID-19, treatment strategies did not include remdesivir, interleukin 6 (IL-6) antagonists, convalescent plasma, or dexamethasone, which are now commonly utilized [23]. The higher rate of mortality among those requiring steroids was likely a surrogate for the severity of illness for these patients and is similar to observational studies in pneumonia caused by COVID-19, as well as other phylogenetically similar viruses [14,19].\u00a0Hydroxychloroquine was used for the majority of patients, and at least in unadjusted comparison, did not appear to impact survival. Another aspect to be explored is the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In an Italian study of critically ill COVID-19 patients, 11% with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were managed with NIV [11]. The use and impact of NIV on outcomes were not included in this study.The limitations of the present study include those inherent to retrospective study design such as recall biases, indication biases, and the presence of uncharacterized confounding factors. While a multivariate regression analysis could have helped identify how various factors impacted mortality in a combined model, it was not performed due to the complexity of the resultant model, which failed to significantly add to the presented results. We plan to perform this in the future with a larger dataset. The follow-up was limited to the inpatient hospital stay and did not capture complications or readmission post-discharge. The data included are from eight different hospitals with a mix of urban academic and rural community hospitals. Variations may exist due to the practice and population patterns of the individual hospitals. ConclusionsThe present study contributes to the growing body of data on the characteristics and outcomes for COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.\u00a0COVID-19 was associated with high mortality and complication rates. Several factors associated with adverse outcomes were identified in the present study. Further investigations are needed to assess the predictive factors that drive mortality to better refine treatment strategies.
