{"title": "Cisatracurium attenuates LPS-induced modulation of MMP3 and junctional protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.5582/bst.2020.03399", "PMID": "33627570", "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with hypoxemic lung damage and inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase protein-3 (MMP3 or Stromelysin-1) is known to promote vascular injury in ALI/ARDS. Cisatracurium, a nicotinic neuromuscular blocker, is used in ARDS patients to decrease mechanical ventilator dyssynchrony, increase oxygenation, and improve mortality. However, the magnitude and the underlying mechanisms of these potential benefits of cisatracurium remains unclear. We investigated the effect of cisatracurium on lipopolysaccharide-induced MMP3 expression in human microvascular endothelial cells. In our results, cisatracurium treatment significantly decreased LPS-induced MMP3 expression and increased expression of cell junction proteins such as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and claudin-5.", "author": [{"author": "Rana W Kadry", "affiliation": ["Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Georgia, and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Kadry+RW&cauthor_id=33627570"}, {"author": "Mir S Adil", "affiliation": ["Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Georgia, and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Adil+MS&cauthor_id=33627570"}, {"author": "Andrea Sikora Newsome", "affiliation": ["Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Georgia, and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Newsome+AS&cauthor_id=33627570"}, {"author": "Payaningal R Somanath", "affiliation": ["Clinical and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Georgia, and Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA, USA."], "href": "/?term=Somanath+PR&cauthor_id=33627570"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["33627570"], "body": ""}
