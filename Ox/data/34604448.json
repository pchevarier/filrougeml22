{"title": "U2.3 Precursor Small Nuclear RNA in vitro Processing Assay", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.21769/BioProtoc.4142", "PMID": "34604448", "abstract": "Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are vital for eukaryotic cell activities and play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing. The molecular mechanism underlying the transcription of snRNA, regulated via upstream/downstream cis-elements and relevant trans-elements, has been investigated in detail using cell-free extracts. However, the processing of precursor snRNA (pre-snRNA), which is required by 3' end maturation of pre-snRNA, remains unclear as a proper processing assay is difficult to develop in vitro. Here, we present an in vitro method using synthetic labeled RNA as substrates to study the 3' cleavage of pre-snRNA.", "author": [{"author": "Chan Lin", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Lin+C&cauthor_id=34604448"}, {"author": "Yujie Feng", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Feng+Y&cauthor_id=34604448"}, {"author": "Xueyan Peng", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Peng+X&cauthor_id=34604448"}, {"author": "Jiaming Wu", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Wu+J&cauthor_id=34604448"}, {"author": "Weili Wang", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Wang+W&cauthor_id=34604448"}, {"author": "Yunfeng Liu", "affiliation": ["State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, 100 Daxue Road, Nanning, Guangxi 530004, China."], "href": "/?term=Liu+Y&cauthor_id=34604448"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["34604448"], "body": ""}
