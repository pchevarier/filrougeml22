INTRODUCTIONSingle-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) are indispensable for many aspects of DNA metabolism including replication, repair and recombination, and play a vital role in the maintenance of genomic stability in all three domains of life (1,2). SSBs are characterized by the presence of one or more OB (oligosaccharide\u2013oligonucleotide binding) fold domains. OB folds consist of a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet that is coiled to form a closed \u03b2-barrel, often capped by an \u03b1-helix (2,3). They range in length from 75\u2013150 residues with much of the length variation being due to the presence of variable loop regions located between structurally conserved \u03b2-strands, and display only a low level of primary sequence similarity (2). In addition to SSBs, where ssDNA binding is not sequence-specific, OB folds are also found in other contexts, for example in proteins that bind ssDNA in a sequence-specific manner such as the bacterial transcriptional terminator Rho. A number of structures of OB fold\u2013DNA complexes have been solved, revealing the molecular details of the protein\u2013ssDNA interaction. Particularly important are stacking interactions between the side chains of conserved aromatic amino acids and unpaired nucleotides (4).SSBs display a wide variety of domain and subunit organizations across evolution (2). In bacteria, almost all SSB proteins comprise a single N-terminal OB fold and a relatively short, flexible C-terminal tail that mediates protein\u2013protein interactions. Individual bacterial SSB proteins assemble into homotetrameric complexes. Eukaryotic mitochondrial SSBs closely resemble bacterial SSBs, indicative of their likely evolutionary origin. In some bacterial lineages, SSB proteins with two OB folds are found: these proteins form homodimers and thus have four OB folds per complex, similar to the homotetrameric SSB complexes described above (2).In eukaryotes, the major cellular SSB is replication protein A (RPA), a conserved heterotrimeric complex comprising the RPA70, RPA32 and RPA14 proteins (5). RPA70 contains four OB-fold motifs, and RPA32 and RPA14 one each, although only four of these six OB folds actually bind ssDNA, the remaining two being involved in mediating protein\u2013protein interactions. In addition to the OB folds, RPA32 also possesses an extended N-terminal domain and a C-terminal winged helix\u2013turn\u2013helix (wHTH) domain, both of which are involved in protein\u2013protein interactions. The N-terminal domain is also a target for regulatory phosphorylation (1). In addition to the canonical RPA, alternative RPA (aRPA) complexes are also found in various eukaryotic lineages, including mammals (6,7) and plants (8) and the structurally similar CST (Cdc13\u2013Stn1\u2013Ten1) complex plays a key role in telomere maintenance (9). Two additional metazoan SSBs that function in the cellular response to DNA damage have also been identified; these proteins (hSSB1 and hSSB2) contain a single OB fold only (10\u201313).In the third domain of life, the archaea, SSBs displaying a wide variety of architectures have been identified and characterized from species representative of several major lineages. The methanogenic euryarchaeal species Methanosarcina acetivorans encodes three RPA proteins termed MacRPA1\u2013MacRPA3, each of which appears capable of self-assembling into a homomultimeric complex (14\u201318). MacRPA1 contains four tandem OB folds while MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 consist of two OB folds and a CX2CX8CX2H zinc finger motif (Figure 1). Mutation of individual conserved cysteine or histidine residues in the MacRPA3 zinc finger reduces ssDNA binding (16). The combination of OB folds and zinc fingers is seen in other methanogenic RPA proteins including Methanopyrus kandleri RPA (which resembles MacRPA2 and MacRPA3, with two OB folds and a zinc finger) (17), Methanocaldococcus jannaschii RPA (four OB folds and a zinc finger) (19) and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus RPA (five OB folds and a zinc finger), in RPA proteins from non-methanogenic species such as Ferroplasma acidarmanus and Thermoplasma volcanium (two OB folds and a zinc finger) (20) and Pyrococcus furiosus (one OB and a zinc finger), as well as in the eukaryotic RPA70 protein (four OB folds and a zinc finger) (5). In addition to MacRPA1, RPA proteins lacking zinc finger motifs are also seen in a broad range of archaeal organisms. In contrast to the complexity seen with the euryarchaeal SSB proteins, the best characterized crenarchaeal SSB, from the thermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus, contains only a single OB fold followed by a flexible C-terminal tail that is not required for ssDNA binding (21). Similar structures are predicted for other crenarchaeal SSB proteins.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 1.SSB proteins.

Protein lengths are indicated.Acquiring a detailed understanding of the function of the archaeal RPA proteins will require a combination of in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical and biophysical approaches. To date, however, only a handful of archaeal species have proved tractable to molecular genetic analysis (22). Among these, the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii has proved particularly useful. This organism is easy to culture in the lab, growing aerobically with an optimal growth temperature of 42\u201345\u00b0C in medium containing 18% NaCl and a generation time of 2\u20133\u2009h. A range of molecular tools and methods have been developed to facilitate genetic analysis in Hfx. volcanii, including selectable markers, shuttle vectors, transformation methods, a regulatable promoter, etc. (22). The complete sequence of the Hfx. volcanii genome has been determined and is publically available (23). Hfx. volcanii also has a natural system of genetic exchange (24,25) that can offer an additional route for strain construction (26).In this paper, we present the first genetic analysis of RPA function in any archaeal organism using Hfx. volcanii as a model system. We identify Hfx. volcanii genes encoding homologues of the biochemically characterized M. acetivorans RPA proteins MacRPA1\u2013MacRPA3 and show that while the related Hfx. volcanii RpaA1 and RpaB1 proteins (homologues of M. acetivorans MacRPA2 and MacRPA3) are individually non-essential for cell viability, they appear to share an essential function. In contrast, Hfx. volcanii RpaC (homologue of M. acetivorans MacRPA1) is essential for cell viability on its own; however, the effects of reduced RpaC expression can be overcome by increased expression of RpaB. In addition, we demonstrate the importance for the OB folds of RpaC for its function and roles for the non-essential N- and C-terminal domains of RpaC in surviving DNA damage. Consistent with a role for RpaC in DNA repair, we show that elevated expression of RpaC leads to enhanced resistance to DNA damage. Our results represent an important first step towards obtaining a full understanding of the diverse roles performed by the multiple SSB proteins found in haloarchaeal cells.

For selection procedures, tryptophan and/or thymidine and hypoxanthine were added to Hv-Ca and Hv-Min medium at a final concentration of 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml for tryptophan and thymidine and 40\u2009\u03bcg/ml for hypoxanthine. For counter-selection using 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), Hv-Ca or Hv-Min was supplemented with uracil and 5-FOA at final concentrations of 10\u2009\u03bcg/ml and 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Hgm. borinquense DSM11551 and Hqr. walsbyi DSM16790 were grown in medium recommended by the DSMZ.E. coli were grown in LB medium (Formedium) supplemented when necessary with ampicillin at 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml.Plasmids for gene deletionsPlasmids for gene deletion were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying regions of \u223c500\u2009bp from 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the region to be deleted using Hfx. volcanii DS70 genomic DNA as template. Details of the oligonucleotides used (P1\u2013P12) can be found in Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were then restricted with EcoRI and BamHI (5\u2032 flanking region for rpaA and rpaB operons, 3\u2032 flanking region for rpaC ORF) or BamHI and SpeI (5\u2032 flanking region for rpaC, 3\u2032 flanking region for rpaA and rpaB) and ligated together into EcoRI- and SpeI-digested plasmid pTA131 (27). The resulting plasmids (PL5, PL7 and PL9, Supplementary Table S2) were sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted sequence changes. Next, BamHI or BamHI\u2013BglI restriction fragments carrying the trpA+ or hdrB+ selectable marker genes from plasmids pTA230 (27) and pBBHrdB, respectively, were then cloned into the unique BamHI site located in the centre of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions. Plasmid pBBHrdB is a derivative of pTA187 (27) in which a BglI site has been introduced downstream of the hdrB+ gene to ease subsequent sub-cloning (unpublished data). The resulting plasmids (PL6, PL8 and PL10, Supplementary Table S2) were passaged through E. coli SCS110 to demethylate the DNA prior to transformation into Hfx. volcanii.Plasmids for regulated expressionPlasmid pNPM-tna was constructed by amplifying the 124\u2009bp tnaA promoter from Hfx. volcanii DS70 genomic DNA using oligonucleotides P13 and P14, digesting the PCR product with BclI and NotI, and ligating into BclI- and NotI-digested pTA409 (28). The resulting plasmid (pNPM-tna, PL11, Supplementary Table S2) contains a multiple cloning site downstream of the tna promoter with unique NdeI, PacI and NotI sites along with additional unique sites that were present in pTA409; the plasmid was sequenced to ensure the absence of sequence changes in the BclI\u2013NotI region. Next, oligonucleotides P15\u2013P20 were used to amplify the first 300\u2009bp of the rpaA1, rpaB1 and rpaC ORFs from Hfx. volcanii DS70 genomic DNA. The PCR products were restricted with NdeI and EcoRV, cloned separately into NdeI- and EcoRV-digested pNPM-tna and sequenced. The resulting plasmids (pNPM-tna-HfxRpaA, etc., PL12-PL14, Supplementary Table S2) were subsequently passaged through E. coli SCS110 prior to Hfx. volcanii transformation.Plasmid pNPM-tna-HfxRpaC-int (PL15, Supplementary Table S2) was constructed from pNPM-tna\u2013rpaC by insertion of a 500-bp BclI fragment carrying the upstream flanking region of rpaC amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides P21 and P22 and DS70 DNA as template into the unique BclI site upstream of the tna promoter. The plasmid was sequenced and passaged through E. coli SCS110 prior to transformation into Hfx. volcanii.Plasmids for constitutive high-level expressionTo facilitate constitutive high-level RPA expression, the BclI\u2013NdeI fragment carrying the tna promoter in the pNPM-tna-HfxRpa plasmids PL12\u2013PL14 (Supplementary Table S2) was replaced with a 185-bp fragment carrying the Hbt. salinarum fdx promoter, amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers P23 and P24 (Supplementary Table S1) and digested with BamHI and NdeI. The resulting plasmids (pNPM-fdx-HfxRpaA, etc., PL16\u201318, Supplementary Table S2) were sequenced and passaged through SCS110 prior to transformation into Hfx. volcanii.Plasmids for expression of full-length RpaC proteinsPlasmids containing the full-length Hfx. volcanii, Hgm. borinquense and Hqr. walsbyi rpaC genes under the control of the fdx promoter were constructed by amplifying the corresponding ORFs by PCR using the appropriate genomic DNA as template and oligonucleotides P25\u2013P30 (Supplementary Table S1). The PCR products were then digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated together with the BamHI\u2013NdeI 185-bp fragment carrying the Hbt. salinarum fdx promoter, described above, into plasmid pTA230 (27) that had been digested with BamHI and HindIII. The resulting plasmids (pTA230-pfdx-HfxRpaC, etc., PL19\u2013PL21, Supplementary Table S2) were then sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted sequence changes in the BamHI\u2013HindIII region and passaged through SCS110 prior to transformation into Hfx. volcanii.Plasmids for expression of mutated RpaC proteinsPlasmids expressing eight of nine mutant forms of the Hgm. borinquense RpaC protein were constructed by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis using plasmid pTA230-pfdx-HgmRpaC as template and oligonucleotides P27 and P28 in combination with oligonucleotides P31\u2013P42 (Supplementary Table S1). The mutated ORFs were re-cloned (as NdeI\u2013HindIII fragments) into pTA230-pfdx-HfxRpaC, from which the NdeI\u2013HindIII fragment carrying the full-length Hfx. volcanii rpaC gene had been excised, and the resulting plasmids (PL22\u2013PL30, Supplementary Table S2) sequenced to ensure the absence of unwanted sequence changes. The mutated ORFs expressed the following proteins: Hgm RpaC-\u0394NTD (deletion of amino acids 1\u201362 inclusive), \u0394OBA (deletion of amino acids 58\u2013167), \u0394OBB (amino acids 168\u2013267), \u0394OBC (amino acids 268\u2013367), \u0394OBAB (amino acids 58\u2013267), \u0394OBAC (amino acids 58\u2013167 and 268\u2013367), \u0394OBBC (amino acids 168\u2013367) and \u0394OBABC (amino acids 58\u2013367).The ORF to express Hgm RpaC-\u0394NTD was amplified using plasmid pTA230-pfdx-Hgm RpaC as template and oligonucleotides P43 and P28. The PCR product was then digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned as above (PL22, Supplementary Table S2). The truncated ORF is deleted for sequences encoding amino acids 1\u201362 (incl.) of the Hgm. borinquense RpaC protein.The ORF to express Hgm RpaC-\u0394CTD was constructed by digesting plasmid pTA230-fdx-HgmRpaC with EcoRI and ligating in a short dsDNA with EcoRI cohesive ends assembled from oligonucleotides P44 and P45 (Supplementary Table S1) containing a stop codon. The EcoRI site is located in the gene at a position that corresponds to the poorly conserved linker between the third OB fold and the CTD. Correct insertion of stop codon-containing DNA was confirmed by sequencing (PL30, Supplementary Table S2). The truncated ORF encodes amino acids 1\u2013404 of Hgm RpaC only.Plasmids for expression of Flag epitope-tagged RpaC proteinsPlasmids expressing Flag-tagged full-length and mutated forms of Hgm RpaC (PL31\u201339, Supplementary Table S2) were constructed by digesting the appropriate pTA230-fdx-HgmRpaC plasmids with NdeI and ligating in a short dsDNA with NdeI cohesive ends assembled from oligonucleotides P46 and P47 (see Supplementary Table S1). The resulting proteins are expressed with the N-terminal sequence M1DYKDDDDKHM2 where M2 corresponds to the native N-terminal methionine (Met63 in the case of the RpaC\u2013\u0394NTD protein) and the Flag tag is underlined.Gene deletionsUnmethylated plasmids for gene deletion (PL6, PL8 and PL10, Supplementary Table S2) were transformed into Hfx. volcanii strain H99 (\u0394pyrE2 \u0394trpA \u0394hdrB) and transformants obtained on Hv-Ca medium with appropriate supplements at 45\u00b0C. For each gene deletion, three integrant colonies were picked, resuspended in Hv-Ca medium and plated on Hv-Ca or Hv-Min plates (see \u2018Results\u2019 section), supplemented with both uracil and 5-FOA, with or without tryptophan (for selection of deletions marked with trpA+) or with or without thymidine and hypoxanthine (for selection of deletions marked with hdrB+). Candidate gene deletion colonies (typically 16 colonies for each) were screened by PCR using oligonucleotides P48\u2013P57 indicated in Supplementary Table S1. Deletion strains were then purified by streaking to single colonies on Hv-YPC medium, re-tested by PCR and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in 20% glycerol.Mating assayMating of Hfx. volcanii strains was performed essentially as described previously (26). Briefly, strains to be mated (see below) were grown to mid-exponential phase (OD650 nm of 0.4) in Hv-YPC medium before being combined and filtered onto a 0.45-\u00b5m filter. The filter was then placed face-up on an Hv-YPC plate. After overnight incubation at 45\u00b0C, the cells were washed from the filter using 1\u2009ml of sterile 18% SW and 100-\u00b5l aliquots plated onto Hv-Ca plates with necessary supplements. Colonies formed after 5 days incubation at 45\u00b0C were then analysed by PCR.Plasmid integrationFor expression from the tna promoter, plasmids PL12\u201314 (Supplementary Table S2) were transformed into Hfx. volcanii H98 and integrative transformants obtained on Hv-Ca medium without additional supplements. Note that Hv-Ca contains a low level of tryptophan sufficient to activate the tna promoter (29). Plasmid integration at the correct chromosomal loci by homologous recombination was confirmed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers P48\u2013P53 (Supplementary Table S1). Integrant strains (together with strain DS70 as a control) were then grown in liquid Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan to mid-exponential phase (OD650 0.5). After pelleting at 2000\u2009rpm for 8\u2009min and washing with Hv-Min medium, the cultures were adjusted to an OD650 of 0.5, serially diluted in Hv-Min from 10\u22121 to 10\u22125 and spotted onto Hv-Min plates with or without 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan. The plates were incubated at 45\u00b0C until colonies were formed.For expression from the fdx promoter, plasmids PL16\u2013PL18 (Supplementary Table S2) were transformed into Hfx. volcanii H98 and integrative transformants obtained on Hv-Ca medium without additional supplements. Correct integration was confirmed as above.Creation of a stable ptna\u2013rpaC strainPlasmid PL15 (Supplementary Table S2) was transformed into Hfx. volcanii H98 and integrative transformants obtained on Hv-Min medium supplemented with 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan at 45\u00b0C. Colonies were picked, resuspended in 18% SW and plated on Hv-Min plates containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan, uracil, 5-FOA, thymidine and hypoxanthine, and incubated at 45\u00b0C until colonies formed. Colonies were then screened by PCR using oligonucleotide primers P58 and P59 (Supplementary Table S1) to identify ptna\u2013rpaC strains. Subsequently, ptna\u2013rpaC strains were purified by streaking to single colonies on Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan, thymidine and hypoxanthine, re-tested by PCR and stored at \u221280\u00b0C in 20% glycerol.Full-length and truncated RpaC proteinsPlasmids P19\u2013P30 (Supplementary Table S2) were transformed into Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC and transformants obtained on Hv-Min medium supplemented with 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan, thymidine and hypoxanthine at 45\u00b0C. Transformant strains were then cultured on HvMin with tryptophan to mid-exponential phase, washed, serially diluted, spotted on HvMin plates with or without tryptophan and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days.Detection of Flag-tagged RpaC proteinsPlasmids PL31\u2013PL40 (Supplementary Table S2) were transformed into Hfx. volcanii H98 and transformants obtained on Hv-Ca medium (supplemented with thymidine and hypoxanthine) at 45\u00b0C. Proteins extracts were prepared from cell cultures grown to mid-log phase in Hv-Min medium (supplemented with thymidine and hypoxanthine), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE), transferred to PDVF membrane and immunoblotted using anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). Following washing and incubation with HRP-linked sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies (GE Healthcase), signals were visualized using an LAS 3000 imaging system (Fujifilm).DNA damage sensitivity assaysCells were grown in Hv-Min medium supplemented with 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan to an OD650nm of 0.3. For UV sensitivity assay, cells were 10-fold serial diluted, plated onto Hv-Min with tryptophan, irradiated with doses from 50 to 200\u2009J/m2 with UV-C (254\u2009nm) using a Stratalinker UV1800 (Agilent) and incubated in dark at 45\u00b0C. For 4NQO, MMS and phleomycin sensitivity assays, cells were divided into several aliquots of 1\u2009ml and incubated with 20\u2009\u03bcl of appropriated concentration of drug for 1\u2009h with shaking at 45\u00b0C. Ten-fold serial dilutions were plated on Hv-Min with tryptophan. Plates were incubated at 45\u00b0C until colonies formed. Final concentrations for 4NQO were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8\u2009\u03bcg/ml; for MMS 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08% and for phleomycin 5 and 10\u2009mg/ml. RESULTSIdentification of putative haloarchaeal SSB proteinsAs described in the \u2018Introduction\u2019 section, combined bioinformatic and biochemical studies have previously identified three OB fold-containing single-stranded DNA binding proteins MacRPA1, MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 in the methanogenic archaeal organism M. acetivorans C2A (15,17,18). MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 each contains two OB fold domains and a CX2CX8CX2H zinc finger motif while MacRPA1 encodes a protein with four OB fold domains and no zinc finger (Figure 1). In order to identify genes encoding putative SSB proteins in the haloarchaea (the Halobacteriales are a sister clade of the Methanosarcinales), BLAST searching (30) was performed using the three M. acetivorans RPA proteins as query sequences. Genes encoding orthologues of MacRPA1, MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 can be readily identified in all 14 completely sequenced haloarchaeal genomes in current databases (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 for accession numbers and identity/similarity values with M. acetivorans RPA proteins).In Hfx. volcanii, the MacRPA1, MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 orthologues are encoded by the HVO_0519, HVO_1338 and HVO_0292 genes, respectively (Figure 1A). Like MacRPA2, the product of HVO_1338 possesses two putative OB folds, whereas the product of HVO_0292 comprises only a single OB fold (MacRPA3 has two). Both proteins contain a zinc finger motif (although in the HVO_0292 protein and its haloarchaeal orthologues this has the sequence CX4CX8-12CX2H, in contrast to CX2CX8CX2H in MacRPA2). It is highly likely that both HVO_1338 and HVO_0292 are co-transcribed with the downstream ORFs HVO_1337 and HVO_0291, respectively (Figure 1A). The products of these downstream ORFs are related to one another and may also contain OB-fold motifs (see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section).For simplicity, we designated the proteins encoded by the Hfx. volcanii genes as RpaA1 (encoded by HVO_1338, homologue of MacRPA2) and RpaB1 (HVO_0292, homologue of MacRPA3) and the proteins encoded by the downstream ORFs, RpaA2 (HVO_1337) and RpaB2 (HVO_0291). In Hfx. volcanii the ORFs encoding RpaA1 and RpaA2 overlap by three nucleotides, while those encoding RpaB1 and RpaB2 are separated by one nucleotide only. Similar gene organization is seen in all other haloarchaeal species with sequenced genomes (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) and in M. acetivorans, i.e. RPA2 and RPA3 are located adjacent to genes encoding homologues of RpaA2 and RpaB2, respectively (Figure 1A), but the biochemical properties of these proteins have not been analysed.Downstream of the RpaA2 ORF in Hfx. volcanii is an ORF encoding a putative metallophosphoesterase protein of unknown function, Rpe (HVO_1336), that may also be part of the same operon; the RpaA2 and Rpe ORFs are separated by five nucleotides only. Although an Rpe-related ORF is found in the M. acetivorans genome, this is not linked to MacRPA2. Downstream of RpaB2 is the ORF encoding the haloarchaeal-specific Ral protein. In this case, the gap between the RpaB2 and Ral ORFs is 165 nucleotides, suggesting that Ral is not part of the same transcription unit, at least in Hfx. volcanii (see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section).The HVO_0519 gene encoding the closest MacRPA1 homologue in Hfx. volcanii is separated from its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking ORFs by almost 200\u2009nt in each case and is presumably transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. We designate the protein encoded by HVO_0519 as RpaC. RpaC possesses three clear OB fold domains (in contrast to MacRPA1, which has four, see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section) plus conserved N- and C-terminal domains of unknown function (Figure 1B).Essential and non-essential RPA proteinsTo investigate which, if any, of the Hfx. volcanii RPA proteins is essential for cell viability, we attempted to delete the corresponding genes from their native chromosomal loci. In the case of RpaA1 and RpaB1, we initially decided to delete the entire rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ loci as a precursor to more detailed analysis. To delete the genes, the pop-in/pop-out method was used with Hfx. volcanii H99 (\u0394trpA \u0394hdrB \u0394pyrE2) (27,31). Using this method\u2014full details of which can be found in the \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section\u2014the regions of interest are replaced by an auxotrophic marker: trpA+ for deletion of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon and for deletion of rpaC+, and hdrB+ for deletion of rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+.The results of these experiments were as follows. For deletion of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon, we found comparable numbers of colonies on plates on selective and non-selective media (i.e. with and without tryptophan) following the pop-out step, implying that the products of the rpaA1+, rpaA2+ and rpe+ genes are non-essential for cell viability in Hfx. volcanii. Loss of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon was confirmed by PCR in all 16 putative \u0394rpaA1 \u0394rpaA2 \u0394rpe colonies analysed (Table 2, Figure 2A).\n\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 2.Gene deletions. (A) PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA prepared from six rpaA::trpA+ colonies isolated on selective medium (i.e. Hv-Ca or Hv-Min medium containing 5FOA and uracil for counterselection but lacking either tryptophan or thymine/hypoxanthine for selection\u2014see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for details) demonstrating successful deletion of the rpaA1-rpaA2-rpe locus. (B) Similar analysis of six rpaB::hdrB+ colonies demonstrating successful deletion of the rpaB1-rpaB2 locus. (C) PCR analysis of six representatives of the rare colonies isolated on selective medium following attempted replacement of rpaC+ with trpA+. All six still contain an intact rpaC+ locus in addition to the trpA+ marker (see \u2018Results\u2019 section). (D) Similar analysis of five of the rare colonies isolated on selective medium following attempted replacement of rpaB+ with hdrB+ in an \u0394rpaA1-rpaA2-rpe genetic background (upper panel) or of rpaA+ with trpA+ in an \u0394rpaB1-rpaB2 background (lower case). In both cases, all the transformants analysed still contained the gene targeted for deletion as well as the marker gene, either hdrB+ or trpA+ (data not shown). Note that in each case (A\u2013D) the primers used for PCR were located within the ORFs targeted for deletion (see Supplementary Table S1 for primer sequences). See text for further details.Table 2.Gene deletion experimentsStrain backgroundAttempted deletionNon-selective mediumSelective medium1H99rpaA::trpA+9.9\u2009\u00d7\u20091058.8.\u2009\u00d7\u20091052H99rpaB::hdrB+3.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091041.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091023H99rpaC::trpA+1.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910520Open in a separate windowCells were grown as described in \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section and plated onto non-selective or selective medium.Colony-forming units per ml of cell culture are shown, determined by plating serial dilutions.For rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+, the number of colonies on selective medium (i.e. Hv-Ca medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine to select for hdrB+, see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section) following pop-out was substantially lower than on non-selective medium (Table 2). However, 16 colonies from the selective plates screened by PCR all showed loss of the rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ locus, indicating the products of the rpaB1+ and rpaB2+ genes are also non-essential (Figure 2B). We have observed a similar disparity between actual and expected colony number when creating gene deletions of other non-essential genes using hdrB+ (but not trpA+) as the selectable marker on Hv-Ca medium (unpublished results). When we repeated the rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ deletion using Hfx. volcanii minimal medium (Hv-Min) instead of Hv-Ca, the number of colonies found on selective and non-selective plates was comparable and all the pop-outs screened from selective plates were rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ deletions (data not shown). That indicates that Hv-Min is a more appropriate medium for gene deletion using the hdrB+ marker than Hv-Ca.For deletion of rpaC+, we found \u223c104 more colonies on non-selective medium than on selective medium (i.e. medium lacking tryptophan) following pop-out. When screened by PCR for the presence or absence of rpaC+, all 32 colonies analysed from plates lacking tryptophan still contained the rpaC+ gene (Table 2, Figure 2C). These observations suggest strongly that rpaC+ is an essential gene in Hfx. volcanii\u2014the colonies obtained on the selective medium are presumably either merozygotic (that is, they possess both rpaC+ and rpaC::trpA+ loci on different chromosomes after pop-out) or carry mutated pyrE2 genes that confer resistance to 5-FOA (with the result that both rpaC+ and rpaC::trpA+ loci are present on the same chromosome).The relatedness of the products of rpaA1+ and rpaB1+, and to lesser extent rpaA2+ and rpaB2+, raised the possibility that these genes might share an essential function. To test this, we attempted to create an \u0394rpaA \u0394rpaB double deletion strain. This was done in three ways. First, we attempted to replace the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon with trpA+ in an rpaB::hdrB+ background. For this purpose, plasmid PL6 (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section) was transformed into the rpaB::hdrB+ strain and integrant (pop-in) colonies were plated on medium containing uracil and 5-FOA with and without tryptophan to identify (pop-out) colonies of cells that had lost the plasmid. Colonies from plates lacking tryptophan were screened by PCR to detect the presence or absence of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon. However, all the colonies examined contained the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ operon, suggesting that a \u0394rpaA \u0394rpaB double mutant is not viable (Figure 2D, upper panel). Consistent with this, an identical result was obtained when we attempted to replace the rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operon with hdrB+ in rpaA::trpA+ background using plasmid PL8. While deletion of rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ in the wild-type was straightforward (see above), we were unable to delete the gene in a rpaA::trpA+ strain (Figure 2D, lower panel).Finally, we attempted to construct an \u0394rpaA \u0394rpaB double deletion strain by mating \u0394rpaA and \u0394rpaB strains, as described previously (26). Briefly, exponentially growing cultures of rpaA::trpA+ \u0394hdrB and rpaB::hdrB+ \u0394trpA strains were combined, harvested by filtration and incubated overnight on rich medium. The cells were then plated on medium lacking both tryptophan and thymidine to select for double mutants. Control matings were performed with Hfx. volcanii H53 (\u0394trpA hdrB+) and H98 (trpA+ \u0394hdrB) strains (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). In two independent mating experiments we were unable to obtain rpaA::trpA+ rpaB::hdrB+ double mutants from the rpaA::trpA+ \u0394hdrB \u00d7 rpaB::hdrB+ \u0394trpA mating, despite rpaA::trpA+ hdrB+ and trpA+ rpaB::hdrB+ strains being abundant following the control matings (rpaA::trpA+ \u0394hdrB \u00d7 \u0394trpA hdrB+ and trpA+ \u0394hdrB \u00d7 rpaB::hdrB+ \u0394trpA, respectively). Taken together, the results of these experiments imply that the products of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operons share at least one essential function (see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section).Conditional down-regulation of gene expressionIn order to analyse the in vivo function of RpaC in greater detail, we used a tryptophan-repressible promoter system that allows conditional down-regulation of gene expression. The promoter of the Hfx. volcanii tryptophanase gene tnaA is strongly induced in the presence of tryptophan and repressed in its absence (29). Initially, we engineered a strain in which the tnaA promoter was positioned upstream of rpaC+, displacing the native promoter. This was achieved by constructing an integrating plasmid pNPM-tna\u2013rpaC carrying the tna promoter 5\u2032 to 300\u2009bp from the 5\u2032 end of the rpaC+ ORF (PL14, see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). This plasmid was transformed into Hfx. volcanii H98 and transformant colonies obtained on Hv-Ca medium [which contains low levels of tryptophan, enough to activate ptna, see (29)] were analysed by PCR to confirm correct integration of the plasmid (data not shown).To test the ability of the integrated ptna\u2013rpaC+ strain to grow in the absence of tryptophan, serial dilutions of exponentially-growing cultures were spotted onto Hv-Min medium plates lacking tryptophan and, as a control, onto Hv-Min plates supplemented with 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section). Little or no growth was seen on medium lacking tryptophan, consistent with rpaC+ being an essential gene in Hfx. volcanii (Figure 3A, upper panel). Analysis of expression levels by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the rpaC+ mRNA level in cells grown in Hv-Min medium lacking tryptophan was reduced to below the level seen in wild-type cells. At the same time, we observed that the rpaC+ expression level in Hv-Min medium with 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan was elevated above the normal wild-type level (data not shown) but since there is no detectable difference in growth rate between the wild-type and the integrated ptna\u2013rpaC+ strain overexpression does not appear to have a detrimental effect on cells.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 3.Construction of conditional lethal strains. (A) Upper panel: Hfx. volcanii H98 strains carrying integrated pNPM-tna-Rpa plasmids (see Table 1) were grown up to mid-exponential phase at 45\u00b0C in Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan. The cells were then washed and 10-fold serial dilutions spotted onto Hv-Min plates with or without tryptophan, and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days. Strain DS70 is a wild-type control (Table 1). Lower panel: the Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC promoter replacement strain (Table 1) was processed and incubated as above. Strain H98 is a wild-type control. (B) Hfx. volcanii \u0394rpaA strains carrying integrated pNPM-tna-RpaB (see Table 1) were processed and incubated as above.Taken together, these results show that the tnaA promoter can be successfully used for down-regulation of rpaC+ expression. However, the plasmid integration strategy described above creates a strain in which homologous recombination (between truncated and full-length copies of rpaC+) will lead to reversion to wild-type. In order to prevent this, a genetically stable ptna\u2013rpaC+ strain was constructed using the pop-in/pop-out method, in which the rpaC+ promoter was replaced by ptna (see \u2018Material and Methods\u2019 section for details of strain construction). As expected, the stable ptna\u2013rpaC+ strain also showed reduced growth rate on medium lacking tryptophan (Figure 3A, lower panel).As shown above, the products of the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+-rpaB2+ operons appear to share at least one essential function\u2014simultaneous deletion of the two loci is not possible. To extend this observation, we examined the effects of placing the rpaB1+-rpaB2+ locus under tna control in a \u0394rpaA background. As expected, growth of the ptna-rpaB \u0394rpaA strain was significantly retarded on medium lacking tryptophan (Figure 3B).Interplay between SSB proteinsThe presence of multiple single-stranded DNA binding factors in Hfx. volcanii raises the question of whether there is interplay between them. To examine this, we first tested whether high level expression of either rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ or rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ would rescue loss of rpaC+ function in ptna\u2013rpaC+ cells growing on medium lacking tryptophan. To this end, the fdx promoter was placed 5\u2032 to the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ loci in a ptna\u2013rpaC+ background by plasmid integration (see \u2018Material and Methods\u2019 section for details of strain construction). The fdx promoter, derived from the ferredoxin gene from Hbt. salinarum, promotes strong constitutive expression in Hfx. volcanii (32). Serial dilutions of exponentially growing pfdx\u2013rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ ptna\u2013rpaC+ and pfdx\u2013rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ ptna\u2013rpaC+ integrant strains were then spotted onto Hv-Min medium plates lacking tryptophan with appropriate controls. We found that elevated expression of rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ but not rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ could complement for lack of rpaC+ (Figure 4A): growth of pfdx\u2013rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ ptna\u2013rpaC cells was as strong as wild-type cells on Hv-Min medium lacking tryptophan, whereas growth of the pfdx\u2013rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ ptna\u2013rpaC strain was indistinguishable from that of the parental ptna\u2013rpaC strain. Thus, at least one of the products of the rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operon is able to substitute, directly or indirectly, for loss of RpaC.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 4.Rescue of ptna\u2013rpaC strain by expression of RpaB and Hgm RpaC. (A) Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC cells carrying integrated pNPM-fdx-RpaA or pNPM-fdx-RpaB plasmids were grown mid-exponential phase at 45\u00b0C in Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan. The cells were then washed and ten-fold serial dilutions spotted onto Hv-Min plates with or without tryptophan and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days. (B) Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC cells carrying plasmids pTA230-fdx-HgmRpaC or pTA230-fdx-HqrRpaC were grown mid-exponential phase at 45\u00b0C in Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan, washed, serially diluted as above and spotted onto Hv-Min plates with or without tryptophan and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days.Cross-species complementationIn many model organisms, construction of a conditional-lethal mutant strain would ordinarily facilitate rapid structure\u2013function analysis of the corresponding protein. However, in our experience the highly efficient homologous recombination seen with Hfx. volcanii greatly hampers these studies, with gene conversion between the wild-type chromosomal copy of the gene and incoming mutated copies often resulting in loss of the mutant DNA sequences before any functional test can be applied (unpublished data). To bypass these difficulties, we tested whether RpaC orthologues from related haloarchaeal species, displaying only limited sequence similarity at the nucleotide sequence level to the Hfx. volcanii rpaC+ gene but encoding closely related proteins, would function in Hfx. volcanii and rescue growth of ptna\u2013rpaC cells grown in the absence of tryptophan. The RpaC homologues from Halogeometricum borinquense (Hbor_26830; GI:313127408) and Haloquadratum walsbyi (HQ_1435A; GI:110667397) are 75% and 61% identical to the Hfx. volcanii protein, respectively. We constructed replicating plasmids carrying these genes under the control of the fdx promoter (see \u2018Material and Methods\u2019 section) and transformed these into the ptna\u2013rpaC strain. As shown in Figure 4B, expression of either the Hgm. borinquense or Hqr. walsbyi rpaC+ genes from the fdx promoter restores growth of the ptna\u2013rpaC strain in medium lacking tryptophan. No rescue is seen when the cells are transformed with the empty plasmid (Figure 4B, lower panel, top row). Subsequent experiments showed that the level of rescue observed with Hgm. borinquense RpaC was indistinguishable from that seen when Hfx. volcanii RpaC was expressed under equivalent conditions (data not shown).Structure\u2013function analysis of RpaCHaloarchaeal RpaC orthologues display high conservation in domain organization, with three OB folds and N- and C-terminal domains (Figure 1B). The N-terminal domain is present in all haloarchaeal RpaC proteins, and in some methanogens (notably the Methanosarcinales, including M. acetivorans), whereas the C-terminal domain appears to be unique to the haloarchaea (see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section).Studies of the four OB fold-containing MacRPA1 protein have shown that single OB motifs can be deleted without significant loss of ssDNA-binding ability (14) but it is not clear how these changes to the structure of the protein impact on in vivo function. To examine this, and to probe the functions of the N- and C-terminal domains, we generated a collection of truncated and deleted derivatives of Hgm. borinquense RpaC and tested whether these were able to support cell growth when expressed in ptna\u2013rpaC cells grown on medium lacking tryptophan. As shown schematically in Figure 5A, we expressed nine deleted or truncated versions of the Hgm. borinquense RpaC protein: N- and C-terminal deletions (\u0394NTD and \u0394CTD respectively), single OB fold deletions (\u0394OBA, \u0394OBB and \u0394OBC), double OB fold deletions (\u0394OBAB, \u0394OBBC and \u0394OBAC) and a triple OB deletion (\u0394OBABC). Note that, in contrast to previously reported biochemical analysis of the M. acetivorans MacRPA1 protein, we chose to delete individual OB fold domains in their entirety rather than create chimeric OB folds by fusing adjacent folds (15).\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 5.Structure\u2013function analysis of RpaC. (A) Schematic representation of nine mutant Hgm. borinquense RpaC proteins indicating (boxed) the location of the N-terminal domain (NTD), OB folds A\u2013C and the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the extent of the deleted regions. (B) Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC cells carrying various pTA230-fdx-HgmRpaC plasmids (see Supplementary Table S2) were grown up to mid-exponential phase at 45\u00b0C in Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan. The cells were then washed and 10-fold serial dilutions spotted onto Hv-Min plates with or without tryptophan, and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days.Plasmids expressing each of the nine alleles from the fdx promoter were transformed into the ptna\u2013rpaC strain and transformants tested for their ability to grow on medium lacking tryptophan by spotting of serial dilutions of exponentially growing cultures (Figure 5B). The results were as follows\u2014none of the three OB folds, the NTD nor the CTD is individually essential for RpaC function: all five single domain deletions (\u0394NTD, \u0394CTD, \u0394OBA, \u0394OBB and \u0394OBC) were able to restore growth to the ptna\u2013rpaC strain, although in each the degree of rescue was reduced when compared to the full-length RpaC protein (Figure 5B). OB fold C appears to have the most important role, as no growth was observed when \u0394OBAC and \u0394OBBC were expressed, while \u0394OBAB retained some rescue activity. Consistent with this, \u0394OBA and \u0394OBB rescued better than \u0394OBC, although none of these rescued as well as the full-length protein, indicating that all three OB folds are necessary for optimal RpaC function. No rescue was observed in cells expressing the triple OB fold deletion mutant \u0394OBABC.Cells expressing \u0394NTD also grew more poorly than cells expressing the full-length protein while rescue by \u0394CTD was comparable to wild type. Subsequent western blotting of N-terminally Flag-tagged versions of all nine mutant proteins plus full-length Hgm RpaC confirmed that all nine were expressed to similar levels in Hfx. volcanii (data not shown).Cells expressing \u0394NTD and \u0394CTD mutants are sensitive to DNA-damaging agentsDespite being non-essential for RpaC function, the N- and C-terminal domain sequences are reasonably well conserved across haloarchaeal species suggesting that they play important roles in vivo. As the RPA proteins are likely to be involved in DNA repair, we examined whether ptna\u2013rpaC cells expressing truncated Hgm RpaC-\u0394NTD and RpaC-\u0394CTD proteins were more sensitive to the effects of various DNA damaging agents than cells expressing full length Hgm RpaC. As summarized in Figure 6, cells expressing RpaC-\u0394NTD showed increased sensitivity to UV light (Figure 6A) and to MMS and phleomycin (Figure 6B), whereas cells expressing RpaC-\u0394CTD mutant displayed increased sensitivity to UV irradiation and MMS but not to phleomycin. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain may have a general role in RpaC function in DNA repair whereas the role of the C-terminal domain may be confined to certain types of DNA repair only (see \u2018Discussion\u2019 section).\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 6.Sensitivity of cells expressing Hgm RpaC-\u0394NTD and -\u0394CTD to DNA damage. (A) Response to UV treatment. Hfx. volcanii ptna\u2013rpaC cells carrying various pTA230-fdx-HgmRpaC plasmids were grown up to mid-exponential phase at 45\u00b0C in Hv-Min medium containing 0.075\u2009mM tryptophan. The cells were then washed and ten-fold serial dilutions spotted onto Hv-Min plates, irradiated with the indicated dose of UV and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days. Upper panel: survival curves. Lower panel: spotting assay. (B) Response to MMS and phleomycin treatment. The same strains were grown up and exposed to MMS (0.08%) or phleomycin (10\u2009mg/ml) for 1\u2009h, before being serially diluted, spotted and incubated at 45\u00b0C for 3 days. See \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for details.Increased expression of RpaC leads to resistance to DNA damagePrevious work with Hbt. salinarum has established a link between increased expression of the orthologous rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operon and resistance to ionizing radiation (33). To investigate whether increased expression of the Hfx. volcanii rpaC+ might also lead to resistance to DNA damage, pfdx\u2013rpaC and ptna\u2013rpaC strains (the latter grown on medium containing tryptophan) were exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging agents in liquid culture and cell viability determined by colony counting. We observed enhanced resistance of both pfdx\u2013rpaC and ptna\u2013rpaC strains to all DNA-damaging agents tested (Figure 7). Taken together with essentiality of RpaC and the DNA-damaging sensitivity seen in cells expressing N- and C-terminally truncated RpaC proteins, these results underline the contribution of RpaC to maintaining genome integrity in the haloarchaea.\nOpen in a separate windowFigure 7.Increased expression of RpaC leads to enhanced resistance to DNA damage.

DISCUSSIONIn all three domains of life, SSBs play vital roles in DNA replication, repair and recombination. In this report we present the first genetic analysis of RPA function in the third domain of life, the archaea, using the euryarchaeon Hfx. volcanii as a model to take advantage of the wide range of genetic tools available for this organism (22).Previously, detailed biochemical analysis of the SSB proteins MacRPA1, MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 from the methanogenic archaeal species M. acetivorans has been described (14\u201318). The MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 proteins are related to one another, indicative of descent from a common ancestor: each possesses two OB folds plus a zinc finger motif (Figure 1B). Database searching readily identified homologues of these proteins in the haloarchaea, a sister clade to the methanogens. The haloarchaeal MacRPA2 and MacRPA3 homologues (RpaA1 and RpaB1 in Hfx. volcanii, respectively) have a similar domain organization to their methanogen counterparts, with one or two OB folds and a zinc finger motif. Intriguingly, in both cases (and in both organisms, Hfx. volcanii and M. acetivorans) the ORFs encoding these proteins are most likely co-transcribed with adjacent ORFs encoding proteins of the COG3390 family (RpaA2 and RpaB2 in Hfx. volcanii, MA0591 and MA3018 in M. acetivorans, see Figure 1A). Iterative database searching using PSI-BLAST (30) reveals that these proteins also contain at least one OB fold (data not shown), raising the possibility that RpaA1 and RpaA2, and RpaB1 and RpaB2, may form heteromeric SSB complexes in vivo. Also possible are mixed complexes comprising, for example, RpaA1 and RpaB2, or RpaB1 and RpaA2, although the non-essentiality of the individual rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operons indicates that mixed complexes, should they exist, are not obligatory for cell growth.The rpaA locus also contains a gene, rpe+, downstream of rpaA2+, encoding a putative metallophosphoesterase of unknown function. In Hfx. volcanii, the rpaA2+ and rpe+ ORFs are separated by five nucleotides only, suggesting that they are likely to be co-transcribed although this has not been tested. A related gene is found in methanogens, including M. activorans, but is unlinked to the MacRPA2\u2013MA0591 locus (Figure 1A, data not shown). Our deletion analysis shows that rpe+ is a non-essential gene (Figure 2). An additional ORF, ral+, is also found downstream of rpaB1+ and rpaB2+. In Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, this appears to be co-transcribed with the rpaB1+ and rpaB2+ orthologues but whether this is true in Hfx. volcanii (where the rpaB2+ and ral+ ORFs are separated by 165\u2009bp, in contrast to only 45\u2009bp in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1) is not known: in several haloarchaeal species, the rpaB2+ and ral+ ORFs are physically separated by ORFs encoding (or predicted to encode) unrelated proteins, indicating that co-expression of rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ with ral+ is not obligatory (data not shown). Importantly, levels of the Halobacterium rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+\u2013ral+ transcript were shown to be increased in two mutant strains displaying increased resistance to ionizing radiation (33), possibly implying a role for these proteins in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and following UV treatment (34). Consistent with latter result, deletion of the Hfx. volcanii rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ operon results in increased UV sensitivity (data not shown). The Ral protein does not contain an OB fold and is unlikely to have any role in ssDNA binding.While the individual rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ deletions were viable, we were unable to construct the double \u0394rpaA \u0394rpaB deletion, either by the pop-in/pop-out method or by mating, suggesting that the products of these loci share an essential function. The construction of a ptna-rpaB \u0394rpaA strain (Figure 3B) offers a useful tool for future analysis of this function.In contrast to the rpaA1+\u2013rpaA2+\u2013rpe+ and rpaB1+\u2013rpaB2+ loci, rpaC+ is individually essential for cell growth. We were unable to delete the rpaC gene from the chromosome and downregulation of rpaC+ expression using the tna promoter caused growth arrest of ptna\u2013rpaC strains on medium lacking tryptophan (Figure 3A). Interestingly, elevated expression of the rpaB1-rpaB2 operon, driven by the constitutive fdx promoter, is sufficient to partially suppress the growth defect of ptna\u2013rpaC+ cells (Figure 4A), implying that the RpaB1 protein, possibly acting in concert with RpaB2, is able to perform some of the cellular functions of RpaC.Using the closely related Hgm. borinquense protein as a model, we examined the consequences of deleting the N- and C-terminal and OB fold domains of RpaC by testing the ability of the mutated proteins to rescue growth of the ptna\u2013rpaC strain on medium lacking tryptophan (Figure 5). Individual deletion of the three OB folds reduced but did not abolish growth, indicating that RpaC function is not dependent on the presence of all three OB folds. In contrast, deletion of OB fold C together with either A or B prevented rescue of ptna\u2013rpaC. Some growth was seen when OB folds A and B were deleted, implying that an RpaC protein containing OB fold C alone retains residual activity. It remains to be seen how these deletions affect DNA binding by the Hgm RpaC protein and whether there is a direct correlation between in vivo function and affinity for ssDNA. Previous work with the M. acetivorans MacRPA1 protein has shown that ssDNA binding by this protein is largely unaffected by deletion of single OB folds (achieved by the creation of chimeric OB folds by, for example, fusing the N-terminal part of OB fold A with the C-terminal part of OB fold B), although ssDNA-binding affinities are somewhat reduced and the ability to discriminate between ssDNA and dsDNA impaired (15). Interestingly, deletion of single OB folds in this way did not affect the size of the ssDNA-binding site.While MacRPA1 comprises four OB folds A\u2013D, the haloarchaeal RpaC protein contains only three, equivalent to folds A-C in the MacRPA1 protein. A low level of sequence similarity can be observed between the MacRPA1 OB fold D and the region of RpaC that we have designated the C-terminal domain (data not shown) suggesting that the latter is a highly divergent form of the former that is no longer recognizable as an OB fold. The RpaC CTD is also separated from OB fold C by a linker sequence (indicated by the short black line in Figure 5A) that is not conserved even among the haloarchaea. Deletion of the CTD from the RpaC protein did not affect its ability to rescue the ptna\u2013rpaC+ strain, although the rescued cells were significantly more sensitive to UV- and MMS-induced DNA damage (Figure 6). No increase in sensitivity to phleomycin was seen, however, suggesting that the CTD does not play an important role in the repair of dsDNA breaks.Another highly conserved feature of the haloarcheal RpaC proteins is the N-terminal domain (NTD). This 60-amino-acid domain, which centres on a 15-amino-acid sequence (residues 27\u201341 in the Hfx. volcanii RpaC protein) that is identical in all 14 haloarchaeal RpaC proteins in current databases, is also found in the methanogen RpaC-like proteins such as MacRPA1. There is no evidence to suggest that the NTD forms an OB fold; indeed, structure modelling using Phyre2 (35,36) suggests, albeit with low confidence, that the NTD may form a three-helix bundle structure, with the perfectly conserved 15-amino-acid sequence spanning the C-terminal end of the second helix, an unstructured loop and the N-terminal end of the third helix (data not shown). Whether this prediction is a valid one awaits determination of the structure of RpaC. Deletion of the NTD impairs RpaC function; cells expressing the \u0394NTD protein are more sensitive to DNA damage (Figures 5 and \u200band6).6). We are currently screening for proteins that interact directly with the NTD in an effort to elucidate the role of this part of the RpaC protein.In contrast to the DNA damage sensitivities observed when domains of RpaC are deleted, overexpression of rpaC (either from the constitutive H. salinarum fdx promoter or from the tna promoter in cells growing on tryptophan) resulted in an increased resistance to several DNA-damaging agents without any measurable affect on growth rate (Figure 7). We used four DNA-damaging agents that cause different types of damage: UV irradiation and 4NQO (4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide) introduce bulky adducts such as cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) into DNA, MMS (methyl methanesulfonate) methylates DNA on N7-deoxyguanine and N3-deoxyadenine which can lead to replication fork stalling, and phleomycin causes DNA double-strand breaks. The increased resistance observed to each type of damage when rpaC+ is overexpressed implies that RpaC function (or more likely, SSB function in general) is limiting in wild-type cells. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the earlier observation that expression of the rpaB1-rpaB2 operon in Halobacterium sp. NRC1 is induced in response to both ionizing radiation and UV light treatments (33,34). In neither of these cases was rpaC+ expression reported to be increased, and we do not know if there is similar transcriptional regulation of SSB function in Hfx. volcanii.In summary, our results offer the first insights into the functional and structural properties of the haloarchaeal RPA proteins. Future work will focus on determining the exact roles of these proteins in haloarchaeal DNA replication, repair and recombination, on understanding precisely how each interacts with ssDNA in the high-salt intracellular environment of the haloarchaeal cell, and on identifying the proteins with which each RPA interacts to perform its functions.
