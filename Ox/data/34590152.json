Aldo\u2011keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) is a member of the aldo\u2011keto reductase superfamily, and is a well\u2011known Nrf2 target gene and an oxidative stress gene. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of AKR1C1 on a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2011induced ALI model. After mice received LPS treatment, the mRNA expression levels of AKR1C1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum were measured using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and its relationship with the inflammatory factors and malondialdehyde levels were determined using correlation analysis. Next, AKR1C1 was overexpressed or knocked out in mice, and subsequently ALI was induced in mice using LPS. The severity of ALI, oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs were measured, and the potential involvement of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transduction activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway was assessed by measuring the changes of lung injury parameters after the agonists of JAK2/STAT3 pathway, including interleukin (IL)\u20116 and colivelin, were administrated to mice. The results revealed that AKR1C1 expression was decreased in the LPS\u2011induced ALI mouse model. AKR1C1 expression was inversely correlated with serum tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1, IL\u20116 and malondialdehyde levels, and positively correlated with serum IL\u201110 levels. AKR1C1 overexpression significantly attenuated lung injury, as shown by the changes in Evans blue leakage in the lung, lung wet/dry weight ratio, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, survival rate of mice and histological lung changes. In addition, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was significantly deactivated by AKR1C1+/+. When AKR1C1+/+ mice were treated with JAK2/STAT3 agonists, the effects of AKR1C1 overexpression on lung injury and oxidative stress were abolished. In conclusion, AKR1C1 may protect against oxidative stress and serve as a negative regulator of inflammation in ALI/ARDS. In addition, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway could participate in the protective effects of AKR1C1 against ALI.", "author": [{"author": "Xianjun Wang", "affiliation": ["Emergency Observation Ward, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, Lianyungang, Jiangsu\u00a0222002, P.R.

ALI is primarily characterized by alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial cell injury, and manifests as diffuse pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema, which can lead to acute respiratory dysfunction, the most serious form of which is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2). The primary clinical manifestations of ARDS are hypoxia and low lung compliance. Notably, the pathogenesis of ALI remains unclear; at present, it has been established that oxidative stress and uncontrolled inflammation are important mechanisms underlying the occurrence and progression of ALI (3). During the development of ALI, various inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-8, initiate a cascade of reactions leading to the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung (4,5). Although there are several treatments available, such as mechanical ventilation therapy, vasodilators (nitric oxide and prostaglandins), surfactants, antioxidants, glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory drugs, all of which facilitate in management of the disease, there are still no specific cures for ALI.Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) is a member of the AKR family of the human AKR superfamily (6). The enzymatic function of AKR1C1 is to utilize the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate as a coenzyme to reduce aldehydes or ketones to the corresponding alcohol (6). AKR1C1 and its subfamily members, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3, possess a high degree of homology (6,7). AKR1C isoenzymes serve a key role in NADPH-dependent reduction (8), and AKR1C1 is also a well-known Nrf2 target gene and an oxidative stress gene (9,10). Notably, it has previously been revealed that, in both small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer, high AKR1C1expression is associated with the proliferation and migration of cancer cells (11,12). In addition, it has been reported that AKR1C1 could activate signal transduction activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to promote the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer or promote cervical cancer progression via regulating Twist1 expression (13,14). However, to the best of our knowledge, the function of AKR1C1 in the protection of normal lung cells against lung injury has not been investigated. Since oxidative stress serves an important role in ALI (15), it is possible that AKR1C1 may protect normal lung cells from injury.The Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 signaling pathway is activated by cytokine stimulation, which allows for delivery of biological signals to target cells and the regulation of downstream genes involved in cell proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis (16). It has previously been shown that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is involved in the pathological process of pancreatitis-associated lung injury (17). A previous study revealed that AKR1C1 could act on the interaction of STAT3 with JAK2 to promote the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer, indicating the potential regulatory role of AKR1C1 in the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (13). However, to the best of our knowledge, whether JAK2/STAT3 signaling is involved in the effects of AKR1C1 on the development of ALI remains undetermined. Therefore, in the present study, AKR1C1 was overexpressed or knocked out in mice, which were then injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish an in vivo ALI mouse model. The severity of ALI, oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs were then measured. Furthermore, the involvement of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was investigated, which may provide a molecular mechanistic understanding of the effects of AKR1C1. Materials and methodsAnimals and groups Male BALB/c mice (age, 6\u20138 weeks; weight, 25\u201330 g; n=350 mice) were obtained from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center (Shanghai, China; http://www.slarc.org.cn) and housed in the Animal Center of The First Affiliated Hospital of Kangda College of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China) at 23\u201325\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 50\u201370%, 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Approval for all experimental protocols was issued by the Animal Care Committee of Nanjing Medical University (approval no. NMU-2017-563).In Experiment I, mice were randomly divided into two groups (n=12 mice/group): i) Control; and ii) LPS. Mice in the Control group received a single intratracheal instillation of PBS at the same volume as LPS group. Mice in the LPS group received a single intratracheal instillation of LPS (10 \u00b5g LPS dissolved in 50 \u00b5l PBS, 0.5 mg/kg body weight) after anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and acepromazine (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.). After 24 h, mice in each group were sacrificed by quick cervical dislocation. The mRNA expression levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 in both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum were measured. The lung tissues of mice were collected and the protein expression levels of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 were measured using immunohistochemistry. The serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the mice were measured, and their relationship with the levels of AKR1C1 was determined using correlation analysis.In Experiment II, mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=36 mice/group): i) Control; ii) LPS (LPS+wild-type); iii) LPS+E-virus; iv) LPS+AKR1C1+/+; and v) LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212. To minimize the total number of mice, mice in Control group of experiment II and experiment III were used again, as those in Control group received the same treatment (a single intratracheal instillation of PBS). After mice were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg; intramuscular injection) and xylazine (7.5 mg/kg; intramuscular injection), mice in the Control or LPS groups received a single intratracheal instillation of PBS or LPS (10 \u00b5g LPS dissolved in 50 \u00b5l PBS, 0.5 mg/kg body weight), respectively. Mice in the LPS + E-virus group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and intravenous injection of empty virus (5\u00d7109 PFU/200 \u00b5l). Mice in the LPS+AKR1C1+/+ group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and intravenous injection of a virus carrying the AKR1C1 vector (5\u00d7109 PFU/200 \u00b5l). Mice in the LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212 group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and AKR1C1 knockout by CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. After 24 h, 12 mice in each group were sacrificed by quick cervical dislocation to measure the Evans blue leakage in the lung, lung wet/dry weight ratio, cell counts in the BALF, levels of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 in BALF and lung tissue, lung injury based on histological analysis, levels of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative products, and the expression of phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3 and STAT3 in lung tissues. Another 12 mice in each group were used for PaO2/FIO2 ratio measurement and the final 12 mice in each group were used for monitoring survival rate.In Experiment III, mice were randomly divided into five groups (n=36 mice/group): i) Control; ii) LPS; iii) LPS+AKR1C1+/+; iv) LPS+AKR1C1+/++IL-6; and v) LPS+AKR1C1+/++Colivelin. Mice were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg; intramuscular injection) and xylazine (7.5 mg/kg; intramuscular injection) before intratracheal instillation of PBS or LPS. Mice in the Control or LPS groups received a single intratracheal instillation of PBS or LPS (10 \u00b5g LPS dissolved in 50 \u00b5l PBS, 0.5 mg/kg body weight), respectively. Mice in the LPS+AKR1C1+/+ group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and intravenous injection of a virus carrying the AKR1C1 vector. Mice in the LPS+AKR1C1+/++IL-6 group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and intravenous injection of a virus carrying the AKR1C1 vector and intratracheal instillation of recombinant mouse IL-6 (100 ng; BD Pharmingen; BD Biosciences) to activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Mice in the LPS+AKR1C1+/++Colivelin group received intratracheal instillation of LPS and intravenous injection of a virus carrying the AKR1C1 vector and intratracheal instillation of Colivelin (10 nmol; Tocris Bioscience) to activate the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway. After 24 h, 12 mice in each group were sacrificed by quick cervical dislocation to measure the expression levels of p-JAK2, JAK2, p-STAT3 and STAT3, Evans blue leakage, wet/dry weight ratio and the levels of oxidative products (MDA and protein carbonyl) in the lung tissues. Another 12 mice in each group were used for PaO2/FIO2 ratio measurement and the remaining 12mice in each group were used to monitor survival rate.AKR1C1 overexpression and knockout AKR1C1 overexpression was performed via transfection. Briefly, mice were transfected with AKR1C1-expressing vector (pLenti-EF1\u03b1-GFP-puromycin-AKR1C1-Amp cDNA expression lentiviral vector; 5\u00d7109 PFU/200 \u00b5l; AKR1C1+/+) or an empty lentiviral vector (5\u00d7109 PFU/200 \u00b5l; E-virus) via tail vein injection. The AKR1C1 promoter region was amplified from Cal-27 (Shanghai Huiying Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) genomic DNA and cloned using a cloning kit (cat. no. K-01-K-03; Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd.). CAL-27 cells were used as our previous experience showed that they can effectively amplify the AKR1C1 promoter region (data not shown). The promoter was subcloned into the SBI pGreenfire reporter vector (System Biosciences; http://www.systembio.com) and then injected into mice. All kits were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. A total of 72 h after transfection, mice were treated with LPS.The AKR1C1 knockout was performed using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology Briefly, the single guide RNA (sgRNA) was transcribed in vitro. The software used to design the sgRNA sequence was the latest online version (last update: 2017-05-09) of CRISPR finder (18). The sgRNA sequences used to knock out AKR1C1 were as follows: Forward 5\u2032-GCATCTCAAGAAAAAGTCTA-3\u2032 and reverse 3\u2032-CGTAGAGTTCTTTTTCAGAT-5\u2032. The exon of the gene targeted was 5\u2032-ATGAACTCCAAATGTCATTGTGTCATATTGAATGATGGTAACTTCATTCCAGTGCTGGGTTTTGGTACTGCTCTTCCTCTAGAG-3\u2032 and the corresponding protein domain affected was MNSKCHCVILNDGNFIPVLGFGTALPLE. Cas 9 plasmid (CAS9P-1EA; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and sgRNA were microinjected into the fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 mice (female, 12 mice, obtained from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center and housed in the Animal Center of The First Affiliated Hospital of Kangda College of Nanjing Medical University at 23\u201325\u00b0C with a relative humidity of 50\u201370%, 12-h light/dark cycle and free food/water access). Fertilized eggs were transplanted into the uterus of C57BL/6 mice to obtain positive F0 mice, which were confirmed by PCR with the methods mentioned in the reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR subsection and sequencing (19) (data not shown). A stable F1 generation mouse model was obtained by mating positive F0 generation mice with C57BL/6 mice and used in experiment II to generate the LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212 group.BALF, serum and lung tissue collection A total of 24 h after the treatment procedures, mice were sacrificed via rapid cervical dislocation. Similar to Su et al (20), the trachea and main bronchus of the mice were exposed, and an incision was made at the trachea to collect the BALF using ice-cold saline. The lungs were lavaged with 1 ml ice-cold saline three times, and the resultant BALF was centrifuged at 1,500 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to separate the supernatant and cell deposits. The supernatant was retained. Cell deposits were stained using the Diff Quick staining system (International Reagents Corp.). The cell smears were dried in the air, then dipped successively in methanol fixed solution for five times (10\u201320 sec), staining solution I (eosin G) for five times (5\u201310 sec) and staining solution II (thiazide dye) for five times (5\u201310 sec), following which they were rinsed carefully with distilled water and dried in the air. The whole dyeing process took ~20\u201330 sec. The total cell number and neutrophils were counted under an Olympus BX61WI light microscope (Olympus Corporation). Blood was collected from the retro-orbital vein, from which serum was obtained by centrifuging the blood (1,500 \u00d7 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C). The right lung was used to measure the wet/dry weight ratio; half of the left lung was homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and used for biomarker measurement. The other half of the left lung was used for lung H&E and immunohistochemical staining.Lung H&E and immunohistochemical staining Similar to Nagata et al (21), half of the left lung was used for H&E and immunohistochemical staining. The lung injury score was calculated from the H&E staining results based on alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, infiltration or aggregation of neutrophils in the airspace or vessel wall, thickness of the alveolar wall and hyaline membrane formation. The H&E staining protocol was similar to the study of Zhang et al (22). Briefly, lungs were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (cat. no. P0099; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) for 24 h at room temperature. After they were subjected to gradient alcohol dehydration and paraffin-embedding, the tissues were cut into 5\u20137-\u00b5m thick sections, which were stained with hematoxylin (cat. no. C0105M; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 2\u20133 min and then with eosin (cat. no. C0105M; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 30\u201360 sec. The lung injury was then evaluated under an Olympus BX61WI light microscope (Olympus Corporation; magnification, \u00d7200). The scoring protocol was performed as described in a previous study (23). For immunohistochemical analysis of AKR1C1, the lung tissue was embedded in paraffin, deparaffinized and rehydrated. The details have been described in the study of Nagata et al (21). After blocking in 10% goat serum (cat. no. G9023; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 30 min at room temperature, the slices were incubated with a primary antibody against AKR1C1 (cat. no. SAB2700882; 1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, then incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). AKR1C1 expression in lung tissues was visualized under a light microscope and analyzed using ImageJ version 1.46 (National Institutes of Health).RNA extraction and RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted from the BALF or serum of mice using SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega Corporation). The procedure was performed as described by Zhang et al (24). Briefly, a PCR amplification kit (Omega; Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) was used. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SMATer cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech; Takara Bio USA). qPCR was performed using ABI 7500 prepstation (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and the SYBR\u00ae-Green PCR Master Mix (GeneCore Biotechnologies, Inc). The following thermocycling conditions were used: Initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, followed by 40 cycles at 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The sequences of the primers used were: AKR1C1 sense, 5\u2032-TGCTCTTATAGCCTGTGAGG-3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032-AAGGATGACATTCCACCTGG-3\u2032; AKR1C2 sense, 5\u2032-GTGTGAAGCTGAATGATGGTCA-3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032-TCTGATGCGCTGCTCATTGTAGCTC-3\u2032; AKR1C3 sense, 5\u2032-TCCAGAGGTTCCAAGAAGTAAAGCTTT-3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032-TGGATAATTAGGGTGGCTAGCAAA-3\u2032; AKR1C4 sense, 5\u2032-TCCAGAGGTTCCGAGGAACAGAGCT-3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032-AATGGATAATCAGGATGGTCCATA-3\u2032; GAPDH sense, 5\u2032-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3\u2032. The 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Cq method was used to quantify the mRNA expression levels of AKR1C1-4, similar to Livak et al (25).Measurement of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, MDA and IL-1 levels in serum, BALF and lung tissues The levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and MDA in the serum, and the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1 in the BALF and the supernatants of lung tissues (which were homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C) were measured using ELISA kits (TNF-\u03b1, cat. no. PT512; IL-6, cat. no. PI326; IL-10, cat. no. PI522; MDA, cat. no. S0131M; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). For analysis, samples (0.1 ml) were added to the coated reaction wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After the wells were washed with PBS, a freshly diluted enzyme-labeled antibody (0.1 ml; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) was added to each reaction well and incubated for a further 1 h at room temperature. TMB substrate solution was then added to each reaction well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by incubation with 2 M sulfuric acid at room temperature for 5 sec. The optical density value of each well was detected using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) at a wavelength of 450 nm to calculate the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, MDA and IL-1.Evaluation of lung permeability using the Evans blue dye leakage method Similar to Huerter et al (26), Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was injected into the external jugular vein (45 mg/kg) 30 min before the mice were sacrificed. After mice were perfused with PBS for three times to remove the blood after sacrifice, the lung was homogenized, incubated with two volumes of formamide (50% formamide in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, 18 h, 60\u00b0C) and centrifuged (10,000 \u00d7 g, 30 min) at room temperature. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 620 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) to calculate the concentration of Evans blue leakage.Measurement of wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs The wet/dry weight ratio protocol was performed as described by Zhou et al (27). A total of 24 h after the treatments were finished, mice were sacrificed. The right lung was then removed to measure the wet weight. Subsequently, lungs were dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C for 72 h to obtain the dry weight. The wet/dry weight ratio was calculated to evaluate the extent of lung edema.Oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) analysis A total of 24 h after the treatments, mice were anesthetized using ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg; intramuscular injection) and xylazine (7.5 mg/kg; intramuscular injection). Endotracheal intubation was performed on mice with an 18-gauge catheter to provide mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen at 7 ml/kg (120 breaths/min). After 30 min, arterial blood was collected from the carotid artery and measured using a blood gas analyzer (AVL Omni 6; Roche Diagnostics), similar to Sharma et al (28).Measurement of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative products in lung tissue The levels of antioxidant enzymes [glutathione peroxidase (GPx; cat. no. CX1124-1; Beijing Biosea Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), catalase (cat. no. 11363727001; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD; cat. no. DYC3419-2; R&D Systems, Inc.)] and oxidative products [MDA (cat. no. ZKP-150051; Suzhou Zeke Biotech Co., Ltd.), protein carbonyl (OxiSelect Protein Carbonyl ELISA kit; cat. no. STA310; Cell Biolabs, Inc.), 8-OHdG (cat. no. 4380-192-K; R&D Systems, Inc.)] in lung tissues were measured using ELISA kits. The lung tissue was homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer (cat. no. P0013C; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant (0.1 ml) were added to the coated reaction wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Subsequently, freshly diluted enzyme-labeled antibody (0.1 ml) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for a further 1 h. TMB substrate solution (0.1 ml) was then added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and 2 M sulfuric acid was added to terminate the reaction. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a microplate reader to calculate the concentrations.Western blotting Half of the left lung was homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer (cat. no. P0013C; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and placed on ice, and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay. Subsequently, a total of 20 \u00b5g total protein was loaded per lane, separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was subsequently incubated in 5% non-fat milk for 30 min under room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies against AKR1C1 (1:1,000; cat. no. SAB2700882), p-JAK2 (1:1,000; cat. no. SAB4300124), JAK2 (1:1,000; cat. no.

The membranes were washed with PBS, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody for 1 h under room temperature (1:5,000; cat. no. AP124P; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Cytiva). Densitometry analysis was performed using PhotoCapt MW (version 10.01 for Windows; Vilber Lourmat) with GAPDH as the loading control.Statistical analysis All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Differences between groups were compared using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc.). The relationship between AKR1C1 expression and serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and MDA levels was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The lung injury score was analyzed non-parametrically with Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post hoc test. The following data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test: Levels of Evans blue leakage in the lung, lung wet/dry weight ratio, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, total cell and neutrophil counts, activities of GPx, catalase and SOD, levels of MDA, protein carbonyl and 8-OHdG, and fold changes of proteins. The mouse survival rate was analyzed with log-rank tests (a Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed before log-rank test), then multiple post hoc log-rank tests, followed by a Bonferroni correction to compare the survival curves. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. In total, three experimental repeats were performed.

To confirm the efficacy of AKR1C1+/+ and AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212, the expression levels of AKR1C1 were examined by western blotting (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression of AKR1C1 was notably increased by AKR1C1+/+, but markedly decreased by AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212. The Evans blue leakage in the lung, lung wet/dry weight ratio, PaO2/FIO2 ratio and survival rate of mice were also measured (Fig. 3B-E). As shown in Fig. 3B and C, the Evans blue leakage and wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs were significantly increased in the LPS and LPS+E-virus groups compared with those in the Control group (P<0.05). Compared with those in the LPS+E-virus group, the Evans blue leakage and wet/dry weight ratio of the lungs were significantly decreased in the LPS+AKR1C1+/+ group (P<0.05), but were significantly increased in the LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212 group compared with the LPS group (P<0.05).

Lung injury was characterized by denudation of the alveolar membrane, increased cellular infiltration, edema formation and hyaline membrane deposition.

SOD can specifically scavenge superoxide anion free radicals, whereas GPx can specifically catalyze the reduction reaction of GSH to H2O2, and scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. These two antioxidant enzymes can scavenge free radicals, reduce the production of lipid peroxides, and protect the integrity of cell membrane structure and function (29). MDA and protein carbonyl are the final products of lipid and protein peroxidation, and are two commonly used indicators for evaluating oxidative stress in the body (30). Following LPS stimulation, compared with those in the Control group, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, catalase and SOD) were significantly decreased in the lungs of the LPS and LPS+E-virus groups (P<0.05, Fig. 6A-C). In the LPS+AKR1C1+/+ group, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were significantly increased compared with those in the LPS+E-virus group (P<0.05), whereas in the LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212 group, the activities were significantly decreased compared with those in the LPS group (P<0.05). The levels of oxidative products (MDA and protein carbonyl) were significantly increased in the lungs of mice in the LPS and LPS+E-virus groups compared with those in the Control group (P<0.05; Fig. 6D and E). Conversely, in the LPS+AKR1C1+/+ group, the levels of these oxidative products were significantly decreased compared with those in the LPS+E-virus group (P<0.05), whereas in the LPS+AKR1C1\u2212/\u2212 group, these levels were significantly increased compared with those in the LPS group (P<0.05).

As shown in Fig. 7A-C, the protein expression levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were significantly increased in the LPS and LPS+E-virus groups compared with those in the Control group (P<0.05), but were decreased in the LPS+AKR1C1+/+group (P<0.05 vs. LPS+E-virus).

DiscussionAKR1C1 serves an important role in various biological processes and its expression has been reported to exhibit notable tissue specificity (31). AKR1C1 is most predominantly expressed in the lung, followed by the liver, testis, breast, endometrium and brain (32). As an important member of the AKR family, the primary functions of AKR1C1 are as follows: AKR1C1 can catalyze the reduction of progesterone to 20-hydroxyprogesterone through NADPH, reducing the concentration of progesterone, which can result in a greatly increased incidence of premature delivery, endometriosis and endometrial cancer (31,32). Moreover, overexpression of AKR1C1 can reduce sensitivity to chemotherapy. Most anticancer drugs can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause cell dysfunction and apoptosis via several signaling mechanisms. AKR1C1 overexpression has been reported to reduce the production of ROS, eliminate free radicals and inactivate anthracycline anticancer drugs, thereby reducing DNA damage and inhibiting cell apoptosis (32). Hsu et al (33) demonstrated that AKR1C1 expression was upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer tissues, and its expression was associated with tumor stage and survival prognosis; however, the protective effects of AKR1C1 in healthy lung tissues have not been well studied. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to report that AKR1C1 may function as a protective gene against LPS-induced ALI. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that AKR1C1 may be a key modulator involved in the development of LPS-induced ALI.It is well-established that increased inflammation results in cell death, thus contributing to the development of ALI (34). Although the definition and diagnostic criteria of ARDS are constantly changing, there is a consensus that uncontrollable inflammation is the internal cause of its occurrence and progression (34). The characteristic pathological changes associated with ALI are pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary fibrosis caused by increased pulmonary microvascular permeability (35). The cause of these changes is the significant pulmonary inflammation cascade, which can result in damage to the pulmonary vascular endothelial barrier and alveolar epithelial barrier (36). ALI primarily manifests as uncontrollable alveolar inflammation and massive infiltration of inflammatory cells (37). Endotoxins first initiate the release of inflammatory signals in inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, leading to the activation of phagocytic function and the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 (38). Although researchers are constantly exploring treatment options for ALI/ARDS, there are still no effective cures, other than supportive therapy to manage the disease (39). Alveolar vascular damage is one of the pathological manifestations of ALI, which can be indirectly indicated by Evans blue leakage (40). As overexpression of AKR1C1 was able to reduce Evans blue leakage and the wet/dry weight ratio in the present study, it was suggested that AKR1C1 may exert a potential protective effect on the alveolar vascular barrier and pulmonary edema. In addition, the changes in the levels of IL-6, IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 in the BALF and lung tissues indicated that AKR1C1 could attenuate the inflammatory response in the LPS-induced ALI mouse model.The balance between oxidation/antioxidant mechanisms serves an important role in the pathological process of ALI. During the development of ALI, the activity of various enzymes, such as SOD, catalase and GPx, can be inhibited, and the body can produce excessive oxygen free radicals, which lead to an imbalance in redox reactions. The neutralization of antioxidants, such as SOD, catalase and GPx, can cause oxidative damage, destroying pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in lung injury (41). The pathogenesis of ALI is accompanied by an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidant responses, as well as in the inflammatory response (42). Oxidative stress and inflammation are known to cause damage to the integrity of the pulmonary microvascular endothelium, which is the direct cause of the infiltration of fluid and macromolecular substances from the blood vessels into the alveoli and lung tissue edema (43). LPS promotes the release of large quantities of ROS, which attack the cell membranes and capillaries, initiating a \u2018cascade\u2019 chain reaction of lipid peroxidation, causing tissue damage (44). An increase in the levels of MDA and protein carbonyl can indicate an increase in free radical production (45). The present study demonstrated that AKR1C1 overexpression recovered the cellular antioxidant activity and reduced the oxidative stress in lungs; these findings are consistent with those of previous studies. For example, Burczynski et al (46) reported that AKR1C1 provided an inducible cytosolic barrier to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal following ROS exposure. Furthermore, it was revealed that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and other \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes produced during lipid peroxidation were substrates of the inducible AKR1C1 isoform. AKR1C1 could be induced by 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal and ROS, indicating that it may be a member of a battery of genes (glutathione S-transferase and \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase), which participate in a counter-response to ROS in electrophilic and oxidative stress (46).The STAT3 signaling pathway is activated by cytokine stimulation and transmits biological signals to target cells, participating in the regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis (16). The activation of NF-\u03baB induced by LPS has been shown to promote the secretion of IL-6; subsequently, a complex formed betweenIL-6 and its secretory receptor soluble IL-6 receptor may activate STAT3 and further induce activation of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, which can form a cascade of inflammatory responses and accelerate the progression of ALI (47). However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of AKR1C1 on the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in LPS-induced ALI have not been thoroughly investigated. The present results suggested that AKR1C1 could deactivate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in LPS-induced ALI. To further investigate the role of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in the protective effects of AKR1C1, AKR1C1+/+ mice were treated with LPS and JAK2/STAT3 agonists (IL-6 and colivelin), and the phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3, as well as indicators of lung injury, were then measured. The results revealed that IL-6 and colivelin successfully activated the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and abolished the effects of AKR1C1+/+ on lung injury protection. Previous studies have revealed that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway serves an important role in the development of ALI. It has been reported that IL-6 can promote the phosphorylation of STAT3, which, in turn, may further promote the expression of IL-6, forming a positive feedback regulation loop and intensifying the inflammatory response (48). Other cytokines and ILs may also activate JAKs and selectively phosphorylate STATs, promoting the transcription of target genes (49). In another study, quantitative genomic and functional analyses indicated that AKR1C1 was a key component of the STAT3 signaling pathway (13). It was reported that AKR1C1 could directly interact with STAT3, enhance the association of STAT3 to its target genes and drive metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (13). AKR1C1 was also revealed to be critical for the interaction between JAK2 and STAT3 (13), thus indicating the impact of AKR1C1 on JAK2/STAT3 signaling. Collectively, the present results indicated that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may be the key mechanism underlying the protective effects of AKR1C1overexpression on ALI. AKR1C1 was revealed to inhibit overactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in LPS-induced ALI, thus reducing oxidative stress, the levels of proinflammatory markers and edema, thereby protecting the alveolar vascular barrier. However, there are several limitations of the present study that need to be addressed. Firstly, no direct evidence for the interaction between AKR1C1 and JAK2/STAT3 was obtained, such as that which could be obtained from co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Secondly, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may not be the only mechanism of action of AKR1C1. Finally, a sham control was not generated as a negative control for intratracheal instillation. More in-depth experiments are thus required to fully clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of AKR1C1 on ALI.In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that AKR1C1 protected against oxidative stress and may be considered a negative regulator of inflammation in an in vivo model of ALI/ARDS. Overexpression of AKR1C1 led to reduced oxidative stress, reduced levels of proinflammatory markers, reduced edema formation and repair of lung tissue, whereas AKR1C1 knockout resulted in increased lung injury. The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may participate in the protective effects of AKR1C1 against the progression of ALI. Although the exact mechanism still requires further study, the AKR1C1 gene may serve as a novel biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for ALI. AcknowledgementsNot applicable.
