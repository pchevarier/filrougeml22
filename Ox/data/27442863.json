INTRODUCTIONThe ability to measure the density of RNA polymerase across the genome\nprovides a comprehensive and quantitative snapshot of transcription(Fuda et al., 2009). Collecting a series of these\nsnapshots in response to regulatory switches reveals the identity of genes that\nrespond immediately or secondarily to specific signals, and provides critical\ninsights to the mechanisms of their regulation(Adelman and Lis, 2012). Quantifying RNA polymerase density along the\ngenes is also critical for deciphering the regulatory steps involved in\ntranscription.In addition to protein coding genes, many other regions in the genome (such\nas upstream divergent regions, regions downstream of mRNA poly A sites, and\nenhancers) are transcribed to various extents. Enhancers produce short unstable RNAs\n(eRNAs) that do not encode proteins(Core et al.,\n2014) but delineate major hubs of transcription regulation(Heinz et al., 2015). Differential regulation of\nenhancer mediated transcription is implicated in various diseases(Vahedi et al., 2015), and understanding this regulation\nis important for deciphering the transcriptional changes in response to\ndevelopmental, nutritional, and environmental cues. However, sequencing of total RNA\nby RNA-seq is inefficient in detecting these unstable RNAs.A number of methods have been described that enrich and sequence nascent RNAs\nassociated with RNA polymerase. These methods are either based on\nimmunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase(Churchman and\nWeissman, 2011; Larson et al.,\n2014; Nojima et al., 2015) or are\ndependent on purification of insoluble chromatin(Weber et al., 2014). Therefore, these methods are highly dependent on\nantibody specificity or the purity of the chromatin fraction respectively. We have\ndeveloped nuclear run-on based methods to map active RNA polymerases and their start\nsites genome-wide at up to base pair resolution(Core\net al., 2008; Kwak et al., 2013).\nIn these methods, the endogenous activity of RNA polymerase is used to selectively\nlabel nascent RNAs. The ability to affinity-purify nuclear run-on RNA multiple times\nduring the course of library preparation provides an approximate million-fold\nenrichment of the nascent RNA over other forms of RNA and thereby effectively\neliminates background(Core et al., 2008).\nFurthermore, because the RNA is sequenced, the direction of transcription can be\nunambiguously identified.Development of PRO-seqPRO-seq is based on Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq), a genome-wide\nadaptation of nuclear run-on assays that have been used classically to measure\ntranscription of target genes. In GRO-seq, bromouridine-labeled nascent RNAs are\naffinity-purified and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to map RNA\npolymerase positions. Extremely high sensitivity and specificity is achieved\nthrough multiple distinct affinity-purification steps(Core et al., 2008; Jonkers et al., 2014). GRO-seq uses bromouridine as the substrate\nfor the nuclear run-on reaction, enabling RNA polymerase to add multiple\nnucleotides to the nascent RNA. Therefore, the resolution of GRO-seq is tens of\nbases.However, to understand the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional\nelongation and promoter-proximal pausing, RNA polymerase mapping at base-pair\nresolution is required. Such resolution enables mechanistic modeling of how DNA\nsequences, nucleosomes, or other DNA-binding factors affect RNA polymerase\nelongation and gene expression(Adelman and Lis,\n2012; Kwak and Lis, 2013). To\nachieve base-pair resolution, we used a modified nuclear run-on that limits the\nnumber of labeled nucleotides added to the nascent RNA(Core et al., 2008; Hah et al., 2011; Kwak et al.,\n2013; Larschan et al., 2011;\nMin et al., 2011). In PRO-seq,\nbiotin-labeled nucleotide triphosphates are provided as the substrates for the\nnuclear run-on reaction. The incorporation of a biotin-NTP by an RNA polymerase\ninhibits further incorporation of biotin-NTPs into the nascent RNA. Sequencing\nfrom the 3\u2032 end of the nascent transcript therefore identifies the last\nincorporated NTP and reveals the precise location of the active site of the RNA\npolymerase engaged with its nascent RNA.Identification of the precise position of transcription start sites\n(TSSs) is also important to understand how DNA elements, general transcription\nfactors and transcription activators recruit RNA polymerase to genes and\nenhancers. RNA polymerase initiates transcription at TSS and quickly transcribes\na short region before pausing at a promoter-proximal site. However, because the\nnascent transcripts are sequenced from the 3\u2032 end in PRO-seq, the\npositional information of where RNA polymerase began transcription is mostly\nlost. We therefore developed PRO-cap by modifying the sequencing strategy of\nPRO-seq to sequence the capped nascent RNA from 5\u2032 end, enabling\ntranscription start sites to be identified at the RNA synthesis level(Kwak et al., 2013).Overview of the procedureA general overview of the PRO-seq and PRO-cap experimental procedures is\nshown in Figure A.1. Nuclei from cells are\nrapidly isolated and native nucleotides are washed away to halt transcription.\nHowever, RNA polymerases remain engaged on the DNA and retain their enzymatic\nactivity. Incubation of isolated nuclei with biotin-labeled nucleotide\ntriphosphates allows the RNA polymerases to actively elongate and label the\nnascent RNA. For PRO-seq only, the labeled nascent RNA is hydrolyzed with NaOH\nto generate RNA fragments suitable for sequencing (~100 bp in length). The RNA\ncontaining a biotin nucleotide is then enriched by affinity purification using\nstreptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The biotin-streptavidin interaction is very\nstable (Kd ~ 10\u221214 mol/L), which allows stringent\nwashing of the magnetic beads to minimize contamination with unlabeled RNA. A\n3\u2032 sequencing adapter is then ligated to the hydroxyl (OH) group at the\n3\u2032end of nascent RNA followed by another affinity purification to\nfurther enrich nascent RNA and remove unligated adapter sequences. Preparation\nfor 5\u2032 sequencing adaptor ligation differs for PRO-Seq and PRO-cap. For\nPRO-seq, the 5\u2032 cap is removed from unhydrolyzed short nascent RNA using\neither Tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) or RNA 5\u2032 Pyrophosphohydrolase\n(RppH). The 5\u2032 OH generated by base hydrolysis is then converted to\n5\u2032 phosphate by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) For\nPRO-cap, uncapped RNA with a 5\u2032-monophosphate is degraded using\n5\u2032-Phosphate-dependent exonuclease. 5\u2032 triphosphates and\nmonophosphates are removed from any remaining contaminating uncapped RNA with\nAlkaline phosphatase. Only then is the 5\u2032 cap of nascent RNA removed\nwith TAP or RppH treatment. After these chemical modifications, a 5\u2032\nsequencing adapter is ligated to the nascent RNA and a third round of affinity\npurification performed to enrich for nascent RNA with sequencing adapters on\nboth ends. Nascent RNA is then reverse transcribed and test-PCR-amplified to\ndetermine an appropriate number of PCR cycles for final amplification; this\nlatter step is critical to avoid over amplification. During the final\namplification, barcodes can be added so that multiple libraries can be pooled\nfor sequencing. Finally, the PCR amplified libraries are size-selected for a\nrange of 140\u2013350 bp and sent for high-throughput sequencing. Sequencing\ndepth of 25\u201350 million for mammalian cells, 10\u201320 million for\norganisms with smaller genome size such as Drosophila, and 5\u201310 million\nfor yeast cells provide useful information. Relatively short read length such as\n40\u201350 bp is sufficient. The sequencing result is a text-based list of\nshort nucleotide sequences and its sequencing quality parameters are provided in\na \u2018fastq\u2019 format(Cock et al.,\n2010). The sequences may contain varying lengths of adapter\nsequences, which are removed, and the adaptor-removed sequences are then aligned\nto the appropriate genome. Finally, the aligned sequences are used to generate\ncoverage files that can be used to visualize and analyze the data.Open in a separate windowFigure A.1Flowchart of the PRO-seq and PRO-cap protocolStages of the procedure are outlined along with schematics indicating the\nstatuses of the RNA polymerase and the nascent RNA. PRO-seq and PRO-cap share\ncommon steps, but are different at the adaptor ligation, reverse transcription,\nand 5\u2032 modification stages. In PRO-seq, the 3\u2032 RNA adaptor is\nmodified to have the reverse complement sequence of a standard 5\u2032 RNA\nadaptor. Similarly, the 5\u2032 RNA adaptor and the reverse transcription\nprimer are modified for PRO-seq. This allows 3\u2032 sequencing of the RNA on\na standard Illumina platform. For PRO-cap, standard small RNA adaptors are used,\nand results in a 5\u2032 sequencing as usual. In the 5\u2032 modification\nstep, PRO-seq RNAs are de-capped and re-phosphorylated to ensure all RNA is\naccessible for 5\u2032 RNA adaptor ligation. PRO-cap RNAs are\nde-phosphorylated first to convert all forms of 5\u2032 end except for the\n5\u2032 capped ends to a 5\u2032 hydroxyl end, in order to restrict the\nligation of 5\u2032 adaptor only to the cap containing nascent RNAs after cap\nremoval . Then the 5\u2032 caps are converted to 5\u2032 monophosphates\nusing the tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, and can be ligated to a 5\u2032 RNA\nadaptor.Advantages and limitations of PRO-seqThe key advantages of PRO-seq are:It provides base-pair resolution and strand-specific information\nof global RNA polymerase occupancy.Background RNA contamination is hugely reduced due to almost a\nmillion fold purification of biotinylated nascent RNAs.It is highly sensitive in detecting rare and common nascent RNAs\nwith a large dynamic range (>105).It can identify short unstable nascent RNAs transcribed from\nenhancer regions.PRO-seq also has a number of limitations that should be considered when\ndeciding which genome-wide RNA polymerase mapping strategy to use.In principle, PRO-seq results are ensemble profiles of\npotentially heterogeneous populations of cells - and this is generally\ntrue for all multi-cell, high-throughput sequencing analyses. Unlike\nmature RNA molecules that are present in multiple copies per cell, RNA\npolymerase at a specific genomic position can only yield at most two\ncopies of nascent RNA. So while it may be possible to adapt PRO-seq to\nmeasure nascent transcript levels for abundantly expressed genes in\nsingle cells, genome-wide mapping of RNA polymerase in single cells\nusing PRO-seq would remain a challenge.PRO-seq detects only the active RNA polymerase and so RNA\npolymerases in the pre-initiation complex will not be detected. There is\nalso a possibility that other forms of stalled RNA polymerases, such as\nback-tracked polymerases, may not be detected, although nuclear run-on\nconditions may allow some of these polymerases to realign the active\nsite through thermal motion. Generally, the signals seen by ChIP-seq of\nRNA Polymerase II (Pol II) and our genome-wide run-on methods\nquantitatively agree(Core et al.,\n2012), so the bulk of Pol II is detectable by GRO- and\nPRO-seq methods.Compared to GRO-seq that adds a longer extension to the\n3\u2032 end of nascent RNA(Core et\nal., 2008), PRO-seq only adds one or a few nucleotides in\norder to provide higher resolution mapping. However, there is a\npossibility that RNA polymerases positioned very close to the TSS may\nnot be detected because the nascent RNA may not be long enough to be\nuniquely mapped to the genome. In this case, GRO-seq may provide more\naccurate quantification of promoter proximal RNA polymerases. Likewise,\nRNA polymerases positioned in a repetitive sequence region of the genome\nis difficult to unambiguously map to a particular repeat.PRO-seq does not distinguish nascent transcription derived from\ndifferent RNA polymerases (Pol I vs Pol II vs Pol III) unless carried\nout in the presence of inhibitors of specific RNA polymerases. Also,\nunlike NET-Seq, nascent RNA associated with specific RNA polymerase\nmodifications (e.g. phosphorylations of the C-terminal domain) cannot be\nselectively detected using PRO-seq(Nojima et al., 2015).Applications of PRO-seq and PRO-capThe most common use of PRO-seq is for the analysis of genome-wide\ntranscription levels with directional information and with higher resolution and\nsensitivity than an RNA polymerase ChIP-seq assay. PRO-seq provides an\nindependent layer of gene expression analysis distinct from mRNA-seq, revealing\nthe transcriptional stages of regulation before the influence of mRNA processing\nor stability control. The increased resolution and the directional information\nbecome useful in distinguishing upstream divergent (also called upstream\nantisense) transcription(Core et al.,\n2008; Seila et al., 2008).PRO-cap(Kwak et al., 2013) can\ncapture TSS at the nascent RNA synthesis level in contrast to other TSS analyses\nthat use mature RNA(Andersson et al.,\n2014; Carninci et al., 1996; Forrest et al., 2014). This becomes an\nadvantage in detecting enhancer transcripts(Core\net al., 2014; Hah et al.,\n2013; Wang et al., 2011), upstream\nantisense transcription(Core et al., 2008;\n2014), or other types of unstable\ntranscripts, and avoiding post-transcriptional background capping events(Fejes-Toth et al., 2009).Alternatives to PRO-seqRNA polymerase can be mapped genome-wide by a variety of different\nstrategies.ChIP-seq: In this approach, RNA polymerase\nproteins are cross-linked to the DNA and then RNA polymerase II (Pol II)\nis purified by immuno-precipitation. Pol II associated DNA is identified\nand quantified by high-throughput sequencing thereby providing an\nestimate of the amount of Pol II at different sites on the genome. The\nresolution of ChIP is usually limited by the size of the fragmented DNA\nin the chromatin at the immunoprecipitation step. A variant of this\nmethod called ChIP-exo overcomes the resolution limitation by\nadditionally treating the DNA fragments from the Pol II ChIP with a DNA\nexonuclease(Rhee and Pugh,\n2012). The exonuclease digests DNA from the 3\u2032 end of\nboth strands, stopping near the cross-linked polymerase complex. An\nadditional limitation of ChIP-seq is that Pol II-unbound genomic regions\nthat interact with a Pol II-bound region through three-dimensional\nlooping can be falsely identified with this method due to the use of\ncross-linking. Finally, ChIP-seq will map all forms of Pol II, including\ntranscriptionally inactive Pol IIs and Pol IIs in antisense orientation:\ntherefore, the direction of the transcription is not directly\ndisclosed.Permanganate footprinting: this method can be\nused to identify the single stranded DNA created by the transcription\nbubble formed on DNA by the RNA polymerase. The non-template strand of\nthe DNA is exposed to single-strand specific breakage at T residues\nthrough a series of chemical treatments. A method called\nPermanganate-ChIP-seq couples permanganate footprinting to Pol II ChIP\nand thereby maps the cleaved ends of the DNA from the single-stranded\nregion of transcription bubbles(Li et\nal., 2013). This directly maps the transcription active site\nwith high resolution. Permanganate mapping depends on the presence of\nthymine residues in the non-templated single-stranded DNA of the bubble\nthat are not masked by protein binding. Although the protocol enriches\nfor Pol II in a single chromatin immunoprecipitation, other regions that\nexpose single stranded thymine such as in other DNA-RNA hybrids or\nintra-strand DNA hairpins could contribute to background.Native Elongating Transcript sequencing\n(NET-seq): a number of chromatin bound nascent RNA based\nmethods, including NET-seq and its variants, have been developed for\nmapping RNA polymerase(Churchman and\nWeissman, 2011; Mayer et al.,\n2015; Nojima et al.,\n2015; Weber et al.,\n2014). In the original NET-seq protocol(Churchman and Weissman, 2011), the RNA\npolymerase complex is immunoprecipitated and the co-purified native RNA\nis sequenced. The 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA provides base-pair\nresolution mapping of RNA polymerase. This method is ideally suited to\nexamine the occupancy of differently modified RNA polymerases. In\npractice, the efficiency of NET-seq relies on the degree of enrichment\nprovided by the single immuno-precipitation step. Because the method\ndetects the 3\u2032 ends of all RNAs that are associated with Pol II,\nit also captures 3\u2032 ends of intermediates of co-transcriptional\nsplicing and micro-RNA production that can complicate mapping of\ntranscriptionally-engaged Pol II(Nojima\net al., 2015).Experimental DesignCells In our lab, we have successfully generated PRO-Seq libraries for\ncells from plant (unpublished, G.T.B.), yeast (unpublished, G.T.B.),\nDrosophila(Kwak et al.,\n2013), and mammals(Core et al.,\n2014; Mahat et al., 2016).\nIn general, the higher the number of cells the better the PRO-seq read\ncoverage of the genome. However, a minimum of 5\u201310 million nuclei or\npermeabilized cells is required for a single PRO-seq library regardless of\ncell type. In principle, the application of PRO-seq in yeast, including\nS. pombe and S. cerevisiae, is very\nsimilar to that of other organisms; however, some alterations are required\nin yeast cell permeabilization(Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2004), run-on reaction,\nand post run-on RNA extraction procedures(Collart and Oliviero, 2001); required modifications for yeast\nare indicated in the appropriate steps of the Procedure.Sample preparation Isolation of nuclei for nuclear run-on is a critical step in the\nprocedure not only to preserve the enzymatic activity of the RNA polymerase,\nbut also to capture the precise position of the RNA polymerase on genes.\nStarting with 10\u201320 million cells per library is recommended\nconsidering the efficiency of nuclei isolation process (~50%). The\nwhole process should take place in the cold room on ice as far as is\npossible. Isolated nuclei can be resuspended in the glycerol-containing\nstorage buffer, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage\nat \u221280\u00b0C. We have used permeabilized cells in PRO-seq as an\nalternative to isolating nuclei, making handling easier and reducing loss of\nsample; cell permeabilization has a much higher efficiency (~90%)\nthan nuclei isolation. Cell permeabilization conditions may differ between\ncell types and may need to be optimized; we provide a general method for\npermeabilization in the Procedure as well as a version optimized for yeast\ncells.Spike-in for library normalization Disproportionate loss of RNA and/or cDNA can occur during multiple\nstages of the PRO-seq library preparation, which spans 4\u20135 days and\ninvolves several handling steps. Even with the use of identical starting\nmaterial, uneven loss of libraries could affect the genome-wide RNA\npolymerase density between libraries. To control for handling effects on\nlibrary yield, a small fraction (1\u20135%) of cells with a\ndistinct genome can be added during library preparation; adding an identical\nnumber of spike-in cells to different libraries enables normalization\nbetween different conditions. We have used Schizosaccharomyces\npombe to normalize Saccharomyces cerevisiae\nand vice versa, and Drosophila cells to normalize mammalian\ncells and vice versa. When using the cell-permeabilization approach,\nspike-in cells should be added and permeabilized together with the\nexperimental cells. For the nuclei isolation approach, spike-in cells should\nbe added to the experimental cells prior to nuclei isolation and dounced\ntogether.Nuclear run-on In PRO-seq, biotin-NTPs are used as the nuclear run-on substrates.\nThe Km of each of the NTPs as substrates for RNA polymerase lie\nin the range of 1\u201320 \u03bcM(Job\net al., 1984). Therefore, final substrate concentration greater\nthan 1\u201320 \u03bcM range (~25 \u03bcM) is, in general,\nsufficient for each biotin-NTP substrate. Depending on the purpose of the\nexperiment, biotin-NTP substrates can be supplied in different combinations:\nindividual biotin run-on, 4 biotin run-on, 2 biotin run-on or 1 biotin\nrun-on.Individual-biotin run-on: To obtain the\nmost precise mapping of the RNA polymerase, four separate PRO-seq\nlibraries are made, each supplied with only one type of biotin-NTP\nin the nuclear run-on reaction. This ensures that the RNA polymerase\nadds only one, or at most a few (when the polymerase is positioned\nat multiple stretches of same nucleotide) biotin-NTPs to the nascent\nRNA. In this case, 4 times more sample is required.4-Biotin run-on: we found that all 4\nbiotin-NTPs can be supplied in a single reaction and the Pol II only\nincorporates one or at most a few bases, giving an equivalent\nresolution to single biotin run-on. The reason for this is unclear,\nbut we speculate that steric hindrance in the active site of RNA\npolymerase prevents incorporation of multiple biotinylated\nnucleotides.2-Biotin run-on: When the amount of sample\nor the cost is limiting, unlabeled NTPs can be used in combination\nwith biotin NTPs. Use of biotinylated purine nucleotides\n(biotin-ATP, biotin-GTP) is more costly than that of the pyrimidine\nnucleotides (biotin-CTP, biotin-UTP). A combination of biotin-CTP,\nbiotin-UTP, ATP, and GTP can be supplied to the nuclear run-on\nreaction, providing reasonable resolution and cost.1-Biotin run-on: If a longer run-on RNA is\npreferred, combinations of biotin-CTP with unlabeled CTP, UTP, ATP,\nand GTP can be used effectively in a biotin-NTP form of GRO-seq.\nThis approach can be useful for increasing sequencing coverage of\nRNA polymerases that reside near the TSSs. While most\ntranscriptionally-engaged RNA polymerases near the 5\u2032 ends\nreside between 30\u201360 nucleotides from the TSS(Kwak et al., 2013), RNA\npolymerases closer to the TSS may fail to map uniquely.\nAdditionally, the longer run-on extensions of nascent RNAs may be\ndesired for distinguishing allele-specific nascent\ntranscription.PCR amplification of PRO-seq library When the number of cells and/or nuclei are limited for PRO-seq\nlibrary preparation, a higher number of PCR amplification cycles will be\nrequired to generate sufficient library for reliable quantification and\naccurate loading into the sequencer. However, a higher number of PCR cycles\ncan result in amplification bias of some sequences. To avoid PCR-induced\nbiases, molecular barcodes(Fu et al.,\n2014) can be introduced as part of the 3\u2032 RNA adapter,\nwhich is ligated to the nascent RNAs. Duplicate reads generated by PCR\nover-amplification can be identified by identical barcodes and\ncomputationally filtered at the stage of mapping the sequenced reads to the\ngenome. MATERIALSREAGENTSCRITICAL: Extreme care should be taken to avoid nuclease contamination.\nUse nuclease-free reagents and change gloves routinely.Appropriate cell line(s) e.g. K562, GM12878, MCF7, Hela,\nembryonic stem cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse 3T3 cells,\nDrosophila S2, yeast.CAUTION: Before use, cells should be checked for\ncontamination.Chemical stocks Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.\nD5758)CAUTION: DEPC is toxic and harmful.

For example, if the\nlane in the agarose gel with dilution 3 has the desired amplification\ncharacteristics, then the optimal number of PCR cycles (optimized cycle,\nOC) for full-scale amplification is 13 (see step 93).

Stop electrophoresis 10 minutes after\nthe Orange G dye has run off the gel.116During the electrophoresis, puncture the bottom of a sterile,\nnuclease-free, 0.5 ml centrifuge tube using a 21-gauge needle (heated in\na bunsen flame) to create a hole or several holes in the bottom of the\ntube. Place the 0.5 ml microtube into a sterile, round-bottom,\nnuclease-free, 2 ml microtube.117After the electrophoresis, pry apart the gel cassette and stain\nthe gel with SYBR Gold (10 \u03bcl SybrGold per 100 ml 1\u00d7 TBE\nbuffer) in a clean container for 5\u201310 min.118Visualize the gel on a Dark Reader transilluminator.119Using a clean scalpel or razor, cut the gel from 140 bp (20 bp\njust above the 120 bp adapter dimer) up to 350 bp (see Figure A.2C, A.2D, and A.2E).120Split the gel fragment vertically and place the pieces into the\n0.5 ml microtube.121Centrifuge the stacked tubes at 10,000 g for 2\nmin at room temperature to shred the gel through the holes into the 2 ml\ntube (there is no liquid at this point).122If some gel remains in the top tube, add 100 \u03bcl of Gel\nElution Buffer and spin at 10,000g again for another 2 min.123Add 600 \u03bcl of Gel Elution Buffer and incubate for 2 hr\nin a rotating incubator, 37\u00b0C.PAUSE POINT: The elution can continue overnight.124Spin down gel pieces for 1 min at max speed in a benchtop\ncentrifuge.125Transfer all liquid possible to a new tube.126Add 400 \u03bcl of Gel Elution Buffer to the remaining gel\npieces.127Incubate for 1 hr in a rotating incubator, 37\u00b0C.128After 1 h incubation, spin at the maximum speed in a benchtop\ncentrifuge for 1 min; take the supernatant and pool with the first\nelution from step 125.129Rinse gel pieces with 250 \u03bcl H2O, spin and\nadd the rinsed liquid to the pool.130Transfer the pooled eluate which may contain small pieces of\ngel debris, to the top of a Spin-X filter.131Centrifuge the filter for 1\u20132 min at\n6,000\u20137,000 g, room temperature. Collect the\nfiltrate. If the volume exceeds the filter capacity, use multiple\nfilters or split into batches and repeat filtering a couple of times and\npool the filtrates.132Lyophilize (on medium setting) the sample using a Speed Vac\ndryer reduce the volume to ~400 \u03bcl (takes 45 min\u20132 hr).\nIf the volume decreases below 400 \u03bcl, bring the volume up to 400\n\u03bcl by adding DEPC-H2O.133Add an equal volume of buffered phenol:chloroform, and vortex\nthoroughly.134Centrifuge at 14,000 g for 5 min,\n4\u00b0C.135Collect the aqueous layer in a clean tube.136Add an equal volume of chloroform to the aqueous layer, and\nvortex thoroughly.137Centrifuge at 14,000 g for 5 min,\n4\u00b0C.138Collect the aqueous layer in a clean tube.139Add 1 \u03bcl GlycoBlue to the aqueous layer.140Add 2.5\u00d7 volume of room temperature 100%\nethanol.141Vortex thoroughly and incubate at room temperature for 10\nmin.142Centrifuge at 14,000 g for 20 min,\n4\u00b0C.143Remove liquid, and wash the DNA pellet once in 75%\nethanol by repeating steps 45\u201348.144Re-dissolve the pellet in 12 \u03bcl H2O.145Use 2 \u03bcl of the library DNA for quantification using\nQubit or Bioanalyzer. The expected concentration of the library is\nbetween 1\u201320 ng/\u03bcl.146If required, dilute the samples to 5 ng/\u03bcl. Send ~10 ng\nto the sequencing facility for sequencing. If the libraries are\nbarcoded, pool the barcoded libraries that are to be sequenced\nsimultaneously.High-throughput sequencing | Timing: 24 h147Sequence pooled PRO-seq or PRO-cap libraries using an Illumina\nTRU-seq compatible sequencing platform. Sequencing depth of ~20 million\nand ~50 million reads provides good coverage in insect cells and\nmammalian cells respectively.Data analysis | TIMING: variableCRITICAL. In PRO-seq, the 3\u2032 end of the nascent\nRNA corresponds to the genomic position of the RNA polymerase active site. The\nmodified RNA adaptors were designed to enable sequencing of the reverse\ncomplement of nascent RNAs. Therefore, the 3\u2032 end of the reverse\ncomplement of the sequencing reads reflects the RNA polymerase active site\nposition. In PRO-cap, conventional RNA adaptors are used, and the 5\u2032\nends of each sequence read reflects the transcription start sites in the same\ndirection. Below, we outline the three major stages of a simple processing\npipeline.148Pre-process the raw sequence data. Filter out\nlow quality reads and trimming potential adaptor sequences\n(TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG) from the sequence reads. Tools such as\n\u2018cutadapt\u2019 are publicly available for this purpose.\nDepending on the quality of the library, sequences containing only the\nadaptor sequences (adaptor dimers) may take up to 5% of total\nreads.149Map or align the sequence reads to the genomic\nsequence. Since most of the nascent RNA reads are captured\nbefore RNA processing and splicing, they do not contain large gaps in\nalignment. Therefore, many alignment programs based on the\nBurrows-Wheeler transformation algorithm such as \u2018bwa\u2019\nor \u2018bowtie\u2019 work well. Reads with multiple alignments\nare usually discarded, unless they are used for studying specific target\nregions that are repeated more than once. Sometimes, reads aligning to\nthe ribosomal DNA sequence can be pre-filtered since they can account\nfor 30\u201340% of all the transcriptional activity. On\naverage, about 55\u201370% of the raw sequence reads are\naligned uniquely to the genome. The alignment results are commonly\nstored in \u2018sam\u2019 or \u2018bam\u2019 formats.150Generate the coverage of the aligned sequence\nreads. A common way to do this using publicly available\ntools is as follows: first, sort the \u2018bam\u2019 file using\n\u2018samtools sort\u2019; then process the sorted\n\u2018bam\u2019 file using \u2018bedtools genomecov\u2019\nwith \u2018-ibam\u2019 (use bam file input),\n\u2018-strand\u2019 (strand specific coverage), and\n\u2018-5\u2032 (5\u2032 position coverage\u2019) options.\nFor the PRO-seq data, swap the plus and minus strand data for the\ncorrect orientation. These data can be visualized in genome browsers\n(Figure A.3), and used in\nfurther downstream analyses.Open in a separate windowFigure A.3Genome browser examples of PRO-seq and PRO-cap results(A) Sample of PRO-seq and PRO-cap data viewed on the University of California at\nSanta Cruz (UCSC) genome browser.

In general, PRO-seq profile of a\ngene exhibits several features such as: a) higher read density at the\npromoter-proximal pause site compared to the gene body representing paused Pol IIs,\nb) uniform read density across exons and introns, c) reads beyond the\npolyadenylation site, and d) divergent PRO-seq reads at the promoter of genes in\nmammals indicating divergent transcription. The enhancer regions, which are present\nin intergenic and intragenic regions, are also characterized by divergent PRO-seq\nreads. In PRO-cap, read density is very high at TSS and very low, almost at\nbackground level, in gene bodies. An indication of whether library preparation has\nbeen successful can be obtained at the Test amplification stage (steps\n93\u2013101) through estimates of yield and quality (Figure A.2). Spiky PRO-seq read coverage along the gene\nbody indicates lower complexity of the library, which may arise from use of fewer\nnuclei or permeabilized cells or by the use of higher number of PCR amplification\ncycles. Libraries that require fewer amplification cycles (less than 13 cycles)\nprovide high quality results, and those requiring between 14\u201318 cycles\nprovide meaningful results but with some potential for amplification biases. These\namplification biases manifest as low library complexity in general and high\nrepetition of certain sequence reads.
