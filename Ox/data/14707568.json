{"title": "Effect of neuromuscular blocking agents on gas exchange in patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome", "pubDate": "2004", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1097/01.CCM.0000104114.72614.BC", "PMID": "14707568", "abstract": "Objective:                       To evaluate the effects of a 48-hr neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) infusion on gas exchange over a 120-hr time period in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.                  Design:                       Multiple center, prospective, controlled, and randomized trial.                  Setting:                       Four adult medical or mixed medical-surgical intensive care units.                  Patients:                       A total of 56 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <150 at a positive end-expiratory pressure of > or =5 cm H2O.                  Interventions:                       After randomization, patients received either conventional therapy without NMBA (control group) or conventional therapy plus NMBA for the next 48 hrs. The initial ventilator mode was volume-assist/control. The ventilator remained on assist-control mode throughout the initial 48-hr period in both groups. Tidal volume was 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight.                  Measurements and main results:                       When analyzed for the entire 120 hrs, there was a significant effect of the NMBA on the course of PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p =.021). Separate comparisons at each time point indicated that patients randomized to the NMBA group had a higher PaO2/FiO2 at 48, 96, and 120 hrs after randomization. Moreover, a decrease of positive end-expiratory pressure (p =.036) was only found in the NMBA group. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance exhibited a decrease in positive end-expiratory pressure over time (p =.036). Concerning short-term effects, there was no modification of PaO2/FiO2 ratio 1 hr after randomization in either group. Only one patient (from the control group) developed pneumothorax.                  Conclusions:                       Use of NMBA during a 48-hr period in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with a sustained improvement in oxygenation.", "author": [{"author": "Marc Gainnier", "affiliation": ["Service de R\u00e9animation M\u00e9dicale, H\u00f4pitaux Sud, Marseille, France."], "href": "/?term=Gainnier+M&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "Antoine Roch", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Roch+A&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "Jean-Marie Forel", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Forel+JM&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "Xavier Thirion", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Thirion+X&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "Jean-Michel Arnal", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Arnal+JM&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "St\u00e9phane Donati", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Donati+S&cauthor_id=14707568"}, {"author": "Laurent Papazian", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Papazian+L&cauthor_id=14707568"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["14707568", "35101098", "35065599", "34992415", "34860978", "34599691", "34585258", "34301439", "33934595", "33738034", "33713156", "33627570", "33444180", "33206201", "33159530", "33104824", "33095344", "33071092", "32483489", "32325004", "32288733", "32076372", "32066488", "32063852", "32030529", "32030306", "32015880", "31961896", "31931794", "31903290", "31656637", "31392279", "31380507", "31365111", "31334568", "31258917", "31236307", "31197492", "30557377", "30460261", "30247273", "30053961", "29788993", "29706811", "28828367", "28828366", "28770545", "28770093", "28127231", "28102521", "28013329", "27790273", "27408729", "27255913", "26988416", "26598954", "26399891", "25586462", "25266883", "25110462", "25098333", "24667919", "24413319", "23822630", "23796602", "23497608", "23062076", "22835162", "22383921", "21970563", "21298026", "20948686", "19769782"], "body": ""}
