By using chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses (ChIP, ChIP\u2010seq, reChIP and 3C\u2010ChIP), we demonstrated that pS81 is coupled to AR transactivation and enriched at AR\u2010activated enhancer\u2010promoter loops. pS81 is co\u2010stimulated by CDK1 and CDK9, both representing potential therapeutic targets in castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer patients, either alone or in conjunction with direct AR antagonists.\n Abbreviations3Cchromosome conformation captureADTandrogen deprivation therapiesARandrogen receptorATAC\u2010Seqassay for targeting accessible\u2010chromatin with high\u2010throughput sequencingBETAbinding and expression target analysisBRD4bromodomain\u2010containing protein 4CDK1cyclin\u2010dependent kinases 1CDK9cyclin\u2010dependent kinases 9CDSsteroid\u2010depletedChIP\u2010seqchromatin immunoprecipitation analysis\u2010sequencingCRPCcastration\u2010resistant prostate cancerddPCRdroplet digital PCRDHTdihydrotestosteroneDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEnhenhancerFACSfluorescence\u2010activated cell sortingIHCimmunohistochemistryPCaprostate cancerPCRpolymerase chain reactionPropromoterpS81AR serine 81 phosphorylationPSAprostate\u2010specific antigenpTEFbpositive transcription elongation factor bRNA Pol IIRNA polymerase II 1.\u2003IntroductionAndrogen receptor (AR) is an essential molecule in prostate cancer (PCa) development and the major target in PCa therapy. In PCa cells, AR binds to thousands of genomic loci and regulates hundreds of gene promoters by recruiting transcription co\u2010factors that elicit chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation [1, 2]. Most PCa patients respond to androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) but they generally relapse within a few years with castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). AR is still highly expressed in CRPC cells and many CRPC tumors respond to second\u2010line anti\u2010androgen agents, such as enzalutamide and the CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone. However, these responses are limited and mechanisms and targets underlying AR re\u2010activation in advanced CRPC remain to be established [3, 4, 5].In response to androgen, AR undergoes phosphorylation at multiple proline\u2010directed sites [6, 7, 8]. The AR serine 81 (S81) is a proline\u2010directed phosphorylation residue that bears unusual features: it is embedded within a long poly\u2010glutamine (Poly\u2010Q) stretch with surface\u2010accessibility and it is the most androgen\u2010responsive phosphorylated site on AR [6, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Unlike phosphorylation at other AR residues, S81 phosphorylation (pS81) occurs over a prolonged time course that is correlated with AR\u2010target gene induction, indicating a mechanistic connection between pS81 and AR transactivation [9, 10, 13, 14, 15]. The expression of pS81 is also androgen dose\u2010dependently linked to AR transactivation [11]. Consistent with these observations, we previously reported that pS81 may function in AR nuclear localization and chromatin binding [9], and a recent study found that pS81 can mediate AR interaction with coactivator protein p300 [16]. In addition, the proline\u2010directed kinases CDK1 and CDK9 were identified to interact with AR and mediate S81 phosphorylation [6, 14, 17]. Canonically, CDK9 together with cyclin T forms the pTEFb complex that phosphorylates RNA polymerase II (RNA pol\u20102) to elicit transcriptional elongation [18]. It has been proposed that CDK9 may similarly phosphorylate AR at S81 upon occupancy of the target gene promoter [17], providing a coupling mechanism where pS81 forms a complex with the pTEFb that simultaneously activates the RNA Pol II and transcription. Indeed, a recent report showed that AR can be reactivated through CDK9\u2010mediated phosphorylation, and co\u2010targeting CDK9 and AR can be an AR\u2010directed strategy in PCa [19].CDK1 overexpression has been frequently observed in CRPC with increased G2\u2010M spectrum in the cell cycle [6, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In CRPC cells, hyperactivated CDK1 can mediate phosphorylation of S81 to activate AR in the absence of ligands or in response to residual androgens. Here we employed multiple approaches to assess a linkage of pS81 with AR transactivation at the chromatin loci of a subset of androgen\u2010stimulated genes. Using ChIP, ReChIP and 3C\u2010ChIP assay, we demonstrated an enrichment of pS81 at the AR\u2010activated enhancer\u2010promoter loop, where phosphorylated AR and activated RNA Pol II would share CDK9 for transactivation. Notably, we also found CDK1 and CDK9 co\u2010sustain pS81 expression across all cellular fractions, indicating pS81 is constantly equilibrated between cytoplasm and chromatin. In addition, amplified CDK1 can function throughout the cell cycle in CRPC cells and its inhibition can re\u2010sensitize CRPC cells to androgen. Together, our findings define the chromatin roles for Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR on its transactivation and further validate the potential of CDK1 and CDK9 as therapeutic targets in PCa. 2.\u2003Materials and methods2.1.

ImmunohistochemistryThe immunohistochemistry (IHC) test was performed using the VectorStain EliteABC kit (Cat.H\u20106100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and its procedures, as outlined in the following steps.Step1: Deparaffinization: the slides were baked at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, then processed in the following order: xylene\u00a0\u2192\u00a0xylene\u00a0\u2192\u00a0100% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a095% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a080% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a070% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a050% ethanol, each for 3\u00a0min. The slides were then rinsed with tap water 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min.Step 2: Nonezymatic antigen retrieval and epitope recovery: the slides were boiled in a steam container with 1\u00d7 Diva Decloaker buffer (Biocare Medical #DV2004LX, MX) for 30\u00a0min and cooled down naturally, and the slides then rinsed with tap water.Step3: Blocking: the slides were kept in 10% H2O2 for 5\u00a0min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, and the slides rinsed in tap water and then blocked in 1% BSA/PBS with serum for 45\u00a0min.Step 4: Antibody and avidin/biotin incubation: the antibodies were prepared in 1% BSA/PBS; for both the anti\u2010pS81 and anti\u2010AR antibody, the optimized final concentration was 100\u00a0ng\u00b7mL\u22121. The slides were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the slides in the PBS\u2010T buffer (0.05% Tween20) for 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min, the slides were incubated with the biotin\u2010linked secondary antibody (1\u00a0:\u00a0400) in the blocking buffer (1% BSA/PBS with serum) at room temperature for 30\u00a0min. After washing the slides in the PBS\u2010T buffer for 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min, the slides were incubated with the ABC reagent for 45\u00a0min, followed by washing in the PBS\u2010T buffer for 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min.Step 5: Chromagen detection and counterstain: the slides were developed using the DAB kit (Cat. SK\u20104100; Vector Laboratories) and observed frequently under microscope for up to 5\u201320\u00a0min until the desired stains reached sufficient intensity; the slides were then immersed in tap water to stop the reaction. Upon washing the slides with running tap water, counter\u2010staining was conducted with 10% hematoxylin (Sigma MHS32\u20101L) solution for 2\u00a0min. The slides were then rinsed with tap water.Step 6: Dehydration and mounting: the slides were processed sequentially in 50% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a070% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a080% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a095% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a0100% ethanol\u00a0\u2192\u00a0xylene\u00a0\u2192\u00a0xylene, each for 3\u00a0min, followed by mounting the slides with the non\u2010aqueous mounting reagent (PERMASLIP; Alban Scientific, St. Louis, MO, USA).2.3. Bioinformatics and datasetsTime\u2010dependent androgen\u2010induction of AR\u2010regulated gene expression was based on LNCaP Affymetrix microarray (DHT, 10\u00a0nm; treatment for 2, 4, 8 and 24\u00a0h) [24]. GSEA study was performed as reported [25] with the following datasets: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE32269\",\"term_id\":\"32269\"}}GSE32269; {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE11428\",\"term_id\":\"11428\"}}GSE11428, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE31410\",\"term_id\":\"31410\"}}GSE31410 and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE32356\",\"term_id\":\"32356\"}}GSE32356 [20, 22, 23]. For binding and expression target analysis (BETA) see http://cistrome.org/BETA/ [26]. AR binding in LNCaP cells was based on AR ChIP\u2010Seq (R1881 treated for 16\u00a0h; {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE14092\",\"term_id\":\"14092\"}}GSE14092) [27]. ChIP\u2010Seq annotation was performed using the WASHU Browser. The promoter peaks based on \u00b1\u00a03\u00a0kb of gene TSSs were identified using the R package \u2018ChIPseeker\u2019. The enhancer (roughly between 3 and 100\u00a0kb) was assigned to the nearest gene. Pair\u2010end sequencing reads from the AR ChIP\u2010seq experiment were aligned to the NBCI Build hg19 of the human genome with bowtie v2.3.5 [28] with default parameters. Only reads with a mapping quality >\u00a0q5 were retained. Peak calling was performed on datasets with macs v2.2.6 software [29] using parameters \u2018\u2010\u2010keep\u2010dup\u00a0=\u00a01\u2019 and \u2018\u2010\u2010SPMR\u2019. According to the descending order of peaks of the P\u2010value, the top 5000 peaks of enhancer and promoter were identified, and then analyzed for de novo motif discovery in ChIP\u2010seq using HOMER [30]. Resultant bedGraph files were converted to big wiggle files using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) bedGraphToBigWig tool. Genomic signal within 2\u00a0kb of peaks was visualized using deepTools.2.4. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation), ChIP\u2010Seq, Re\u2010ChIP and 3C\u2010ChIP2.4.1.  ChIP The ChIP test was carried out as reported previously [17], and as briefly described here. For crosslinking: the cells in media were fixed by adding formaldehyde (1%, final concentration) and incubation at room temperature for 10\u00a0min, followed by quenching with glycine at a final concentration of 0.2\u00a0m. The cells were washed twice with pre\u2010chilled PBS, and then harvested in PBS. The nuclear fraction was extracted by first re\u2010suspending the pellet in 10\u00a0mL of LB1 buffer (50\u00a0mm Hepes\u2010KOH, pH\u00a07.5; 140\u00a0mm NaCl; 1\u00a0mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 0.5% NP\u201040; 0.25% Triton X\u2010100) for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Cells were pelleted, re\u2010suspended in 10\u00a0mL of LB2 buffer (10\u00a0mm Tris\u2010HCl, pH\u00a08.0; 200\u00a0mm NaCl; 1\u00a0mm EDTA; 0.5\u00a0mm EGTA) and mixed at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Cells were then pelleted and re\u2010suspended in 300\u00a0\u00b5L of LB3 buffer (10\u00a0mm Tris\u2010HCl, pH\u00a08.0; 100\u00a0mm NaCl; 1\u00a0mm EDTA; 0.5\u00a0mm EGTA; 0.1% Na\u2010deoxycholate; 0.5% N\u2010lauroylsarcosine) and sonicated with a waterbath bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ, USA). Then 30\u00a0\u00b5L of 10% Triton X\u2010100 was added and the lysate was centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 20\u00a0000\u00a0g to separate debris. The supernatant was then subjected to pre\u2010clearing and ChIP analysis, as described [17].2.4.2.  ChIP\u2010seq The ChIP step was carried out similar to Section 2.4.1 and the DNA was submitted for deep\u2010seq on the Illumina platform. In all, two AR and three pS81 ChIP samples were submitted for deep\u2010seq at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (MBCF at DFCI, Boston, MA, USA). All five ChIP\u2010Seq samples were based on independent tests of LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted CDS medium. The DHT (10 nm) treatment conditions are: A1 (AR, DHT for 4 h); A2 (AR, DHT for 8 h); S1 (pS81, DHT for 4 h); S2 and S3 (pS81, DHT for 8 h). The ChIP\u2010Seq data were deposited in the GEO datasets ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE166192\",\"term_id\":\"166192\"}}GSE166192).2.4.3.  Re\u2010ChIP The ReChIP test was carried out as reported previously [31].2.4.4.  3C\u2010ChIP Crosslinking Formaldehyde was added to the cell culture medium for fixation at a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Incubation took place at room temperature for 10\u00a0min under gentle rotation. Glycine solution was added to a final concentration of 0.125\u00a0m to quench the reaction. Incubation was at room temperature for 5\u00a0min on rocker. After washing 2\u00d7 in PBS, ~\u00a05\u00a0mL PBS were added and cells harvested by scratching. The medium was centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 300\u00a0g at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and the supernatant discarded. Cell lysis was then conducted or the cells stored as flash\u2010freeze cell pellets in liquid nitrogen or dry ice/ethanol and at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.Lysis and restriction digest For each sample, 1\u00a0mL of ice\u2010cold cell lysis buffer (10\u00a0mm Tris\u2010HCl pH8.0, 10\u00a0mm NaCl, 0.2% NP40) was combined fresh with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitors. Prepared cell lysis buffer 1\u00a0mL was added to each crosslinked cell pellet. The pellets were mixed in a vertex and the cell suspension incubated on ice for 20\u00a0min. After centrifugation at 2500\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted nuclei were washed once with 1\u00a0mL of ice\u2010cold cell lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 2500\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were gently re\u2010suspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 0.5% SDS and incubated at 62\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u201310\u00a0min. After heating was over, 290\u00a0\u03bcL of water and 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% Triton X\u2010100 (Sigma, 93443) were added to quench the SDS. Thorough mixing was carried out, avoiding excessive foaming. The suspension was incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. Finally, 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 10\u00d7 REB (3C Restriction Enzyme Buffer) and 500\u00a0U of 3C restriction enzyme (PstI, #R0140S; NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) were added and chromatin digested overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with rotation.Proximity ligation and crosslink reversal To inactivate 3C restriction enzyme, incubation at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min and then cooling naturally to room temperature was carried out. A 700\u2010\u03bcL aliquot of the ligation master mix below was added to each sample: 499\u00a0\u03bcL of water, 120\u00a0\u03bcL of 10\u00d7 NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB, B0202), 70\u00a0\u03bcL of 10% Triton X\u2010100, 6\u00a0\u03bcL of 20\u00a0mg\u00b7mL\u22121 bovine serum albumin (NEB, B9000S), 5\u00a0\u03bcL of 400\u00a0U\u00b7\u03bcL\u22121 T4 DNA Ligase (NEB, M0202). Each sample (1.2\u00a0mL) was mixed by inverting, and split into two tubes, each containing 600\u00a0\u03bcL of mixture. Incubation at room temperature was carried out for 4\u00a0h or overnight with slow rotation. Finally, centrifugation at 2500\u00a0g was carried out for 5\u00a0min, and the supernatant removed.CHIP The pellets were re\u2010suspended in ChIP lysis buffer, followed by sonication, and the ChIP protocol was continued.2.5.

Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR analysis was carried out with the TaqMan One\u2010Step RT\u2010PCR Master Mix Reagents (Cat. 4309169; Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan primer\u2010probe sets for KLK3/PSA (FAM labeled, Cat. PN4351370), NKX3\u20101 (FAM labeled, Cat. Hs00171834_m1), ATAD2 (FAM labeled, Cat. Hs00204205_m1) and the internal control GAPDH (VIC\u2010TAMRA labeled, Cat. 4310884E) transcripts were from Applied Biosystems.2.7. FACS analysisHoechst 33342 staining and FACS analysis are described below: LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 5% CDS or 10% FBS for 2\u00a0days as indicated, and LNCaP\u2010Abl cells were grown in phenol red\u2010free RPMI medium containing 10% CDS for 2\u00a0days, followed by treatment without or with 10\u00a0nm of DHT for 24\u00a0h as indicated. Hoechst 33342 (at a final concentration of 4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121; Sigma) was added directly to the medium and the cells were further incubated for 60\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The cells were then trypsinized and subjected to FACS analysis using the Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios (Brea, CA, USA). Cells gated at 2n and 4n were sorted as G0/G1 and G2/M populations, respectively. The sorted cells were then boiled in 2% SDS, normalized and subjected to blotting. PI staining and FACS analysis were carried out as described previously [9].2.8. Cytoplasmic, nuclear and chromatin fractionationThe assay was carried out with the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit (Cat. 78840; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), following the manufacturer's directions. With this kit it is possible to assess cytoplasmic, membrane, soluble nuclear, chromatin\u2010bound and cytoskeletal protein fractions. In this report, we focused on the cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear and chromatin\u2010bound fractions, with the insoluble chromatin\u2010bound fraction being released by micrococcal nuclease (MNase).2.9. Cell culture and transfectionAll cell lines were from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The LNCaP\u2010Abl cell line was maintained in phenol\u2010red\u2010free RPMI\u20101640 medium (Cat. 118035\u2010030; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% CDS. LNCaP were grown in the RPMI\u20101640 containing 10% FBS; C4\u20102 and Cos1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS; and 293T cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS. For androgen\u2010starving conditions, cells were grown in medium containing 5% CDS. Plasmid transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Cat. P/{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"N52887\",\"term_id\":\"1194053\",\"term_text\":\"N52887\"}}N52887; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).2.10. Cell proliferationCells were cultured in 96\u2010well plates for 2\u00a0days and then treated for 3\u00a0days as indicated. The cell counting analysis was performed with the CellTiter\u2010Glo assay kit (Cat. G7571; Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer's manual.2.11. Animal xenograftsSix\u2010 to 8\u2010week\u2010old male ICR/scid mice (IcrTac:ICR\u2010Prkdc<scid>) from Taconic (Taconic Biosciences, Inc., Germantown, NY, USA) were used to generate PCa xenografts. The mice are housed in Allentown HEPA\u2010filtered, individually ventilated cages with ducted HEPA exhaust and automatic watering. Irradiated food and hyperchlorinated, reverse osmosis water are provided to all cages. Rodent racks, cages and bedding are autoclaved in double\u2010door bulk autoclaves prior to use. The mice were injected subcutaneously with 2\u00a0million VCaP/LAPC4 cells in 50% Matrigel. When the number of xenografts reached ~\u00a01000\u00a0mm3, biopsies were obtained and the mice were castrated [32]. Additional biopsies were obtained 4\u00a0days after castration, and the tumors were harvested at relapse. All animal experiments were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines. 3.\u2003Results3.1. Nuclear expression of S81\u2010phosphorylated AR in metastatic PCa rapid biopsy and in PCa xenografts is correlated with AR transactivationIn previous reports, we used an affinity\u2010purified polyclonal phospho\u2010AR\u2010Ser81 (pS81) antibody that was validated by peptide\u2010competition assay in both western blotting and an optimized IHC staining protocol [11, 17]. In the end, we stained pS81 on multiple clinical PCa samples, including benign, primary PCa, CRPC and metastasis, and VCaP xenografts before and after castration [11]. In this report, we similarly stained rapid biopsy samples from a patient who had undergone various anti\u2010androgen treatments. As shown (Fig.\u00a01A), IHC tests in the liver and bone metastases all indicated that pS81 has a specific and intense nuclear distribution pattern, despite diffused staining of total AR in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Overall, these observations substantiated our previous findings of an enrichment of pS81 in the metastatic CRPC nucleus.Open in a separate windowFig. 1Nuclear expression of Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR (pS81) in metastatic PCa rapid biopsy and in PCa xenografts is correlated with AR transactivation. (A) AR and pS81 staining based on rapid autopsied PCa samples collected from indicated metastatic sites of a PCa patient having received anti\u2010androgen treatment. Scale bars: 25\u00a0\u03bcm. (B) AR and pS81 staining of VCaP (upper panels) and LAPC4 (lower panels) xenografts through castration and progression to CRPC. Pre: pre\u2010castration; Cas: castration for 4\u00a0days; CRPC: recurrent CRPC [32]. Scale bars: 25\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) Real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR analysis of KLK2 expression in representative mice bearing VCaP and LAPC4 xenografts, respectively. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Statistical significance was determined by one\u2010way ANOVA; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant: * P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ** P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, *** P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.We next examined total AR and pS81 by IHC in castration\u2010sensitive and castration\u2010resistant VCaP and LAPC4 xenografts. In the pre\u2010castration xenografts, the AR and pS81 antibodies showed staining in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with more preferential accumulation of the pS81\u2010AR in the nucleus (Fig.\u00a01B). In xenografts harvested 4\u00a0days after castration there was a shift towards cytoplasmic distribution for total AR, with fewer cells showing nuclear pS81; those that did show pS81 staining, demonstrated decreased intensity, consistent with the decrease in androgen. In relapsed xenografts (about 6\u00a0weeks after castration), restoration of AR activity was likely driven by mechanisms including increased AR and intratumoral androgen synthesis. Significantly, total AR in these xenografts was highly expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and pS81 was highly expressed and predominantly nuclear (Fig.\u00a01B). These findings are consistent with our previous reports of nuclear pS81 distribution in CPRC xenografts and clinical samples [11].Of importance, in these xenografts there is a consistent alignment of pS81 nuclear expression and AR\u2010activated gene expression profiling, as assessed by monitoring the expression of KLK2 messages in both xenograft models (Fig.\u00a01C). Tests on additional AR signature genes had similar results [32]. These xenografts studies support a functional alignment between nuclear pS81 and AR\u2010mediated transcription in\u00a0vivo.3.2. S81 phosphorylation on chromatin is intrinsically linked to AR\u2010mediated transactivationIn the classical androgen\u2010sensitive PCa LNCaP cells, pS81 expression is induced by androgen in a time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent manner and its induction correlates with AR\u2010mediated gene stimulation, indicating a mechanistic connection between pS81 and AR transactivation [6, 11]. To examine specifically the functions of pS81 on chromatin, we performed ChIP assays to test the hypothesis that the time course for activating distinct AR\u2010mediated genes is in alignment with locus\u2010specific pS81 occupancy. For this purpose, we selected an early androgen\u2010responsive gene (NKX3.1), an intermediate androgen\u2010responsive gene (KLK3/PSA) and a late androgen\u2010responsive gene (ATAD2). The grouping was based on an analysis of time\u2010dependent gene stimulation in LNCaP Affymetrix microarray in conjunction with AR binding based on LNCaP AR ChIP\u2010Seq datasets (Figs S1 and S2). Interestingly, the gene loci of early androgen\u2010responsive gene NKX3\u20101 and intermediate androgen\u2010responsive gene PSA have strong AR binding that is associated with open chromatin as marked by pronounced locus\u2010specific H3K27Ac expression and ATAC\u2010Seq signal. In contrast, the late androgen\u2010responsive gene ATAD2 gene loci has relative weak AR binding, and the AR binding sites are marked by less pronounced H3K27ac binding and ATAC\u2010Seq signal, indicating less chromatin accessibility (Fig.\u00a02A).Open in a separate windowFig. 2pS81 chromatin expression is intrinsically linked to AR\u2010mediated transactivation.

The alignment was based on WASHU Brower. (B) LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were stimulated for indicated time\u2010points with 10\u00a0nm of DHT and then harvested for ChIP analysis of AR and pS81, with IgG as negative control. AR binding sites, as the major peaks in (A), were subjected to ChIP\u2010qPCR analyses. (C) LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were stimulated for indicated time\u2010points with 10\u00a0nm of DHT and then total RNA was harvested for real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR analysis. The ratio (fold) was calculated based on the value of specific gene expression as normalized to the internal control GAPDH, with the un\u2010liganded control set to 1. Data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of three biologically independent replicates. Statistical significance was calculated by one\u2010way ANOVA; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant: * P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ** P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, *** P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.ChIP\u2010qPCR studies using total AR and pS81\u2010specific antibody demonstrated that androgen quickly induced strong pS81 binding at the NKX3\u20101 and PSA AR enhancers, whereas pS81 chromatin distribution was weak at the ATAD2 gene loci and was stimulated at a delayed time course (Fig.\u00a02B). Furthermore, the time course of chromatin pS81 expression was generally in line with induction of specific gene messages (Figs\u00a02C, S1 and S2). These findings support an association between chromatin openness and pS81 binding, and solidify evidence for a mechanistic connection between chromatin\u2010bound pS81 and AR\u2010mediated transactivation.3.3. pS81 expression is highly enriched in the AR\u2010activated gene promoterAs our findings identified a connection between pS81 and AR\u2010mediated gene expression, we next conducted global analysis of phosphorylated AR binding along the genome to define further the mechanistic link. For this purpose, we performed ChIP analyses in LNCaP cells stimulated by androgen, followed by deep\u2010seq on the Illumina platform. As exemplified in Fig.\u00a03A, both AR and pS81 signals were globally centered on the enhancer and promoter regions. Motif analyses demonstrated that classic AR binding motif was the top annotation hit for both AR and pS81 ChIP\u2010Seq datasets (Fig.\u00a03B), validating our analyses. AR is known to bind to distal enhancers, and next we aligned AR and pS81 global binding profiling. Interestingly, pS81 have ~\u00a054% unique sites and ~\u00a046% common sites with total AR (Fig.\u00a03C), indicating that they share a distinct chromatin distribution profiling. Further analyses showed pS81 had higher enrichment at the promoter, whereas total AR was more enriched at the distal enhancer (Fig.\u00a03D).Open in a separate windowFig. 3AR and pS81 ChIP\u2010seq analyses indicated they had both common and distinct binding profiles and pS81 was enriched on AR\u2010activated promoter. LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were stimulated with 10\u00a0nm of DHT for 8\u00a0h and then harvested for ChIP\u2010seq analysis using Illumina platform. (A) Heatmap analyses of global AR and pS81 enrichment at enhancer versus promoter regions along the genome. (B) Global motif enrichment analyses of AR and pS81 ChIP\u2010seq; in both cases AR motif was ranked as the Top\u20101 hit. (C) Venn diagram of AR and pS81 ChIP\u2010seq. (D) Barplot using ChIPseeker to characterize AR and pS81 binding profiles along the genome.We reason that the discrepancy between AR and pS81 binding is due both to the stringency of the analyses and the fact that AR is enriched at distal enhancers, whereas pS81 has preferential enrichment at proximal promoters. Consistently, the two AR ChIP\u2010seq datasets (A1\u2010A2) yielded a much higher Enh/Pro ratio than that of the three pS81 datasets (S1\u2013S3) (Figs\u00a04A and S3). In comparison, pS81 had a more balanced distribution between enhancer and promoter (Fig.\u00a04A\u2013C and Fig.\u00a0S3), an indication that AR is phosphorylated at Ser81 in the vicinity of the Enh\u2010Pro.Open in a separate windowFig. 4In AR\u2010activated genomic loci, Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR is highly expressed in the vicinity of the enhancer and promoter. (A) Global calculation of pS81/AR ratio based on AR ChIP\u2010Seq and pS81 ChIP\u2010Seq datasets generated in this report. IN all, two AR (A1\u2010A2) and three pS81 (S1\u2010S3) ChIP samples were submitted for deep\u2010seq. These independent samples were all based on LNCaP in androgen\u2010depleted medium. DHT (10\u00a0nm) treatment conditions: A1 (AR, DHT for 4\u00a0h); A2 (AR, DHT for 8\u00a0h); S1 (pS81, DHT for 4\u00a0h); S2 and S3 (pS81, DHT for 8\u00a0h). (B) AR and pS81 peak binding plot at the transcriptional starting sites (TSS) indicated a robust enrichment of Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR at the proximal promoter. (C) Global profiling of AR and pS81 on AR\u2010occupied enhancers (upper panels) vs. promoters (lower panels) were analyzed based on H3K27ac ChIP\u2010Seq, AR ChIP\u2010Seq and pS81 ChIP\u2010Seq datasets using deepTools. (D) Track alignment of LNCaP AR ChIP\u2010Seq (A2) and pS81 ChIP\u2010Seq (S2), RNA Pol II ChIP\u2010Seq (\u2212/+ androgen, {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM353617\",\"term_id\":\"353617\"}}GSM353617 and {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM353618\",\"term_id\":\"353618\"}}GSM353618, respectively), FoxA1 ChIP\u2010Seq ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2480813\",\"term_id\":\"2480813\"}}GSM2480813) and HoxB13 ChIP\u2010Seq ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2480817\",\"term_id\":\"2480817\"}}GSM2480817) at the NKX3\u20101, KLK3 and ATAD2 gene loci. The data range for both AR and pS81 signals was set at 0\u201310. The alignment was based on WASHU Browser. (E) BETA study of pS81 ChIP\u2010Seq and AR signature genes in LNCaP ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE118152\",\"term_id\":\"118152\"}}GSE118152).To specify further the AR and pS81 binding profiling, we next showed the tracks of AR, pS81 and RNA Pol II signals at AR\u2010activated gene loci, together with the pioneer factors FoxA1 and HoxB13 (Fig.\u00a04D). At all three gene enhancers there was greater AR occupancy than pS81; in contrast, in the early AR\u2010stimulated gene promoters (NKX3\u20101 and KLK3), there was greater enrichment of pS81 as compared with total AR, whereas in the late AR\u2010stimulated gene promoter (ATAD2), the pS81 and total AR signals were comparable. The overall pS81 and AR signals were higher in the early activated genes than in the late stimulated genes. Additionally, an alignment of pS81 with RNA Pol II also indicated their approximate distribution in the promoter and along the gene body (Fig.\u00a04D). Of significance, binding and expression target analysis (BETA) that combines gene expression changes with genome\u2010wide binding data indicated that the pS81 binding profile was correlated with AR activated but not repressed signatures (Fig.\u00a04E). These findings support an active engagement of Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR with the Enh\u2010Pro looping complex mediating RNA Pol II activation [33].3.4. 3C\u2010ChIP analyses confirmed an enrichment of pS81 at the PSA gene enhancer and promoter looping complexTo address specifically a role of pS81 in AR\u2010activated Enh\u2010Pro loops, we developed a 3C\u2010based ChIP test based on established 3C protocols [34, 35] followed by an adapted ChIP assay (Fig.\u00a05A). The 3C step was based on PstI digestion of the PSA regulatory region \u2013 two PstI sites that are ~\u00a05\u00a0kb apart and in proximity to the enhancer and promoter, respectively (Figs\u00a05B,C and S4). The distal arrangement of these two PstI sites and the directional placement of the PCR primers would effectively discount amplification background. Next, we performed the 3C test in LNCaP cells under DHT treatment (10\u00a0nm for 12\u00a0h) and then applied the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system to assess the 3C digestion and ligation efficiency (Fig.\u00a05D,E). The analyses were based on targeted amplification of the PSA Enh\u2010Pro hybrid, which was assessed with specific primers and a FAM probe together with the reference reaction that was based on the copy number gene RPP30 with a HEX probe. Without considering the variations in the amplification efficiency resulted from different genomic loci and PCR primer/probe sets, two independent ddPCR readouts consistently indicated an efficacy of Enh\u2010Pro fusion at 0.0288% (\u00b1\u00a00.0013), or 3200\u20133750 cells/event, roughly in the range of a typical 3C test, where locus\u2010specific ligation events occur in 1/2000 to 1/20\u00a0000 mammalian cells [34].Open in a separate windowFig. 53C\u2010ChIP analyses demonstrated an enrichment of pS81 at the PSA gene enhancer and promoter looping complex.

(C) Alignment of the PSA gene locus based on AR ChIP\u2010Seq in LNCaP cells ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE14092\",\"term_id\":\"14092\"}}GSE14092). (D,E) Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to assess the PstI digestion, followed ligation efficiency in the 3C test. The targeted PSA Enh\u2010Pro hybrid was assessed with specific primers and a FAM probe with QSY as quencher (D). As shown, in two independent ddPCR reads (20\u00a0\u03bcL reaction each), the following copy numbers were recorded: 4.2 and 3.8 for the PSA Enh\u2010Pro amplicons vs. 14 120 and 13\u00a0640 for that reference RPP30 that does not contain PstI in its amplicon, respectively (E). Two repeated tests: T1 (test 1) and T2 (test 2). (F) PCR round 1 products were used for SYBR Green real\u2010time (RT) qPCR to quantify the 3C\u2010ChIP products based on pS81 and total AR, respectively. Each test includes three biologically independent replicates and results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's t\u2010test was performed to calculate the statistical significance. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant, as marked by *. (G) Nest\u2010PCR identified a single specific 3C band in the input and pS81 ChIP product, with an expected size at 234\u00a0bp. A 100\u2010bp gene ruler was used as DNA marker (Mr, Marker, Thermo Fisher, SM0243). More background information is included in Figs S4 and S5.The above 3C test indicated that we had generated the PSA Enh\u2010Pro looping complex in androgen\u2010stimulated LNCaP cells. To determine whether Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR was preferentially distributed in the loop, the 3C ligation mixtures were then subjected to ChIP analysis using pS81 and AR antibodies, respectively. Due to the low productivities in both 3C and ChIP assays, we next adapted two\u2010round nest\u2010PCR analyses with the first round PCR using the hot\u2010start PCR system, which is robust and and has a high fidelity in amplification (Figs\u00a05B and S4). The PCR (round 1) products were assessed using SYBR Green real\u2010time (RT) qPCR, which showed a massive enrichment of the 3C products with the pS81 antibody over the total AR antibody (Fig.\u00a05F). To verify the specificity of the amplification, we then used a nest\u2010PCR (round 2) to amplify the PCR (round 1) products similarly with the hot\u2010start PCR system. The specificities of all the above PCR reactions were also safeguarded by the uniqueness of the primers and probes used in this report, all of which were verified by blast against the human genome and transcripts (Fig.\u00a0S4). Indeed, the nest\u2010PCR yielded a clean background and produced a single specific 3C band in both the input and the pS81 ChIP samples, which had a theoretical size of 234\u00a0bp (Fig.\u00a05G). The PCR products were then purified and submitted for DNA sequencing, which confirmed that a PSA Enh\u2010Pro fusion occurred exactly at the targeted PstI sites in both the input and the pS81 ChIP samples (Fig.\u00a0S5).3.5. pS81 expression on the chromatin is coupled to AR\u2010dependent transactivation and is co\u2010sustained by CDK1 and CDK9Our previous reports indicated that CDK9 can stimulate S81 phosphorylation of AR in the presence of androgen, whereas pS81 expression was more dependent on CDK1 under androgen ablation [17]. Consistent with our findings, a recent study demonstrated that AR re\u2010activation can be achieved by CDK9\u2010mediated phosphorylation and that PCa can be co\u2010targeted by CDK9 inhibitor and AR antagonist [19]. Indeed, we determined by ChIP\u2010qPCR that the robust occupancy of pS81 (but not total AR) at the KLK3 promoter was correlated with the recruitment of pTEFb (CDK9/Cyclin) complex and transcriptional active RNA Pol II, as marked by pS2 and pS5 (Fig.\u00a06A). Notably, the chromatin expression of pS81 was similar between PSA enhancer and promoter, further evidence of its distribution in the Enh\u2010Pro looping complex.Open in a separate windowFig. 6pS81 expression on the chromatin was coupled to AR\u2010dependent transactivation and co\u2010sustained by CDK1 and CDK9. (A) ChIP\u2010qPCR analyses of LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium that were treated with DHT (10\u00a0nm, 24\u00a0h).

(B) Re\u2010ChIP analysis of LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium treated with 10\u00a0nm DHT for 24\u00a0h. The antibodies used for the first and second round of ChIP analysis are indicated; binding of specific factors to PSA enhancer and PSA\u2010promoter loci was monitored. (C) LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were pretreated for 2\u00a0h with CDK1 and CDK9 inhibitors, and 10\u00a0nm of DHT was then added for 15\u00a0min, followed by cellular fractionation. The insoluble chromatin\u2010bound fraction (Ch) was released using MNase. CDK1 inhibitor (RO: RO\u20103306, 10\u00a0\u00b5m) and CDK9 inhibitor II (iII, 50\u00a0\u03bcm). Beta\u2010tubulin, FoxA1 and Histone H3 were used as markers for cytoplasmic, nuclear and chromatin\u2010bound proteins, respectively. Phospho\u2010H3\u2010Ser10 (pH3S10) was used as a marker for CDK1 activity that peaks in mitosis. pS81 and AR signals of the DHT pulsed samples were quantified using imagej (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and the normalized pS81/AR ratio is shown. (D) A model was proposed to outline pS81 activities that were co\u2010sustained by CDK1 acting under basal conditions and in soluble environments and by CDK9 working under androgen stimulation and chromatin\u2010dependence. The amplification of CDK1 in CRPC makes it a potential therapeutic target. Each test includes three biologically independent replicates and results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Statistical significance was determined by two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's t\u2010test; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant: * P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ** P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, *** P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.Next, to specify pS81 functions on the chromatin we assessed its engagement with the CDK9 complex. For this purpose, we performed re\u2010ChIP analysis, which is based on two rounds of ChIP assays that are sandwiched with an intermediate step to release the precipitation upon the completion of the first round ChIP test. As shown in Figs\u00a06B and S6, re\u2010ChIP assays at the PSA Enh demonstrated that total AR had a higher enrichment than pS81 for the pTEFb/BRD4 complex, which is consistent with a higher total AR signal in the first round of ChIP assay on the enhancer (Figs\u00a04B and \u200band6A).6A). Importantly, re\u2010ChIP assay at the PSA\u2010Pro demonstrated that enrichment of pS81 was higher than that of total AR for the pTEFb/BRD4 complex. These findings strongly support that pS81 is looped at AR\u2010activated Enh\u2010Pro loci, where it is complexed with the elongation complex (pTEFb/BRD4 and RNA Pol\u20102).As a complementary approach to verify the above findings further, we next carried out biochemical tests to similarly assess pS81 expression in distinct cellular compartments. For this purpose, we isolated soluble proteins from the cytoplasm and from the nucleus. The insoluble fraction was then subjected to MNase digestion to release the chromatin\u2010bound proteins. As shown in Fig.\u00a06C, DHT quickly induced nuclear and chromatin localization of AR and pS81, with the nuclear and chromatin\u2010bound AR having a higher proportion of pS81 than cytoplasmic AR did. Significantly, both CDK1 and CDK9 inhibitors attenuated pS81 expression in all cellular chambers, with CDK1 inhibitor more effectively repressing pS81 in the soluble fractions and CDK9 inhibitor more severely reducing pS81 on the chromatin.Together, we outlined these findings on pS81 in a graphic model (Fig.\u00a06D). Under basal conditions CDK1 stimulates pS81 in the soluble cell compartments, independent of chromatin association. While under androgen\u2010stimulated conditions, CDK9 stimulates pS81 on the chromatin, and results in transcriptional activation. The pS81 repressive effects of both CDK1 and CDK9 inhibitors in all cellular chambers imply that AR undergoes dynamic re\u2010distribution and constant equilibration within the cellular spaces of cytoplasm, nucleus and chromatin.3.6. CDK1 activity is required to activate AR\u2010dependent transcription before and after androgen stimulationAs we have reported previously, CDK1 and CDK9 phosphorylate AR at Ser81 by distinct mechanisms [6, 17]. Indeed, in AR transfected into 293T and COS1 cells grown in androgen\u2010depleted medium, nocodazole activated CDK1 (as marked by pCDK1\u2010T161) and led to pS81 expression in the absence of androgen (Fig.\u00a0S6). Importantly, androgen\u2010stimulated pS81 can be further increased by co\u2010treatment with nocodazole. Similar observations were made in LNCaP cells co\u2010treated with nocodazole and various doses of androgen, and these findings were time\u2010dependent (Fig.\u00a0S7). These observations support the co\u2010stimulation of pS81 by CDK1 and androgen, which acts through AR\u2010mediated recruitment of CDK9 to synthesize pS81 on the chromatin.To validate the above findings functionally, we subjected LNCaP cells to androgen stimulation, together with pre\u2010 or post\u2010treatment with both CDK1 and CDK9 inhibitory compounds. As shown in Fig.\u00a07A, pretreatment for 2\u00a0h with the CDK1 and CDK9 antagonists markedly repressed androgen\u2010stimulated pS81 expression. Of importance, upon a 2\u2010h DHT stimulation, post\u2010treatment with the CDK1 and CDK9 antagonists also substantially reduced androgen\u2010induced pS81 expression, although to a lesser extent than pretreatment did (Fig.\u00a07A). These observations are consistent with the notion that both CDK1 and CDK9 are constantly catalyzing pS81 synthesis and are required for AR\u2010mediated transactivation. In addition, both pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment with CDK1 compound attenuated androgen stimulation of PSA, NKX3.1 and ATAD2 gene expression, with more severely repressive impact occurring on the late androgen\u2010responsive ATAD2 gene (Fig.\u00a07B). Together, our findings are in line with the previous model [17] and with the above findings that pS81 functions to prime AR\u2010specific chromatin loci: the early androgen\u2010responsive gene loci can be initiated with the basal pS81 in the cells, whereas the elicitation of the late androgen\u2010responsive gene loci may require additional pS81 expression that takes time to accumulate within the cells. Mechanistically, both CDK1 and CDK9 are linked to AR transactivation via pS81 undergoing constant cellular re\u2010distribution.Open in a separate windowFig. 7CDK1 activity is required to activate AR\u2010dependent transcription before and after androgen stimulation. (A) LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were treated with CDK1 and CDK9 inhibitors 2\u00a0h before (pretreatment) or after (post\u2010treatment) adding 10\u00a0nm DHT for 4\u00a0h. Total proteins were normalized for blotting. pS81 and AR signals were quantified using imagej and the normalized pS81/AR ratio is shown. (B) LNCaP cells in androgen\u2010depleted medium were treated with CDK1 inhibitor before or after adding 10\u00a0nm DHT for indicated treating times. Total RNA was subjected to RT\u2010PCR analysis. Each test includes three biologically independent replicates and results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's t\u2010test was performed to calculate the statistical significance. For the left panels, DHT (8\u00a0h) only was used as control. For the right panels, different time\u2010points of DHT only were used as controls for DHT effects or compound effects. P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant: * (or #) P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ** (or ##) P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, *** (or ###) P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.3.7. CDK1 activity is maintained throughout the cell cycle in CRPC to sustain basal AR activationWe showed previously that CDK1 could increase pS81 to promote AR activity under androgen depletion [6, 9, 17]. The repressive effects on AR and cell proliferation by CDK compounds indicated that CRPC cells have CDK1 activity spread throughout the cell cycle, rather than just in a short interval during mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we grew LNCaP and CRPC Abl cells in steroid\u2010depleted (CDS) vs. androgen\u2010containing (FBS) media and then used fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cells in G0/G1 and G2/M\u2010phases, respectively (Fig.\u00a08A). We first observed that the G0/G1 Abl cells in CDS medium had substantial pS81, confirming that pS81 was not only present in cells during M\u2010phase (Fig.\u00a08B). Using pT161 as an indicator of CDK1 activity, we then found CDK1 was activated in the G0/G1 Abl cells in CDS medium, which was correlated with increased cyclin A. Androgen could increase CDK1 activity in the G0/G1 Abl and LNCaP cells, in agreement with AR driving cell cycle progression, whereas\u00a0the activity of CDK1 was similar and high in the G2/M LNCaP and Abl cells under both conditions (Fig.\u00a08B). These results are consistent with CDK1 mediating the basal AR pS81 throughout the cell cycle in the Abl cells, and with the observations of rapid loss of pS81 in response to CDK1 inhibition [17].Open in a separate windowFig. 8CDK1 activity is maintained throughout the cell cycle in CRPC to sustain basal AR activation. (A) Cell sorting diagrams of the LNCaP and Abl (cell culture developed CRPC cell line based on LNCaP) cell lines. LNCaP and Abl cells in indicated growth conditions were subjected to Hoechst staining and cell sorting. Red and black arrows indicate the gated G0/G1 (R2) and G2/M (R3) populations, respectively. (B) The above gated G0/G1 and G2/M populations were harvested and total proteins were normalized for blotting. pS81 and AR signals were quantified using imagej and the normalized pS81/AR ratio is shown. (C) Box\u2010plotting analysis for the relative expression of a 29\u2010gene signature (see Fig.\u00a0S9) functionally enriched in DNA synthesis and cell cycle in the CRPC cell lines and clinical samples. The analyses (metastatic vs. primary PCa; Abl vs. LNCaP in androgen\u2010deprived condition) were based on global AR binding and Affymetrix microarray profiling [20, 21, 22, 23]. (D) LNCaP and its xenograft\u2010derived CRPC cell line (C4\u20102) were grown in androgen\u2010deprived medium and subjected to PI staining and FACS analysis of cell cycle distribution. The distribution of indicated cell cycle phases was compared between LNCaP and C4\u20102. (E) CRPC LNCaP\u2010Abl and C4\u20102 cell lines were treated for 3\u00a0days with RO\u20103306 (10\u00a0\u03bcm) and R1881 (10\u00a0nm) as indicated, followed by cell proliferation assay. Each test includes three biologically independent replicates and results are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Two\u2010tailed unpaired Student's t\u2010test was performed to calculate the statistical significance; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant: * P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ** P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, *** P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.As previously reported, global gene expression assessments showed that cell cycle genes are markedly increased in metastatic CRPC vs. primary androgen\u2010dependent PCa (Figs\u00a08C, S8 and S9) [20]. The CRPC cell lines Abl and C4\u20102 both expressed high levels of basal pS81 that are dependent on elevated CDK1 activity, consistent with increased G2\u2010M\u2010phase distribution in the cell cycle (Figs\u00a08C,D, S8 and S9) [17]. These findings support an increase in CDK1 activity in CRPC and a strategy to inactivate AR under basal conditions by targeting CDK1.We next asked whether CDK1 inhibition could restore androgen dependence to CRPC cells. For this purpose, Abl cells in CDS medium were stimulated with androgen (R1881, 10\u00a0nm) in the absence or presence of RO\u20103306. In the vehicle \u2010treated cells, R1881 did not stimulate cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a08E), consistent with the known androgen\u2010refractory property of Abl [23]. In contrast, R1881 stimulated the proliferation of cells treated with RO\u20103306. Treatment of the C4\u20102 cells with RO\u20103306 similarly rendered the cells responsive to R1881 stimulation (Fig.\u00a08E). Together these results show that CDK1\u2010mediated pS81 can drive basal AR activity in CRPC cells and CDK1 activation is a mechanism to castration resistance. 4.\u2003DiscussionThe profound effects of androgen on PCa biology and the robust spectrum of AR signature pathways attest to the importance of addressing AR re\u2010activation in CRPC. Consistent with its extraordinary structural features, Ser81 is phosphorylated time\u2010dependently and dose\u2010dependently by AR agonists but not antagonists [6, 11]. Previous studies have also shown an association of pS81 with AR nuclear localization and chromatin binding, and with AR\u2010p300 interaction [6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17]. Using ChIP assay to track pS81 signatures on the chromatin, here we confirmed that pS81 occupancy to AR\u2010mediated loci is intrinsically linked to androgen stimulating different subsets of AR\u2010responsive genes. We further conducted pS81\u2010specific vs. AR\u2010specific ChIP\u2010Seq analyses to disclose an unusual enrichment of pS81 at AR\u2010activated promoters, along with pTEFb and activated RNA pol II that occupy the Enh\u2010Pro loop for transactivation. Significantly, using a 3C\u2010based ChIP assay, we verified that Ser81\u2010phosphorylated AR was indeed enriched in the PSA Enh\u2010Pro looping complex. These observations together with the ReChIP findings on pS81 as a partner of BRD4/pTEFb in the Enh\u2010Pro vicinity are all in accordance with the coupling of pS81 (but not total AR) to the general transactivation machinery.It is a seminal observation that Ser81\u2010phosphorylated and \u2010unphosphorylated AR have differential binding profiles. The underlying mechanisms could be attributed to phosphorylation\u2010mediated conformation change and/or formation distinct complexes; an alternative explanation is that only a small fraction of total AR is looped at the Enh\u2010Pro loci, where it is phosphorylated by pTEFb/CDK9 in proximity to the promoter. Similar to the androgen\u2010dependent and chromatin\u2010bound pS81 transactivation mediated by CDK9, under basal condition we identified the dependence of pS81 expression on CDK1 that is hyperactivated in CRPC cells. An enrichment of pS81 nuclear distribution is consistent with reports that S81\u2010phosphorylated AR is preferentially distributed to the nucleus in PCa [9, 11, 15]. Mechanistically, the nuclear\u2010enriched pS81 can prime the target gene locus and confer hypersensitivity of AR to various ligands, thus contributing to castration resistance. Indeed, we have reported that in CRPC cells the basal pS81 was predominantly mediated by CDK1 and was not blocked by the AR antagonists [17]. In this report, we further determined that CDK1 functions in the soluble cell compartments to maintain the basal pS81 and AR transactivation, supporting the CDK1\u2010dependence of AR transcription under androgen\u2010depleted status. Consistently, in CRPC cells, AR transactivation is effectively attenuated by a CDK1 inhibitor that can restore androgen responsiveness, providing a rationale to target CDK1. 5.\u2003ConclusionCollectively, our report could guide future studies on the potential mechanisms and functions of pS81 chromatin binding and on additional AR phosphorylation sites or other post\u2010translational modifications that may also have distinct binding profiles and functional significance. Here our observations delineated the circumstances in which CDK1 and CDK9 activate AR: both S81 kinases contribute the S81 phosphorylation of AR that is dynamically distributed to various soluble compartments and the chromatin. Significantly, our findings uncovered extraordinary pS81 chromatin occupancy profiling: its looping in the AR\u2010activated Enh\u2010Pro loci and its coupling to the general transcription machinery. These findings together rationalize the strategy to target these pS81 kinases, alone or in conjunction with direct AR antagonists in CRPC patients.
