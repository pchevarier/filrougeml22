MethodsPatients and data collectionWe conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients at eight referral hospitals (four in Northern Taiwan, two in Central Taiwan, and two in Southern Taiwan). All patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of these hospitals during the epidemic wave were screened between October 1, 2015, and March 31, 2016. Influenza pneumonia was diagnosed in patients with or without mechanical ventilation by collecting their nasal and oral swabs or sputum samples and testing these samples by using the rapid test or polymerase chain reaction. Patients were diagnosed as having ARDS if they met the following Berlin definition criteria1: acute onset of respiratory failure within 1 week, bilateral lung opacities, no evidence of cardiac failure-related hydrostatic edema on echocardiography, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of <300\u00a0mmHg with a PEEP of \u22655 cm H2O. All patients with influenza pneumonia-related moderate to severe ARDS who were treated with prone positioning or ECMO were included in this study. Patients were followed up until discharge from the hospital, death, or up to 60 days after the onset of ARDS. The local institutional review board for human research approved this study (CGMH IRB No. 201600632B0), and the need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.We collected patient data from medical records and the standard care report form. Baseline characteristics and treatment-related data regarding ARDS development and ICU evolution collected daily during ICU admission were obtained. The following data were recorded and compared between the prone positioning and ECMO groups: age, gender, body mass index, comorbidity, influenza type, pneumonia severity index (PSI),21 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score,22 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score,23 laboratory data, other interventions, mechanical ventilator settings, and lung mechanics and duration from ARDS diagnosis to prone positioning or ECMO. The indeterminate influenza type included patients who diagnosed as influenza by rapid antigen test. The chronic liver disease included patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic abnormal liver function in the previous medical record. In terms of outcomes, we compared 30-day mortality, 60-day mortality, and hospital mortality rates; lengths of ICU and hospital stay; and ventilation-free days between the prone positioning and ECMO groups.Ventilator settingsAll patients included in this study were administered the pressure-control mode of mechanical ventilation. Ventilator settings were adjusted according to the lung protective strategy provided by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Research Network.3 PEEP was set according to a lower PEEP/FiO2 combination table.3 Dynamic driving pressure is calculated as the difference between peak inspiratory pressure and PEEP, and compliance is calculated as tidal volume divided by dynamic driving pressure.Prone positioningProne positioning was initiated on the basis of the decisions of critical care doctors and if a patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio was <150\u00a0mmHg. According to the PROSEVA study,6 prone positioning was performed for at least 16\u00a0h in a day. Hemodynamic instability is the main contraindication for prone positioning.ECMOThe initiation of ECMO was decided by critical care doctors and cardiovascular surgeons, and ECMO was administered by cardiovascular surgeons. Venovenous ECMO was used for patients with no improvement of refractory hypoxemia despite optimal ventilator settings or severe hypercapnia. The venoarterial ECMO was used for patients with no improvement of refractory hypoxemia despite optimal ventilator settings combined with severe shock status despite high dose inotropic agent treatment usage.Statistical analysisNominal variables are presented as numbers (percentages), and continuous variables are presented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare nominal variables, and Student's t test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to comparing continuous variables depending on the underlying distribution. The Kaplan\u2013Meier curve with log-rank statistic was used to compare survival between the prone positioning and ECMO groups. In addition, we used the propensity score to match the prone positioning and ECMO groups by using the PSI, SOFA score and P/F ratio as predictors and a cutoff of 0.10 for match tolerance. We used the univariate and multivariate Cox regression to analyze the predictive factors of survival, and the variables with p value less than 0.10 in univariate analysis were included for multivariate analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), for statistical analyses and database management. ResultsIn total, 336 patients with virology-proven severe influenza pneumonia were admitted to the ICU during the study period (Fig.\u00a01\n). Of these 336 patients, 263 were diagnosed as having severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS. On the basis of the Berlin definition, 28 (10.6%), 79 (30.1%), and 156 (59.3%) patients were classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively. The 30-day mortality rates in patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS was 7.1% (2/28), 19.0% (15/79), and 28.2% (44/156), respectively. Of 263 patients with ARDS, 65 (24.7%) and 53 (20.2%) who received prone positioning and ECMO, respectively, were included in the further analysis. Of 65 patients who received prone positioning, 8 were shifted to ECMO because the initial prone positioning failed, resulting in the deterioration of patients\u2019 hypoxemia. These eight patients were excluded in both groups for analysis. In total, 40 patients (including 6 with prone positioning failure) received venovenous ECMO and 13 patients (including 2 patients with prone positioning failure) received venoarterial ECMO.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Flow chart of the study; ARDS: acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ICU: intensive care unit.The characteristics of included patients at admission were similar between the prone positioning group and ECMO group, except for the total bilirubin level (0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0mg/dL in the prone positioning group and 1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0mg/dL in the ECMO group, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; Table 1\n).

DiscussionThe results of this multicenter retrospective cohort study revealed that patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS who received prone positioning had lower mortality rates than did those receiving ECMO at day 60 (28% vs. 60%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and usage or prone positioning or ECMO was an independent predictor for 60-day mortality. Since further randomized controlled trial is needed to elucidate the causality between prone positioning and better clinical outcomes, prone positioning can be considered an adjunct therapy for refractory hypoxemia before administering ECMO in patients with influenza pneumonia complicated by moderate to severe ARDS.Pneumonia, the most common ARDS risk factor, is associated with a high mortality.24 Influenza (H1N1)-related ARDS can rapidly progress, resulting in life-threatening hypoxemia. The clinical course of influenza (H1N1)-related ARDS appears to be substantially different from that of non\u2013influenza-related ARDS, involving a prolonged recovery of pulmonary gas exchange, a frequent demand for ECMO, and a prolonged ICU stay. In the LUNG SAFE study, the overall 28-day mortality rate of patients with ARDS was 34.8% (29.6%, 35.2%, and 40.9% with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) without focusing on any specific risk factor.2 However, in this study, the 30-day mortality rate of patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS was relatively low (23.2%)\u2014with it being 7.1%,19.0%, and 28.2% in patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively. Compared with no treatment, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with H1N1 influenza admitted to hospitals (adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.70\u20130.93; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0024).25 In this study, the relatively low mortality rate in patients with severe influenza pneumonia with ARDS might partially be attributed to early recognition of ARDS and the administration of empiric neuraminidase inhibitor treatment to most patients, particularly during the epidemic. Considering easy progression to severe ARDS but with a relatively low mortality rate in some patients with severe influenza pneumonia, we must select an adequate adjunct therapy, such as prone positioning or ECMO, earlier, if required.Current guidelines suggest both prone positioning and ECMO as rescue therapies for refractory hypoxia in patients with severe ARDS.26\n,\n27 However, the guidelines suggest the use of these therapies in different conditions; for example, prone positioning and ECMO may be used when the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is\u00a0<\u00a0150\u00a0mmHg and <80\u00a0mmHg, respectively.26 In the PROSEVA study,6 the 28- and 90-day mortality rates of patients who received prone positioning were 16.0% and 23.6%, respectively; these values were lower than real-world data observed in our study (30- and 60-day mortality rates were 26% and 31%, respectively, in our study). However, we focused on patients with severe influenza pneumonia, and the mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio of patients in our study was lower than that of patients in the PROSEVA study (95.9 vs. 100\u00a0mmHg). Moreover, the mortality rate reported in Cochrane meta-analysis data28 was higher than that observed in our study both in the short term (33.4%) and long term (41.7%). By contrast, the mortality rate of the ECMO group in our study was higher (30- and 60-day mortality rates were 36% and 60%, respectively) than that reported in the EOLIA study (60-day mortality rate was 35%)16 or other studies including patients with influenza.29\n,\n30 These differences are potentially attributable to different viral characteristics, early ECMO usage (mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio\u00a0=\u00a0101.3\u00a0mmHg), or the nonuse of an efficient ultra-protective ventilator strategy with a low tidal volume according to the current suggestion.14 To the best of our knowledge, no study has compared the outcomes of patients with severe ARDS receiving prone positioning and those receiving ECMO, especially those with severe influenza-related ARDS. According to the results of the present study, prone positioning should be considered before ECMO as a rescue therapy in patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS. Additional prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to compare the efficacy between prone positioning and ECMO in patients with severe ARDS.The current guidelines31 recommend ECMO only after other strategies such as prone positioning, neuromuscular blockers, or high PEEP cannot reverse refractory hypoxemia. However, a trial of prone positioning may delay the initiation of ECMO. A study reported that patients with influenza who received late cannulation (after >7 days) had significantly high mortality.32 A previous study compared patients who received ECMO with or without a prone positioning trial before the ECMO was initiated.33 The 30-day mortality in patients who received prone positioning before ECMO was not significantly higher than that in patients who did not receive prone positioning (21% vs. 41%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.098). In our study, eight patients received prone positioning before ECMO, and the mortality rate of these patients who received prone positioning before ECMO did not have a significantly higher 60-day mortality rate than did those who did not receive prone positioning before ECMO (50% vs. 60%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.597). Therefore, a trial of prone positioning before ECMO implementation is a suitable consideration in clinical practice.In the real-world, however, prone positioning may be underused in clinical practice for ARDS management. In this study that the choice of prone positioning or ECMO was mainly by the duty doctors\u2019 decision, or the equipment or experience in the unit or hospital, 24.7% (65/263) of patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS received prone positioning. However, in the LUNG SAFE study, only 16.3% (95% CI, 13.7%\u201319.2%) of patients with severe ARDS had received prone positioning.2 The infrequent use of prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS reflects the under recognition of indications, appearance of contraindications, the unavailability of experienced staff, and the absence of strong evidence supporting this intervention. Furthermore, before initiating ECMO, only 31% of patients with severe ARDS received a trial of prone positioning, which is a simple and cost-effective technique that demonstrated a survival benefit.34 During an epidemic, handling a suddenly increasing number of patients with severe ARDS requiring ECMO is considerably challenging for the health care system. Because of the effectiveness of prone positioning and limited facility for administering ECMO, patients with severe influenza pneumonia-related ARDS should receive a trial of prone positioning before ECMO.This study has some limitations that should be addressed. First, because it was a retrospective study, standardizing the protocols of prone positioning and ECMO in different hospitals was difficult. Bias existed regarding the choice of adjunct therapy and the time to initiate it because both these factors depended on the available facility, staff experience, and physician's decision. Nevertheless, this multicenter study is valuable because it included a large sample size from different regions in Taiwan. Second, only patients who developed severe ARDS due to influenza were included in this study. Thus, this might limit the applicability of results to patients with severe ARDS caused by other risk factors. Whether these rescue therapies can result in the same outcomes in patients with various causes of ARDS should be examined in the future. Third, we did not analyze ECMO or ventilator settings after starting ECMO support, and this might have affected the mortality of patients who received ECMO. Additional studies are required to analyze optimal ECMO or ventilator settings in these patients. ConclusionsWhile the patients receiving prone positioning had better outcome, the causality between prone positioning and the prognosis is unknown. However, the current data suggested that patients with influenza-related ARDS may receive prone positioning before ECMO support.
