PIC formation entails multiple protein-DNA contacts between GTFs (i.e., TATA binding protein [TBP]-TFIID) and conserved sequence elements of promoters (Louder et\u00a0al., 2016). The loaded polymerase is activated by TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation allowing it to engage the DNA template and to transcribe a short RNA stretch followed by a transient pause 30\u201380\u00a0bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (Jonkers and Lis, 2015). Subsequent transition of the engaged Pol II complex into a productive elongation complex requires 5\u2032-capping of the RNA, which serves as an important checkpoint of the process.In addition to reflect the time needed to assemble an elongation competent complex, pausing of Pol II allows post-initiation regulation of gene expression (Jonkers and Lis, 2015). It is, however, unclear how frequently pausing occurs and what weight it has in regulating genic output (Brannan et\u00a0al., 2012, Ehrensberger et\u00a0al., 2013, Henriques et\u00a0al., 2013, Jonkers and Lis, 2015, Wagschal et\u00a0al., 2012).Direct probing of polymerase activity revealed imperfect correlation between the amount of Pol II loaded at promoters and the measured activity of the elongating polymerase (Core et\u00a0al., 2012). This imbalance is particularly marked at some inducible genes including those that are activated upon heat shock in Drosophila melanogaster. These harbor high Pol II levels downstream of their TSS, yet display very low elongation activity (Jonkers and Lis, 2015). These genes are rapidly induced upon heat shock and show further strong activation if transcriptional elongation is enforced (Lis et\u00a0al., 2000). Consequently, they serve as canonical examples for regulating genic output by controlling elongation, which in this particular case enables rapid induction during stress response (Guertin et\u00a0al., 2010). This concept has been extrapolated to also function in control of gene induction during developmental and stimulus-responsive pathways (Gaertner and Zeitlinger, 2014, Henriques et\u00a0al., 2013, Jonkers and Lis, 2015, Levine, 2011).Current concept of transcriptional pausing favors a model where engaged Pol II is stabilized post-initiation, leading to the accumulation of transcriptionally competent polymerases downstream of the TSS. In support of this model, residence time of Pol\u00a0II has recently been reported to be in the range of minutes at some genes (Buckley et\u00a0al., 2014, Henriques et\u00a0al., 2013, Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017). This paused state was proposed to\u00a0be mediated through reinforced activity of negative elongation\u00a0factor (NELF) and DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) possibly through the action of sequence-specific transcription factors (Jonkers and Lis, 2015). Alternatively, premature transcription termination and removal of Pol II could regulate transcriptional output post-initiation (Ehrensberger et\u00a0al., 2013). Such termination would entail the combined action of exonucleases allowing decapping and degradation of the RNA protruding from the engaged polymerase (Brannan et\u00a0al., 2012, Wagschal et\u00a0al., 2012).Our incomplete understanding of how early transcription events are regulated partly reflects the limited resolution of current approaches to probe binding and activity at promoters. Probing of Pol II and GTF binding has recently reached nucleotide resolution enabling to precisely locate binding of the transcription machinery in\u00a0vivo (Pugh and Venters, 2016, Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017). Importantly, the above are bulk measurements that compile signals from many molecules. Due to this averaging, these are intrinsically unable to uncover the heterogeneity in protein-DNA interactions expected to result from complex binding events such as PIC formation and Pol II initiation (Louder et\u00a0al., 2016).To overcome these limitations, we establish a detection method that allows single-molecule footprinting of protein-DNA interactions genome-wide at high resolution. It simultaneously quantifies the occupancy of nucleosomes, the PIC, and Pol II at and downstream of the TSS. This permits to follow the\u00a0changes in protein-DNA contacts associated with transcriptional activity. It identifies the effect of core promoter elements such as the TATA box on the dynamics of PIC formation. Furthermore, measuring changes in occupancy of polymerases upon chemically inhibiting initiation reveals that Pol II half-life at\u00a0paused genes including the well-characterized Hsp70 promoter is equivalent to the one observed at normally elongating genes. ResultsPrinciples of Dual-Enzyme Single-Molecule FootprintingDetection and quantification of the multiple binding events that co-occur at promoters requires the ability to measure protein-DNA contacts at the level of single molecules. Using recombinant methyltranferases for footprinting combined with detection of their activity by bisulfite sequencing can probe nucleosome occupancy in intact nuclei at the resolution of single molecules (Kelly et\u00a0al., 2012, Nabilsi et\u00a0al., 2014). We thought to improve methyltransferase footprinting (Bell et\u00a0al., 2010, Kelly et\u00a0al., 2012, Nabilsi et\u00a0al., 2014) in order to detect transcription initiation intermediates at the scale of the genome. To do so, we combine two recombinant methyl-transferases that target cytosines in different dinucleotide contexts (M.SssI targets CGs while M.CviPI methylates GCs) (Figure\u00a01A). Both enzymes, when used separately or in combination, give remarkably similar footprinting profiles (R\u00a0= \u223c0.8, Figures S1A\u2013S1C) arguing that the resulting signal reflects genuine DNA accessibility rather than individual biases of each enzyme. Importantly, their additive sequence specificity increases the median resolution to 7\u00a0bp (13 or 10\u00a0bp for M.SssI or M.CviPI alone), which is below the size of footprints created by transcription initiation factors. Bisulfite sequencing measures methylation at single cytosine resolution. Therefore, it can provide continuous information on neighboring cytosines as long as they reside within the same sequenced molecule (Figure\u00a01A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01High-Resolution Genomic Footprinting Detects Non-nucleosomal Binding Events(A) Overview of dual-enzyme single-molecule footprinting (dSMF). Nuclei are isolated and incubated with recombinant cytosine methyl-transferases that target GpC (M.CviPI) and CpG (M.SssI). DNA bound by proteins is protected from methyltransferase activity (GpC, purple lollipops; CpG, blue lollipops), which results in distinct footprints of methylation (unmethylated, white lollipops). Combined treatment with both enzymes increases footprint resolution (\u223c7\u00a0bp). Resulting methylation is detected by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing at single-molecule and base-pair resolution. Sequencing is done with long reads (300\u00a0bp) to cover regions of interest within the same molecule.(B) dSMF footprinting pattern of a 30-kb chromosomal region illustrating increased accessibility at regulatory regions. Shown is the inverse frequency of methylation (1-methylation (%)) (black line). Read counts for additional datasets are shown as smoothed signal (colored lines, datasets as indicated).

Shown is the footprinting frequency (1-methylation [%]) of individual cytosines (black dots). The average MNase signal for the same regions is overlaid (light-blue line indicating MNase 5\u2032 cut site). Note the footprint downstream of the TSSs of active genes that is not accounted for by nucleosomes.(F and G) The non-nucleosomal footprint downstream of TSSs aligns with the site of Pol II accumulation. Shown are the averaged accessibility signal (black line), average Pol II occupancy (ChIP-seq, purple), and activity (PRO-seq, brown) for (F) active genes and (G) inactive genes as defined in (D) and (E).We applied dual-enzyme single-molecule footprinting (dSMF) in Drosophila cells as an established model for studying early initiation events (Kwak et\u00a0al., 2013, Lim et\u00a0al., 2004, Nechaev et\u00a0al., 2010). Components of the core transcription machinery are closely conserved from flies to mammals, and the absence of endogenous methylation in Drosophila prevents signal interference with footprinting. We generated high-coverage footprinting methylomes (\u223c40\u00d7 median) in duplicate for two cell lines of divergent cellular origin with different transcriptional programs (Arnold et\u00a0al., 2013) (Schneider-S2 and Ovarian Stem Cell [OSC]). Importantly, we optimized library preparation protocols to generate continuous footprinting information over long DNA stretches (\u223c300\u00a0bp).An initial inspection of the resulting chromosomal profiles revealed that a large fraction of the genome is only weakly accessible to methyltransferase activity as expected for chromatinized DNA (Figure\u00a0S1G). The distribution of footprints reveals a periodic structure highly reminiscent of nucleosomal phasing (Figures 1B and S1I). Similarly, we observe higher accessibility at linker regions, mirroring the activity of MNase (Figures 1B and S1I). In addition a subset of chromosomal regions show increased accessibility in a reproducible fashion (R > 0.89, Figures S1D, S1E, and S1I). A fraction of these regions show discrete differences between cell types (Figure\u00a0S1F). In agreement with previous observations, these represent active regulatory regions that are free of nucleosomes (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1I) (Kelly et\u00a0al., 2012, Nabilsi et\u00a0al., 2014).dSMF Detects Binding of Non-histone ProteinsWhile methylation footprinting is well documented to probe nucleosome organization (Kelly et\u00a0al., 2012, Nabilsi et\u00a0al., 2014), detection of binding by non-nucleosomal proteins such as transcription factors has also been shown to be possible in principle (Gal-Yam et\u00a0al., 2006, Kelly et\u00a0al., 2012, Levo et\u00a0al., 2017). Consequently, we explored our dSMF profiles for such non-nucleosomal footprints. At promoters of highly expressed genes, we noticed the presence of a short (\u223c50\u00a0bp) footprint downstream of the TSSs and directly upstream of the highly phased\u00a0+1 nucleosome (Figures 1C and 1D). This footprint is absent from inactive genes (Figure\u00a01E). Comparison with MNase data indicates that this additional density does not reflect the presence of nucleosomes (Figure\u00a01D). Instead, it nicely aligns with Pol II occupancy data suggesting that this footprint is caused by transcriptionally engaged RNA Pol II (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1H). Additionally, we noticed at a subset of promoters an additional density shortly upstream of the TSS at the same position where the PIC is reported to bind in\u00a0vitro (\u221235:-22) (Figure\u00a02A, upper panel). Together this suggests that high-resolution dSMF captures non-nucleosomal binding events at sites contacted by GTFs and Pol II.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Pattern Decomposition into Discrete States of Transcriptional Initiation(A) Single-molecule decomposition of footprinting signals over a single active promoter. Upper panel: graphic representation of promoter elements of the CG45186 gene. Middle panel: shown is the average footprint for single cytosines (black dots connected by a line, red line, TSS). Lower panel: stack of individual molecule reads illustrating the discrete distribution of accessible (methylated Cs, light gray) and protected regions (unmethylated Cs, black). DNA molecules measured by targeted amplicon bisulfite sequencing are organized by hierarchical clustering. Distribution of footprints illustrates the heterogeneity in protein binding at a single promoter within a population of cells.(B) Average footprinting patterns centered on the TSS of the 10% most active promoters.(C) Illustration of the strategy used to assign discrete states from dSMF datasets. Four bins anchored relative to core promoter elements were used to extract methylation from every sequenced molecule. Methylation was binarized within each bin creating a 4-bit vector leading to 16 possible combinations describing the state of each molecule. Five footprinting patterns were selected and defined as states (see STAR Methods).(D) Average footprinting patterns of the five states (colored lines) centered on the TSS of active promoters computed after single-molecule separation. Sequencing reads were classified into five pre-defined states, and the average footprinting frequency was calculated for each covered position across the set of active promoters.(E) Spatial alignment of footprinting signal with polymerase downstream of the TSSs (brown box) or positioned nucleosomes (blue box) across the same set of promoters. Average read count signal across active promoters is displayed for independent measurements.(F) Global relation between state frequencies at promoters and independent bulk measurements of Pol II and nucleosomes depicted in form of a heatmap of similarity (Pearson correlation). States separate in two groups that either correlate with occupancy by the transcription machinery (Pol II ChIP-seq) or nucleosomes (MNase-seq) illustrating accurate state quantification.(G) Distribution of state frequencies as a function of promoter activity. Cumulative bar plot depicting the distribution of state frequencies. Promoters were binned based on Pol II enrichment (log2 ChIP-seq), and the median frequency of each state was calculated within each bin. The frequency of each state is represented using the same color code as in (D). For comparison median expression (RNA-seq; reads per kilobase per million reads [RPKM]) is displayed (upper panel, white to black scale). A sharp decrease in nucleosome occupancy is observed between silent and lowly expressed genes, concomitant with a mirroring increase in unoccupied molecules. Promoters with increasing transcriptional activity display a reduction of unbound molecules concomitant with increasing Pol-II-bound molecules at a constant nucleosomal occupancy rate (\u223c10%).(H) Single-locus examples of a weakly active promoter (left panel, Roh-Pol II fold enrichment 9\u00d7) versus a highly active promoter (right panel, IP3K1-Pol II fold enrichment 36\u00d7). Shown are stacks of individual molecules measured by targeted amplicon bisulfite sequencing, sorted into five states using the classification algorithm (methylated Cs, accessible, light gray; unmethylated Cs, protected, black). The vertical side bar depicts the frequency of each state using the same color code as 2D. The percentages of molecules in the Pol II or unbound state are indicated at the right side of the plot.We next sought to investigate whether the sequence of protein-DNA binding events that occur during transcription initiation would create distinct patterns when analyzed at the single-molecule level. Indeed, such heterogeneity is evident when we cluster individual reads amplified from a specific promoter (Figure\u00a02A, bottom panel). An active promoter displays fully accessible molecules, molecules with very large or discrete footprints at various positions around the TSS (exemplified in Figure\u00a02A). While large footprints could reflect nucleosome occupancy, shorter ones (<50\u00a0bp) are unlikely to be able to accommodate nucleosomes. Instead, these probably represent PIC and Pol II occupancy since they spatially fit the expected binding regions for these protein complexes (Figure\u00a0S2A).Simultaneous Quantification of Multiple Transcription Initiation IntermediatesIf these heterogeneous patterns represent distinct steps of the transcription initiation process, we should be able to link these patterns with occupancy of the protein complexes expected to create the footprints. In order to quantify pattern frequencies, we designed a molecular classifier that sorts molecules based on their footprints (Figure\u00a02C). The separation was anchored around TSSs, and four collection bins were designed that cover regions contacted by the PIC and Pol II (Figures 2C, S2A, and S2B). For each individual molecule, the algorithm collects binarized methylation within the four bins creating 16 (24) possible combinations. We applied this method to the entire genome and quantified single-molecule footprints for \u223c99% of those TSS that contain informative GCs or CG dinucleotides within all four collection bins. These represent 9,062 out of the 21,726 uniquely annotated TSS. Their almost complete experimental recovery argues for saturation in genome coverage.Among the 16 theoretical patterns that were used for the classification, only the ones representing footprints occurring at promoters in\u00a0vivo should be recurrently observed. Indeed, inspection of the frequencies of individual patterns across promoters identifies a subset of footprints that are frequently observed in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a0S2F). Interestingly, the frequencies of these abundant states tend to show correlation with promoter activity as defined by Pol II occupancy (Figure\u00a0S2G). In opposition, the less abundant states tend to show no significant correlations with the tested features (Figure\u00a0S2G). In order to facilitate data interpretation, we constructed a simplified set of five states (Figure\u00a0S2C). This condenses the information of the most frequent ten states that show evidence of correlations with bulk data (Figures S2C and S2G). The remaining unassigned reads were compiled into a separate \u201cunassigned\u201d category (Figure\u00a0S2F). Importantly, we observed high reproducibility between biological replicates in the frequency of each of the five states (R > 0.85 Figure\u00a0S2I).To delineate the nature of the observed footprints, we contrasted their spatial distribution with those of nucleosomes or Pol II as measured by bulk methodologies (Figures 2D and 2E). State 1 is characterized by a broad footprint that spans the entire promoter region compatible with presence of nucleosomes at these molecules. States 2\u20135 show a consistent footprint at\u00a0\u223c100\u00a0bp downstream of the TSS that aligns well with the phased\u00a0+1 nucleosome as mapped by MNase sequencing (MNase-seq) (Figures 2D and 2E). Besides this nucleosomal footprint, state 2 is completely accessible at the promoter region. In contrast, states 3 and 4 harbor a short footprint upstream of the TSS (Figure\u00a02D), indicative of binding of the PIC due to similarities with previous in\u00a0vitro footprint patterns of TFIID-TFIIA (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013). An additional peak downstream of the TSS (+30:+80\u00a0bp) characterizes state 4, a feature that is shared with state 5. Importantly, this short peak downstream of the TSS precisely aligns with the summit of Pol II density as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP or precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) (Figures 2D and 2E).If our single-molecule quantification strategy is accurate, the abundance of states at a given promoter should correlate with orthogonal bulk measures for chromatin and polymerase. To perform such comparison, we used molecule counts as a measure of state occurrences at individual promoters (Figure\u00a02F). This revealed that all states but state 1 positively correlate with measures reflecting gene activity. Importantly, the strongest correlation for state 5 is observed with Pol II ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) (R\u00a0= 0.69), confirming that abundance of this state largely recapitulates enrichments of Pol II. Additionally, we observe that state 1 is highly correlated with the abundance of nucleosomes at TSSs as measured by MNase-seq (R\u00a0= 0.74, Figure\u00a02F). The differences of states between cell types mirror those detected with other measures of accessibility or Pol II binding (Figure\u00a0S2J). Based on these similarities, we assigned the states to those factors that explain best the observed footprint (Figures 2D\u20132F).To validate the ability of our methodology to accurately reflect the binding frequency of the PIC (state 3 and 4) and Pol II (state 4 and 5), we determined state frequencies after depletion of either TBP using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Figure\u00a0S2K) or Pol II using \u03b1-amanitin-mediated degradation (Figure\u00a0S2L). We observe that TBP depletion leads to selective reduction in the frequency of those states assigned to the PIC (state 3 and 4) (Figures S2M and S2R). In contrast, depletion of Pol II specifically reduces the frequency of state 5 (Figures S2N and S2S). As a control, we repeated this analysis using the 16-state classification (Figures S2O and S2P), confirming that most of the experimental variations were already captured by our simplified five-state classification (Figures S2M\u2013S2P). We conclude that dSMF footprinting generates quantitative measures for multiple occupancy events at promoters genome-wide and at single-molecule resolution.Next, we investigated how frequencies of these five states relate to each other. We ranked promoters according to their activity as defined by Pol II ChIP-seq (Figure\u00a02G). While the frequency of the Pol II-bound state increases linearly, the frequency of the \u201cnucleosome-occupied\u201d state shows a bimodal pattern (Figure\u00a02G). In other words, promoters of inactive genes are occupied by nucleosomes \u223c80% of the time. This frequency drops rapidly to \u223c10% for promoters of even lowly active genes (Figure\u00a02G). This loss coincides with a simultaneous increase in the number of \u201cunbound\u201d molecules, which contain neither nucleosome nor polymerase. With increasing promoter activity the pool of Pol-II-bound molecules grows linearly at the expense of unbound molecules. (Figure\u00a02G). Remarkably, this also illustrates that Pol II occupancy can reach up to 65% at a small set of very active promoters (Figures 2H and S2E). These results have several implications. First, they illustrate that within a population of dividing cells one-tenth of DNA molecules of even active TSSs remain occupied by nucleosomes. Second, it suggests that nucleosomal presence is equally low at weakly (Figure\u00a02H, left panel) and highly transcribed promoters (Figure\u00a02H, right panel). Thus a high number of molecules remain unoccupied at weakly active promoters (Figures 2G and 2H), arguing that increased output of promoters does not involve additional nucleosome removal but solely depend on increased Pol II recruitment. To directly test this hypothesis, we monitored state distributions at a hormonal-responsive promoter (Hr46) upon stimulation with ecdysone. This promoter displays low occupancy and basal transcription in untreated cells (Figure\u00a0S2T). Upon hormonal induction it is upregulated as measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and displays a coinciding increase in the frequency of Pol II footprints and decrease in number of unoccupied molecules (Figure\u00a0S2T). This directly illustrates how transcriptional upregulation can occur through increased recruitment of Pol II in absence of changes in nucleosome occupancy.The TATA Box Stabilizes Binding of the PICFormation of the PIC is initiated through interactions of TFIID subunits with the TATA box as well elements downstream of the TSS (Louder et\u00a0al., 2016). Presence of core promoter elements such as the TATA box influence TFIID binding in\u00a0vitro (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013). In contrast, in\u00a0vivo binding of TBP-TFIID was reported to not be strongly enhanced at TATA-containing promoters when measured by ChIP-seq (Pugh and Venters, 2016). Given this apparent discrepancy, we wondered whether single-molecule quantification of DNA-protein contacts would reveal differences between promoters depending on the presence of a TATA box.A comparison of active promoters with or without a TATA box revealed striking differences in their frequency of footprints upstream of the TSS (Figures 3A and 3B). These occurred much more often at a TATA-containing promoter such as Fur1 (37% of molecules, Figure\u00a03B), compared to a TATA-less promoters such as Nrv1 (3% of molecules, Figure\u00a03A). Inspection of the composite footprints for highly active promoters (Figure\u00a03C) confirms these observations, since we rarely detect PIC footprints at TATA-less promoters.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03TATA Box Stabilizes Binding of the PIC(A and B) Single-locus examples of TATA-less (A) versus TATA-containing (B) promoters.

The percentages of molecules in PIC- or Pol-II-bound states are indicated on the right side of the plot.(C) Composite footprinting profiles around TATA-containing or TATA-less highly active promoters (red and blue lines, respectively) showing strong differences in PIC footprints between the categories.(D) Heatmap showing state frequencies for transcriptionally active promoters. k-means clustering was used to organize the heatmap. Side bars indicate presence (colored) or absence (black) of core promoter elements, revealing that TATA-containing promoters cluster due to the increased abundance of PIC footprint.(E) TATA-box presence alters state distribution, depleting accessible molecules and increasing the number of molecules bound by PIC (with or without Pol II binding). Shown are p values (\u2013log) of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test multiplied by the sign of the statistic parameter to account for directionality of the differences.To test whether this is generally the case, we clustered active promoters according to state frequencies (Figure\u00a03D). This revealed that a fraction of active promoters (\u223c7%) show a high\u00a0enrichment of PIC-bound molecules (Figure\u00a03D, II) and indeed a large majority of these contain a TATA box (78%, Figure\u00a03D). Furthermore, TATA-containing promoters display a strongly increased frequency of PIC-bound molecules, which coincides with a reduction of the unbound state (Figure\u00a03E, p\u00a0value <10\u221220) but which is independent of their transcriptional activity (Figure\u00a0S3B). Importantly, this enrichment in PIC molecules at TATA-containing promoters appears as an intrinsic feature as we find it reproducible across cell types (Figure\u00a0S2J) with no obvious cell-type-dependent redistribution of states (Figure\u00a0S3A).Interestingly, both PIC and engaged Pol II footprints frequently co-occur on the same molecule suggesting that the PIC is not necessarily evicted from DNA after initiation (Figure\u00a03B). This observation is compatible with the concept that some GTFs of the PIC can form a stable scaffold able to promote re-initiation of transcription (Yudkovsky et\u00a0al., 2000). Since no stable protein-DNA interactions are observed upstream of the TSS at TATA-less promoters (Figure\u00a03A), PIC formation appears to be either transient and/or restricted to TFIID interactions with downstream promoter elements. In summary, these data suggest that PIC formation occurs by distinct protein/DNA interactions and with striking different dynamics in\u00a0vivo at TATA-containing versus TATA-less promoters.Polymerase Turnover at Paused GenesThe accumulation of Pol II in a paused state is considered not only to be a step of RNA quality control, but also to act as a regulatory switch at many developmental and stimulus-responsive genes. In order to directly probe the stability of the engaged Pol II, we inhibited transcription initiation by treating cells with Triptolide using previously established conditions (Figure\u00a04A) (Henriques et\u00a0al., 2013).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Blocking Transcriptional Initiation Changes Pol II Occupancy(A) Schematic representation of the initiation process and its block through chemical inhibition of XPB-TFIIH with Triptolide.(B) Composite footprinting profile around the top 10% expressed genes (as in Figure\u00a01D) before and after Triptolide treatment for 10\u00a0min (black and red lines, respectively).

The vertical side bar depicts the frequency of each state using the same color code as in 2D. Red dashed line depicts position of the TSSs. The percentages of molecules harboring footprints for the engaged Pol II are indicated on the right side of the plot.(D) Inhibition of transcription initiation leads to a genome-wide reduction of engaged polymerases and an increase of the frequency of PIC and unbound states. Shown is a heatmap displaying the promoters showing the highest differences in state abundance (n\u00a0= 468) after a 10-min inhibition of initiation (Triptolide). Left side bar depicts presence (green) or absence (black) of a TATA box at promoters. Promoters were organized by k-means clustering.(E) Loss of Pol II at paused promoters upon inhibiting initiation is of similar amplitude than at non-paused promoters. Plotted is the starting amount of engaged Pol\u00a0II at non-paused against the amount of Pol II lost after 10\u00a0min of initiation inhibition for two promoter categories (non-paused genes, black dots; paused genes, red dots). The running median for each starting Pol II amount is depicted for each category (non-paused genes, black; paused genes, red thick line).(F) A similar fraction of Pol-II-bound molecules is lost at paused and non-paused promoters. Distribution of the fold change in Pol-II-bound amounts (log2) for both promoter categories (non-paused, black; paused, red) illustrating that all promoters loose a comparable fraction (\u223c65%) of Pol II irrespective of their category or the amount of Pol II before Triptolide treatment.Blocking transcriptional initiation for 10\u00a0min resulted in a global reduction of Pol II footprints at active promoters (Figure\u00a04B). These changes are directly evident when focusing at individual promoters such as the TATA-containing Fur1 (Figure\u00a04C), where Pol II frequency drops but frequency of the PIC only state increases (Figure\u00a04C). A genome-wide analysis of the effect of initiation inhibition identified reproducible changes in state frequencies (Figures 4D, S4A, and S4B). This reveals that most active genes lose engaged Pol II upon inhibition. Depending on the promoter type, this loss coincides with increased frequency of the unbound or the PIC-only state. These observations further support the model that the TATA box stabilizes the PIC at a stage preceding TFIIH activity. Notably, promoters that lose Pol II upon treatment do not gain nucleosomes (Figures 4C and 4D). Then within the tested time interval, engaged Pol II does not significantly contribute to the maintenance of open chromatin at promoters as previously proposed (Gilchrist et\u00a0al., 2010).Next, we asked for all promoters how the change in Pol II occupancy relates to the amount of polymerase present before treatment (Figure\u00a04E). This reveals a strong negative correlation (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69) indicating that on average promoters lose a constant fraction of engaged Pol II regardless of their activity level. We then isolated a set of paused genes based on their \u201cpausing index\u201d as defined by the imbalance between Pol II at promoters compared to gene body (Figure\u00a0S4C) (Core et\u00a0al., 2012). Surprisingly, the loss of Pol II footprint observed at these genes is overall of comparable amplitude than the one observed at non-paused genes (Figures 4E and 4F). Importantly, this is similarly evident at the promoter of the Hsp70 gene (Figure\u00a04E), which is the best-characterized example of a promoter whose output is indeed regulated by a switch to productive elongation (Guertin et\u00a0al., 2010).To show that the observed rapid loss of Pol II at paused genes can be observed with other detection methods, we performed ChIP-seq against Pol II under identical conditions (Figures S4D\u2013S4G) and quantified the relative Pol II changes genome-wide. This confirmed that inhibiting initiation leads to a global decrease of Pol II levels (Figures S4D\u2013S4G). Taken together these results suggest that the turnover rate of Pol II at paused promoters could be similar to that observed at actively transcribing genes, where polymerases continuously move into productive elongation.Rapid Pol II Turnover at Paused GenesIn order to monitor this process in more detail, we measured changes in Pol II occupancy during a time course of inhibition with Triptolide. For these experiments, we acquired high-coverage dSMF data from a focused set of 52 promoters sampled to have a broad range of transcriptional activities and pausing indices (Figure\u00a05A, left panel). We observed a significant spread in Pol II turnover kinetics between tested genes (Figure\u00a05A). While this spread is comparable to previous reports (Henriques et\u00a0al., 2013), we did not observe an increased residence time for Pol II at promoters of paused genes (Figure\u00a05A, red label). In fact, genes with comparable Pol II turnover differ significantly in their pausing index (Figure\u00a05A). For instance, the genes CG8180 (Figure\u00a05B) and ps (Figure\u00a05C) have both \u223c30% of their molecules occupied by Pol II even though they differ largely in their pausing index (Figures 5A and 5D). Upon inhibition of initiation, both lose two-thirds of their Pol II footprint (17% and 18%, respectively) within 10\u00a0min of inhibition (Figures 5B and 5C) and at similar kinetics (Figure\u00a05D). Interestingly, one of the fastest turnover is detected at the paused Hsp70 promoter (Figure\u00a05D). The observed half-life is well below 2.5\u00a0min (our earliest time point of measurement) and thus faster than previously reported for this gene (Buckley et\u00a0al., 2014). It is as rapid as observed at glec, one of the most actively transcribed promoters within our set (Figure\u00a05D).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05High Levels of Pol II Turnover at Paused Promoters(A) Inhibition of transcription initiation leads to a rapid reduction of engaged polymerases at promoters also at paused genes.

Shown are average values over two biological replicates.(G) scRNA decay kinetics for each group of TSS (color as in A). Shown is the distribution of scRNA levels for each TSS (black dots) and the median abundance at each time point (colored lines and dots). The first time point where the median of the relative scRNA amount reached 50% of its original value was used to approximate the half-life for each cluster.Paused promoters such as Hsp70 experience basal elongation levels. To test how much of the loss of Pol II at paused promoters could be explained by elongation, we repeated the inhibition of initiation in presence of the p-TEFb inhibitor Flavopridol that blocks entry into elongation (Figure\u00a0S5A). This simultaneous inhibition indeed partially buffers the loss of Pol II at a fraction of non-paused promoters (Figures S5B and S5D). However, paused promoters including Hsp70 show a similar loss regardless of the additional inhibition of elongation (Figures S5C and S5E). We conclude that the loss of Pol II observed at paused promoters occurs independent of elongation.Taken together, these results suggest that engaged polymerases are not particularly stable at paused promoters compared to promoters experiencing frequent elongation. This would in turn imply that a large fraction of Pol II engaged at paused promoters is rapidly lost independently of elongation, most probably through premature termination.Widespread Rapid scRNA Turnover at Paused GenesAbundance of short capped RNA (scRNA) at the 5\u2032 of genes has been shown to indirectly reflect amounts of Pol II engaged at a particular promoter (Nechaev et\u00a0al., 2010). To independently validate our above observations, we sequenced scRNA during the same time course of inhibition. Importantly, the generated dataset compares well with previous measures of scRNA decay kinetics made at the single-gene level (Figure\u00a0S5F). We then compared the kinetics of Pol II loss as measured by SMF (Figure\u00a05D), with that of scRNA decay (Figure\u00a05E) for our selected set of TSSs. Both paused and non-paused genes show a very good agreement between the two measures, including the rapid decay of scRNA signal at the promoter of Hsp70 (Figure\u00a05E). This independent readout further argues that engaged Pol II and its associated scRNA can be short lived at some paused promoters such as the Hsp70 promoter. We then asked generally how Pol II turnover relates to Pol II accumulation downstream of the TSS at paused genes. To address this question, we clustered all highly active genes (Figure\u00a0S5G) according to their scRNA decay profile (Figure\u00a05F), grouped them by similarity and estimated the approximate half-life of their scRNA (Figure\u00a05G). We found that for a majority of promoters (68%) scRNA have a short half-life comprised between 0 and 5\u00a0min (Figures 5F and 5G, clusters 4\u20136), with a substantial fraction shorter than 2.5\u00a0min. When we compared the pausing index (Figures 5F, side bar, S5H), or the global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) signal at the gene body (Figures S5I and S5J), we\u00a0observe equivalent amount of paused or non-paused genes\u00a0with half-life <2.5\u00a0min. Importantly, the half-life of Hsp70 scRNA ranks again among the fastest detected genome-wide (< 2.5\u00a0min, Figures 5E\u20135G). In fact none of the gene groups that differ significantly in their half-life display any particular enrichment for either category (Figures S5H\u2013S5K, chi-square test, p value >0.01). Together these results further support a model where many paused genes have a short Pol II half-life. More generally our data suggest that stability of Pol II at promoters is not correlated with the efficiency of entry into elongation. Indirectly, these results imply that many paused genes including Hsp70 experience frequent premature termination rapidly after initiation.Continuous Transcription Initiation Is Required for Induction of the Paused Heat Shock GeneTo functionally test such model of abundant non-processive pausing, we used the paradigm of heat shock response. We reasoned that if the large pool of polymerases engaged at the Hsp70 promoter (\u223c40%, Figure\u00a06C) is stable as postulated in the classical model of \u201cpausing,\u201d the transcriptional response upon heat shock should be insensitive to a preceding short inhibition of transcription initiation. If Pol II is indeed unstable as we observed in our time-course experiment (Figures 5A, 5D, and 5E), a short inhibition of initiation should alter heat shock-induced transcriptional activation. To discriminate between these two models, we performed heat shock induction after short incubation with the same set of inhibitors (Figures 6A and 6B). In absence of Triptolide, we observed a rapid and over 10-fold increase in Hsp70 transcript upon 1\u00a0min of high temperature (Figure\u00a06B) as previously reported (Guertin et\u00a0al., 2010, Wirbelauer et\u00a0al., 2005). During the strong transcriptional response upon normal heat shock, we observed that the amount of engaged Pol II is similar to the one prior to induction (Figures 6C and 6D). This shows that the initiation rate at Hsp70 is sufficient to directly replenish the pool of engaged Pol II that are going into elongation upon induction. This is in good agreement with the initiation and elongation rate measured at this promoter upon induction (Buckley et\u00a0al., 2014). As expected, this fast induction is almost completely abolished upon chemical inhibition of elongation, in line with the established model that the engaged polymerase at the uninduced Hsp70 is controlled at the elongation step. Importantly, however, a short (2.5\u00a0min) chemical inhibition of initiation alone similarly abolishes the transcriptional response of Hsp70 (Figure\u00a06B). This lack of transcriptional response fully agrees with the footprinting patterns that showed a rapid loss of the pool of engaged Pol II upon short initiation inhibition (Figures 5D, \u200bD,6A,6A, and 6E). This result indicates that the rapid transcriptional response observed upon heat shock is not mediated by a pool of polymerases that are stably associated with the DNA template. Instead, it suggests that this response relies on continuous initiation. We conclude that promoter-engaged Pol II is indeed unstable at the Hsp70 promoter, the canonical example of output regulation by pausing. We propose that the observed accumulation of engaged Pol II at these promoters is the result of continuous cycles of initiation followed by rapid premature termination. The fact that we observe this behavior throughout the genome argues that non-processive pausing is a common phenomenon. Activation of such paused genes appears not to be mediated through release of stably associated Pol II but rather through switching from termination to processive elongation.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06Heat Shock Response Requires Continuous Transcriptional Initiation(A) Effect of short inhibition of initiation or elongation on heat shock response.

The percentages of molecules harboring footprints for engaged Pol II are indicated on the right side of the plot. DiscussionThis study establishes a methodological and computational framework for genome-wide SMF and applies it to quantify binding events that co-occur at promoters throughout the fly genome. By monitoring formation of various intermediates in the transcription initiation process this uncovers new insights about chromatin opening, PIC formation, and Pol II initiation dynamics leading to a revised model for polymerase pausing.We find promoters of inactive genes to be covered by nucleosomes at a high frequency of 80%, while active genes show an expected lower occupancy. Surprisingly, however, active promoters display a rather homogeneous rate of \u223c10% nucleosomal occupancy irrespective of their very different activity. Since our data were derived from an unsynchronized population of cells, it is tempting to speculate that the remaining 10% of occupied molecules originate from cells in a phase of the cell cycle where the transcriptional machinery is evicted from chromatin such as mitosis (Liang et\u00a0al., 2015).Our genome-wide promoter analysis further reveals that presence of core elements significantly alters footprinting patterns. This is most prominent in case of the TATA box, which displays frequent PIC footprints. While any footprinting assay is agnostic to the identity of the complexes binding, our data are in direct support of models previously derived from structural and biochemical data (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013). These postulate that at TATA-containing promoters, TFIID binds through TAFs-MTE/DPE and TBP-TATA, while contacts will be limited to the downstream interaction for TATA-less sequences. Moreover the co-occurrence of this stabilized PIC and engaged Pol II suggests that this structure could allow re-initiation cycles as proposed by biochemical studies (Yudkovsky et\u00a0al., 2000).Quantitative monitoring of promoter footprints and their changes upon inhibition of initiation or elongation revealed surprisingly high turnover rates of Pol II at many paused promoters. Affected genes include the heat shock-responsive promoter Hsp70 that displayed one of the fastest Pol II turnover rates. This is not unique to our study and experimental approach since very fast turnover at Hsp70 was also very recently reported as part of a high-resolution genome-wide dataset of Pol II in Drosophila (not discussed by the authors, relevant data part of their Table S1 [Shao and Zeitlinger, 2017]). This is in contrast to a previous report using live tracking of photo-activated Pol II on polytene chromosomes, which estimated a significantly longer half-life than the one we derive from measuring Pol II occupancy (Buckley et\u00a0al., 2014). This discrepancy might be explained by local recycling of the terminated polymerases, which could lead to extended fluorescence in a microscopical assay. In turn, this could result in an overestimation of residence time as already pointed out by the authors (Buckley et\u00a0al., 2014).Together our data revise the concept of promoter proximal pausing defined as the accumulation of a stable pool of polymerase to enable rapid gene activation upon stimuli (Guertin et\u00a0al., 2010). Instead, our data argue for a non-processive model for pausing where a large fraction of initiated polymerases rapidly and prematurely terminates upon elongation block. In this scenario, rapid induction would not be mediated by release of a pool of polymerases pre-loaded on the DNA template. Instead, initiation at these genes leads to continuous replenishing of Pol\u00a0II, which can be rapidly switched to elongation upon stimulus. Such regulation might enable higher and potentially sustained amplitude of expression, as induction does not rely solely on a single Pol II release but on continuous waves of initiation.While mechanistically different from the prevalent concept of polymerase pausing, the model proposed here is nevertheless compatible with the idea that genes requiring rapid activation upon stimuli acquire a specific non-processive activation state. We confirm that in contrast to truly inactive promoters, this promoter state is characterized by extensive chromatin remodeling (>80% of molecules), high levels of PIC formation and transcription initiation. However, compared to truly active promoters, this state does not appear to involve extended stability of the engaged Pol II pool, but rather its continuous and rapid turnover. This turnover mechanism could in principle take place at promoters of developmental genes that have been suggested to be regulated at the level of elongation. If and how this precisely takes place during the course of early development remains to be determined.

The nuclei were then incubated with 200U of M.CviPI (NEB-M0227L) at 30\u00b0C for 7.5\u00a0min (in presence of 0.6mM SAM, and 300mM Sucrose). The reaction was supplemented with 100U of M.CviPI and 128pmol of SAM before a second incubation round of 30\u00b0C for 7.5\u00a0min. 10mM MgCl2, 128pmol of SAM and 60U of M.SssI (NEB-M0226L) were added for a third incubation round of 30\u00b0C for 7.5\u00a0min. Reaction was stopped by adding a SDS containing buffer (20mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, 1%SDS 10mM EDTA), DNA was extracted after overnight Proteinase K (200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) digestion at 55\u00b0C. For single treatments only one of the enzyme was used under the same conditions.Whole genome bisulfite libraries were prepared using Illumina Truseq DNA sample preparation kit following manufacturer recommendation. 5\u03bcg of sheared DNA (covaris) was used as an input for end-repair and A-tailing. Methylated adaptors were ligated and large DNA fragments (400-600bp) were selected on a low melting agarose gel (BIO-RAD \u2212161-3107). The extracted material was used as an input for bisulfite conversion (Quiagen - 59104). The converted DNA was amplified by 10 cycles of PCR using Pfu Cx HotStart (Agilent - 600410) using Illumina primers. PCR product was purified using AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter - A63880) and controlled on Bioanalyser High sensitivity (Agilent 5067-4626). The samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq2500 generating 150bp paired-end reads (rapid-run). Two biological replicates was sequenced for each condition.Amplicon bisulfite sequencing Primers were designed against the in\u00a0silico converted templates using Primer3 with slight modifications and subsequent selection of 96 bisulphite primer pairs (product size: 250\u2013500\u00a0bp). Primers were commercially synthesized on 96 well plate format. A 2\u00a0\u03bcg sample of RNaseA-treated genomic DNA was converted following standard Epitect bisulphite conversion kit protocol (QIAGEN). Bisulphite-converted DNA was amplified with specific primers with following cycling conditions: twenty touch down cycles from 52 to 48\u00b0C with 30\u00a0s at 95\u00b0C, 30\u00a0s at 52/48\u00b0C and 30\u00a0s at 72\u00b0C, followed by 36 cycles of 30\u00a0s at 95\u00b0C, 30\u00a0s at 48\u00b0C and 30\u00a0s at 72\u00b0C. Then samples of 5\u00a0\u03bcL per reaction were pooled and bead purified (Agencourt - AMPureXP). Bisulfite amplicons libraries were prepared using NEBNext Chip (NEB - E6240) multiplexing up to 10 libraries (NEB - E7335) on a Miseq instrument generating 250bp paired-end reads. All targeted experiments have been performed in at least triplicates except for the time course data that have been performed in duplicates.Short capped RNA preparation (scRNA) For each condition 20 10\u02c66 of Triptolide treated Drosophila cells were spiked with 2 10\u02c66 untreated mouse embryonic stem cells. scRNA protocol was adapted from (Nechaev et\u00a0al., 2010). Cells were re-suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10mM Tris (pH\u00a0= 7.4), 10mM NaCl, 3mM Mgcl2, 0.1mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40), incubated 10min on ice, span down. Nuclei were washed with ice cold (10mM Tris (pH\u00a0= 7.4), 10mM NaCl, 3mM Mgcl2, 0.1mM EDTA) and nuclear pellets were dissolved in Trizol (Thermofisher). RNA was size selected (17-200bp) using a two-step column purification strategy (RNA clean and concentrator, Zymo-R1016). 10\u00a0\u03bcg of purified RNA was successively treated by 5\u2032 dephosphorylation - 20U at 37\u00b0C for 30min (Epicenter - RP8092H); 5\u2032 terminator exonuclease - 1U in Buffer A at 30\u00b0C for 60min (Epicenter - {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"TER51020\",\"term_id\":\"1599868412\",\"term_text\":\"TER51020\"}}TER51020); cap-clip decapping enzyme \u2013 5U at 37\u00b0C for 90min. After each reaction, short RNA was column purified (RNA clean and concentrator, Zymo-R1016). The resulting RNA was used for library preparation using TruSeq small RNA library (Illumina). Libraries were purified on 6% TBE gels (150-300bp \u2013 Novex - EC6265BOX). Size distribution of the libraries were controlled on Bioanalyser High sensitivity (Agilent 5067-4626). Two biologically independent inhibition time courses were performed. The samples were run on an Illumina NextSeq generating 38bp paired-end reads.dsRNA mediated RNA interference Primers were designed using the snapdragon online tool. A two-step PCR was used to amplify the target sequence from the fly genome and add the full length T7 promoter. In\u00a0vitro transcription was performed using the Megascript kit (LifeTech \u2013 AM1626). 30\u00a0\u03bcg of purified dsRNA was directly soaked into the medium with 1.5 10\u02c66 of S2 cells for 72\u00a0hr. Efficiency of downregulation was probed using RT-qPCR. Experiments were performed in biological duplicates.Chomatin Immuno-precipitation (ChIP) 20 10\u02c66 S2 cells were cross-linked in S2 medium containing 1,1% formaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. Cross-link was stopped by addition of 0.125\u00a0M glycine 10min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS. Nuclei were extracted by successive incubation in (10mM Tris (pH\u00a0= 8.0), 10mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) and (10\u00a0mM Tris (pH\u00a0= 8.0), 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 200\u00a0mM NaCl). Nuclei were resuspended in (50\u00a0mM HEPES/KOH (pH\u00a0= 7.5), 500mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%DOC, 0.1%SDS, protease inhibitors) and sonicated (40 cycles - 30 s) (Diagenode Bioruptor). 70\u00a0\u03bcg of pre-cleared chromatin was incubated with \u223c5ug of antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. The protein-DNA complexes were immuno-precipitated by addition of protein A-Sepharose for 3\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed twice with 1mL lysis buffer and once with 1\u00a0mL DOC buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris (pH\u00a0=\u00a08.0), 0.25\u00a0M LiCl, 0.5% NP- 40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1\u00a0mM EDTA). Chromatin was eluted in (1% SDS, 0.1\u00a0M NaHCO3). After RNase A treatment, cross-linking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65\u00b0C followed by proteinase K digestion. DNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 50\u00a0mL TE buffer.Quantification and Statistical AnalysisAlignment and data extraction Data alignment For dSMF data, raw sequence files were pre-processed using Trimmomatic to remove Illumina adaptor sequences, remove low quality reads and trim low quality bases. The trimmed reads were then aligned using QuasR (using Bowtie as an aligner) (Gaidatzis et\u00a0al., 2015) against a bisulfite index of the Drosophila melanogaster genome (BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3).For other datasets (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, scRNA), reads were aligned using QuasR against the Drosophila melanogaster genome (BSgenome.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3), and or mouse genome (BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9). To enable analysis at the multi-copy Hsp70 locus, we allowed multiple hit mapping (< 10 \u2013 QuasR option maxHits\u00a0= 10). For multi-mapping reads, only one hit is randomly selected for each read, avoiding artificial signal enhancement.Average methylation call Context independent cytosine methylation call was performed using QuasR. Custom R functions were developed to determine context dependent (CG, GC) average methylation. Methylation has been called genome wide for Cs covered at least 10 times. Single dot are used to display single C nucleotide data while curves represent smoothed data obtained by averaging data using a sliding window over 10 Cs.Single molecule methylation call Single molecule C methylation extraction was performed using QuasR (Gaidatzis et\u00a0al., 2015). Custom R functions have been developed to determine nucleotide context and sort the molecules according to their methylation pattern using a molecular classifier.Single molecule footprint quantification A set of unique reference transcription start site has been constructed using Refseq (dm3) precisely repositioned according to the main CAGE signal within 50bp (S2 cells CAGE data from Modencode; Roy et\u00a0al., 2010). A molecular classifier has been developed (Figures 2A and S2A\u2013S2G) that extract methylation for every read in 4 bins designed around the theoretical position of promoter elements where the transcription machinery (PIC, Pol II) has been observed to create footprints (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013, Lee et\u00a0al., 2008, Lim et\u00a0al., 2004): upstream:[-58:-43]; TATA/BRE:[-36:-22]; INR:[-6:14]; DPE:[28:47] (Figure\u00a0S2A). All reads were aligned relative to the set of TSSs and methylation was extracted for every molecule in each bin. The methylation was binarized in each bin, creating a 4 bit vector classifying the state of every molecule among 2\u02c64\u00a0= 16 theoretical possibilities. These include a fully accessible pattern (1111); a fully inaccessible pattern (0000) which may indicate the presence of nucleosomes; a pattern which indicates accessibility only at the position of the DPE (1110) which may be reflective of engaged Pol II; and several patterns that could potentially be associated with PIC formation (1011, 1010, 1001 and 1101) (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013, Lee et\u00a0al., 2008, Lim et\u00a0al., 2004). To simplify the interpretation of the data, we aimed to focus our analysis on states that are recurrently observed in\u00a0vivo. We excluded some states based on their low frequency of occurrence at promoters (Figure\u00a0S2F). These include some of the possible PIC footprints (1001, 1101) that either do not occur in\u00a0vivo or are too transient to be captured in our assay. Additionally, comparison of the frequency count with bulk datasets enabled to separate states that capture variations related to gene activity (Figure\u00a0S2G), from states that do not show any correlation with external measurements (0101, 0110, 0011, 1100). We noted that many of these correspond to the states occurring at low frequency. These states were grouped to an \u2018unassigned\u2019 category. The remaining states contained many of the patterns showing similarity with footprints observed in\u00a0vitro (Cianfrocco et\u00a0al., 2013) as well as in high resolution structure of transcription initiation (Louder et\u00a0al., 2016) (Figures S2A and S2C). From these, we aggregated states sharing high similarities in their pattern (i.e.,\u00a00000, 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001) (Figure\u00a0S2C) and show high correlation (Figure\u00a0S2G) (state 1 and 2). Coverage cutoffs of 30 and 100 reads have been used for genome wide analysis and amplicon bisulfite sequencing respectively.Data analysis All analyses were performed using R- Bioconductor. Ad hoc R scripts are available upon request.Detection of core promoter motifs Motif occurrence has been determined by searching for occurrence of the consensus motif (INR:\u2019TCAKTY\u2019; TATA: \u2018TATAWAAR\u2019; DPE:\u2019RGWYV\u2019 (Lim et\u00a0al., 2004)) allowing for one mismatch at their theoretical position relative to TSS flexible by 5bp. The effect of promoter motifs on state distribution has been measured by performing a Wilcoxon ranked-sum test comparing the abundance of a given state as a function of the presence/absence of the motif. The statistics of the test was used to display the directionality of the differences.Comparison with external datasets Data collection was performed using the qCount function of QuasR (Gaidatzis et\u00a0al., 2015). Different collection windows were adopted to collect reads in external reference datasets. For comparison at TSS, reads for all datasets were collected in a [-150:150] window surrounding the TSSs with the exception of MNase datasets. For MNase the window was restricted to [-40:30] to exclude the\u00a0+1 and \u22121 phased nucleosomes that sit around\u00a0\u00b1 100bp and restrict the counts to nucleosomes occupying the TSSs. Correlations were calculated on log2 transformed data.Definition of \u2018pausing\u2019 index Pausing index was calculated genome wide as previously described (Core et\u00a0al., 2012). For each genes read counts were collected in GRO-seq data around the TSS (+/\u2212 150bp) and in the gene body (+300:+600). The pausing index was defined as the ratio of TSS reads over gene body reads. \u2018paused\u2019 genes were defined as active genes having a pausing index > 8, and low read counts in the gene body (log2(RPKM)\u00a0< 3), to extract genes with high levels of engaged Pol II but transcriptionally inactive. \u2018unpaused\u2019 genes were defined as active genes having a pausing index\u00a0< 8.scRNA data analysis After alignment against Drosophila and mouse genomes (see above for details). Reads were counted in a window around TSSs [-100:200] using the qCount function of QuasR (Gaidatzis et\u00a0al., 2015). To reduce potential contamination with full-length transcripts we used the second read from the pair representing the 3\u2032 of the transcript for counting. Pairs having insert length > 180bp were excluded. We used the mouse spike-ins to perform inter-sample normalization and enable quantification of the global effects expected to occur upon inhibition of transcription. Under the Assumption that read counts from the mouse should be constant across samples; reads counts from each fly sample were normalized by the sum of the reads detected at mouse promoters within the same sample. Abundance of scRNA at each time-point was calculated relative to the respective amount before inhibition. This relative level was calculated for each replicate separately to correct for batch variations. While we generally observed the signal to be restricted to the 5\u2032 of the genes, we noted unusually high gene body signal at a top-expressed genes (including many ribosomal protein coding genes). We interpreted this as a contamination by mRNA degradation products for highly abundant transcripts and therefore discarded those from the analysis. To avoid variations related to gene activity, the analysis was restricted to highly active genes (top 10% ChIP-seq as defined in Figure\u00a01D).ChIP -seq analysis Reads were counted in a window around TSSs [-200:100] using the qCount function of QuasR (Gaidatzis et\u00a0al., 2015) and enrichment over input were derived.Targeted amplicon bis-seq primer design Within the set of promoters covered in the genome wide experiment, a subset of 96 promoters were targeted for amplicon bisulfite sequencing. Promoters were selected to have presence/absence of core promoter elements (i.e., TATA box, INR), a wide range of expression levels and pausing indices. Moreover specific cases as the canonical \u2018paused\u2019 Hsp70 promoter were targeted. Primers were designed using R functions wrapping Primer 3. The design was performed using a C > T converted genome excluding CG and GC containing regions. Primer list is available upon request.Data and Software AvailabilitySoftware Software from this study has been previously published as detailed under \u201cQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.\u201dData Resources The accession number for the sequencing data reported in this paper is GEO: {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE77369\",\"term_id\":\"77369\"}}GSE77369.
