By using multivalent interactions to create a phase-separated functional compartment, the histidine-rich domain in kinases targets the CTD into this environment to ensure hyperphosphorylation and efficient elongation of Pol II. Among all transcription-related cyclins, cyclin (CYC) T\u2014which includes T1 (CYCT1) and T2\u2014has the longest C-terminal regions. In CYCT1, the N-terminal region is structured and contains the cyclin-box repeats required for binding and activating CDK9, whereas the C-terminal region has only a few isolated motifs and is mostly unstructured (Fig. 1a).Open in a separate windowFig. 1 |The CYCT1 HRD promotes hyperphosphorylation of Pol II CTD52 and activation of transcription, but not interaction with P-TEFb partners, by CDK9.a, c, P-TEFb containing the indicated CYCT1\u2013Flag proteins (domain structure at bottom) were tested in kinase reactions containing GST\u2013CTD52 and GST\u2013CTD9 as the substrates.

A mixture of glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013CTD52 (RPB1 CTD containing all 52 repeats) and GST\u2013CTD9 (CTD containing 9 consensus repeats) was used in all reactions as the kinase substrates.The various CYCT1 truncations did not substantially affect the ability of the associated CDK9 to autophosphorylate by producing the ATP-dependent mobility shift (Fig. 1a), nor did the truncations decrease the phosphorylation of CTD9. However, upon truncation to a position at and beyond 533, CDK9 became largely unable to produce the hyper-phosphorylated CTD52 (hereafter, IIo) as revealed by the anti-phospho-Ser5 antibody 3E8 (Fig. 1a). A similar pattern was also detected with the anti-phospho-Ser2 antibody 3E10 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Thus, a region around position 533 in CYCT1 promoted the hyperphosphorylation by CDK9 of CTD52.To determine whether the CYCT1 C-terminal truncations affect the transcriptional activity of P-TEFb, we used the Gal4-tethering system to test fusion proteins containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain attached to the various truncated forms of CYCT1 to activate luciferase expression from the HIV-1 promoter containing Gal4-binding sites (Fig. 1b). Correlating with the kinase results, progressive CYCT1 C-terminal truncations to and beyond position 533 markedly reduced P-TEFb transcriptional activity (Fig. 1b).The coiled-coil domain (CCD, amino acids 379\u2013430) and the histidine-rich domain (HRD, amino acids 480\u2013550) exist around position 533 (Fig. 1a). In kinase reactions, only the deletion of HRD (\u0394HRD) but not CCD (\u0394CCD) blocked the hyperphosphorylation by CDK9 of CTD52 (Fig. 1c). Consistently, HRD but not CCD was required for P-TEFb transcriptional activity in the Gal4-tethering assay (Fig. 1d). Dependence on HRD for Tat/P-TEFb-activated HIV-1 elongation has previously been proposed7, and here confirmed by our finding that wild-type CYCT1 but not CYCT1\u0394HRD could effectively rescue the RNAi-knockdown of endogenous CYCT1 expression to produce long (promoter-distal) but not short (promoter-proximal) viral transcripts (Fig. 1e).The importance of the HRD for the transcriptional activity of P-TEFb was generalized to cellular genes, as CYCT1\u0394HRD produced significantly less mRNA from four representative immediate early genes\u2014FOS, JUNB, MYC and EGR1\u2014as well as HSP70\u20131 (also known as HSPA1A) under both basal and heat-shock conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2), all of which require P-TEFb for optimal transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2e) shows that the decreased activity of CYCT1\u0394HRD was not due to any substantial change in binding to the major P-TEFb partners, including BRD4 and subunits of the super elongation complex and the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle that regulate P-TEFb activity1,4,5.What is the mechanism by which the HRD promotes the activity of P-TEFb? The first hint came from the finding that wild-type CYCT1 in HeLa nuclei was more resistant to salt extraction, as compared to CYCT1\u0394HRD (Fig. 2a), which suggests that the HRD promoted the retention of CYCT1 in the nucleus. To determine more precisely the location and dynamics of this retention, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis of bindings of Halo-tagged wild-type CYCT1 and CYCT1 HRD to a gene array activated by reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (Fig. 2b). This array contains about 200 copies of an integrated transgene marked by YFP\u2013Lac repressor bound to the lac operator, which enables FRAP to be performed at this spot8. We observed significantly faster FRAP recovery for CYCT1\u0394HRD on the array than for wild-type CYCT1 (Fig. 2c). Further quantitative analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3a, \u200b,bb and Supplementary Information) revealed that this was mainly due to longer apparent residence time of wild-type CYCT1 (\u03c4off ~ 56 s), as compared to CYCT1\u0394HRD (\u03c4off ~ 4 s).Open in a separate windowFig. 2 |CYCT1 HRD contributes to the stable engagement of P-TEFb with activated gene array and endogenous genes, as well as direct binding to CTD by P-TEFb.a, Nuclei of HeLa cells expressing indicated CYCT1\u2013Flag were extracted with increasing NaCl concentrations.

The constitutively bound histone H2B\u2013Halo shows the photobleaching limit. Data from three independent replicates were merged and plotted. f, Immobilized GST or GST fusions were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract. The bound proteins were detected by western blotting (WB). g, Immobilized GST\u2013CTD52 was incubated with the indicated affinity-purified CYCT1\u2013Flag. The bound proteins and 2.5% of input were analysed by western blotting. All western blots are representative of three independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.To generalize the FRAP finding to endogenous genes (active and inactive) and cross-validate it using an orthogonal technique, we performed single-particle tracking in U2OS cells of Halo-tagged wild-type CYCT1 and CYCT1\u0394HRD proteins at 95 Hz to determine whether the HRD affects CYCT1 diffusion dynamics and bound fractions9,10 (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e, Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Information). Consistent with the HRD-facilitated association of CYCT1 with chromatin and the transcriptional machinery, CYCT1\u0394HRD diffused faster and showed a smaller bound fraction (8.8%) than did wild-type CYCT1 (13.0%). Next, we conducted single-particle tracking using a longer exposure time (500 ms; Supplementary Video 2) to blur out fast-diffusing molecules and focus on bound molecules that were presumably located at predominantly activated genes. We observed a wide distribution of CYCT1 binding events that probably encompassed both specific and non-specific interactions (Fig. 2e). Because this distribution did not fit well with models that assumed one or two single rate-limiting steps, we could not reliably attribute a single residence time. Nevertheless, consistent with the FRAP result, wild-type CYCT1 showed binding events that were significantly more stable than those of CYCT1\u0394HRD (Fig. 2e). Together, the single-particle tracking and FRAP results underscore the key role of the HRD in promoting the binding of P-TEFb to activated genes to phosphorylate CTD52.What could be the direct target of the HRD on activated genes? Consistent with a previous report that a CYCT1 mutant that lacked the HRD failed to bind the CTD7, wild-type GST\u2013CYCT1 precipitated more Pol II from HeLa nuclear extracts than did GST\u2013CYCT1\u0394HRD (Fig. 2f). Moreover, GST\u2013CTD pulled down P-TEFb containing wild-type CYCT1, but not CYCT1\u0394HRD (Fig. 2g). Finally, a direct and HRD-dependent interaction was detected between a recombinant CYCT1 C-terminal fragment and mCherry\u2013CTD in both the GST pulldown and glycerol gradient formats (Extended Data Fig. 8a, \u200b,b).b). Thus, P-TEFb uses the HRD to directly target the CTD.In addition to P-TEFb, CDK7\u2013 CYCH in TFIIH is also a CTD kinase for Pol II to clear the promoter during transcription initiation1. Unlike CYCT1, CYCH lacks a long C-terminal region and HRD. Compared to CDK9\u2013CYCT1\u2013Flag, affinity-purified CDK7\u2013CYCH\u2013Flag produced a markedly lower level of CTD52 IIo in kinase reactions (Fig. 3a), which was confirmed with recombinant CAK (CDK7\u2013CYCH\u2013MAT1) and P-TEFb (Millipore) in a time-and dosage-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 4a, \u200b,bb).Open in a separate windowFig. 3 |Upon fusion with CYCT1 HRD, CYCH promotes CDK7 hyperphosphorylation of Pol II CTD; DYRK1A also contains a functional HRD to target and hyperphosphorylate CTD.a, b, e, The indicated anti-Flag immunoprecipitates (IP) were tested in kinase reactions as in Fig. 1a. c, The CYCT1 knockdown cells were co-transfected with HIV-1 LTR-luciferase reporter construct and plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. Luciferase activities were measured and analysed as in Fig. 1b. Data are mean \u00b1s.d., n =3. d, Immobilized GST\u2013 CTD52 was incubated with nuclear extract of HeLa cells expressing the indicated proteins. The bound proteins and 2.5% of input were analysed by western blotting. f, Nuclear extract of HeLa cells expressing the indicated proteins and anti-Flag immunoprecipitates from nuclear extract were analysed by western blotting. All western blots are representative of three independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.Appending a CYCT1 C-terminal fragment (amino acids 401\u2013630) containing the HRD to CYCH markedly increased hyperphosphorylation by CDK7 of CTD52 (Fig. 3b), and partially rescued the CYCT1 knockdown to support HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 3c). However, when the HRD was deleted from the CYCH +CYCT1 chimaera, both the production of CTD52 IIo and the rescue of CYCT1 knockdown were mostly abolished (Fig. 3b, \u200b,c),c), which indicates the importance of the HRD to these processes. Consistently, the chimaera, but not wild-type CYCH, was precipitated by GST\u2013CTD (Fig. 3d).We next investigated whether other CTD kinases also use an HRD to target Pol II for hyperphosphorylation. We noticed that the kinase DYRK1A, a CTD kinase that controls transcription of selected growth-related genes6 and that is associated with Down syndrome, also contains an HRD (Fig. 3e). The rest of DYRK1A and CYCT1 are non-homologous. In kinase reactions, wild-type DYRK1A and DYRK1A\u0394HRD autophosphorylated to a similar extent, but only wild-type DYRK1A efficiently hyperphosphorylated CTD52 (Fig. 3e). In a co-immunoprecipitation assay employing three different anti-RPB1 antibodies, wild-type DYRK1A precipitated more Pol II than did DYRK1A\u0394HRD (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4c). The precipitation of DCAF7, which binds DYRK1A N terminus11, was unaffected by DYRK1A\u0394HRD. Thus, in addition to CYCT1, at least one other kinase also requires a functional HRD to efficiently bind and hyper-phosphorylate CTD52.The HRD is a low-complexity domain owing to the overrepresentation of only a single amino acid. This domain, including a central cluster of multiple consecutive histidines, is highly conserved in vertebrate CYCT1 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Using the prediction program IUPred12 (http://iupred.enzim.hu), we found that the human CYCT1 HRD displays the highest disorder tendency in a broader intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that lacks well-defined structure13 and overlaps with the CYCT1 C-terminal region (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Recently, the IDRs\u2014especially those containing a low-complexity domain\u2014have been shown to promote liquid\u2013liquid phase separation, which probably drives the formation of intracellular membrane-less organelles14 for compartmentalized biochemical reactions13.In vitro, phase separation is reversible13 and influenced by several parameters (for example, temperature, ionic strength, post-translational modifications and so on), which enable liquid droplets to form upon reaching a certain threshold and to quickly dissemble when pushed in the opposite direction15. To determine whether T1-IDR (amino acids 462\u2013654)\u2014the longest, HRD-containing CYCT1 IDR\u2014could phase separate in an HRD-dependent manner, we purified the GFP\u2013T1-IDR and GFP\u2013T1-IDR\u0394HRD fusions from Escherichia coli (Extended Data Fig. 5c). At 150 mM NaCl, the protein solutions remained translucent. When lowered to 37.5 mM, a typical concentration used to induce phase separation in vitro16,17, the wild-type GFP\u2013T1-IDR solution immediately turned opaque, whereas GFP\u2013T1-IDR\u0394HRD showed no change (Extended Data Fig. 5e).Under a microscope, wild-type GFP\u2013T1-IDR spontaneously formed micrometre-sized, spherical droplets, whereas GFP\u2013T1-IDR\u0394HRD produced only a low level of irregular aggregates (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the GFP fusion that contained the longest IDR (amino acids 491\u2013686) of DYRK1A also formed droplets in an HRD-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 6). Notably, the GFP\u2013T1-IDR droplets quickly disappeared once NaCl returned to 150 mM (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Furthermore, 1,6-hexanediol, a compound that is known to perturb weak hydrophobic interactions to disassemble structures that exhibit liquid-like properties18,19, completely blocked droplet formation (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Finally, when nine histidines within the histidine cluster in CYCT1 HRD were changed to alanines (Extended Data Fig. 7a), the resulting GFP\u2013T1-IDR(9A) mutant formed only tiny droplets (Fig. 4b), which indicates that the histidines are essential for phase separation. Functionally, the mutation decreased phosphorylation by P-TEFb of CTD52, and the transcriptional activity of P-TEFb (Extended Data Fig. 7c, \u200b,dd).Open in a separate windowFig. 4 |The hyperphosphorylation of CTD by P-TEFb is promoted by CYCT1 IDR, which forms phase-separated droplets and/or speckles in an HRD-dependent manner and recruits the CTD into these compartments.a, b, Solutions containing the indicated proteins at 6 mg ml\u22121 (a) or 2 mg ml\u22121 (b ) were examined with a microscope for fluorescence (GFP) or under white light (bright field). c, HeLa cells expressing wild-type CYCT1\u2013Flag or CYCT1 HRD\u2013Flag were examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody.

Three separate cell nuclei are shown, in which CYCT1 speckles underwent spontaneous fusions as indicated by the arrows. f, Solutions containing GFP\u2013T1-IDR at 3 mg ml\u22121 and/or phosphorylated (phos.) or unphosphorylated (unphos.) mCherry\u2013 CTD at 1.2 mg ml\u22121 were examined under a fluorescence microscope as in a. g, Kinase reactions as in Fig. 1a were performed in the presence of the indicated concentrations of 1,6-hexandiol. p-CTD52 was detected by western blotting. Levels of CYCT1\u2013Flag and its bound CDK9 in each reaction are also shown. h, 1,6-Hexanediol was present at the indicated concentrations in solutions containing 6 mg ml\u22121 wild-type GFP\u2013T1-IDR and 37.5 mM NaCl, which were examined under a fluorescence microscope. i, Immobilized GST\u2013CTD was incubated with recombinant GFP\u2013T1-IDR in reactions containing the indicated concentrations of 1,6-hexandiol. The bait and bound proteins were analysed by western blotting. All western blots are representative of three independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.In cells, both ectopically expressed CYCT1\u2013Flag or eGFP\u2013CYCT1 and endogenous CYCT1 displayed a punctuated staining pattern inside the nuclei (Fig. 4c\u2013e and Extended Data Fig. 5h). This has previously been attributed to the localization of P-TEFb to the nuclear speckles enriched with transcription and splicing factors20,21. Importantly, HRD and its histidine cluster were needed to target CYCT1 to the speckles (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Figs. 5h, \u200b,7e),7e), and the same has also been reported for DYRK1A22. Mirroring its disruption of the GFP\u2013T1-IDR droplets in vitro, 1,6-hexanediol also quickly dissembled the CYCT1 nuclear speckles (Fig. 4d). Finally, when performing time-lapse phase-contrast imaging of cells expressing eGFP\u2013CYCT1, we observed multiple cells in which CYCT1 speckles displayed at least one fusion event within the period of a few minutes, demonstrating their dynamic and liquid-like properties (Fig. 4e).Following previous findings23,24, we asked whether the HRDcontaining IDR could recruit the CTD into phase-separated droplets, given their demonstrated direct interaction. Indeed, although the CTD itself is a low-complexity sequence, recombinant mCherry\u2013CTD23 (Extended Data Fig. 5d) alone did not phase separate, but it was readily incorporated into droplets when incubated together with GFP\u2013T1-IDR (Fig. 4f).During transcription, the CTD is phosphorylated first by CAK in TFIIH and then by P-TEFb1,4,5. Pre-phosphorylation by CAK (Extended Data Fig. 8c) not only enhanced the incorporation of mCherry\u2013CTD into the GFP\u2013T1-IDR droplets, but also promoted phase separation overall by producing bigger and brighter droplets (Fig. 4f). Consistently, the pre-phosphorylated GST\u2013CTD precipitated more GFP\u2013T1-IDR (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Underscoring the physiological relevance of these observations, hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo is known to preferentially localize in the nuclear speckles25.Although both CTD hyperphosphorylation by CDK9 and HRD-mediated droplet formation were largely inhibited by 2.5% 1,6-hexanediol, the HRD\u2013CTD binding (and CDK9\u2013CYCT1 interaction) was not substantially inhibited until 1,6-hexanedil was at 10% (Fig. 4g\u2013i). This important difference suggests that phase separation, which is caused by weak, multivalent interactions among the HRDs and is easily disrupted by 1,6-hexanediol, is critical for the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD. On the other hand, the relatively drug-resistant HRD\u2013CTD binding is probably key to the recruitment of the CTD to CDK9 in droplets, but is insufficient to establish the optimal environment for hyperphosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 9).In summary, our data indicate that in at least two kinases\u2014CYCT1 of P-TEFb and DYRK1A\u2014the HRD, a low-complexity domain of previously unknown function, promotes the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD by targeting the CTD as well as inducing phase separation in vitro and in cells. The phase-separated droplets and speckles compartmentalize the kinase and substrate to enable highly efficient reactions, which results in the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD and robust transcriptional elongation and RNA processing.FUS and TAF15, which are two proteins that contain low-complexity domain and that are active in transcription initiation, have previously been shown to form phase-separated hydrogels that trap the CTD23,24. Additionally, the bidirectionally transcribed enhancers and resulting antisense transcripts have been proposed to control initiation in part through phase separation26. What was unknown until now is whether any transcription factors and the CTD are involved in droplet formation after initiation1. Our finding that phase separation is induced by CYCT1 of P-TEFb (a well-defined transcription elongation factor) and DYRK1A (a probable gene-specific elongation factor6) has expanded the regulatory roles of phase separation to the next stage of the transcription cycle. Furthermore, these studies show that some key ini\\tiation and elongation factors that phase separate should no longer be viewed as passive passengers waiting to be picked up by the CTD. Rather, they have active roles in recruiting Pol II through multivalent interactions to their droplets and/or speckles that function as hubs where much of transcription and RNA processing is dynamically controlled. Extended DataExtended Data Fig. 1 |Open in a separate windowThe CYCT1 HRD-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Pol II CTD52 by affinity-purified CDK9\u2013 CYCT1\u2013Flag dimer can also be detected with anti-phospho-Ser2 antibody.a, Examination of the affinity-purified CDK9\u2013CYCT1\u2013Flag dimer containing wild-type CYCT1\u2013Flag by SDS\u2013PAGE and silver staining. The anti-Flag affinity-purification was performed under high salt plus detergent (1 M KCl + 1% NP-40) conditions to strip away all the P-TEFb-associated factors but keep the CDK9\u2013CYCT1 interaction intact. b, Affinity-purified CDK9\u2013CYCT1\u2013Flag heterodimers containing the indicated CYCT1\u2013Flag proteins were tested in kinase reactions containing a mixture of GST-fused CTD52 and CTD9 as the substrates. The phosphorylated p-CTD52 and p-CTD 9 were detected by western blotting with the anti-phospho-Ser2 antibody 3E10. Although a very similar pattern of CTD phosphorylation was detected with both anti-phospho-Ser2 and anti-phospho-Ser5 antibodies, the unphosphorylated CTD present in the ATP(\u2013) lanes was only detected by the former antibody, making the phospho-Ser5 antibody a preferred choice for detecting CTD phosphorylation in these kinase reactions.Extended Data Fig. 2 |Open in a separate windowThe CYCT1 HRD is required for efficient transcription of human immediate early genes as well as the HSP70\u20131 gene under both basal and heat-shock conditions.a, Confirmation by western blotting of the knockdown of endogenous CYCT1 expression in HEK293T cells expressing the CYCT1 (also known as CCNT1)-specific shRNA (shCYCT1). b, Anti-Flag western blotting analysis of the expression of either wild-type CYCT1\u2013Flag or CYCT1\u0394HRD\u2013Flag from the shCYCT1-resistant plasmid introduced into the knockdown cells.

The levels of the co-precipitated MEPCE, AFF4 and AFF1 were first quantified and then normalized to that of their corresponding CYCT1\u2013Flag bait. The levels of MEPCE, AFF4 and AFF1 bound to low, middle and high levels of CYCT1\u0394HRD\u2013Flag were then divided by those of MEPCE, AFF4 and AFF1 bound to the corresponding levels of wild-type CYCT1\u2013Flag and shown in lanes 5\u20137, with the numbers in lanes 2\u20134 set to 1 as a reference.Extended Data Fig. 3 |Open in a separate windowThe HRD promotes the binding of CYCT1 to activated gene expression array, endogenous genes and the RNA Pol II CTD.a, Estimates of parameters extracted from fitting of FRAP data (top) and parameters calculated from the fitted FRAP data (bottom). b, Model fit overlaid on raw FRAP data.

The input (2.5%) and the bound proteins were analysed by western blotting. b, Binding reactions containing the purified recombinant fusion proteins indicated on the right were analysed in a 7.5 to 20% glycerol gradient containing 500 mM NaCl plus 0.5% NP-40, which was centrifuged at 55,000 r.p.m. and 4 \u00b0C for 13 h. The indicated fractions were analysed by western blotting to detect the distributions of proteins marked on the left. The entire length of the CTD could be bound by varying numbers of IDRs, resulting in the formation of a series of complexes with broad distributions in the gradient. c, mCherry\u2013CTD was incubated with or without immobilized CAK for 6 h in kinase reactions and then analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. d, Immobilized GST\u2013CTD was incubated with (phos.) or without (unphos.)
