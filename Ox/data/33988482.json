Since then,\nthe rapid spread of the virus has led to a global pandemic of COVID-19. As of 3\nFebruary 2021, over 103\u00a0million cases of COVID-19 (in accordance with the\napplied case definitions and testing strategies in the affected countries) have been\nreported, including 2.24\u00a0million deaths. Severe lung disease, characterized\nby \u2018acute respiratory distress syndrome\u2019 (ARDS), and multi-organ\ndysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation\u00a0represent the most\nsevere complications [1]. Myocardial injury is\npresent in more than a quarter of critical cases, manifesting either acutely on\npresentation or more insidiously as illness severity intensifies [2\u20134]. Moreover, COVID-19 shows a\nstrong age gradient in the risk of death [5].\nThe long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. A recent\ncohort study of 1733 patients with confirmed COVID-19, who had been discharged from\nJin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between 7 Jan and 29 May 2020, showed the\nfrequent persistence of fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties and anxiety\nor depression. Patients with more severe disease during hospitalization had\nfunctional and radiographic evidence of pulmonary alterations [6].Multiple variants of the virus that cause COVID-19 are circulating globally. The UK\nB.1.1.7 variant appeared in the fall of 2020, spreading more easily and quickly than\nother variants [7]. In January 2021,\npreliminary evidence was provided that this variant may be also associated with an\nincreased risk of death, but more studies are needed to confirm this finding [8]. The South African 501Y.V2 variant emerged in\nNelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area in early October 2020, then spread quickly to\nbecome the predominant virus lineage in the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces by\nthe end of November 2020. Cases caused by this variant were reported in the USA and\nUnited\u00a0Kingdom at the end of January 2021 [9]. In early January 2021, a variant called P.1 was discovered during\nroutine screenings at an airport in Japan on passengers from Brazil [10]. This variant contains a set of additional\nmutations that may compromise the recognition by antibodies (Abs). Clinical presentationCOVID-19 can present a variety of manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection\nto critical disease (reviewed in [11\u201313]).Although no precise guidelines exist to define grade severity, mild disease is\ndiagnosed as a condition characterized by fever, cough, sore throat and myalgia.\nSome patients have gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and diarrhea [14]. Anosmia and ageusia were initially not\nconsidered but were then realized to manifest in >60% of patients,\nbeing more frequent in women [15].Patients with moderate disease may suffer shortness of breath, presenting 5\u20138\ndays after initial symptom onset, as the first indication of a worsening state\n[16]. Chest radiography confirms lower\nrespiratory tract disease but with a blood oxygen saturation of\n\u226594%\u00a0while the patient is breathing ambient air.Severe disease is characterized by tachypnea, oxygen saturation \u226493%\nand radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates in >50% of the lung\nfield involved within 24\u201348\u00a0h [17].The definition criteria for critical COVID-19 include respiratory rate\n\u226430-times/min, pulse oxygen saturation at rest \u226493%, the\npartial pressure of\nPaO2/FiO2\u00a0\u2264\u00a0300\u00a0mmHg, a\nrequirement for mechanical ventilation and shock [18].ARDS is the main cause of poor prognosis in critically ill patients [19], manifesting in 42% of those with\npneumonia, and 61\u201381% of those requiring intensive care [20]. Classically, ARDS is defined by the\nfollowing criteria: acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; presentation within 1 week\nof worsening respiratory symptoms; bilateral airspace disease on chest x-ray,\ncomputed tomography or ultrasound that is not fully explained by effusions, lobar or\nlung collapse, or nodules; and cardiac failure [21]. Anatomically, there is a damage to the pulmonary capillary\nendothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to inflammatory exudate in the alveoli\nand pulmonary edema. An important feature of COVID-19-associated ARDS is the\noccurrence of increased thrombotic and microvascular complications. Several studies\nhave assessed the circulating and alveolar levels of markers associated with\nendothelial damage and platelet activation in critically and noncritically ill\npatients [22\u201324]. High levels\nof fibrin degradation products, D-dimer, soluble thrombomodulin, von Willebrand\nfactor and PAI-1, and decreased CRP\u00a0were found in critical patients compared\nwith noncritical patients [25]. Mortality was\nsignificantly correlated with von Willebrand factor and soluble thrombomodulin among\nall patients, while high soluble thrombomodulin concentrations were associated with\nlower rates of hospital discharge and a lower likelihood of survival [25]. These data support the view that the early\nidentification and treatment of endotheliopathy could improve outcomes in patients\nwith COVID-19.Altogether these clinical pieces of evidence support the adoption of graded,\ncombinatory therapeutic protocols to control the evolution of symptoms [26]. In the next sections, we summarize the key\npathogenic mechanisms providing a rationale for targeted therapies (Figure\u00a01). We also focus on the rationale\nfor using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, illustrating the current landscape of\nongoing clinical trials.Open in a separate windowFigure 1. Treatment protocol according to the disease stage and\ntarget.The upper panel identifies clinical signs of disease progression. The middle\npanel shows the virus-intrinsic and host-related mechanisms. The lower panel\nshows the graded approach.Mechanisms of infectionCoronavirus particles consist of a helical structure, formed by the association\nbetween nucleocapsid (N) phosphoproteins and the viral genomic RNA, which is\nsurrounded by a lipid bilayer where three or four types of structural proteins\nare inserted: the spike (S), the membrane (M), the envelope (E) proteins and,\nfor some coronaviruses only, the HE\u00a0protein [27]. While the M and E proteins are involved in viral\nassembly, the S protein is the leading mediator of viral entry following\nprocessing by host cell proteases, such as the serine protease\nTMPRSS2\u00a0[28], and subsequent\nbinding to cellular receptors [29].\nSARS-CoV-2 receptors are classified as entry receptors, some being expressed by\ndifferent host cells but others exclusively by a specific cell population, and\nattachment receptors.SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory tract by adhering to components of the\nairway\u2019s epithelia, namely the carbohydrate chains of proteoglycans and\nglycosphingolipids, and then engaging with often multiple, cellular entry\nreceptors [30]. By disrupting the\nmultilayered pulmonary barrier formed by epithelial cells, endothelial cells and\npericytes, SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the circulation and\ninfect/damage other organs including the heart [31,32]. Anchor receptorsThe first target for therapy of COVID-19 is shielding epithelial and endothelial\ncells from the virus contact. The SARS-CoV-2 anchor receptor HSPG, which is\nubiquitously expressed within the proteoglycan-rich glycocalyx layer on the cell\nsurface, allows the virus to make primary contact with permissive cells [33].An association between the HSPG syndecan-1 and the CD147 entry receptor is reportedly\nessential for cyclophilin B-induced activation of p44/42 MAPKs and promotion\nof cell adhesion and chemotaxis [34].\nEvidence indicates that there are heparin-binding sites both within and outside of\nthe receptor-binding domain (RBD) on S-protein [35,36]. Heparan sulfate-binding\nsites are thought to reduce the specificity of the receptor required for cell entry.\nMoreover, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to HSPG may stabilize the open conformation of\nthe S protein, thereby promoting binding to the ACE2, which can only occur in the\nopen conformation [36,37].Inhibition of the virus anchoringMedications directed at HSPG may be valuable as a potential treatment for\nCOVID-19 [38]. Heparin has recently been\nshown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection of permissible cells by inducing\nconformational changes of the S protein and competing with HSPG anchors [39\u201344]. Heparin\nis an anticoagulant that leads to bleeding risk in patients [45]. Therefore, researchers are focusing on\nsafer HSPG competitors.Lactoferrin is an 80-kDa iron-binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family,\nfound in secretions such as milk, sputum, lung surfactant, and present in\nneutrophil granules. It is used for treating stomach and intestinal ulcers and\ndiarrhea and has broad antiviral properties [46\u201349]. Interestingly, lactoferrin has\nbeen shown to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the S protein\nheparin-binding domains to a similar degree as heparin, without showing the\nanticoagulant adverse effects [50].\nIn vitro studies, showed that lactoferrin can inhibit viral\ninfection in the early stages and is effective against SARS-CoV-2 in the\npost-infection phase. Furthermore, lactoferrin possesses immunomodulatory and\nanti-inflammatory effects [51]\nConsidering the protein is available as a supplement, this would be an easy\noption to administer within the community and may be specifically suited to\nthose in care homes. A recent trial of oral and intranasal administration of\nlactoferrin was conducted in 32 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms\n[52]. The goal was to test the\nefficacy in improving symptoms and eliminating the virus. A dose of\n1\u00a0g\u00a0of liposomal apo-lactoferrin in ten capsules per day was\nadministered orally for 30\u00a0days, in addition to the same form\nadministered nasally three-times per day. All patients showed improvement in\nsymptoms except fatigue, which continued in about a third of the group. Of note,\nthe authors reported a decrease in D-dimer concentration, which is a biomarker\nof the severe outcome. Conventional & unconventional entry receptorsThe widely expressed SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, belongs to a family of dipeptidyl\ncarboxydipeptidases and has considerable homology to ACE [53]. Both enzymes are located on the plasma membranes of\nvarious cell types, including epithelial cells of the lung, vascular endothelial\ncells and pericytes, and their balance is essential to the maintenance of\nepithelial-vascular homeostasis [54,55].ACE generates the vasoconstrictor and profibrotic\u00a0Ang II, and degrades\nvasodilator BK\u00a0into the pro-inflammatory metabolite [des-Arg9] BK.\nConversely, ACE2 cleaves Ang II into the vasodilator Ang 1\u20137 peptide and\ndegrades the ACE-generated [des-Arg9] BK peptide. The binding of\nSARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2 is detrimental in two ways, by allowing the virus to\nenter the cell and by causing ACE2 internalization/degradation, leaving the\nACE-related peptide pathway unopposed and [des-Arg9] BK undegraded. The ensuing\ndamage of the pulmonary epithelial-vascular barrier manifests in the form of\nvascular extravasation, lung congestion\u00a0and typical acute respiratory\nsyndrome as well as the systemic spread of the virus. Therefore, ACE2 has been\nconsidered a pivotal target for treatment.Basigin/CD147, a plasma membrane protein associated with oligomannosidic\nglycans, has emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [56]. It was found initially to be expressed in both lung\nepithelium and in immune cells [57],\nalthough, interestingly, in CD147-transfected HEK 293 cells, the S protein was not\nshown to bind [58]. The binding of S protein\nto CD147 may necessitate the recruitment of coreceptors present in the cells that\nconstitutively express CD147. The best characterized binding partners of CD147 are\nmonocarboxylate transporters (a family of molecules involved in lactate,\npyruvate\u00a0and ketone flux across the plasma membrane), caveolin-1, CD98,\n\u03b21 integrin and CD44 (a major receptor for hyaluronan) [59].Inhibition of the virus entry receptors, processing protease\u00a0&\ndownstream mechanismsRecombinant ACE2 has been used as a virus interceptor to reduce the SARS-CoV-2\ninfection in cardiovascular organoids [60] and is now investigated in a pilot trial as a treatment for patients\nwith severe COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov no.: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04287686\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04287686\"}}NCT04287686). ACE2-blocking Abs\nhave been also proposed as a treatment [61]. Nonetheless, ACE2-based approaches could be insufficient\nbecause of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to use alternative pathways to enter human\ncells.An open-label, clinical trial of meplazumab \u2013 a humanized monoclonal Ab\nagainst the CD147 receptor\u00a0\u2013 showed clinical improvements in\nCOVID-19 patients [62]. Potent individual\nAbs that simultaneously bind the RBD of the S protein provide an ideal solution\nto decrease the potential for virus escape mutants arising due to the selective\npressure from a single-Ab administration or vaccination [63,64].Combinatory blocking strategies may be considered, after the assessment of\nefficacy with a single blockade. Weinreich et al. reported the\ninterim results of a trial in patients with early infection, combining two\nmonoclonal Abs, casirivimab and imdevimab (together called REGN-COV2), raised\nagainst the S protein [65]. The patients\nwere randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single intravenous infusion\nof either 2.4 g\u00a0or 8\u00a0g of REGN-COV2 or placebo. In the first 275\npatients, those who received either dose of REGN-COV2 had lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nlevels than those who received placebo. A small number of patients (12) required\na medically attended visit within the 29-day follow-up period, with a larger\npercentage in the placebo group. The US FDA has issued an emergency use\nauthorization for REGN-COV2 to be administered for the treatment of mild to\nmoderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients.Another trial conducted by Chen et al. [65,66]\u00a0evaluated three doses (700, 2800 and 7000\u00a0mg) of a\nsingle monoclonal Ab, bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555), which was administered to 452\noutpatients. Bamlanivimab was associated with a greater reduction in symptoms of\nCOVID-19 than was placebo. An extension of the clinical trial is enrolling\npatients who will receive a combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab\n(LY3832479) to overcome or prevent Ab resistance (ClinicalTrials.gov no.:\n{\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04427501\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04427501\"}}NCT04427501).Broadly neutralizing Abs\u00a0represent an attractive opportunity for\ntherapeutic drug stockpiling to prevent or mitigate future outbreaks of\nSARS-CoVs. An important study used a directed evolution approach to engineer\nthree SARS-CoV-2 Abs for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. The\nvariant ADG-2 showed a strong binding activity to a large panel of sarbecovirus\nRBDs and neutralized representative epidemic sarbecoviruses with high potency\n[67]. Operation Warp Speed and the\nNational Institutes of Health have the plan to compare several Abs for treatment\nin their ACTIV-2 trial involving outpatients with COVID-19 ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04518410\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04518410\"}}NCT04518410).The protease inhibitors lopinavir, ritonavir and camostat mesylate have been used\nwith the aim to block the activation of S protein by inhibiting the protease\nTMPRSS2. In order to promote the clinical use of these potential drugs, WHO and\nthe EU have promoted new clinical trials testing the efficacy of drug\nassociations including protease inhibitors, such as the SOLIDARITY Trial\n({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04321616\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04321616\"}}NCT04321616) and the DisCoVeRy Trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04315948\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04315948\"}}NCT04315948).A fascinating feature of SARS-CoV-2 is that it could use the S protein not only\nas a passe-partout to enter cells but also as a signaling ligand to activate\nintracellular pathways, ERK1/2 among the others, instrumental to\nreplication and evasion of host\u2019s defense. Blocking the S protein with\navailable Abs or interfering with ERK1/2 with inhibitors could be viable\nways to suppress the initial steps of cell damage [68]. In line with this, pharmacological inhibition of\nERK1/2 or gene knockdown using small interfering RNAs-suppressed\ncoronavirus replication [68,69]. We presented in vitro\nevidence that the S protein alone can elicit functional alterations in pericytes\nfrom the human heart, reducing their angiogenic activity and inducing the\nsecretion of pro-inflammatory and -apoptotic factors. These adverse phenomena\ncould be mediated by the S protein interaction with CD147, as neutralization of\nthis receptor by a blocking Ab prevented them [70]. Therefore, the use of receptor entry blocker may exert multiple\nbenefits, reducing the intracellular viral load, viral replication and dampening\nearly inflammatory response. Interventions that block COVID-19 at the early\nstage could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, the number of\nhospitalizations, and the burden on healthcare systems [71]. Viral replicationCoronaviruses express and replicate their genomic RNA to produce full-length copies\nthat are incorporated into new viral particles (reviewed in [72]). Coronaviruses possess remarkably large RNA genomes that\ncontain cis-acting secondary RNA structures essential for RNA synthesis. At the\n5\u2032 end, two large open reading frames (ORFs; ORF1a and ORF1b) occupy a large\npart of the capped and polyadenylated genome. ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural\nproteins that are instrumental for viral replication and the transcription complex\nthat includes RNA-processing and -modifying enzymes and an RNA proofreading function\nnecessary for maintaining the integrity of the coronavirus genome.Antiviral therapyBecause viral replication is active early during COVID-19, antiviral therapy may\nexert the greatest benefit before the disease progresses into the\nhyperinflammatory state of severe disease. Remdesivir, an inhibitor of the viral\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase was identified as a promising therapeutic candidate\nfor COVID-19 because of its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in\nvitro [73]. Moreover, the\ndrug reduced lung virus levels and lung damage in nonhuman primate studies after\ninoculation with Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV1 [74]. Currently, remdesivir is the only FDA-approved\nantiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. A double-blind, randomized,\nplacebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were\nhospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection\nwas superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery [75].Hydroxychloroquine has antiviral effects in vitro, and, in\nassociation with azithromycin, seemingly decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral load in a\nsmall, nonrandomized study [76]. However,\na randomized trial of 504 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 demonstrated\nthat the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve\nthe clinical status as compared with standard care [77]. Therefore, the current guidelines recommend against\nthe use of this treatment.AntibioticsEmerging data regarding bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 pneumonia suggest\nan association between the detection of bacterial products in blood and disease\nseverity [78]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics\nare indicated in these patients with COVID-19 with suspected or confirmed\nbacterial superinfection [79]. Inflammation & immune responseThe host immune response of SARS-CoV-2 has been a subject of intense\ninvestigation\u00a0(reviewed in [80,81]). The humoral response involves the\ncharacteristic IgG and IgM production, starting with Abs against the high\nimmunogenic N protein, while anti-S protein Abs could be detected after\n4\u20138\u00a0days from the appearance of initial symptoms [82]. It was reported that a robust Ab response\nmay be associated with disease severity while a weak response is associated with the\nelimination of the virus [83].SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs interferon responses and suppresses antigen presentation\non both MHC class I and class II, thereby evading the innate immune cells response\n[84]. The infiltration of\nmonocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and adaptive immune cells leads to\nincreased pro-inflammatory cytokines [85]. A\ndecrease in the innate antiviral response together with hyperinflammation\u00a0and\ndysfunction of effector and regulatory T cells\u00a0characterizes the immune\nprofile of patients with severe COVID-19 [86,87] However, there are also\narguments about the concept of COVID-19-related cytokine storm syndrome (COVID-CSS)\n[88,89]. These criticisms argue that the definition of COVID-CSS is vague,\nlevels of IL-6 (a hallmark of the syndrome) are often low, and some COVID-19\npatients have a hypoinflammatory vasculopathy rather than a hyperinflammatory\nhypercytokinemia syndrome [90]. In order to\nreconcile these disparities and guide therapeutic decisions, the following criteria\nhave been proposed to identify patients with COVID-CSS: pneumonia requiring\nmechanical ventilation, fever (maximum temperature >38\u00b0C), CRP\n>100\u00a0mg l-1\u00a0and peak serum ferritin\n>1000\u00a0\u03bcg l-1 [91]. Patients meeting these criteria had also markedly elevated research\nserum IL-6 levels, although not always correlated with CRP or ferritin [92].Convalescent plasmaConvalescent plasma has been used for the treatment of infectious diseases for\nmore than a century, the rationale being that passive immunization can help to\nlimit the disease severity. To date, it is considered the standard treatment of\nArgentine hemorrhagic fever, but conclusive data in SARS, Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome, influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza (H5N1),\nEbola\u00a0and eventually COVID-19 are lacking. A trial of 228 patients with\nsevere COVID-19 showed no significant differences in clinical status or overall\nmortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who\nreceived placebo [93]. Similar\nconclusions were reached in another trial where the convalescent plasma was\nadministered to patients with moderate COVID-19 to halt the progression to\nsevere disease [94]. In January 2021, the\nRECOVERY trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04381936\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04381936\"}}NCT04381936) independent Data Monitoring Committee announced\nthat the study investigating the potential benefits of receiving convalescent\nplasma has stopped assigning people to receive this treatment after an early\nanalysis showed that overall it did not help to reduce deaths. They also decided\nto continue the recruitment to the tocilizumab treatment arm, and to the other\nongoing comparisons \u2013 aspirin, colchicine and Regeneron\u2019s Ab\ncocktail.Cytokine inhibitorsThe recognition of a state of hypercytokinemia in severe COVID-19 represents a\nrationale for immunomodulatory and cytokine-inhibitor therapy [95].The COVACTA RCT ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04320615\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04320615\"}}NCT04320615) compared tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal Ab\nthat blocks IL-6 from binding to receptors, and placebo in COVID-19 reported no\ndifference in the primary outcomes (clinical status and mortality), although a\npost hoc subanalysis of patients requiring high-flow oxygen by nasal cannula\nshowed an improved clinical status at day 14 [96].The EMPACTA (Evaluating Minority Patients with Actemra, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04372186\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04372186\"}}NCT04372186)\nplacebo-controlled trial demonstrated that tocilizumab could reduce the risk of\nprogression to mechanical ventilation or death among patients receiving low-flow\noxygen, but again the active treatment did not improve 28-day survival [97].The REMAP-CAP (Randomised, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02735707\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02735707\"}}NCT02735707) trial found tocilizumab was effective\nin decreasing inhospital mortality compared with standard care\n(28%\u00a0vs 35.8%, adjusted odds ratio for survival 1.64,\n95% CI: 1.14\u20132.35) and progression to intubation, extracorporeal\nmembrane oxygenation\u00a0or death [98].Conversely, Veiga et al. reported an increased death rate at day\n15 in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with placebo (17% vs\n3%, odds ratio 6.42, 95% CI: 1.59\u201343.2), a result that\nrequired an early stop of the trial [99].\nThe reasons for these different outcomes remain unknown.Altogether, the results of recent trials remain contradictory, possibly because\nof the wide heterogeneity of inflammatory markers and difficulty to decipher the\npatient\u2019s phenotype that may benefit from immunomodulation.CorticosteroidsCorticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DXM) have been proposed as a potential\nmeans to control the complications associated with the cytokine storm.In the RECOVERY trial, [100] DXM reduced\nthe incidence of death in the group of patients receiving invasive mechanical\nventilation (29.3% vs 41.4% in controls) and to a lesser extent in\nthose receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs\n26.2% in controls). The data also indicated that DXM might increase\nmortality in hospitalized patients who were not receiving oxygen [100].A meta-analysis of clinical trials of DXM in patients with severe COVID-19\nconfirmed that the active treatment with corticosteroids was associated with\nlower 28-day all-cause mortality compared with usual care or placebo [101]. This meta-analysis comprises pooled\ndata from seven randomized clinical trials of corticosteroids in critically ill\npatients with COVID-19. The reported mortality was 32.7% in the\ncorticosteroids group and 41.5%\u00a0in controls. The results were\nheavily affected by the RECOVERY trial, whose participants represented\n59% of total trialed subjects who were included in the meta-analysis.These landmark trials have informed subsequent practice guidelines for\nhospitalized patients on supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation [102]. Nonetheless, a significant number of\npatients were unresponsive to DXM and serious adverse events were reported in\nsix of the seven trials of the above meta-analysis, occurring in 18.1% of\nthe patients randomized to corticosteroids and in 23.4% of the patients\nrandomized to usual care or placebo [101].There are also concerns that, by hindering B cell-mediated Ab production and\ninterfering with the protective function of T cells and macrophage-mediated\nclearance of apoptotic cells, DXM treatment can result in a higher plasma viral\nload and an increased risk of secondary infections [103,104].\nTherefore, additional therapeutic approaches should be considered for the\ntreatment of patients with severe COVID-19. For instance, it was suggested that\nfuture studies may include remdesivir, which was not part of the RECOVERY trial\n[105].Mesenchymal stem cellsThe term MSC was officially introduced more than 25\u00a0years ago to represent\na class of cells from human and mammalian bone marrow and periosteum, that could\nbe isolated and expanded in culture while maintaining the capacity of\nmultilineage differentiation [106,107]. This minimal definition, however,\ndoes not reflect the diversity and functional pleiotropism of different MSC\npopulations. MSCs from the stroma of different tissues, like the bone marrow,\nadipose tissue\u00a0and the perivascular niche of solid organs, may share a\ncommon antigenic phenotype but are also characterized by heterogeneous profiles\n[108].Previous therapeutic applications of MSCs More than 1050 clinical trials are registered at FDA.gov that explore MSCs\nfor many clinical applications including neurodegenerative and cardiac\ndisorders, perianal fistulas, Crohn\u2019s disease, graft-versus-host\ndisease, diabetic nephropathy, and organ fibrosis.About 300 clinical trials using MSCs have been completed as of 2020. Results\nsuggest that the benefit is heterogeneous depending on the modality and\npurity of the cell preparation and the characteristics of target pathology.\nThe TiGenix/Takeda Phase III clinical trial studying the use of an\nMSC product (alofisel) for complex perianal fistulas in patients with\nCrohn\u2019s disease represents the most successful late-stage MSC trial\nto date ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01541579\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01541579\"}}NCT01541579) [109]. In\naddition to alofisel, there are ten\u00a0globally approved MSC therapies\nwith various indications including cardiovascular disease (reviewed in\n[110]). Systematic meta-analyses\nof trials conducted in patients with myocardial infarction and chronic heart\nfailure showed MSC therapy may improve ventricular function but does not\nreduce mortality [111,112].Immunological properties & entry receptor expression The benefit of MSC-based therapies can be reconducted to the paracrine\ninduction of cell repair and the rebalancing of immune cell response in\ninjured or inflamed tissues. Recent review articles have summarized the\nlatest research in the immunological properties of MSCs, their use as\nimmunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory/antimicrobial agents,\nmethods to customize their immunological profile and their use as vehicles\nfor transferring therapeutic agents [113,114].Figure\u00a02 illustrates key features\nof the MSCs\u2019 capacity to modulate innate and adaptive immunity (also\nreviewed in [115]). Moreover, MSCs\ncan enhance pathogen engulfment by endocytosis and phagocytosis\nin\u00a0macrophages [116] as well\nas improve killing ability in most of these cells. Another important point\nis the MSC-induced enhancement of efferocytosis of apoptotic or infected\ncells, which would be extremely important during infection [117].Open in a separate windowFigure 2. Mesenchymal stem cells modulate both innate &\nadaptive immune cells.MSCs directly regulate immune cells and this regulation can be\ninfluenced by the inflammatory milieu of the host tissue. The\nimmunoregulatory activity of MSCs is exerted mainly via paracrine\nrecruitment and activation of cells from both the innate and\nadaptive immune systems. Innate: inhibition of NEU and DCs\nproliferation, NK proliferation and cytotoxic activity, and\nfacilitation of monocytes and macrophages M1\u2013M2 transition.\nAdaptive: inhibition of Th1 and Th17 and promotion of Treg\nproduction, inhibition of B cells via the regulatory Breg. Moreover,\nMSCs have an additional indirect influence on T and B cells.DC: Dendritic cell;\u00a0EV: Extracellular vesicle;\u00a0MSC:\nMesenchymal stem cell; NEU: Neutrophil; NK: Natural killer.Noteworthy, another advantage of MSCs is that they do not express the ACE-2\nreceptor and the priming enzyme that allow SARS-CoV-2 engagement and entry\n[118]. Cultured MSCs from\ndifferent tissues were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild strain without evidence of\ncytopathic effects; moreover, under in vitro challenges\nwith the virus, the conditioned medium did not contain viral particles\n[118]. The lack of ACE2 and\nTMPRSS expression was also interpreted as a key element for the reported\nclinical success of an MSC therapy trial, described in more detail below, in\nseven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [119]. Yet, it should be noted that no direct evidence has been\nprovided so far that MSCs are resistant to infection or maintain an intact\nfunctional activity when challenged with the infectious agent in the\npatient\u2019s body.Preclinical studies using MSC therapy in ARDS A review from Xiao and colleagues illustrated the results of preclinical\nresearch on MSC therapy in models of ARDS and acute lung\ninjury\u00a0[120]. In the\nH9N2-infected mouse model, MSC treatment increased the survival rate and\ndecreased lung edema and signs of acute lung injury compared with those of\nthe placebo group [121]. Moreover,\ncell therapy with MSCs improved gas exchange and reduced the levels of\nalveolar chemokines and cytokines [121].Likewise, MSCs were effective in treating an H1N1-infected pig model,\nreducing viral shedding in nasal swabs and viral replication in the lungs,\nand lowering the release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1\nand CXC chemokine ligand 10 [122].\nRogers et al. reported the results of studies in animal\nmodels and ex vivo human lung models showing the\nMSC\u2019s capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen\nimmune responses and improve alveolar fluid clearance [114].Clinical studies using MSC therapy in ARDS There have been recent notable studies evaluating the efficacy of MSCs for\nthe treatment of ARDS. The START study was a Phase I pilot trial\n({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01775774\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01775774\"}}NCT01775774) [123], now extended to\nPhase IIa ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02097641\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02097641\"}}NCT02097641). In the Phase I trial, patients were followed daily\nfor adverse events through day 28, death or hospital discharge, whichever\noccurs first. Vital status was collected at 6 and 12\u00a0months after\nstudy enrolment. The Phase IIa was a prospective, double-blind, multicenter,\nrandomized trial, comparing a single intravenous dose of cryopreserved bone\nmarrow-derived MSCs of (10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\ncells/kg) with placebo in patients with moderate to severe ARDS\n[124]. The benefit was only\nmarginal, mainly consisting of a reported trend of improved oxygenation in\nthe MSC group.These findings were in sharp contrast with the results of a clinical study\nthat examined the performance of menstrual blood-derived MSCs for the\ntreatment of 17 critically ill patients with H7N9 influenza induced ARDS\n[125]. In this case, patients\nreceived either three or four infusions of\n1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells/kg. The MSC group\nbenefitted a remarkably improved survival outcome (54.5% vs\n17.6%), with no long-term adverse events being noted. It is not clear\nwhether the difference could be attributed to the methods of preparation and\nstorage (cryopreservation) or the modality of single or repeated injections.\nIt should be noted that studies of this group size are not suited for a\ndefinitive conclusion on efficacy.A systematic literature review and random-effects meta-analysis reported the\npotential value of MSC therapy in ARDS [126]. MSCs were intravenously or intratracheally administered in\n117 participants, who were followed for 14\u00a0days to 5\u00a0years.\nAll MSCs were allogeneic from bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood,\nadipose tissue or unreported sources. No related serious adverse events were\nreported. Although favorable trends were observed, neither mortality nor\nfunctional and biochemical markers were significantly improved by the active\ntreatment.Initial studies of MSC therapy in critical patients with COVID-19 MSCs have been recently trialed for the treatment of severe COVID-19, the\nmain indication being critically patients with the manifestation of ARDS\n(reviewed in [127,128]).Small-size trials of MSCs for critically ill COVID-19 patients have been\ninitially conducted in China. A single-center open-label pilot study used\nMSCs, of an undefined source, to treat seven patients with ARDS in a Beijing\nHospital [119]. The disease severity\nvaried among the seven patients studied and only one required mechanical\nventilation. All patients receiving MSCs showed clinical improvement after\n2\u00a0days, and three were discharged from the hospital after\n10\u00a0days. The authors reported remarkable improvements in inflammatory\nmarkers and in the immune cell repertoire, especially Treg and dendritic\ncells, in treated patients.A second anecdotical report covered the case of a 65-year-old woman in China\ntreated with three doses of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\numbilical cord-derived MSCs. The patient manifested significant clinical\nimprovement, resulting in the cessation of mechanical ventilation, after the\nsecond dose, which was matched by a reduction of pneumonia detected in chest\nCT scans [129].These results led to an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA [127]. Conversely, both the\nInternational Society for Cellular and Gene Therapies and the International\nSociety for Extracellular Vesicles do not endorse cell products or their\nsubcellular derivatives for any purpose in COVID-19, including but not\nlimited to reducing cytokine storm, exerting regenerative effects or\ndelivering drugs [130].Recent trials of MSC in critical patients with COVID-19 In September 2020, 69 clinical trials utilizing MSCs for the treatment of\nCOVID-19 were registered on the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry\nPlatform [131]. At the time of this\nreview article compilation, a search of the same Registry Platform revealed\nthe number of studies has increased to 103 (Supplementary Table 1). Of these, 49 studies were\neffectively recruiting, while the remaining 54 were inactive, having been\napproved but not started yet.As shown in Figure\u00a03, most trials\nare from China (30) followed by the USA (19), Iran (14), Spain (12), Mexico\n(three) and Brazil (three). Notably, other European countries contributed\nwith only five studies, of which only two are actively recruiting.\nConsidering the declared patient target, the whole 103 studies encompass a\npopulation of 4366 patients (mean, 42.3 patient per study), of which 2119 in\nthose that are effectively recruiting (mean, 43.2). In addition, only seven\nstudies have a plan to recruit >100 patients and 30 do not include a\ncontrol group.Open in a separate windowFigure 3. Distribution of clinical trials using mesenchymal stem\ncells in the world.Only countries with two trials or more are shown.In relation to the tissue of origin for the derivation of MSCs, we could\nconfirm the distribution reported by others in September [131]. Only five trials are\ninvestigating MSCs from the bone marrow, the preferred tissue source for\nother clinical uses. Cord-derived MSCs (including from Wharton\u2019s\nJelly) are the most common source with 37 trials, followed by 15 from\nadipose tissue, five from dental pulp and four from the placenta, while 18\nwere using MSCs of undefined origin. A few trials employ either\nMSC-conditioned media or vesicles/exosomes, which are acknowledged to\nexert similar immunomodulatory and reparative activities of the cells from\nwhich they are derived [132\u2013134].Personal considerations on current trial methodology In a critical situation like the current pandemic, all possible solutions\nwith the potential to alleviate the consequences of COVID-19 merit\nconsideration. It is currently premature to draw conclusions about the\nefficacy and safety of MSC trials as most of them are still ongoing. The\ncurrent challenge in COVID-19 therapeutics, including MSC therapy, is the\nquality of trial studies, the imbalance of their subjects, and the quality\nand robustness of preliminary reports [135].A view of Supplementary Table 1 summarizing MSC trials clearly\nindicates that these studies differ greatly from each other about\npreparation, dosage (from a few million to a hundred million),\nadministration schedule (single or repeated dosage) and the best combination\nwith other anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, there is a large variation\non primary end points. Ten out of the 49 trials currently recruiting\nparticipants have safety as a primary end point, alone or in combination\nwith efficacy. Thirteen (of which 11 are controlled trials) focus on\nmortality. The remaining trials\u00a0assess softer end points such as\nclinically, laboratory or imaging data (mainly blood oxygen saturation and\nCT scan of the lungs).The current scenario does not differ from the typical stem cell therapy\nlandscape: a plethora of small size trials that are unlikely to provide\ndefinitive conclusions, due to the diversity of cell source, dosages and\nprotocols of administration. Unfortunately, these drawbacks can also\npreclude the applicability of meta-analyses (often incorrectly employed with\nthe hope to amend the initial errors), due to concerns regarding statistical\npower and confusion from two major sources of variation: pitfalls in trial\ndesign and inconsistencies in reporting and interpreting trial results.In addition, in the authors\u2019 opinion, several caveats reduce the\nenthusiasm for the cell therapy approach. First, unless MSC-based therapy\ndemonstrates to be effective in patients unresponsive to DXM,\ncorticosteroids remain formidable competitors due to the much lower cost and\nmore flexible dosage. Second, no biomarker exists to predict the safety and\nefficacy of MSCs in COVID-19. The cytokine storm profile differs among\npatients affected by severe COVID-19, this being, as mentioned above, a\nburden also for the proper use of cytokine-targeting inhibitors [136]. Third, after intravenous\ninjection, MSCs are captured in the capillary bed of the lungs. Here, they\nare supposed to reduce inflammation and restore endothelial integrity [137], yet this mechanism may be\ndysfunctional in COVID-19 patients with ARDS due to the severe microvascular\ndamage favoring clotting of infused cells. In fact, one of the few\nidentified complications is the risk of MSC therapy-induced thrombosis,\nreported in several patients before the insurgence of COVID-19 [138\u2013140]. A recent\nclinical trial showed that intravenous infusion of allogeneic adipose\ntissue-derived MSCs exerted mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory as well as\nprocoagulant effects during human endotoxemia [141]. The procoagulant activity of MSCs was associated\nwith a mechanism involving phosphatidylserine and tissue factor, which\nrequires further analysis to avoid adverse effects of MSC therapy in\npatients with a risk of thrombosis [142]. Finally, while ARDS remains the main clinical indication\nfor the cellular approach, there is no experimental evidence that supports\nthe utilization of MSCs for the treatment of cardiac complications of\nCOVID-19, an extended application that might be instigated by previous\nexperience of cell therapy in patients with myocardial infarction or heart\nfailure [143].Commercial MSC trials for COVID-19 Cell therapies are advanced therapy medicinal products. Their development\naccording to the highest quality standards and needs for off-the-shelf\ndeployment is preferentially achieved through a commercial route. Therefore,\nan overview of MSC trials conducted by companies may help to gauge the\nvalidity of this approach.Several companies are repurposing their MSC products for therapeutic use in\nCOVID-19. For example, Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq: MESO; ASX: MSB), a global\nleader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, has\nrecently proposed the use of ryoncil\u00ae (remestemcel-L) to\ntreat patients with moderate to severe ARDS. The compound is currently under\npriority review by the FDA for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host\ndisease. Pilot data indicate that survival rate was 83% in\nventilator-dependent COVID-19 patients when treated with two intravenous\ninfusions of remestemcel-L, whereas the survival rate was only 12% in\nthose receiving standard of care during the same period. Remestemcel-L is\nbelieved to counteract the pathological process by downregulating the\nproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the production of\nanti-inflammatory cytokines.To confirm these pilot data, Mesoblast has launched a Phase III randomized\ncontrolled trial ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT04371393\",\"term_id\":\"NCT04371393\"}}NCT04371393) of up to 300 ventilator-dependent adults with\nmoderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS. The dosing regimen in Phase III is the\nsame as in the pilot trial and the end point is the reduction in mortality.\nThe Data Safety Monitoring Board will perform an interim analysis of the\ntrial\u2019s primary end point of all-cause mortality within\n30\u00a0days of randomization. Further interim analysis is planned after\n60% of the trial has been enrolled.It is not surprising that leading companies are pursuing an accelerated\napproval pathway for their advanced cell products. They have already robust\nmanufacturing and quality control data, preclinical evidence of safety and\nefficacy, and an adequate budget for preclinical and clinical\nexperimentation. Their return is potentially massive and commensurate to the\npandemic impact of COVID-19. It is estimated that 25% of hospitalized\npatients require intensive treatment and 1% develop severe COVID-19.\nProjected to the total number of cases and considering a US $4000 cost for a\nsingle MSC treatment, the total cost to treat previous cases would have been\nequivalent to $2320 billion. ConclusionAs massive vaccination programs against SARS-CoV-2 are now ongoing, the open question\nis how to manage newly infected patients suffering from COVID-19 and whether\nimmunization will be sufficient to eradicate the problem. It is, therefore, crucial\nto implement different treatments and refine current guidelines according to the\nseverity and stage of the disease. While the pilot studies showed a promising stance\nfor some of these products, large and well-designed trials are warranted. In\naddition, preclinical research in cellular and animal models should define a\nstronger rationale in support of clinical experimentation. Additional investigation\nis also needed on biomarkers guiding the choice of anti-inflammatory and\nimmunomodulatory drugs. Future perspectiveThere are important lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. The first lesson is that the\ncoronavirus does not respect national boundaries. Therefore, everyone in the\nscientific community bears great responsibility for collaborating and sharing\nresults, with great attention to the ethics and robustness of the provided\nevidence.On the one hand, we need that data are collected and analyzed rapidly. On the other\nhand, it is crucial that researchers take primary responsibility for the production\nand use of knowledge making sure about the quality of basic, translational, and\nclinical studies and related reports. This review contains many references that are\npreprint articles, which have not received regular scrutiny through referees\u2019\nevaluation. Readers need to be aware of the limitations of this new method to\ncommunicate the results. These challenges are highlighted by a recent article\nillustrating how the health research system may have to deal with the inevitable\nimperfections of rapid scientific reporting in the current and future crises [144].The second lesson has medical, commercial and governmental implications. It regards\nthe pressing need for global-readiness programs aiming to develop treatments and\nvaccines that can mitigate future viral pandemics [145]. Developing novel antiviral agents including blocking Abs,\nantiviral drugs and vaccines is financially costly. Creating vaccines, especially\nunder the pressure of an acute health emergency, has not proved very rewarding in\nthe past, meaning pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant in investing their\nbudgets in such long-term programs. Therefore, governments should continue to invest\nin pandemic strategies the same way they do now in defense. In the USA alone, deaths\ndue to SARS-CoV-2 have reached today (3 February 2021) 447,000, a figure that\nsurpasses the 405,399 losses that occurred during World War II. Academic\ninstitutions should participate and/or lead these global-preparedness\nendeavors. Repurposing clinically available drugs, as exemplified by the use of\ncorticosteroids in COVID-19, could be cost/benefit advantageous.The third lesson is that COVID-19 has prompted a remarkable change in medical\npractice, providing the battlefield for a new army of doctors and nurses to nurture\nexperience in capturing critical needs in real-time selecting options from a growing\narmamentarium of approved medicines and support devices. In the future, machine\nlearning technologies could be harnessed to help to integrate scientific and medical\nknowledge into rapid diagnostic flowcharts and personalized treatments.Executive summaryEpidemiology & emergence of new variantsAs of 3 February 2021, over 103 million cases of COVID-19 have been\nreported, including 2.24 million deaths. Severe lung disease\ncharacterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome\u00a0(ARDS)\nrepresents the most severe complication. Multiple variants of the\nvirus that causes COVID-19 are emerging globally.Clinical presentationCOVID-19 can present a variety of manifestations ranging from\nasymptomatic infection to critical disease. No precise guidelines\nfor classification have been established, although the current\ndefinition refers to mild, moderate and critical disease with or\nwithout ARDS. Treatment protocols follow this classification as well\nas what is known about target pathogenic mechanisms during disease\nprogression. The S protein is the leading mediator of viral entry\nfollowing processing by host cell protease.Anchor receptorsThe first target for therapy of COVID-19 is shielding epithelial and\nendothelial cells from the virus contact.Conventional & unconventional entry receptorsThe second target is to interfere with entry receptor engagement.Viral replicationThe third target is to use antiviral agents to inhibit viral\nreplication together with antibiotics if superinfection occurs.Inflammation & immune responseAnti-inflammatory therapy and immunomodulatory drugs are indicated in\nsevere disease to combat the state of hyperinflammation and cytokine\nstorm together with evasion of the immune response. Different\napproaches include the use of convalescent plasma, cytokine\ninhibitors, steroids and immunomodulatory stem cells. The latter\nhave been trialed in small studies and now examined in patients with\nARDS. Pharmaceutical companies have repurposed their approved cell\nproducts to this clinical application.ConclusionThe massive vaccination campaign will not resolve the problem\nentirely and the above approaches need to be further refined and\nincorporated in an approved protocol.Future perspectiveWe have learned lessons that will inform future decisions at the\nlevel of research, communication and readiness plans to face new\nemergencies.
