This escalating feedback loop provides novel targets and therapeutic strategies for the prevention of preterm labor and its consequences. Preterm birth (<37 wk gestation), which afflicts 15 million pregnancies each year worldwide, is the primary cause of neonatal mortality (1), a leading cause of lifelong neurological impairment and of neonatal and chronic lung disease (2, 3). To decrease the incidence of preterm birth and its consequences, we must improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy and its transition to a coordinated contractile unit leading to parturition.Both term and preterm labor are preceded by a uterine inflammatory response with increased immune cell migration within the myometrium, enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increased expression of contractile genes (eg, oxytocin receptor [OXTR], connexin 43 [CX43], prostaglandin F2\u03b1 [PGF2\u03b1] receptor) (4). Although intraamniotic infection may provide a stimulus for increased amniotic fluid ILs and leukocyte migration in preterm labor (4), the signals for the inflammatory response leading to labor at term arise both from the fetus (5,\u20137) and mother (8, 9).Throughout pregnancy, myometrial quiescence is maintained by progesterone (P4) acting through its nuclear receptor (PR), which blocks proinflammatory response pathways and expression of contractile genes (10, 11). In most placental mammals, increased uterine contractility near term is associated with an increase in circulating estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) (12, 13) and/or increased estrogen receptor (ER)-\u03b1 activity (14, 15) and a marked decline in circulating P4 levels and/or PR function. Estrogens induce immune cell migration into the uterus and antagonize antiinflammatory actions of P4/PR (15, 16). Furthermore, ER\u03b1 activation enhances transcription of OXTR (17), CX43 (18), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) (COX-2/PGHS) (15), which catalyzes the production of contractile prostaglandins (19,\u201321).Mammalian microRNAs (miRNA/miR) serve as integral components of signaling networks that regulate development and function of inflammatory processes (22). Recently we uncovered a role for the miR-200 family and the miR-199a-miR-214 cluster in the regulation of contractile and proinflammatory genes in myometrium that influence uterine quiescence/contractility during pregnancy and labor (10, 23, 24). In the present study, we observed that highly conserved miR-181a was significantly decreased in both the mouse and human myometrium during late gestation. Notably, the miR-181 family has been implicated in the modulation of inflammatory pathways in a variety of cell types (25,\u201330). In light of the interesting finding that E2/ER-\u03b1 binds to the miR-181a/b-1 regulatory region (31) and inhibits its transcription in human breast cancer cells (32), we further studied the regulation and function of miR-181 family members in inflammatory signaling and contractility of the myometrium. Materials and MethodsMouse studiesAll animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Breeding of ICR/CD1 mice for timed pregnancies, preparation of myometrial tissues, and E2 and P4 injection of ovariectomized mice are detailed in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Acquisition of human myometriumHuman myometrial tissues were biopsied at term (37\u201342 wk) from pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section (term not in labor and emergency cesarean section term in labor) using protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in accordance with the Donors Anatomical Gift Act of the State of Texas and is detailed in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Cell culturehTERT-immortalized human myometrial (HM) cells (33) were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium containing fetal bovine serum (10% [vol/vol]) and transfected with hsa-miR-181a mimics and inhibitor (Ambion; MC10421; and Exiqon; 4101132, respectively) for 24 hours. Primary human myometrial cells were isolated by enzymatic dispersion from term not in labor fundus uterine biopsies as described previously (34) and detailed in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)Total RNA (including miRNAs) was extracted from tissues and cells using miRNeasy minikit (QIAGEN), as detailed in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Immunoblot analysisAntibodies against c-Fos (ab94903; Abcam) and ER\u03b1 (SC-542; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to analyze protein levels by immunoblotting, as described previously (10). \u03b2-Actin (ab8227; Abcam) was detected as a loading control for each blot.TNF-\u03b1 ELISATNF-\u03b1 levels in the medium from cultured myometrial cells were determined using an ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific), according to the manufacturer's protocol. TNF-\u03b1 levels were normalized to concentrations of total protein.Luciferase assaysThe psiCHECK-2 system (Promega) was used to validate miR-181a binding sites in TNF-\u03b1 and ER\u03b1 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) in cotransfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells using a dual-luciferase assay (Promega), as described previously (23). To analyze E2/ER\u03b1 transcriptional regulation of MIR181A1HG and MIR181A1HG genes, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with MIR181A1HG-Luc or MIR181A2HG-Luc reporter constructs and human ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), followed by the E2 treatment for 24 hours and a dual-luciferase assay. Further details are presented in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Collagen matrix contractility assayhTERT-HM cells were transfected with miR-181a mimics, nontargeting control, or inhibitors and embedded into collagen matrices (10). Cell-embedded matrices were treated \u00b1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-1\u03b2, or TNF-\u03b1 and assayed for contractility, as described in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCRChIP-qPCR was carried out with human myometrial cells in primary culture using a Magna ChIP assay kit (catalog number 17-10085; Millipore) and antibodies to ER\u03b1 (17-603; Millipore), RNA polymerase II (PolII; 05-623; Millipore), PolII-pS2 and (ab5131; Abcam), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of ER\u03b1, PolII, and PolII-pS2 to the MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG regulatory regions was analyzed by qPCR using specific primers, as detailed in the Supplemental Materials and Methods.Data analysisData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM or as the mean percentage of control \u00b1 SEM, in some cases. Differences between groups were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, with statistical significance determined at the level of P < .05. ResultsMiR-181a is down-regulated in mouse and human myometrium during late gestation and laborUsing miRNA microarray analysis, miR-181a was found to be expressed at relatively high levels in quiescent pregnant mouse myometrium at 15.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and was down-regulated prior to parturition at 18.5 dpc (10). The miR-181 family includes four members, miR-181a/b/c/d, and maps to three clusters in the mouse and human genomes (Supplemental Figure 1A). There is near-complete homology among all miR-181 family members in the mouse and human, differing in their mature sequences by only one or two nucleotides (Supplemental Figure 1A). Although miR-181b also was represented in our array, its expression level was significantly lower, whereas miR-181c and miR-181d were undetectable (10). Using quantitative RT-PCR, we validated the down-regulation of miR-181a in mouse myometrium between 15.5 dpc and 18.5 dpc and in labor (\u223c19.0 dpc) (Figure 1A). No changes in miR181b/c/d were observed during late gestation and labor (Supplemental Figure 1, B\u2013D). The uterus of pregnant women can be divided into two functionally different regions: the fundus, which expands to accommodate the growing fetus and then at labor contracts to cause expulsion of the fetus, and the lower uterine segment, which maintains a relative quiescence during labor to allow passage of the fetus. In myometrium from pregnant women at term, we found that miR-181a also was significantly down-regulated during labor in the fundus but not in the lower uterine segment (Figure 1B), compared with the not-in-labor tissue specimens.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.miR-181a expression declines in pregnant mouse myometrium during late gestation and in myometrium from women in labor at term.

Lower panel, Data from scanned immunoblots, corrected for \u03b2-actin as an index of loading and transfer. **, P < .01 (n = 5 mice per group). Data shown are mean \u00b1 SEM.To identify inflammatory and parturition-regulated genes that are potential targets of miR-181 during pregnancy and labor, we searched TargetScan (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) and found a highly similar set of predicted mRNA targets related to inflammation in the mouse and human (Supplemental Table 2). Among these predicted targets, TNF-\u03b1 (35) and ER\u03b1 (14) mRNA levels were previously shown to be upregulated in labor. We further confirmed that TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 1C) and ER\u03b1 (Supplemental Figure 2) mRNA levels as well as ER\u03b1 protein levels (Figure 1D) were increased during late gestation in the mouse myometrium and reached peak levels during labor.miR-181a mimics inhibit TNF-\u03b1 expression in human myometrial cells and blocks induction of TNF-\u03b1 by LPS or IL-1\u03b2In previous studies, miR-181a mimics were found to significantly inhibit LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 expression in Raw264.7 cells (36), whereas miR-181 knockdown enhanced LPS induction of TNF-\u03b1 in astrocytes (29). To evaluate the effects of miR-181a overexpression on TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels in human myometrium, immortalized human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells (33) were transfected with miR-181a mimics or inhibitors, followed by treatment with LPS (10 \u03bcg/mL) or IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/mL) to enhance the inflammatory response. The cells showed a nearly 1000-fold increase in miR-181a after 24 hours of transfection with mimics and an approximately 70% decrease of miR-181a expression after transfection with inhibitors (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B). After 4 hours of IL-1\u03b2 treatment, levels of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA increased significantly in hTERT-HM cells. The miR-181a mimics significantly down-regulated basal expression of TNF-\u03b1 and prevented the induction of TNF-\u03b1 by IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 2A).Open in a separate windowFigure 2.miR-181a mimics and inhibitors alter expression of its target TNF-\u03b1 and contractility of immortalized human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells. A, Transfection of hTERT-HM cells with miR-181a mimic (20 nM) for 24 hours significantly reduced basal and IL-1\u03b2-induced TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression compared with IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/mL) treatment alone (4 h). B, miR-181a mimic significantly blocked IL-1\u03b2-induction of TNF-\u03b1 protein concentrations in medium of cultured hTERT-HM cells. UD, undetectable. C, Schematic of psiCHECK-2-luciferase reporters containing subcloned 3\u2032-UTR of TNF-\u03b1 with wild-type (WT) and mutated (mut) miR-181a binding sites (upper panel). Luciferase assays were conducted in HEK293 cells cotransfected with miR-181a mimics (20 nM) or the NC and the psiCHECK-2-TNF-\u03b1-3\u2032-UTR reporters (500 ng). Data shown in panels A\u2013C are the mean \u00b1 SEM of five independent experiments, each conducted in triplicate. *, P < .05, **P < .01, ***, P < .001, ****, P < .0001 compared with vehicle-treated cells transfected NC; ##, P < .01, ###, P < .001 compared with IL-1\u03b2-treated cells transfected with NC. D, Effects of transfections of miR-181a mimic (20 nM) or anti-miR-181a (20 nM) on contraction of hTERT-HM cells was assessed by measurement of mean gel area and is expressed as pixels. One milliliter of fresh DMEM, either unsupplemented (control) or containing 10 \u03bcg/mL LPS, 10 ng/mL IL-1\u03b2, or 10 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1, was added over the cell-collagen matrix. A representative gel is shown below the data for each group. Data shown are the mean \u00b1 SEM values from three independent experiments, each conducted in duplicate dishes. *, P < .05, **, P < .01 compared with NC from the same treatment group; #, P < .05, ##, P < .01 compared with the NC transfected vehicle control. NS, nonsignificant.Because TNF-\u03b1 protein is primarily secreted from cells after an inflammatory stimulus, its levels are generally undetectable in cells by immunoblotting. Consequently, we quantitatively assayed levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the culture medium by an ELISA. LPS and IL-1\u03b2 significantly increased TNF-\u03b1 levels in the cell culture medium; this was completely blocked by an transfection of miR-181a mimics (Figure 2B).miR-181a directly binds to the TNF-\u03b1 3\u2032-UTR to inhibit expressionAlthough miR-181a has been shown to repress TNF-\u03b1 expression in various cell contexts (28, 37), direct binding of miR-181a to the 3\u2032-UTR of TNF-\u03b1 has not previously been proven. We subcloned a portion of the TNF-\u03b1 3\u2032UTR (\u223c530 bp) containing a putative miR-181a binding site downstream of a Renilla luciferase reporter gene in the psiCHECK-2 plasmid (Figure 2C). The recombinant plasmid was then transfected into HEK293 cells. A vector containing a duplicated let-7 binding element also was transfected as a negative control. Enhanced expression of miR-181a significantly repressed luciferase reporter activity in HEK293 cells transfected with psiCHECK-2-TNF-\u03b1-3\u2032-UTR but did not affect the luciferase activity of cells transfected with psiCHECK-2-let7 (Figure 2C). The miR-181a mimics had no effect on luciferase expression of HEK293 cells transfected with psiCHECK-2-TNF-\u03b1-3\u2032-UTRmut construct, in which four bases within the miR-181a binding site were mutated (Figure 2C). By contrast, the transfection of a miR-181a inhibitor caused a modest but significant increase in luciferase activity of HEK293 cells transfected with psiCHECK-2-TNF-\u03b1-3\u2032-UTR; this effect was abolished in cells cotransfected with the psiCHECK-2-TNF-\u03b1-3\u2032-UTRmut construct (Supplemental Figure 3C).Up- and down-regulation of miR-181a expression alters contraction of cultured human myometrial cellsTo determine whether changes in miR-181a expression can alter myometrial contractility, we performed collagen gel contraction assays (10), in which cultured hTERT-HM cells were transfected with miR-181a mimics or inhibitors or scrambled control miRNAs (nontargeting control [NC]) and embedded in three-dimensional collagen gel matrices. We observed that spontaneous contraction of the gel disk or LPS- or IL-1\u03b2-induced contraction was significantly blocked in cells overexpressing miR-181a mimics, whereas cells transfected with the miR-181a inhibitor showed a further reduction in the diameter of the collagen disc, compared with the cells transfected with scrambled miRNAs (Figure 2D). Interestingly, addition of TNF-\u03b1 did not reverse the block of contraction caused by miR-181a mimics (Figure 2D), suggesting the existence of other miR-181a-regulated factors, in addition to TNF-\u03b1, that control myometrial contractility.miR-181a overexpression alters expression of other factors involved in the inflammatory signaling pathwayTo further reveal the profile of proinflammatory factors altered by miR-181a overexpression, we used the RT-qPCR to assay other cytokines and chemokines related to inflammation in hTERT-HM cells. We found that the miR-181a mimic overexpression significantly decreased C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2 and CCL-8 mRNA levels, whereas IL-10 mRNA was increased (Figure 3, A\u2013C). Meanwhile, miR-181a prevented the induction of CCL-2 and CCL-8 as well as the decline of IL-10, caused by IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Figure 3, A\u2013C). Interestingly, CCL-8 and CCL2 are both predicted targets of miR-181a, using Targetscan and RNA22 prediction tools (https://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22/Interactive/), respectively. However, the change in IL-10 is more likely caused by an indirect action of miR-181a; notably, IL-10 is not a predicted target of miR-181a by either prediction tool. IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 were not affected by miR-181a overexpression (Supplemental Figure 4, A\u2013D).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.miR-181a alters expression of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and inhibits expression of c-Fos in hTERT-HM cells. A and B, Transfection of hTERT-HM cells with miR-181a mimic (20 nM) for 24 hours caused a significant reduction in basal and IL-1\u03b2-induced CCL-2 (A) and CCL-8 (B) mRNA expression compared with cells transfected with the NC. C, miR-181a overexpression increased expression of IL-10, and blocked IL-1\u03b2 inhibition of IL-10 expression after 24 hours. For panels A\u2013C, *, P < .05, ***, P < .001 vs NC; #, P < .05, ##, P < .01 compared with IL-1\u03b2 in cells transfected with NC. D and E, c-Fos mRNA (D) and protein (E) expression were significantly increased in pregnant mouse uterus during labor (IL). **, P < .01 (n = 6 mice per gestational time point). F, c-Fos mRNA expression was not affected by transfection of miR-181a mimics (20 nM) or inhibitors (20 nM) in hTERT-HM cells after 24 hours. G, miR-181a mimic (20 nM) decreased, whereas miR-181a inhibitor (20 nM) increased c-Fos protein expression in hTERT-HM cells after 24 hours. Data shown in bar graphs are the mean \u00b1 SEM from three independent experiments. *, P < .05, compared with NC transfected cells.c-Fos, a crucial inflammatory transcription factor, has been reported to increase in pregnant rat myometrium during late gestation and into labor (38). In the present study, a similar pattern was observed in pregnant mouse myometrium (Figure 3, D and E). Intriguingly, c-Fos is a validated target of miR-181a in dendritic cells (39). Whereas c-Fos mRNA did not change in response to miR-181a mimic or inhibitor treatment in hTERT-HM cells (Figure 3F), c-Fos protein expression was significantly decreased by the overexpression of miR-181a and was increased upon transfection of miR-181a inhibitors (Figure 3G).E2/ER\u03b1 and miR-181a exist in a reciprocal repressive feedback loopAs mentioned, estrogens promote an inflammatory response in the uterus and antagonize antiinflammatory actions of P4/PR (15, 16). Moreover, circulating estrogen levels increase markedly near term in a number of species (12, 13) with the decline in uterine PR function (11, 40). ER\u03b1 is a predicted inflammatory target of miR-181a and increases in pregnant mouse myometrium in association with the decline in miR-181a expression (Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure 2A). To assess the effects of E2 on miR-181a expression in the uterus, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were given a single sc injection of E2 (1 \u03bcg), and uterine tissues were collected 24 hours later. Notably, E2 treatment of OVX mice significantly inhibited uterine miR-181a expression (Figure 4A). In parallel studies, we also injected OVX mice with P4 (1 mg) and harvested uterine tissues after 24 hours. In contrast to E2, P4 treatment caused no significant changes in miR-181a expression (Supplemental Figure 2B).Open in a separate windowFigure 4.E2/ER\u03b1 and miR-181a exist in a reciprocal feedback loop in myometrial cells. A, Subcutaneous injection of OVX mice with E2 (1 \u03bcg in 0.25 mL sesame oil) significantly inhibited uterine miR-181a expression compared with oil-injected controls after 24 hours. **, P < .01 (n = 5 mice per group). B, Treatment of HM-SMC cells with E2 (10\u22127 M) significantly decreased expression of mature miR-181a after 24 hours.

Data shown are the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments, each conducted in triplicate. *, P < .05, **, P < .01 compared with vehicle.To further investigate the effects of estrogen on the expression of miR-181a, primary cultures of human myometrial smooth muscle cells (HM-SMCs) were treated with E2 (10\u22127 M) for 2\u201324 hours. E2 treatment significantly reduced the expression of mature miR-181a after 24 hours (Figure 4B). miR-181a is transcribed from long noncoding RNAs located in two human chromosomes, which are annotated as miR-181A1 host gene (MIR181A1HG) in chromosome 1 and miR-181A2 host gene (MIR181A2HG) in chromosome 9. We observed that E2 treatment of HM-SMCs caused a rapid reduction of MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG expression (Figure 4, C and D), indicating that the E2-mediated repression of mature miR-181a was due to the down-regulation of host gene expression. The specific ER\u03b1 antagonist, ICI182,780, blocked the E2-mediated down-regulation of MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG as well as mature miR-181a (Figure 4, B\u2013D).Interestingly, ER\u03b1 also is a predicted target of miR-181a (Targetscan and RNA22 prediction tools), suggesting the existence of a potential reciprocal repressive feedback loop between E2/ER\u03b1 and miR-181a. To confirm the regulation of ER\u03b1 by miR-181a, hTERT-HM cells were transfected with miR-181a mimics or inhibitors. Both mRNA and protein levels of ER\u03b1 were significantly decreased by miR-181a mimics and increased by miR-181a inhibitors (Figure 4, E and F). To determine whether miR-181a directly binds to the 3\u2032-UTR of ER\u03b1, we cloned approximately 590 bp of ER\u03b1 3\u2032-UTR sequence containing the putative miR-181a binding site from human genomic DNA downstream of the Renilla luciferase reporter gene in the psiCHECK-2 plasmid. The plasmids were then cotransfected into HEK293 cells together with miR-181a mimics or inhibitors. We observed that miR-181a mimics dramatically repressed (Figure 4G) whereas miR-181a inhibitors increased (Figure 4H) luciferase reporter activity in HEK293 cells transfected with psiCHECK-2-ER\u03b1-3\u2032-UTR. These effects were prevented when four bases in the putative miR-181a binding site within the ER\u03b1-3\u2032-UTR were mutated (Figure 4, G and H). Again, miR-181a mimics and inhibitors had no effect on expression of a luciferase reporter vector containing a duplicated let-7 binding element.To assess the transcriptional effects of estrogen and the presence of ER\u03b1 response elements in the genomic regions surrounding the MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG lncRNAs, we mined publicly available Global Run-On Sequencing (GRO-seq) and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets from E2-treated MCF-7 cells (41). Several ER\u03b1 binding regions approximately 3 kb upstream of MIR181A1HG and approximately 50 kb downstream of MIR181A2HG coding sequences were identified (Supplemental Figure 5A and Figure 4I); putative estrogen response element-like sequences (ERE-LS) were identified within these regions using Lasagna software (http://biogrid-lasagna.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/; Figure 4J). We then cloned the regulatory regions flanking MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG containing the ERE-LS from human genomic DNA, and constructed MIR181A1HG:Luc and MIR181A2HG:Luc reporter plasmids. The reporter plasmids were cotransfected with TK-Renilla plasmid and either ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 expression plasmids into HEK293 cells and the cells were cultured \u00b1 E2 (10\u22127 M). After 24 hours of E2 treatment, the ratio of Firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity was significantly decreased as compared with vehicle-treated controls, in HEK293 cells overexpressing ER\u03b1 (Figure 4J) but not in HEK293 cells overexpressing ER\u03b2 (Supplemental Figure 5B). Moreover, the mutagenesis of the most proximal ER\u03b1 binding sites (MIR181A1HG-MUT:Luc and MIR181A2HG-MUT:Luc) flanking each of these genes blocked the E2 repression of MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG transcriptional activities (Figure 4J).ChIP-qPCR was used to assess in vivo binding of ER\u03b1 to the ERE-LS in the MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG regulatory regions (Figure 4K and Supplemental Figure 5C) in primary cultures of HM-SMCs treated with or without E2 for 2 hours. We observed binding of endogenous ER\u03b1 to ERE-LS3 within the MIR181A1HG regulatory region (Supplemental Figure 5C) and to ERE-LS2 within the MIR181A2HG regulatory region (Figure 4K); binding to these elements was further increased by E2 treatment. By contrast, ER\u03b1 binding to putative ERE-LS1 and ERE-LS2 within the MIR181A1HG regulatory region (Supplemental Figure 5, D and E) and to ERE-LS1 within the MIR181A2HG regulatory region (Supplemental Figure 5F) was not affected by E2 treatment. Binding of endogenous RNA PolII and of PolII phosphorylated on serine-2 can be used as markers of transcription initiation and elongation, respectively. Using ChIP-qPCR, we observed that binding of both total PolII and S2-phosphorylated PolII to ERE-LS2 within the MIR181A2HG regulatory region was significantly decreased by E2 treatment (Figure 4K). On the other hand, whereas PolII binding to ERE-LS3 within MIR181A1HG regulatory region was unaffected by E2, S2-phosphorylated PolII binding was significantly decreased by E2 treatment (Supplemental Figure 5C). DiscussionAccumulating evidence supports a central role for the miR-181 family in the regulation of inflammatory responses in a variety of cell types (25, 26, 28, 29, 36, 39, 42, 43). Although it is evident that inflammatory pathways are robustly activated within the uterus and cervix prior to and during parturition, the signals controlling inflammation remain incompletely defined, especially under noninfectious settings. Our present findings show that miR-181a expression significantly declines during late gestation as its proinflammatory targets, TNF-\u03b1, c-Fos, and ER\u03b1, increase.Although the other miR-181 family members (miR-181b, miR-181c, and miR-181d) have a similar target spectrum as miR-181a, their levels were significantly lower than those of miR-181a and remained unchanged in the myometrium during late gestation. This suggests that miR-181a is regulated independently from other family members in the pregnant myometrium and is consistent with previous findings that miR-181a, but no other miR-181 family member, was significantly down-regulated by estradiol in MCF7 cells (44). Thus, the specific decline in miR-181a expression in the pregnant myometrium near term may be controlled by increasing E2/ER\u03b1 activity. Differential expression of miRNA family members within the same cluster was previously reported in plants (45) and animal cells (46, 47). Although miRNA gene clusters often are transcribed as a single polycistronic transcript, discrepant expression patterns may be caused by their independent transcriptional regulation or by differential posttranscriptional regulation, such as miRNA half-life, or degradation resulting from non-Dicer processing (46, 48). Collectively our data strongly suggest that among the miR-181 family members, miR-181a specifically serves as a molecular rheostat for intrauterine aseptic inflammation, which facilitates the initiation of labor.Although TNF-\u03b1 was predicted to be a target of miR-181a, this had not previously been proven. In the present study, we found that the miR-181a mimic significantly decreased TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression in human myometrial cells and blocked its induction by IL-1\u03b2. This is consistent with previous findings in macrophages and astrocytes (29, 36). More importantly, using luciferase reporter assays, we determined that the TNF-\u03b1 3\u2032-UTR contains a bona fide miR-181a binding site, suggesting that TNF-\u03b1 is a direct target of miR-181a.In hTERT-HM cells, we also observed that miR-181a overexpression caused the down-regulation of the chemokines CCL-2 and CCL-8, predicted targets of miR-181a, and a coordinate upregulation of antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10. Because IL-10 increases in response to miR-181a overexpression, it is most likely that the effects of miR-181a on IL-10 are indirect. Our findings using collagen gel contraction assays that TNF-\u03b1 was unable to antagonize miR-181a inhibition of myometrial cell contraction suggests that the antiinflammatory effects of miR-181a involve targets in addition to TNF-\u03b1. In this regard, c-Fos, a crucial transcription factor, which mediates the actions of proinflammatory cytokines in a variety of cell types (49, 50) and acts together with c-Jun to upregulate CX43 expression in the pregnant myometrium near term (51), is a confirmed target of miR-181a (39). Putative activator protein-1 binding sites are present in the promoter regions of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines, suggesting the existence of potential positive feedback loops between c-Fos and cytokines. Thus, the decline in the miR-181a expression near term likely promotes the increased expression of its targets, TNF-\u03b1, CCL-2, CCL-8, and transcription factor c-Fos, which mediates the cytokine action to enhance the proinflammatory and contractile gene expression.Notably, estrogen also can enhance proinflammatory gene expression by interacting with p160 coactivators bound to Fos/Jun at activator protein-1-regulated promoters to increase their transcriptional activity (52). Our previous studies revealed regulation of miRNAs in mouse uterus by estrogen and P4 (10, 23). In the present study, we observed that E2 significantly inhibited miR-181a expression in the uterine tissues of the OVX mice and in the primary cultures of human myometrial cells. Moreover, our finding that ER\u03b1 is a direct target of miR-181a uncovers the existence of a feedback loop, whereby the increase in circulating estrogen near term causes a suppression of miR-181a, which allows a derepression of ER\u03b1 with further suppression of miR-181a expression. Interestingly, it was previously observed that E2/ER\u03b1 causes a selective decrease in miR-181a among other family members (44). Together these findings provide exciting new insight into the role of miR-181a as a mediator of the proinflammatory effects of estrogen in the pregnant myometrium.Transcriptional regulation of miRNAs is poorly understood. Estrogen treatment of various breast and ovarian tumor cell lines caused widespread repression of miRNAs involved in tumor cell growth, including miR-181a (32), suggesting the existence of a more global mechanism underlying estrogen-mediated miRNA repression. Our findings revealed the existence of functional ER\u03b1 response elements approximately 3 kb upstream and approximately 50 kb downstream of MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG, respectively, which mediate rapid (within 2\u20133 h) repression of pri-miR-181a expression. In previous studies, E2-mediated repression of pri-miR-181a was blocked by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D but was unaffected by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (32), suggesting that MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG are primary targets of ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity. In previous studies of in vivo genome-wide binding of ER\u03b1 and PolII, it was observed that the vast majority of estrogen response elements were greater than 50 kb distal to target gene promoters and that greater than 50% of E2-mediated rapid changes in gene expression were repressive (31). It was suggested that long-range ER\u03b1-mediated suppression may be mediated via physiological squelching (competition or interference with binding of transcription factors or coactivators) (31), although the affected coactivators that interact with MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG warrant further investigation.Treatment of hTERT-HM cells with E2 inhibited RNA PolII recruitment to the MIR181A2HG regulatory region but had no effect on PolII recruitment to MIR181A1HG, suggesting that ER\u03b1 may regulate MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG genes via distinct mechanisms. On the other hand, S2-phosphorylated PolII enrichment at both MIR181A1HG and MIR181A2HG regulatory regions was dramatically attenuated by E2 treatment. Because S2 phosphorylation correlates with productive PolII elongation (53, 54), our findings suggest that ER\u03b1 regulates MIR181A2HG at both transcription initiation and elongation, whereas MIR181A1HG is primarily regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation. Thus, as with glucocorticoid and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-mediated transrepression (53, 55), transcriptional pausing may underlie E2/ER\u03b1-inhibition of miR-181a expression.Previously we observed that the expression of the miR-199a/miR-214 cluster also declines in the pregnant mouse myometrium toward term (23). This decrease is mediated, at least in part, by increased E2/ER\u03b1, which inhibits expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox-1 (23), a positive regulator of miR-199a/miR-214 transcription (23). Notably, miR-199a-3p and miR-214 target cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a critical enzyme in the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins, which increase in the pregnant myometrium during labor (23). Thus, the effects of E2 to increase COX-2 transcription (20) are likely mediated, in part, by its effect to inhibit miR-199a-3p/miR-214. Because miR-181a targets ER\u03b1, we suggest that the coordinate decline in miR-181a and miR-199a-3p/214 in myometrium toward term will have indirect and direct effects, respectively, to increase COX-2 expression.Based on our present findings, we suggest that increased estrogen production during late gestation may activate a highly coordinated and integrated series of proinflammatory pathways within the myometrium, mediated in part by E2/ER\u03b1 repression of miR-181a (Figure 5). The decline in miR-181a, in turn, increases the expression of ER\u03b1, a direct target of miR-181a, causing further repression of miR-181a. The gestational decline in miR-181a also enhances the expression of TNF\u03b1 and other proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulates c-Fos, which activates the expression of proinflammatory and contractile genes, culminating in parturition (Figure 5). Elucidation of this central role of miR-181a provides a potential new therapeutic target for preventing preterm birth and its devastating consequences.Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Reciprocal repressive feedback loop between E2 and miR-181a in the pregnant myometrium contributes to activation of inflammatory signaling pathways leading to parturition. During early through midpregnancy, decreased E2/ER\u03b1 levels are permissive for relatively high expression miR-181a, which inhibits expression of ER\u03b1, c-Fos, TNF-\u03b1, and several other proinflammatory cytokines and increases expression of antiinflammatory cytokines. Near term, increased circulating levels of E2 inhibit miR-181a, which, in turn, relieves its suppression of ER\u03b1, TNF\u03b1, and other proinflammatory cytokines and enhances expression of the inflammatory transcription factor, c-Fos. c-Fos mediates the proinflammatory effects of E2/ER\u03b1 and cytokines, resulting in the activation of contractile genes leading to labor.
