Given the uncertain benefits, our objective was to describe contemporary patient selection, high-frequency oscillation utilization, and outcomes.                  Design:                       Utilization review.                  Setting:                       Ten academic centers (Ontario, Canada; January 1, 2005-January 31, 2007).                  Patients:                       We included 190 consecutive adults treated with high-frequency oscillation and retrospectively abstracted data on patient demographics, gas exchange, hemodynamics, settings during conventional ventilation and high-frequency oscillation, adjunctive therapies, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to explore associations with oxygenation response and hemodynamic and ventilatory complications (2 hrs after high-frequency oscillation initiation) and mortality. Continuous data are reported as mean (sd) or median (quartile 1, quartile 3).                  Interventions:                       None.                  Measurements and main results:                       Patients (60.0% male; mean age, 52; sd 17) had predominantly acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (89.8%) and were severely ill (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 28; sd, 9) and hypoxemic (mean Pao2/Fio2, 80; sd, 42). High-frequency oscillation was started a median of 2 (1, 8) days after intubation and continued for a median of 3 (2, 7) days. During high-frequency oscillation, adjunctive treatments (neuromuscular blockade, 75.6%; recruitment maneuvers, 49.5%; nitric oxide, 34.0%; steroids, 63.1%) and new barotrauma or chest tube placement (23.5%) were common. Ten patients (5.3%) had technical complications; five required a new ventilator. Reasons for stopping high-frequency oscillation included death or withdrawal of life support (39.1%), significant improvement in respiratory failure (37.6%), and inadequate improvement (23.3%). One hundred and twenty-eight of 189 patients died in hospital. Most (62.5%) had a positive oxygenation response after 2 hrs of high-frequency oscillation (mean absolute increase in PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082, 22 [SD, 54]; 95% confidence interval of mean 14-31). A minority had lower PaO\u2082/FiO\u2082 (32.5%) or a hemodynamic (27.5%) or ventilatory (30.5%) complication. Older age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and Paco2 before high-frequency oscillation were independently associated with mortality.                  Conclusions:                       Most patients treated with high-frequency oscillation have acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemia that modestly improves 2 hrs after high-frequency oscillation application. However, oxygenation worsens in some patients, complications are common, and mortality is high.", "author": [{"author": "Neill K J Adhikari", "affiliation": ["Department of Critical Care Medicine and the Sunnybrook Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada. neill.adhikari@utoronto.ca"], "href": "/?term=Adhikari+NK&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Abdel Bashir", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Bashir+A&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Fran\u00e7ois Lamontagne", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Lamontagne+F&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Sangeeta Mehta", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Mehta+S&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Niall D Ferguson", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Ferguson+ND&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Qi Zhou", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Zhou+Q&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Lori Hand", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Hand+L&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Kasia Czarnecka", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Czarnecka+K&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Deborah J Cook", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Cook+DJ&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "John T Granton", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Granton+JT&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Jan O Friedrich", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Friedrich+JO&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Andreas Freitag", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Freitag+A&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Irene Watpool", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Watpool+I&cauthor_id=21765359"}, {"author": "Maureen O Meade", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Meade+MO&cauthor_id=21765359"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["21765359", "33258557", "31197492", "29743121", "26380993", "25929255", "24887179", "24413319", "23853049", "23497577"], "body": ""}
