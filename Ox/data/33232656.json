Here we show that OCA-B, a B cell-specific coactivator essential for germinal center (GC) formation, forms a ternary complex with the lymphoid-enriched OCT2 and GC-specific MEF2B transcription factors, and that this complex occupies and activates an LCR that regulates the BCL6 proto-oncogene and is uniquely required by normal and malignant GC B-cells. Mechanistically, through OCA-B-MED1 interactions, this complex is required for Mediator association with the BCL6 promoter. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only LCR segments heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for its function. Our results demonstrate how an intimately linked complex of lineage- and stage-specific factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the function of a cell-type defining LCR.Keywords: OCA-B, OCT2, MEF2B, BCL6, locus control region, enhancer, CRISPR, Mediator complex, germinal center, B-cell lymphoma Graphical Abstract eTOC BlurbChu & Hellmuth et al. reveal a hierarchical regulation involving a ternary transcriptional complex OCA-B\u2022OCT2\u2022MEF2B composed of both lineage- and stage-specific factors as a critical component utilizing distinct essential enhancer elements within the LCR essential for timely induction of BCL6, a master regulator for germinal center B-cell differentiation. IntroductionDuring the humoral immune response subsets of activated B-cells form transient structures called germinal centers (GCs), wherein they manifest a unique proliferative phenotype tolerant of genomic instability in order to facilitate immunoglobulin affinity maturation (Mesin et al., 2016). Entry into the GC reaction requires B-cells to undergo profound epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming that involves repression of many immune signaling and checkpoint genes by BCL6, a transcriptional repressor that is highly induced in, and essential for, the formation of GC B-cells (Mlynarczyk et al., 2019). Although BCL6 is an essential master regulator of the GC reaction (Dent et al., 1997; Fukuda et al., 1997; Ye et al., 1997), the mechanism through which its expression is induced and maintained in GC B-cells remains poorly understood. Defining how GC stage-specific BCL6 expression is achieved is critical to understanding not only GC B-cells, but also the diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and follicular lymphomas (FLs) that arise from GC B-cells and are dependent on sustained expression of BCL6 for their survival (Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2015). The BCL6 requirement for formation of GC B-cells illustrates how specific cell lineages are dependent on particular transcription factors (TFs) to elicit their phenotype.Gene-specific functions of transcription factors are mediated through interactions with non-coding regulatory regions of the genome. In this regard, genome-wide chromosome conformation (Hi-C) studies in primary B-cell populations revealed a GC-specific intergenic region, located 150 kb upstream of BCL6 on chromosome 3q26, that was suggested to function as a locus control region (LCR) through extensive interactions with neighboring and distal genes that included BCL6 (Bunting et al., 2016). This large region, spanning more than 100 kb, also has super enhancer characteristics based on H3K27ac or BRD4 ChIP-seq data in GC-derived lymphoma cells (Ramachandrareddy et al., 2010; Chapuy et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2015). In contrast to the early lethality caused by defects in non-B cells in Bcl6\u2212/\u2212 mice, constitutive deletion of the Bcl6 LCR yields generally healthy animals that, nonetheless, are completely unable to form GCs (Bunting et al., 2016) - indicating that the function of the LCR is GC-specific and essential for GC formation. Based on DNase I hypersensitive sites, this large LCR contains numerous putative regulatory elements (transcription factor binding sites), whose individual contributions to LCR function and GC biology are unknown. In fact, no enhancer element has been functionally defined as being required for BCL6 expression and mechanisms underlying the function of such elements as lineage specification determinants are not well understood.OCA-B is the first factor shown to be both essential and selective for GC formation (Schubart et al., 1996; Nielsen et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1996). Otherwise healthy Pou2af1\u2212/\u2212 (gene name for OCA-B) mice were found to be completely deficient in GC formation, as later found in Bcl6 and Bcl6 LCR deletion mice. Like BCL6, OCA-B has also been implicated in the growth of GC-derived DLBCL cells (Chapuy et al., 2013). OCA-B was initially identified as a B cell-specific coactivator that can facilitate transcription from immunoglobulin (Ig) gene promoters through interactions with either the ubiquitous (OCT1) or the lymphoid-lineage (OCT2) octamer-binding transcription factor (Luo et al., 1992; Luo and Roeder, 1995) and was shown to facilitate transcription from Ig enhancers in cell-based assays (Stevens et al., 2000). Apart from the Ig locus, other genes including Cxcr5, Cd79a, Cd79b, Kcnn4, Lck, SpiB, and miR-146a are thought to be directly regulated by OCA-B under various conditions in mouse splenic B-cells or cell lines (Wolf et al., 1998; Malone et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003; Bartholdy et al., 2006; Lindner et al., 2014). Genes involved in broad B-cell programs were proposed as OCA-B targets in response to OCT2 knock-down in activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCLs (Hodson et al., 2016). However, unlike Bcl6 or Bcl6 LCR deletions, deletions of the above-mentioned genes do not have effects that resemble the GC defects of Pou2af1. Furthermore, to date there has been no comprehensive understanding of direct OCA-B target genes or mechanistic aspects of OCA-B coactivation functions in relation to its essential role in GC formation.Along these lines, complementary analyses of (i) direct target genes of OCA-B and its mechanism of action and (ii) key regulatory elements and associated factors in the BCL6 LCR led us to propose that OCA-B directly regulates BCL6 expression in GC B-cells. Using both genomic and biochemical approaches, we uncover (i) a previously uncharacterized ternary complex composed of OCT2, OCA-B, and the GC-specific transcription factor MEF2B and (ii) its function on the BCL6 LCR through facilitation of Mediator recruitment and enhancer-promoter looping. Densely tiled CRISPRi screening indicates that only the LCR segments heavily bound by this ternary complex are essential for LCR function. Our results indicate a multi-tiered cooperativity that precisely defines the enhancer specificity and function for a master developmental regulator. ResultsOCA-B and OCT2 are highly enriched at the BCL6 LCRBased on the high GC expression of OCA-B and BCL6 and the GC defect in both Pou2af1\u2212/\u2212 and Bcl6\u2212/\u2212 mice, we reasoned that OCA-B might control the BCL6 LCR. An investigation of genome-wide binding patterns of OCA-B, OCT1, and OCT2 in the GC-derived DLBCL line OCI-Ly7 by ChIP-seq showed a more prominent overlap of OCA-B with OCT2 (75.7%) than with OCT1 (32.1%) (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Over 35% of the OCA-B or OCT2 peaks were located in intergenic or intronic enhancer regions (Figure 1B). Within this group, OCA-B and OCT2 ChIP-seq signals were highly enriched at active enhancers relative to primed enhancers and more dramatically enriched at super enhancers (Figures 1C and S1B to D) (Lov\u00e9n et al., 2013; Whyte et al., 2013). De novo motif analyses for OCT2 and OCA-B binding sites revealed enrichment for the canonical OCT2 motif, as expected, as well as motifs for B-cell related ETS family transcription factors (SPIB, PU.1, and ETS) and genome architectural factors (CTCF and its homolog BORIS) (Figure 1D). ROSE algorithm also identified the BCL6 LCR as one of the most enriched genomic regions for OCA-B and OCT2 (Figure 1E). A subsequent alignment of OCA-B and OCT2 ChIP-seq data with H3K27ac ChIP-seq from human tonsillar na\u00efve B and GC B-cells and ChIP-seq data for other GC B-cell transcription factors (MEF2B, PAX5, and PU.1) and cofactors (p300, CREBBP, MED1) in OCI-Ly7 cells showed that the majority of these factors/marks were enriched at many of the BCL6-LCR constituent enhancers defined by DNase I hypersensitive sites (Figure 1F). Reanalysis of public Blueprint expression data further revealed that, among these factors, expression of OCA-B is highly GC-specific, whereas OCT2 is expressed throughout na\u00efve B and GC B-cells in agreement with its role as B-cell lineage-determining transcription factor (Figure 1F). Collectively, these data point to OCT2 and OCA-B as putative critical functional determinants of the 3q26 BCL6 LCR required for formation of GC B-cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 1.OCA-B and OCT2 are highly enriched at the BCL6 LCR(A) Overlap of OCT2 and OCA-B ChIP-seq peaks in OCI-Ly7 cells.

See also Figure S1.OCA-B binds to MEF2B to drive BCL6 LCR activityAs further evidence that OCA-B and OCT2 are required to drive BCL6 expression in GC-derived B-cells (OCI-Ly7 cells), CRISPRi-mediated knock-downs using two different gRNAs each resulted in a marked reduction of BCL6 mRNA levels (Figure 2A). Similarly, CRISPR-mediated deletion of OCA-B or OCT2 in the same cells yielded markedly reduced BCL6 protein levels (Figure 2B). To help define the mechanism of action of OCA-B in the context of GC-derived B-cells, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) using anti-OCA-B antibody with OCI-Ly7 cells. Strikingly, we detected a highly significant association of OCA-B with most of the ~30 subunits of the Mediator transcriptional coactivator complex (Malik and Roeder, 2010) and with MEF2B (Figure 2C), another highly GC-specific TF (Figure 1F) whose GC-specific deletion reduces GC formation by ~ 50% (Brescia et al., 2018). Associations between OCA-B, OCT2, and MEF2B were validated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation from OCI-Ly7 nuclear extract (Figure 2D). To determine if these reciprocal associations also reflect the presence of a ternary complex sub-population, we performed a double IP using anti-OCA-B and anti-OCT2 antibodies for the first and second IPs, respectively. Notably, MEF2B was immunoprecipitated in association with the OCA-B\u2022OCT2 complex, clearly indicating the existence in OCI-Ly7 cells of a ternary OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex whose formation is independent of DNA binding (Figure 2E). Consistent with previous findings that MEF2B can activate BCL6 expression (Ying et al., 2013), we observed similar results with both CRISPRi-mediated knock-down (Figure 2F) and CRISPR-mediated deletion (Figure 2G) of MEF2B in OCI-Ly7 cells. While OCT2 and OCA-B expression levels was not affected by reciprocal knock-downs, expression of MEF2B was reduced after OCT2 and OCA-B knock-down (Figure S2A), suggesting a more complicated feedback loop-mediated regulation of OCT2\u2022OCA-B on MEF2B for BCL6 activation.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.OCA-B binds to MEF2B to drive BCL6 LCR activity(A, F)\nBCL6 mRNA level quantified by RT-qPCR in CRISPRi knock-down of OCA-B (A), OCT-2 (A) and MEF2B (F) in OCI-Ly7 cells.

See also Figure S2.The high abundance of these three factors at the BCL6 LCR, comprised of numerous constituent enhancers (Figure 1F), led us to investigate whether they drive BCL6 enhancer-like functions through direct binding. While some of the constituent enhancers (e.g., CE2, CE3, CE9) showed H3K27ac marks and chromatin accessibility as early as the na\u00efve B-cell stage, the majority (e.g., CE1, CE4, CE7) were GC-specific (as evidenced by the absence of H3K27ac in NB cells and strong H3K27ac marks in GC cells, Fig. 1F). Since CE1 showed the strongest occupancy of OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B (Figure 1F), it was selected for further analyses. ChIP-qPCR revealed decreased H3K27ac levels at CE1 after CRISPRi knock-down of either of the three factors (Figure 2H), whereas no difference was observed at a negative region (NR) 41 kb upstream of the BCL6 promoter (Figure S6). Similarly, enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression (Core et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) from CE1 and other LCR constituent enhancers was decreased after CRISPRi knock-down of OCT2, OCA-B or MEF2B (Figure S2B), suggesting that all three factors are required for full activation of BCL6 LCR constituent enhancers. To test whether OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B can activate transcription through CE1, a derived 232 bp fragment centered on the OCA-B summit and containing 3 putative OCT2 sites (CE1_O2\u20134, Figure S3B) was placed downstream of a luciferase reporter (Ighluc) that is driven by an octamer-containing IgH promoter (Figure 2I) and serves as a model for OCT2-regulated promoters, including BCL6 (Stauss et al., 2016). Luciferase assays with this reporter (Ighluc-CE1_O2\u20134) and with Ighluc were performed in OCT1-expressing HEK293T cells that do not express endogenous OCT2, OCA-B or MEF2B (data not shown); and overexpression of these latter proteins was confirmed by immunoblot (Figure S2C).The promoter-only reporter (Ighluc) was activated by expression of OCT2 and OCA-B (Figure 2J, lane 7 vs. 1), as expected (Schubart et al., 1996), whereas further addition of MEF2B had only a very modest effect (Figure 2J, lane 10 vs. 7). Importantly, whereas expression of OCA-B and OCT2 only modestly enhanced transcription on the CE1-containing Ighluc-CE1_O2\u20134 template relative to the promoter-only Ighluc template (Figure 2J, lane 8 vs. 7), the further addition of MEF2B yielded a markedly greater induction (Figure 2J, lane 11 vs. 10) -- indicating that optimal CE1 activity requires OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B. In further support, the MEF2B-mediated CE1 enhancer function depended on both OCA-B (Figure 2J, lane 11 vs. 23) and an intact O3 site (Figure 2J, lane 12 vs. 11), indicating that MEF2B-mediated activation of CE1 requires both OCA-B and OCT2. Altogether, these results indicate that OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B are all critical for optimal BCL6 LCR activity and consequent BCL6 induction in an octamer element-dependent manner.OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B bind cooperatively to the BCL6 LCR through octamer elementsThe preceding results led us to hypothesize that recruitment of MEF2B to CE1 is either direct, through binding to a non-canonical MEF2B motif that requires functional cooperation with OCT2 or OCA-B, or indirect, through primary interactions with other TFs (e.g., OCT2). Consistent with the latter possibility, de novo motif analysis of publicly available MEF2B ChIP-seq datasets (Brescia et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2015) revealed highly significant enrichment for motifs that closely match the canonical octamer binding motif for OCT1/2 (Figure S3A), suggesting that MEF2B might cooperate with OCT2 at regions enriched with octamer elements - at least in the GC B-cell context. To define the CE1 elements important for OCT2 and MEF2B binding, recombinant FLAG-tagged OCT2 (F:OCT2) or MEF2B (F:MEF2B) proteins (Figures S3C and D) were incubated with immobilized biotin-conjugated CE1 DNAs bearing serial deletions of the four OCT2 binding motifs and two weak MEF2B motifs (Figure S3B). These immobilized template assays (ITAs) revealed that the strongest OCT2 motif (O3) is most critical for F:OCT2 binding (Figure 3A, upper panel), whereas F:MEF2B showed an apparent non-specific (OCT2 motif- and MEF2B motif-independent) binding (Figure 3A, lower panel) at a low KCl concentration (150mM), which was lost under more stringent ionic conditions (Figure 3B, lane 3 vs. lane 7), consistent with the absence of strong MEF2B motifs on CE1 (Figure S3B).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B bind cooperatively to the BCL6 LCR through octamer elements.(A-B) Binding of OCT2 or MEF2B at 150 mM KCl (A) or both at 150, 200 and 300 mM KCl (B) on CE1 DNA with serially deleted fragments (Figure S3B) measured by ITA.

OCT2-CE1_O3 complex is visible on a longer exposed film at the bottom of (G). The anomalous competition by the mutant octamer probe in panel F, lane 6 reflects the use of an excessive (100x) amount of competitor, with octamer dependency being more clearly revealed in Panel G and in Figure S3H with mutant octamer probes and/or lower amounts (2\u20135x) of competitor, respectively.

See also Figure S3.Although we observed a high overlap of OCT2 and MEF2B binding peaks at CE1 (Figure 1F), as well as an OCT2 and OCA-B requirement for MEF2B-dependent CE1 enhancer activity (Figure 2I), we did not observe increased F:MEF2B binding to the CE1 fragment in the presence of F:OCT2 (Figure 3B, lanes 9\u201311 vs. 6\u20138) -- suggesting that the additional presence of OCA-B may be required. In a further analysis, mutation of the critical octamer motif O3 strongly reduced F:OCT2 binding (Figure 3C, lanes 5, 6 and 7, 8) but not the weak F:MEF2B binding (Figure 3C, lanes 3\u20134 and 7\u20138). These results suggested both a weak, non-specific binding of MEF2B alone in the assay and an OCA-B requirement (in addition to OCT2) for a stronger, more specific binding. Indeed, consistent with the reporter assay results, F:MEF2B binding to CE1 was greatly enhanced by addition of recombinant FLAG-tagged OCA-B (F:OCA-B) (Figure S3E) in the presence of F:OCT2 (Figure 3C, lane 11 vs. lane 7), but the whole complex was lost in the absence of intact OCT2 motif (Figure 4F, lane 11), indicating a critical role for OCA-B in bridging MEF2B to OCT2 and an OCT2 motif-dependent binding of MEF2B to CE1. Complementary GST pull-down assays with purified recombinant proteins (Figure S3F) showed not only a direct, high salt-sensitive binding of F:MEF2B to F:OCA-B (Figure 3D, lanes 8\u201310) but also an increased binding in the presence of F:OCT2 under more stringent (200 mM KCl) conditions (Figure 3D, lane 12 vs. lanes 9 and 6), indicating further levels of cooperative binding between these three proteins for stable complex formation.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.OCA-B recruits the Mediator to BCL6 LCR constituent enhancers.(A) Schematic of crosslinking-coupled binding assay.

(F) MEF2B-facilitated, octamer-dependent, and OCA-B-dependent binding of MED1 to octamer-bound OCT2 on CE1_O2\u20134 measured by ITA. See also Figure S4.To further investigate cooperative interactions of these factors, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using the purified recombinant proteins and a 50 bp probe centered at M2/O3 from CE1 (CE1_O3, Figure S3B). Consistent with the ITA results, OCT2 but not MEF2B formed a stable complex with CE1_O3 alone (Figure 3E, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, OCA-B did not bind CE1_O3 alone, but in the presence of OCT2 induced a further shift indicative of a DNA\u2022OCT2\u2022OCA-B complex (Figure 3E, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, MEF2B neither shifted the OCT2 band nor formed a DNA-bound complex with OCA-B (Figure 3E, lanes 6 and 7), even over a range of protein concentrations (Figure S3G). However, inclusion of MEF2B with OCT2 and OCA-B induced a probe shift indicative of a DNA\u2022OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex (Figure 3F, lanes 2\u20134). The octamer-dependent formation of this complex was confirmed by oligonucleotide competition with an unlabeled control probe (wt), a mutant O3 probe (mt) and a non-specific probe adjacent to CE1_O3 (ns) (Figure 3F, lanes 5, 6 and 7 and Figure S3H; see also legends to Figures 3F and S3H) and by an EMSA assay with a mutant O3 probe (CE1_O3_mut, Figure 3G, lane 9).The above results indicate that MEF2B is recruited to DNA through OCT2 and OCA-B. However, it remained unclear if the DNA binding ability of MEF2B is required for this recruitment and the formation of the OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex on DNA. To address this question, we purified a recombinant double mutant MEF2B(D83V,Y69H) protein from insect cells (Figure S3I). The MEF2B D83V mutation was previously shown to drastically reduce DNA binding at MEF2B sites whereas the Y69H mutation had little effect (Pon et al., 2015). Consistent with the results of Pon et al., MEF2B(D83V,Y69H) showed no direct DNA binding ability (Figure S3J). Both EMSA (Figure 3G) and ITA (Figure 4F) assays demonstrated that the mutant retains the ability to associate with the OCA-B\u2022OCT2\u2022octamer DNA complex, indicating that recruitment of MEF2B by OCA-B\u2022OCT2 onto an octamer sequence is independent of its DNA binding property. We also observed that this mutant actually has a higher affinity for OCA-B (Figure S3K, lanes 8\u201310 vs. lanes 3\u20135), consistent with the formation of a more stable complex formation (Figure 3G, compare lane 5 to 4).Although the MEF2B(D83V) mutant has impaired DNA binding ability (Figure S3J, Pon et al., 2015), the majority of the MEF2B-occupied sites were retained in ChIP-seq experiments comparing MEF2B wildtype and MEF2B(D83V) (Brescia et al., 2018). We hypothesized that the retained MEF2B(D83V)-occupied sites are sites where MEF2B is recruited through other transcription factors and coactivators such as OCT2 and OCA-B. To test this hypothesis, we first identified peaks bound by MEF2B without OCT2 or OCA-B (n=4128) or by OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B together (n=6393) and then calculated the fraction of peaks that are retained in the MEF2B D83V mutant. Sites bound by MEF2B, OCT2 and OCA-B together were approximately twice as likely to retain binding of the MEF2B(D83V) mutant (OR=2.13, p=4.39e\u201379, Figure S3L). In contrast, sites bound by MEF2B without OCT2 or OCA-B were far less likely to be retained in the MEF2B(D83V) mutant (OR=0.507, p=4.94e\u201368, Figure S3L). These results are consistent with our in vitro results and indicate that the DNA-binding ability of MEF2B is dispensable at sites where MEF2B is recruited through OCT2 and OCA-B.To determine whether this OCA-B dependent ternary CE1 complex occurs naturally in B-cells, we performed ChIP-qPCR in OCA-B\u2212/\u2212, OCT2\u2212/\u2212 or MEF2B\u2212/\u2212 OCI-Ly7 cells and measured fold-enrichment at either CE1 or NR. Consistent with our in vitro findings, full recruitment of MEF2B depended on both OCT2 (Figure 3H) and OCA-B (Figure 3I). Notably, maximal OCT2 binding to CE1 was also impaired in the absence of MEF2B (Figure 3J) or OCA-B (Figure 3K). OCA-B recruitment was impaired not only by the absence of OCT2 (as expected) (Figure 3L), but also by loss of MEF2B (Figure 3M), suggesting that stable formation of the CE1 ternary complex requires all three components in the context of natural chromatin. To confirm this interdependency, we performed OCA-B ChIP-re-ChIP experiments in OCI-Ly7 cells using MEF2B or OCT2 antibodies for the first round of enrichment. In both cases the further immunoprecipitation with OCA-B antibodies enriched for CE1 binding (Figures 3N and S3M). Taken together, the results indicate that MEF2B forms a complex with OCT2 and OCA-B at octamer sites in an OCA-B-dependent manner.OCA-B recruits the Mediator to BCL6 LCR constituent enhancersAlthough the preceding results established cooperative functions of OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B at the BCL6 LCR, the mechanisms by which they activate target gene transcription from such a long distance (over 150 kb) remained unclear. Relevant to this issue, our IP-MS studies identified an association of OCA-B with a majority of the ~30 subunits of the Mediator complex (Figure 2C and Table S1) that has been implicated in enhancer-promoter communication (Malik and Roeder, 2016). To further explore the OCA-B-Mediator association, we performed reversible crosslinking-coupled binding assays (Figure 4A, detailed in Methods) (Kim et al., 2006) using recombinant GST-OCA-B and a purified Mediator complex (Figure S4A). Multiple Mediator subunits indicative of complete Mediator bound to GST-OCA-B in the absence of the crosslinking procedure (Figure 4B, lane 3), whereas the crosslinking analysis with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) indicates that MED1 interacts directly with OCA-B (Figure 4B, lanes 4\u20136). This direct interaction was further confirmed by a GST-pulldown assay with purified GST-OCA-B and FLAG-tagged MED1 (F:MED1) (Figures 4C and S4B). A co-IP further showed an association of endogenous OCA-B with MED1/Mediator in OCI-Ly7 nuclear extracts (Figure 4D). In contrast, Mediator subunits could not be pulled down by OCA-B in nuclear extract from murine Med1\u2212/\u2212 embryonic fibroblasts (Figure 4E) (Ito et al., 2000), confirming that MED1 is the primary interacting subunit of Mediator for OCA-B. ITAs using the CE1_O2\u20134 probe and recombinant proteins also demonstrated an OCA-B requirement for MED1 recruitment by OCT2 (Figure 4F, lane 8 vs. lane 7); and the further addition of MEF2B enhanced this MED1 recruitment (Figure 4F, lane 9 vs lane 8). Finally, ChIP-qPCR for MED1 in OCA-B\u2212/\u2212 OCI-Ly7 cells revealed significantly reduced MED1 binding at CE1 (Figure 5I), demonstrating that OCA-B interacts with MED1 to recruit Mediator to the BCL6 LCR.Open in a separate windowFigure 5.The Bcl6 LCR must be positioned in cis to allow GC formation in vivo(A) Mating strategy used to obtain Bcl6 knock-out combined with Bcl6-LCR knock-out on separate alleles (i.e., in trans).

Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM (n=3). NR: negative control region 41 KB upstream of BCL6 TSS. See also Figure S4.The BCL6 LCR must be positioned in cis to allow GC formation in vivoBecause of the large genomic distance (>150 kb) between the BCL6 promoter and the BCL6 LCR, we asked whether LCR function was limited to the same allele (i.e., acting in cis) or could exert control over the sister chromosome (i.e., acting in trans). To test this, we crossed LCR\u2212/\u2212 mice with Bcl6\u2212/\u2212 mice to produce \u201ccompound\u201d Bcl6\u2212/+;LCR+/\u2212 heterozygous animals with a Bcl6 knock-out on one allele and an LCR knock-out on the other allele (i.e., trans configuration, Figure 5A). Bcl6\u2212/\u2212 and LCR\u2212/\u2212 mice manifest complete loss of GCs (Bunting et al., 2016; Dent et al., 1997; Fukuda et al., 1997; Ye et al., 1997). In these compound heterozygous mice, if the Bcl6 LCR were able to interact in trans, then the WT LCR located on the Bcl6\u2212 chromosome would rescue expression of Bcl6 on the LCR\u2212 DNA strand. To test whether this could occur, we compared and contrasted GC formation in mice with the following genotypes: Bcl6\u2212/+;LCR+/\u2212, Bcl6\u2212/+ and LCR+/\u2212. We also included Bcl6+/+;LCR+/+ and homozygous LCR\u2212/\u2212 mice as negative and positive controls, respectively. Groups of mice with the respective genotypes were immunized with T-cell-dependent antigen (sheep red blood cells) to induce GC formation and sacrificed 10 days later when the GC reaction is at its peak. Spleens from these mice were then examined by flow cytometry to assess the abundance of GC B-cells (Figure 5B). As expected, the total numbers of B-cells (B220+) were equivalent in these mice (Figure 5C). As previously reported, Bcl6+/\u2212 mice display a partial reduction in the abundance of GC B-cells (B220+,Fas+,GL7+) (Huang et al., 2014). Similarly, LCR+/\u2212 mice show a partial reduction in GC B-cells (Figure 5D). Compound (trans) heterozygous Bcl6\u2212/+;LCR+/\u2212 mice, however, manifest complete abrogation of the GC reaction (Figure 5D), similar to the GC defect observed in LCR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, Bcl6 and its neighboring LCR must be located on the same chromosome to function in vivo, supporting a direct, cis-regulatory role for the LCR in the induction of Bcl6 and GC formation.BCL6 LCR architectural functions require OCA-B and ternary complex-bound enhancer elementsIn GC B-cells, the BCL6 LCR makes extensive contacts with the BCL6 promoter and other GC-associated genes located along chromosome 3 (Bunting et al., 2016). This prominent architectural function, together with the direct, cis-regulatory role of the BCL6 LCR observed above, prompted us to investigate whether cis-regulatory elements within the LCR, such as CE1, are essential for LCR architectural effects. To test this, we first established CE1-depleted OCI-Ly7 cells (OCI-Ly7CE1+/\u2212 and OCI-Ly7CE1\u2212/\u2212) by CRISPR and observed reduction of BCL6 expression (Figure 5E). Architectural effects were calculated by measuring the interaction frequency between the BCL6 promoter as an anchor and different regions across the LCR using chromosome conformation capture (3C) as described (Ramachandrareddy et al., 2010; Figure S4C). For all tested constituent enhancers with high interactivity (Figure 5F and S4D), OCI-Ly7CE1\u2212/\u2212 cells lost significant promoter interactivity with the region around CE1 (Figure 5G), whereas no interactivity was shown in control HEK293T cells because of the inactive state of the H3K27ac-negative LCR (ENCODE, not shown). Since OCA-B is critical for BCL6 expression (Figures 2A and \u200band2B)2B) and LCR activity (Figure 2J), we hypothesized that loss of OCA-B would affect BCL6 enhancer-promoter contacts. In confirmation, CRISPR-mediated or shRNA-mediated depletion of OCA-B also significantly reduced enhancer-promoter contacts for all tested constituent enhancers (Figures 5G and S4D, respectively).The Mediator is thought to function as a signal transducer that facilitates the flow of regulatory information from enhancers to promoters (Malik and Roeder, 2016). While MED1 has been reported to be essential for certain enhancer-promoter contacts (Lai et al., 2013), recent provocative studies based on the degron-mediated rapid disassembly of Mediator have argued for a functional role by an as yet unclear mechanism, rather than a stable architectural bridging role in enhancer-dependent regulation of promoter activity (El Khattabi et al, 2019; Jaeger et al, 2020). Nevertheless, the transient knockdown of OCA-B (Figure S4F) also led to a striking loss of Mediator at OCA-B peaks across the LCR (Figure S4E), suggesting that OCA-B is required for Mediator recruitment and BCL6 E-P interactivity, both of which are crucial for BCL6 activation. The key downstream event related to Mediator recruitment and enhancer-promoter communication is the formation of a stable Pol II pre-initiation complex that leads to induction of target gene transcription. Accordingly, significant decreases in Pol II and MED1 occupancy at the BCL6 promoter were observed in most of the CRISPR clones - the exception being a persistent MED1 occupancy in OCT2\u2212/\u2212 OCI-Ly7 cells (Figures 5H and \u200bandI)I) that likely reflects potential compensation by OCT1. Collectively, these results suggest a critical role for OCA-B and CE1 in supporting the BCL6 LCR architectural function and facilitating formation of transcriptional complexes at the promoter through recruitment of the Mediator, whether by means of a transient bridging action or through engendering formation of activator-coactivator condensates in the vicinity of the promoter (Shrinivas et al., 2019).CRISPRi screening of the BCL6 LCR reveals internal hierarchy and essential enhancer elements highly enriched with the ternary OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complexThe critical role of CE1 and the ternary complex on LCR activity prompted us to further study the role of other LCR constituent enhancers and their relationship to the ternary complex. To this end, we performed dCas9-KRAB-mediated CRISPRi screens leveraging the fact that BCL6 is essential for cell survival and proliferation in GC B-cells and GC-derived lymphoma cell lines such as OCI-Ly7 (Figure 6A). We generated a pooled gRNA library densely tiling all potential regulatory elements at the human BCL6 locus, thereby covering a genomic region of 316.8 kb with 25,698 gRNAs in total (Figure 6A). The efficacy of the screen was validated by gRNAs targeting 100 essential genes (Figure S5A). Correlation between replicates was high, indicating robust and reproducible screening results (Pearson correlation r=0.81, Figure S5B). Notably, disruptions of a majority of the constituent enhancers showed no growth defects, indicating that they are non-essential (NEs) for cell growth or survival. However, four constituent enhancers, including CE1, had mean growth scores lower than the 1st percentile of control gRNA growth scores, and thus were classified as essential enhancers (EEs) (Figure 6B). Consistent with the results of the screen, independent validations revealed no drop-outs for any of the NEs (Figure 6C); and these results were confirmed in another GCB-DLBCL cell line (SU-DHL-4) (Figure S5C). As NEs could potentially produce effects too small to pick up as a growth phenotype, we then asked whether simultaneous perturbation of two NEs would produce measurable growth defects. To this end, we transduced cells with two separately labeled gRNAs and assessed growth over time. Notably, no growth defect was observed whenever the CE2 NE and another NE were jointly disrupted, whereas growth defects were maintained when an EE was disrupted jointly with CE2 (Figure S5D). Importantly, only disruption of EEs had a significant impact on BCL6 mRNA levels while NEs were dispensable (Figure 6D). These results indicate a strong internal hierarchy and demonstrate that the BCL6 LCR activity relies completely on distinct EE elements.Open in a separate windowFigure 6.BCL6 LCR architectural functions require OCA-B and ternary complex-bound enhancer elements(A) Schematic representing screening strategy and overview of the screened region and H3K27ac ChIP-seq signal as a surrogate for regulatory elements.

Each region was targeted with two different gRNAs (C-D). See also Figure S5 and 6.The aforementioned results raise the question as to how EEs differ from NEs. To address this, we compared several features related to functions of a regulatory element. While H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and MED1 levels are indistinguishable between NEs and EEs, we observed higher (albeit not statistically significant) intensities of H3K27ac marks, DNA accessibility (measured by DNase-seq) and eRNA signals for EEs relative to NEs (Figures S5E and S6). On the other hand, MEF2B showed a striking enrichment at EE while OCT2 and OCA-B showed higher, albeit not statistically significant, occupancy at EEs vs NEs (Figures S5F and S6). Together with our detailed characterization of the OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex described above, this indicates that a key distinguishing feature of the EEs is a high enrichment of the OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex. Supporting the above observations, a significantly higher density of octamer motifs was measured in EEs compared to NEs (Figure S5G), providing additional evidence for the usage of octamer motifs in establishing the LCR activity. Together, these data indicate that octamer motif density and binding of the OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B ternary complex are key distinguishing factors of BCL6 LCR EEs critical for their function. DiscussionIn relation to the profound importance of germinal centers for humoral immunity and lymphoma pathogenesis, our major objective has been to understand gene regulatory pathways important for GC formation. In the present study, analyses of gene targets and mechanisms for GC-specific master regulator OCA-B have converged with analyses of the GC-specific locus control region (LCR) on the gene encoding the master regulator BCL6. Genomic analyses of OCA-B and its GC-enriched DNA-binding partner OCT2 showed a predominant binding to super enhancers, including the BCL6 LCR, in GC-derived DLBCL cells, and also established colocalization with the GC-selective transcription factor MEF2B. Complementary biochemical and genetic analyses further identified an OCA-B\u2022OCT2\u2022MEF2B ternary complex that proved essential for optimal activation of the BCL6 LCR through OCT2-binding (octamer) elements. Mechanistically, this complex was shown to function through OCA-B-MED1/Mediator interactions leading to BCL6 LCR-promoter communication. In parallel studies focused on the structure and function of the large LCR, a densely tiled CRISPRi screen established that only a specific subset of the LCR constituent enhancers are important for the proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells and for BCL6 expression; and the critical subset of enhancers were characterized by high ternary complex occupancy and a high density of octamer motifs. Based on these results, we report a previously unidentified GC-specific transcription complex and essential elements controlling the activity of a GC-specific locus control region of a critical GC master regulator. Further details and implications of these findings are discussed below.Control of optimal BCL6 expression by the OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B ternary complexAll three components of this ternary complex are essential in numerous DLBCL cell lines (DepMap release 20Q2, data not shown). In fact, the top two co-dependencies of OCT2 are MEF2B and OCA-B, confirming their intimate functional relationship. This strong dependency of DLBCL cell lines on the ternary complex components might arise either from their own independent functionalities or, at least in part and as suggested here, from their cooperative roles in BCL6 activation. Although optimal BCL6 LCR-directed BCL6 expression during GC B-cell differentiation has been thought to involve GC-specific factors, they heretofore have not been well defined. Several previous studies examined the role of Pou2af1 in Bcl6 expression in mouse B-cells, but none involved analyses in cells with characteristics of GC B-cells (Qin et al., 1998; Corcoran et al., 2005; Hodson et al., 2016; Levels et al., 2019). A recent study has linked OCT2 and OCA-B to Bcl6 promoter activity in mouse follicular T helper cells, whose differentiation and function also requires Bcl6 (Stauss et al., 2016). However, Bcl6 expression is much lower in these cells than in GC B-cells (Sayin et al., 2018), likely due to the lack of LCR activity (Weinstein et al., 2014). Here, biochemical assays have established physical interactions between OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B, which manifest as the formation of a ternary complex on OCT2 binding sites (octamer elements) in the BCL6 LCR. Importantly, a corresponding co-occupancy of these factors on constituent BCL6 LCR enhancers and functional cooperativity in BCL6 expression have been demonstrated in DLBCL cells. It is noteworthy that the key DNA-binding elements for formation of this complex are the OCT2 binding sites, with no requirement for MEF2B sites and with MEF2B being recruited through direct interactions with OCT2-bound OCA-B and with no apparent interactions with OCT2. Thus, the order of assembly of these key factors on DNA is OCT2\u2192OCA-B\u2192MEF2B.The sequential function of these factors may be especially important during the early differentiation of GC B-cells, where BCL6 is repressed during early initiation and later activated as cells migrate and form nascent GCs (Calado et al., 2012; Dominguez-Sola et al., 2012). A hierarchical model for BCL6 regulation through step-wise activation of the LCR can thus be proposed. First, specific constituent enhancers within the LCR are premarked with the lymphoid lineage OCT2 potentially acting as a pioneer factor or lineage-determining transcription factor (data not shown). Upon antigen engagement and entry into the early GC initiation stage, induced OCA-B then pre-activates the BCL6 LCR followed by full activation by MEF2B, which appears slightly later than OCA-B during GC initiation (De Silva and Klein, 2015).MEF2B as a transcriptional coactivator of the GC-specific BCL6 LCRGiven reports of MEF2B recruitment and function through MEF2 DNA binding motifs in GC transcription events (Ying et al., 2013, Brescia et al., 2018), it was surprising to find that MEF2B function is apparently independent of the MEF2 motif in the present study, at least on the BCL6 LCR constituent enhancers. However, the lack of direct binding of MEF2B to CE1 and the dependence on OCT2 and OCA-B is consistent with a previous study showing GATA factor-MEF2 synergy independent of the DNA binding domain of MEF2 (Morin et al., 2000), as well as our demonstration that MEF2B can be recruited by a direct OCA-B interaction. Compared to other MEF2 family members, MEF2B differs by the presence of a glutamine in place of an aspartic acid at position 14, which affects a key DNA binding residue within the MADS box (Molkentin et al., 1996). This difference implies that MEF2B might have a reduced DNA affinity (Pon and Marra, 2016) that may provide a higher capability for MEF2B genomic redistribution. Notably, MEF2B is recurrently mutated in GC-derived FLs and DLBCLs (Pastore et al., 2015; Ying et al., 2013). In this regard, the overwhelming majority of mutations affect the N-terminal DNA binding MADS and MEF2 domains, and the most common mutations, K4E and D83V, have been shown to decrease MEF2B binding to DNA (Pon et al., 2015). While the MEF2 DNA binding domain has been shown to mediate physical and functional interactions with GATA factors (Morin et al., 2000), we found that the DNA binding-defective MEF2B(Y69H,D83V) not only retained, but actually showed an enhanced, ability to interact with OCA-B and subsequent OCT2-bound OCT2 sites. This result suggests an alternative mechanism of pathogenesis for this recurrent mutation and mandates future studies to elucidate the OCA-B-MEF2B interface, which could potentially be targeted for therapeutic purposes.Interestingly, the reduced OCA-B occupancy on CE1 in MEF2B\u2212/\u2212 cells was not observed in the biochemical analysis, where MEF2B is dispensable for OCA-B binding to OCT2 - implying an additional layer of regulation in cells. The possibility that MEF2B might regulate OCA-B expression, is unlikely since a reduction of OCA-B is not observed in CRISPRi-mediated MEF2B knock-down cells. Therefore, a more likely possibility is that the intracellular chromatin structure of the LCR adds constraints to OCA-B-OCT2 interactions that are overcome by cooperative MEF2B interactions.OCA-B recruitment of the Mediator as a driver for LCR functionalityBeyond the identification of key transcription (co)factors involved in activation of BCL6 through the LCR, a key question is how these factors stimulate transcription from the downstream promoter. Of major significance in this regard is our demonstration of physical and functional interactions of OCA-B with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator. Mediator serves as the major means of communication between enhancer-bound transcription factors and the general transcription machinery at the core promoter, thereby establishing a functional pre-initiation complex (Allen and Taatjes, 2015; Levine et al., 2014; Malik and Roeder, 2016). Consistent with this view, our studies have shown (i) colocalization of MED1 with OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B on LCR constituent enhancers and (ii) the concomitant loss of LCR-promoter interactions, Mediator and Pol II recruitment, and BCL6 expression following the loss of OCA-B. While not eliminating potential interactions of other Mediator subunits with OCA-B or other components of the ternary complex, these results establish a clear role for MED1 in LCR-mediated BCL6 expression.MED1 was shown to be essential for erythroid development, although no obvious effect on the lymphoid lineage was observed in Mx-Cre/Med1f/f mice (Stumpf et al., 2010). However, ex vivo culture of splenocytes treated with IL4+LPS from Mb1-Cre/Med1f/f mice showed a 30\u201360% reduction in class-switch recombination (Thomas-Claudepierre et al., 2016), likely due to impaired interactions between the E\u03bc enhancer and the \u03b31 promoter (IgG1). In view of our previous observation that OCA-B can regulate transcription of class-switched Ig genes by acting on their promoters and enhancers, our current finding that OCA-B recruits Mediator via MED1 raises the possibility OCA-B may act in transcription or transcription-coupled class switch recombination at the IgH locus by a mechanism similar to that observed for the BCL6 locus.Organizational hierarchy of the complex BCL6 LCR revealed by CRISPRi screeningThe enormous size and complexity of the BCL6 LCR raises questions regarding the basis for the complexity, the possible necessity of all constituent enhancers for optimal BCL6 expression and potential redundancy for biological robustness. Our CRISPRi screening approach proved highly informative in dissecting this complex non-coding locus. Use of a maximum density gRNA library combined with CRISPRi provided a precise, robust, and quantitative assessment of the functional impact of each enhancer element within the BCL6 LCR. We identified four distinct constituent enhancers that are essential for LCR activity and GCB-DLBCL survival (termed EEs), whereas all other constituent enhancers were absolutely dispensable or non-essential (termed NEs) - thereby revealing a striking hierarchy among the constituent enhancer elements. Depicting the characteristics of EEs showed no correlation with H3K4me1, H3K4me3, MED1 occupancy, and promoter interactivity and weak correlation with DNA accessibility, eRNA expression and H3K27ac levels. These observations highlight the fact that general features for enhancer activity do not correlate with essential constituent enhancers within an LCR, at least in certain tissues, and suggest that the context of each element may be different as a result of variation in associated factors - such that the magnitude of the activity of each element cannot be accurately judged by comparing the general features. Importantly, however, individual EEs showed strong OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B occupancy, potentially in the form of the identified ternary complex. Nonetheless, there likely exist additional factors that contribute to the function of EEs and may help distinguish them from NEs. Future studies will be required to elucidate the full complement of factors that drive and distinguish EEs within different LCRs and in different cell types.Exactly how the ternary complex forms specifically at EEs remains unclear, but formation was linked significantly to high density octamer motifs. Along these lines it is notable that transcription factor binding site (TFBS) density has recently been implicated as a driver of transcriptional condensate formation at enhancers (Shrinivas et al., 2019) - a process that has been suggested to be of particular importance for super enhancer functions (Boija et al., 2018; Hnisz et al., 2017; Sabari et al., 2018) involving RNA Pol II, Mediator, and specific types of transcription factors. In agreement with this model, disruption of just one OCT2 site had a drastic effect on the transcriptional activity of CE1. Moreover, both OCT2 and MEF2B consist largely of intrinsically disordered regions that, in other studies, have an established role in condensate formation. In light of these observations, one can speculate that BCL6 LCR essential enhancers, by virtue of their TFBS density, act as scaffolds that nucleate the formation of transcriptional condensates containing OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B, with subsequent participation of Mediator and RNA Pol II. A possible role for MEF2B in condensate formation is further supported by the observation (Brescia et al., 2018) that all super enhancers in human GC B-cells are bound by MEF2B.In summary, we have uncovered a previously unknown cooperativity between OCT2, OCA-B and MEF2B and identified the crucial functional units of the BCL6 LCR, which are specifically enriched with an OCT2\u2022OCA-B\u2022MEF2B complex. Our results highlight how an intricate interplay of lineage- and stage-specific factors converges on specific and highly essential enhancer elements to drive the function of a cell-type defining LCR.

OCI-Ly7 were obtained from Ontario Cancer Institute in June 2011. SU-DHL-4 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2957).HEK293T (CRL-3216, ATCC) cells were cultured in complete DMEM (11995040, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 % FCS and 100 U/mL PenStrep (15140122, Thermo Fisher Scientific).Mouse Models and Strains Bcl6\u2212/\u2212 mice were kindly provided by H. Ye (Albert Einstein Medical College). Bcl6 LCR\u2212/\u2212 mice were generated in our lab as reported previously (Bunting et al., 2016). Mice were crossed as indicated in Figure 5A to generate trans double heterozygous Bcl6+/\u2212 LCR+/\u2212 mice and control genotypes. Mice of each genotype were matched as closely as possible for age and sex within constraints of availability (WT: n = 10, female:male = 10:0, median age = 79 \u00b1 0 days.; Bcl6\u2212/+;LCR+/+: n = 8, female:male = 4:4, median age = 103 \u00b1 12 days; Bcl6+/+;LCR+/\u2212: n = 11, female:male = 3:8, median age = 97 \u00b1 12 days; Bcl6+/+;LCR\u2212/\u2212: n = 11, female:male = 9:2, median age = 119 \u00b1 37.6 days; Bcl6\u2212/+;LCR+/\u2212: n = 8, female:male = 6:2, median age = 124 \u00b1 9.32 days). Mice were housed in a dedicated pathogen-free environment. All experiments and procedures conformed to ethical principles and guidelines revised and approved by the Research Animal Resource Center of the Weill Cornell Medical College of Medicine. The use of human tissue was approved by the research ethics board of Weill Cornell Medical Center.METHOD DETAILSCrosslinked Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-sequencing ChIP-seq was performed as described (Yu et al., 2015) with the following modifications. Briefly, 2 \u00d7 107 cells were fixed 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fragmentation of fixed chromatin was performed by sonication of isolated nuclei (Branson Sonifiers, Branson) to achieve enrichment of short chromatin fragments (200 \u2013 700 bp). Five \u03bcg of antibodies were added to the chromatin lysate and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The next day, Dynabeads protein A (10002D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added and incubated with rotation at 4 \u00b0C for 1.5 hours. Enriched DNA was isolated through extensive wash steps and subsequent reverse crosslinking and purification by DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (D4014, Zymo Research). Quantitative ChIP PCR were performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (204143, Qiagen) in 20 \u03bcl reactions with 200 pg of DNA and primers (Table S3) used at a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM on Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher). ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from 2\u20135 ng ChIP DNA. After end-repair (End-It\u2122 End-Repair Kit, ER0720, Lucigen), A-tailing (3\u2019\u21925\u2019 exo\u2212 Klenow Fragment, M0212S, NEB), and ligation (Quick Ligation\u2122 Kit, M2200S, NEB) with barcodes (NEXTflexChIP-Seq Barcodes, PerkinElmer #NOVA-514121), barcoded DNA was amplified by 12 cycles of PCR using Phusion\u00ae High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (M0530S, NEB). Libraries were then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 as 50-bp single-end runs at the Genomics Resource Center at the Rockefeller University. The antibodies used for ChIP are described in Key Resource Table.KEY RESOURCES TABLEREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERAntibodiesIgG Fraction Monoclonal mouse Anti-rabbit IgG, light chain specific, Horseradish PeroxidaseJackson ImmunoResearchCat# 211-032-171, RRID: AB_2339149Monoclonal Anti-Biotin-AgaroseSigma-AldrichCat# A1559, RRID: AB_257936TrueBlot anti-mouse Ig IP agarose beadsRocklandCat# 00-8811-25, RRID: AB_2610704TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP agarose beadsRocklandCat# 00-8800-25, RRID: AB_2610703Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), superclonal recombinant secondary antibody, biotinThermo FisherCat# {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"A28176\",\"term_id\":\"90140\",\"term_text\":\"pir||A28176\"}}A28176, RRID: AB_2536162Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), superclonal recombinant secondary antibody, biotinThermo FisherCat# {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"A27035\",\"term_id\":\"89312\",\"term_text\":\"pir||A27035\"}}A27035, RRID: AB_2536098Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gelMillipore SigmaCat# A2220Anti-Bob1 (OCA-B), rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-955; RRID: AB_2166917Anti-Oct-2 (OCT2), rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-233; RRID: AB_2167205Normal rabbit IgGSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-2027; RRID: AB_737197Normal mouse IgGSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-2025, RRID: AB_737182Anti-BOB1 (OCA-B), rabbit monoclonalAbcamCat# ab92315, RRID: AB_10562774Anti-Oct-1 (OCT1), rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-232; RRID: AB_2167065Anti-MED1, rabbit polyclonalBethylCat# A300-793A, RRID: AB_577241Anti-Lamin B, goat polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-6216, RRID: AB_648156Anti-\u03b2-actin, mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-47778, RRID: AB_626632Anti-H3K27ac, rabbit polyclonalAbcamCat# ab4729, RRID: AB_2118291Anti-EP300, rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-584, RRID: AB_2293429Anti-CREBBP, rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-583, RRID: AB_2245237Anti-BCL6, mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-7388, RRID: AB_2063455Anti-FLAG, mouse monoclonalSigma-AldrichCat# F1804, RRID: AB_262044Anti-GST, mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-138, RRID: AB_627677Anti-MED6, rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-9434, RRID: AB_2250535Anti-RPB1, rabbit polyclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-899, RRID: AB_632359Anti-OCT2, mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-377476; RRID: NAAnti-MEF2B, mouse monoclonalSanta Cruz BiotechnologyCat# sc-517433; RRID: NAAnti-MEF2B, rabbit polyclonalSigma-AldrichCat# HPA004734, RRID: AB_10963939APC-conjugated anti-B220BD BioscienceCat# 553092PE-conjugated anti-FASBD BioscienceCat# 554258FITC-conjugated anti-GL7BD BioscienceCat# 553666Anti-MED30, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED17, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED21, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED23, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED24, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED12, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AAnti-MED13, rabbit polyclonalThis labN/AChemicals, Peptides, and Recombinant ProteinsDSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate)ProteoChemCat# c1104BicineSigmaCat# 391336D(+)-BiotinSigmaCat# 8512090005Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium (1X), +L-Glutamine, + 25mM HEPESLife technologiesCat# 12440Salmon sperm DNAGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 27-4565-01poly-deoxy-inosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid [poly [d(I\u2013C)]Millipore SigmaCat# 10108812001Biodyne\u2122 B Nylon membraneThermo FisherCat# 77016Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III, EDTA-FreeMilliporeCat# 539134Cellfectin IIInvitrogenCat# 10362-100Grace\u2019s Insect Medium (2X), supplementedInvitrogenCat# 11667-037Grace\u2019s Insect Medium, unsupplementedInvitrogenCat# 11595-030BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate)Thermo FisherCat# 21580Benzonase\u00ae NucleaseEMD MilliporeCat# 70664DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium)Thermo FisherCat# 11960-044FormaldehydePolysciencesCat# 18814-10TransIT-LT1Mirus Bio LLCCat# MIR 2306Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum MediumThermo FisherCat# 31985-070Penicillin-StreptomycinThermo FisherCat# 15140122Proteinase KRocheCat# 3115836001PuromycinLife TechnologiesCat# A11138-03Alt-R S.p.

In brief, sequencing data were aligned to human hg38 reference genome using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Galaxy Version 2.3.4.2) with default parameters. Duplicate mapped reads were removed using Samtools with the rmdup option (Li et al., 2009; Galaxy Version 2.0.1). Metaplots for ChIP-seq signals were plotted as averaged profiles or heatmaps by deepTools2 (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2016). Peaks were defined by Homer (Heinz et al., 2010) using the findPeaks program with parameter -style factor and the threshold for statistical significance of peaks at 10\u22129. Filtered peaks were annotated, and genomic distributions of filtered peaks were calculated by Homer with annotatePeaks program. Measurement of peak overlap was done by Intervene (Khan and Mathelier, 2017) with default parameters. De novo motif analysis was performed with homer findMotifsGenome.pl with the following parameters: \u2018-size 50 -bits\u2019 and the JASPAR CORE database (2020 release). For the analysis of MEF2B ChIP-seq data, MACS2 was used to identify peaks using the default settings. MEF2B peaks co-bound by OCT2 and OCAB were identified using the ChIPseeker package and the relative fraction of peaks was calculated by comparing the fraction of co-bound peaks to all peaks. The softwares used for ChIP-seq data analyses are listed in Key Resources Table.Lentivirus Production, Transduction, and Mediated Gene Knock-down Production of lentiviruses bearing lentiviral vectors and transduction of lentiviruses were performed as described by The RNAi Consortium (TRC). In brief, the day before transduction, HEK293T cells were seeded at the density of 4 \u00d7 106 of cells in a 10-cm dish. The next day, 50 uL of virus concentrated using Lenti-X (631232, Takara) were added to cells with complete medium containing 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene. The next day, cells were replenished with fresh complete medium. Positively transduced cells were selected by treating with puromycin at the final concentration of 1 mg/mL for 2 days following 2 days of transduction. For lentivirus-mediated gene knock-down, 4 \u00d7 106 of cells were transduced by 50 uL of virus concentrated using Lenti-X (631232, Takara) with complete medium containing 8 \u03bcg/mL polybrene. The next day, cells were replenished with fresh complete medium. Positively transduced cells were selected by treating with puromycin at the final concentration of 1 mg/mL for 2 days following 2 days of transduction before harvest. pLKO.1 clones containing control shRNA (shCTRL) or shRNA against OCA-B mRNA (shOCA-B) are purchased from Sigma. shOCA-B has been used and validated as described (Chapuy et al., 2013). The shRNA sequences are listed in Table S5 and Key Resource Table.CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Gene Editing For POU2AF1\u2212/\u2212 and MEF2B\u2212/\u2212 cells, Cas9/RNP complex containing Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease 3NLS (1074182, IDT), Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA for MEF2B and POU2AF1 (designed and synthesized by IDT), and Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (1072532, IDT) were assembled in vitro following manufacturer\u2019s instruction (IDT) and delivered into OCI-Ly7 cells by electroporation using Amaxa SF Cell Line 96-well Nucleofector Kit (Lonza). Single cells were then seeded in 96-well plates by serial dilution. Clones were expanded and validated by Sanger sequencing and immunoblot.For POU2F2\u2212/\u2212, CE1\u2212/\u2212, and CE1+/\u2212 cells, gRNA sequences were cloned into lentiCRISPR v2 (52961, Addgene). Lentivirus production and transduction was performed as described above. Infected and selected single cells were then seeded in 96-well plates by serial dilution. Of note, CE1 deleted cells were generated by dual transduction of two gRNAs targeting each side of CE1 peak spanning ~200 bp. Clones were expanded and validated by Sanger sequencing and immunoblot. gRNA sequences are listed in Table S5.Generation of CRISPRi Cell Lines CRISPRi OCI-Ly7 and SU-DHL-4 cell lines were generated by lentiviral transduction of pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (46911, Addgene, a gift from Stanley Qi and Jonathan Weissman) followed by flow sorting for BFP high populations. Cells were expanded and sorted again after 1\u20132 weeks. Flow sorting was repeated 2\u20133 times.CRISPRi-mediated interference Individual gRNA oligos were ordered from IDT and cloned into pLKO5.C+E.sgRNA.EFS.PAC for qPCR experiments or pLKO5.C+E.sgRNA.EFS.GFP for drop-out experiments. gRNA sequences are listed in Table S5. gRNA constructs were lentivirally transduced into OCI-Ly7 or SU-DHL-4 CRISPRi cell lines. For CRISPRi followed by qPCR, puromycin selection was initiated 2 days after transduction. After two days of puro selection, cells were harvested and transcripts were measure by RT-qPCR (see below). For CRISPRi followed by drop-out analysis, see below (\u2018CRISPRi Screen Validation Experiments\u2019).RNA Isolation, cDNA preparation, and Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) For experiments in Figure 2 and \u200band6,6, total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cDNA was synthesized with the Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) using a 3:1 mix of random hexamers and anchored oligo-dT primers. Quantitative PCR was performed using the FAST SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a QuantStudio 6 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For experiments in Figure 5, total RNA from 1 \u00d7 106 of CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells were prepared using RNeasy\u00ae Plus mini kit (74034, Qiagen) with on-column digestion (RNase-Free DNase Set, 79254, Qiagen) following manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The concentration of eluted total RNA was measured by Nanpdrop (ThermoFisher). cDNAs were synthesized from 3 \u03bcg total RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (18080-044, Thermofisher) with oligo(dT) primers following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (204143, Qiagen) on Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System. We normalized gene expression to HPRT1 or TBP and expressed values relative to control using the \u0394\u0394CT method. Primers used here are listed in Table S3. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD (n=3).Luciferase Assay Luciferase assays were performed using Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega) as described (Ou et al., 2011) with modifications. In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected with pGL3-Ighluc-CE1_O2-O4 or pGL3-Ighluc-CE1_O2-O4_O3mut, pRL-CMV (Promega), and pFUGW-pCMV-driven POU2F2, POU2AF1, and/or MEF2B ORFs using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (MIR 2306, Mirus Bio LLC). After 24 hours, cells were washed with PBS once, harvested with 1X PLB buffer, and lysed by passive lysis. Debris was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and 20 \u03bcL of the supernatant was added to 100 \u03bcL of LAR II to measure firefly luciferase activity by TROPIX luminometer (PerkinElmer). Renilla luciferase activity was measured by adding 100 \u03bcL of STOP & Glo Reagent. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by first normalizing firefly luciferase activity with Renilla luciferase activity, followed by dividing each group to EV. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM (n=3). pFUGW-pCMV-related vectors are modified from lentiCas9-Blast (52962, Addgene) and ORFs were inserted by using AgeI and BamHI sites. Sequences of the inserted CE1 fragments are listed in the Table S6).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry (IP-MS) For IP-MS, 200 \u03bcl DynaBeads protein A (10001D, ThermoFisher) were washed twice with 1 ml washing Buffer PBST (PBS containing 0.05 % Tween-20) and 20 \u03bcg of anti-OCA-B antibodies or normal rabbit antibodies were added and incubated with beads for 6 h. Beads were washed twice with PBST. Crosslinking was performed by adding bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, 21580, ThermoFisher) at a final concentration of 5 mM in TBST and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed twice with PBST, quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at final concentration of 50 mM, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Beads were mixed with 50 mg of nuclear extract from OCI-Ly7 in BC200 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 10 % glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 3 mg/mL BSA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1 % NP-40) and incubated overnight. Beads were washed five times with BC200 buffer and eluted with 200 \u03bcl of 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5, with immediate neutralization by 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Eluents were desalted by Amicon Ultra Centrifuge Filters with 10 kDa NMWCO (UFC500308, Millipore-Sigma) and sent for mass spectrometry analysis by the Rockefeller Proteomic Facility with Trypin digestion. Summary for the selected peptides acquired from mass spectrometry are listed in Table S1. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of endogenous proteins in nuclear extract from OCI-Ly7 were performed as described (Chu et al., 2014). Two-Step Coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described with modifications (Sciuto et al., 2018). In brief, nuclear extracts were first incubated with rabbit anti-OCA-B antibody for IP (see scheme in Figure S2D) followed by addition of biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and anti-biotin beads to immobilized proteins associated with OCA-B. After elution with excess biotin in biotin elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 3.3 mM biotin, 3.3 mM bicine, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, protease inhibitor cocktail), the eluent were incubated with mouse anti-OCT2 antibody followed by addition of biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and anti-mouse IgG beads to immobilized proteins associated with OCT2. After washing 6 times, the beads were boiled in 1\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using indicated primary antibodies and light-chain specific secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch).Purification of Recombinant Proteins GST-fused OCA-B (GST-OCA-B), Flag-tagged OCT2 (F:OCT2), F:OCA-B, and F:MEFB proteins were cloned in Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by immobilizing on Glutathione Sepharose\u00ae 4B (GE17-0756-01, Millipore Sigma) or by using Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (A2220, Millipore Sigma). Recombinant F:MED1 was expressed and purified as described (Iida et al., 2015). All recombinant proteins were stored in BC buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 20 % glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) containing 100 mM KCl (BC100).Purification of the Mediator Complex from HeLa Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (Dignam et al., 1983) from a HeLa-derived cell line that stably expresses a FLAG-tagged human MED10. Mediator complex in the nuclear extract was first enriched by a Phosphocellulose 11 anion exchange column from a 0.3\u20130.5 M KCl step fraction and affinity-purified by anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel as described previously (Malik and Roeder, 2003).Protein-protein Interactions and Reversible Crosslinking-coupled Binding Assays In vitro protein binding assays were performed as described (Malik et al. 2004). In brief, GST or GST-fused OCA-B immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose beads were incubated with either purified Mediator complex, F:MED1, F:OCT2, F:MEF2B, or nuclear extracts from mouse embryonic fibroblasts in binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10 % glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 3 mg/mL BSA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1 % NP-40) with indicated KCl concentration for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. Beads were then washed with wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 % glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1 % NP-40) containing indicated KCl concentration for 3 times. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using indicated antibodies. Reversible crosslinking-coupled binding assay was performed as described (Kim et al., 2006) with minor modifications. Briefly, GST or GST-fused OCA-B immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose beads were incubated with purified Mediator complex, washed with binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 10 % glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 3 mg/mL BSA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.1 % NP-40), and crosslinked with various concentrations of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, 22586, Thermo Fisher) in crosslinking buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9] and 100 mM KCl) for 10 min at room temperature. The crosslinking reaction was terminated by quenching buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5] and 100 mM KCl) for 15 min and washed with washing buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 6.0 M urea and 1 % SDS) to remove uncrosslinked proteins. After crosslinking reversal by DTT at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, eluted proteins were boiled in 1\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using indicated antibodies.Immobilized Template Assay Immobilized template assays were performed as described (Chen et al. 2009). A human BCL6 CE1 enhancer fragment, its deletion series, or OCTA mutant was prepared by PCR using biotinylated oligonucleotides (Figure S3B and Table S6) and immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280 streptavidin, Invitrogen). After incubating the beads in blocking buffer {50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.01 % NP-40, 1 mg/mL BSA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 mM DDT, 10 \u03bcg/mL salmon sperm DNA [27-4565-01, GE Healthcare], 10 \u03bcg/mL poly-deoxy-inosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid [poly [d(I\u2013C)], 10108812001, Millipore Sigma]}, purified proteins were added to the reaction and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.01 % NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT) three times, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 100D7 Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblot using indicated antibodies.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) Protein-DNA binding interactions were identified by Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) using LightShift\u2122 Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (20148, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described (Chu et al., 2011) with modifications. In brief, recombinant F:OCT2, F:OCA-B, and/or F:MEF2B were mixed with the biotinylated DNA probe at room temperature for 30 min, followed by electrophoresis by a 5 % native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X tris-borate EDTA buffer at 100 V for 1 h. The DNA was then transferred onto Biodyne\u2122 B Nylon membrane (77016, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 0.5X Tris-borate EDTA buffer at 100 V for 1 h. DNA was further cross- linked on the blot by UV at 120 mJ/cm2 (UV Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene). Detection of biotinylated DNA was performed by Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module Kit (89880, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For competition assays, non-biotinylated probes were used as cold probes and mixed together with the biotinylated probe prior to the addition of recombinant proteins. DNA probe sequences are listed in Table S6.Immunization and FACS Analysis of GC B-Cells Animals were immunized intraperitoneally at 2\u20134 months of age with 0.5 ml of a 2 % sheep red blood cell suspension in PBS (SRBC, Cocalico Biologicals) and sacrificed 10 days later for analysis of GC formation. Splenocytes were isolated and GC B-cells were analyzed by gating B220+DAPI\u2212GL7+FAS+ population using FACS and the following fluorescent-labeled antibodies: APC-conjugated B220 (553092, BD Bioscience), PE-conjugated FAS (554258, BD Biosciences), FITC-conjugated GL7 (553666, BD Biosciences). DAPI was used for the exclusion of dead cells. Data was acquired on a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software.Chromosome Conformation Capture Assay (3C) Chromosome conformation capture assay was perform as described (Hag\u00e8ge et al., 2007) with modifications. In brief, cells were fixed with 1 % of formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with 125 mM of glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were pelleted, washed once with DPBS, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer, and incubated for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 g at 4 \u00b0C and resuspended in 1X NEB EcoRI buffer. SDS was added to 0.01 % and the nuclei were incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min sharp before being quenched by adding Triton X-100 to final 0.1 %. EcoRI was added and the nuclei were incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The next day, EcoRI was inactivated by adding excess SDS and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min. In situ proximity ligation was performed as described (Duan et al., 2012) and incubated at 16 \u00b0C for 4 hours and 25 \u00b0C for one hour. Reversal of crosslinks and protein degradation were performed by adding proteinase K (3115836001, Roche) and incubated overnight at 65 \u00b0C. Additional proteinase K were added and incubated for another 2 h at 65 \u00b0C. DNA was purified using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (P2069, Sigma) and precipitated by sodium acetate and cold ethanol. Quantitative PCR was performed anchoring at BCL6 promoter towards the LCR using primers as partly described (Ramachandrareddy et al., 2010) and listed in Table S3. Relative interaction frequency was calculated by normalized with that of EEF1G locus (Ramachandrareddy et al., 2010).gRNA Library Design The regions targeted by the library consisted of all potential regulatory elements at the human BCL6 locus including the entire BCL6 LCR, adjacent enhancers, the BCL6 promoter and the three alternative promoters for the next upstream coding gene (LPP) as well as ample interspersed genomic regions without evidence of regulatory potential as negative controls. To construct a gRNA library tiling the BCL6 locus at the highest possible density we used custom R code. Briefly, all potential PAM sequences (NGG) and the corresponding 20bp protospacer sequence were identified in the targeted regions. All gRNAs with potential termination signals (TTTT) were removed as well as polyA/C/G stretches (AAAAA, GGGGG, CCCCC) to avoid synthesis and sequencing errors. gRNA with Esp3I sites were removed to avoid cloning errors. gRNA that showed > 1 perfect off-target matches were removed.We selected the top 100 essential genes from two published genome-wide screens (Horlbeck et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) and included five CRISPRi gRNAs per essential gene into the library as positive. 250 non-targeting gRNAs were included as negative controls. Library gRNA sequences are provided in Table S7.Custom code detailing gRNA library design is provided.gRNA Library Cloning Oligos were synthesized on chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and PCR amplified. Both inserts and pLKO5.C+E.sgRNA.EFS.PAC vector were digested simultaneously with Esp3I (Thermo Scientific) and ligated by T4 ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.) followed by electroporation into Endura Competent Cells (Lucigen). Colonies were collected and Maxi-prepped (Qiagen) for Hiseq QC analysis.CRISPRi Screening CRISPR screening generally followed published protocols (Joung et al., 2017) with minor modifications. The gRNA library was packaged into lentiviral particles in HEK293T cells transfected with the gRNA library, pMD2.G (12259, Addgene) and psPAX2 (12260, Addgene) using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirius Bio). CRISPRi expressing cells were transduced with the gRNA library at low MOI for an infection rate of approximately 20\u201330 %. Selection with puromycin was started 2 days after transduction. After three days of puromycin selection, cells were split and the baseline sample (timepoint t0) was stored as a dry cell pellet at \u221280 \u00b0C. The remainder of cells were grown for 10\u201314 population doublings when the final sample was isolated (timepoint t14).gDNA was isolated from t0 and t14 samples using the Quick-DNA Midiprep Plus kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries were generated in a one-step PCR using the primers listed in Table S4. The forward primer contained a staggered stuffer to increase amplicon diversity. We used 9 different barcodes for the reverse primer to allow multiplexed sequencing. PCR products were concentrated using Zymo-Spin V columns (Zymo Research) and gDNA was removed by gel purification. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine.The screen was performed in two independent replicates (CRISPRi). Library representation was 500\u20131000x at all steps of the screen including transduction, cell culture, gRNA isolation, library preparation and sequencing.CRISPRi Screen Analysis Read counts for each gRNA were generate with the python script count_spacers.py provided by Joung et al. (Joung et al., 2017). gRNAs with < 50 reads in any of the t0 libraries were removed. Growth scores for each gRNA was calculated as follows:\ngsx=log2(rcxt14rcxt0)\u2212gs.\u00a0correction\u00a0\u00a0gs.correction\u00a0=1N\u2211i=1Nlog2(rc.\u00a0control\u00a0it14rc.\u00a0control\u00a0it0)\nWhere rcx\nt0 and rcx\nt14 are the read counts at timepoint t0 and t14, respectively, and gsx is the growth score of an individual gRNA. A growth score correction (gs.correction) representing the mean log2-fold change of all control gRNAs is subtracted to account for a negative fold-change bias introduced by normalization. For the sliding window calculation, the mean growth score of all gRNAs in each 200 bp window was calculated and mapped to the midpoint of each window. Custom code detailing screen analysis is provided. gRNA read counts and growth scores are provided in Table S2.CRISPRi Screen Validation Experiments Individual gRNA oligos were ordered from IDT and cloned into pLKO5.C+E.sgRNA.EFS.GFP for drop-out experiments. Each region was independently targeted with two different gRNAs represented by two separate lines in Figures 6 C and Figures S5 C\u2013D. Negative control (desert) regions were selected based on the absence of any activating histone marks. gRNA sequences are listed in Table S5. gRNA constructs were lentivirally transduced into OCI-Ly7 or SU-DHL-4 CRISPRi cell lines. For drop-out curves, cells were infected with GFP-tagged constructs at an infection rate of 20\u201350 % and the fraction of GFP positive cells was monitored by FACS every 3\u20134 days. The fraction of GFP positive cells was normalized to the fraction of GFP positive cells at day 3\u20134. Custom R code was used for analysis of FACS data and plotting of results.Constituent-enhancer-based Analysis We defined constituent enhancers at the BCL6 locus using Encode DNase-seq peaks (ENCFF328RHP). The top quartile peaks were extended to 2 kb windows. Overlapping windows and windows within < 100 bp of each other were merged. This constituent enhancer definition correlated well with other surrogate markers of enhancer activity (H3K27ac and ATAC-seq, data not shown) and functional data (CRISPRi).To identify essential enhancers, we calculated the mean of all gRNA growth scores within each constituent enhancer. Constituent enhancers with a mean growth score smaller than the 1st percentile of all CRISPRi control gRNAs, were classified as essential enhancers.To quantify ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and ChromRNA-seq at each constituent enhancer, we summarized read coverage and normalized for enhancer length.Sequencing and Analysis of Chromatin-bound RNA (ChromRNA-seq) ChromRNA-seq was performed for three independent replicates of OCI-Ly7 cells expressing CRISPRi (dCas9-BFP-KRAB, 46911, Addgene) and a control, non-targeting gRNA. Expression of the CRISPRi system and gRNA did not noticeably alter growth rate, morphological appearance or viability. ChromRNA-seq was performed as previously described (Bhatt et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2015) with minor changes. Nuclei were isolated using the PURE Prep Nuclei Isolation Kit (NUC-201, Sigma). 20 millions of OCI-Ly7 cells were lysed in 800 \u03bcl cold PURE Lysis Buffer containing 0.12 % Triton X-100. The lysate was layered on 600 \u03bcl of a 1.8 M sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 20000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 250 \u03bcl cold glycerol buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 % glycerol, 0.85 mM DTT) and then lysed with 250 \u03bcl nuclear lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 M urea, 1 % NP-40, 1 mM DTT). Chromatin was pelleted at 14000 g for 2 min at 4 \u00b0C. RNase inhibitor (recombinant RNAsin, N2511, Promega) was added to all buffers at 100 U/ml. RNA was isolated from the Chromatin-fraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).Reads were mapped to hg38 using STAR v2.5 with default parameters. Bam files for each condition were merged with samtools v1.6. Merged bam files were converted to bigWigs using bamCoverage (deeptools v2.5). Separate bigWig files were generated for each strand.Transcription Factor Binding Motif Analysis Binding motifs for OCT2 (MA0507.1) and MEF2B (MA0660.1) were downloaded from Jaspar 2018 using the R package TFBSTools v1.22. Edges with an information content < 0.5 were trimmed using the R package universalmotif v1.2.1. To search the BCL6 locus for motif matches, motifs were converted to position weight matrices using a pseudocount of 0.8 (package universalmotif). For OCT2 motif density analysis, motif matches with a relative score > 0.8 (p < 0.005) were considered.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISThe two-sided t test was used unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were carried out using the R statistical package for Figure 2A and \u200bandE,E, \u200b,55 (\u200b(C,C, \u200b,D,D, \u200b,GG and \u200bandH),H), and \u200band6.6. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism software for Figure 2G and \u200bandH,H, \u200b,3,3, \u200b,4,4, and \u200band55 (\u200b(E,E, \u200b,I,I, J and K). Differences were considered significant with a p value of p < 0.05. P values are depicted in figures using one to three asterisks (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.005). Data are presented as \u00b1 SEM with n indicating number of independent experiments if not stated otherwise in the figure legends or results. \u200b\n                    HIGHLIGHTSOCA-B\u2022OCT2 binds heavily across the BCL6 LCROCA-B, OCT2 and MEF2B form a ternary complex controlling BCL6 LCR activityOCA-B directly recruits Mediator bridging the BCL6 LCR to the BCL6 promoter in cisFour distinct OCA-B\u2022OCT2\u2022MEF2B-binding enhancers are essential for the LCR function Supplementary MaterialTable S2Table S2.
