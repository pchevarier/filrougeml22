Thus, people worldwide have faced an extraordinary challenge of a previously unrecognized viral illness with high infectivity.3 It is necessary to promote our in\u2010depth study of the disease in order to better prevent and control this disease and its complications.Several recent studies have reported the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of patients with COVID\u201019, and most of them suggest that there is a high incidence of comorbidity among patients with COVID\u201019 and diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and other chronic metabolic diseases.4, 5, 6 However, despite the increasing number of confirmed cases, the clinical investigation of patients with COVID\u201019 with underlying cardio\u2010metabolic disease was insufficient, and there are no exact data on the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID\u201019 with or without these chronic cardio\u2010metabolic diseases. Meanwhile, most of these studies were from 1 study center. This multicenter, retrospective, and real\u2010world study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, computerized tomography images as well as treatments and outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019 with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease, to help discover which cardio\u2010metabolic disease is more important for causing the mortality and disease severity of patients with COVID\u201019. MethodsStudy ParticipantsThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This multicenter, retrospective, observational, and real\u2010world study was done in hospitalized patients (\u226518\u00a0years old) who were physician\u2010diagnosed with COVID\u201019 according to the criteria published by the World Health Organization.7 Patients who had a definite outcome (dead or discharged) between January 22, 2020 and March 25, 2020 were enrolled in the present analysis. We collected data of 1402 patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in 6 designated tertiary hospitals in Hubei province, with 3 in Wuhan city and 3 in cities outside Wuhan (Table\u00a0S1). This study protocol of case series was approved by each local institutional ethics committees. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.Data CollectionWe reviewed clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory measurements, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory\u2010confirmed COVID\u201019 infection by using standard data collection forms. The research team of experienced clinicians analyzed patients' medical records. A trained teams of physicians and researchers independently entered and cross\u2010checked the data in a computerized database. If the data were missing from the records or clarification was needed, we obtained data by direct communication with attending doctors and other healthcare providers. All data were checked by 2 physicians and a third researcher to adjudicate any difference in interpretation between the 2 primary reviewers.We collected data on age, sex, exposure history, chronic medical histories (chronic cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking), symptoms from onset to hospital admission (fever, cough, sputum production, dyspnea, hemoptysis, fatigue, headache, and nausea or vomiting, diarrhea), and vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation). Routine blood examinations included complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, fasting glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes) and myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase, hypersensitive troponin I), inflammation biomarkers (CRP [C\u2010reactive protein] and procalcitonin), chest computerized tomography scan data, complications, and treatments (oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, corticosteroid, and intravenous immunoglobulin). Length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation therapy, and mortality were also collected.DefinitionCardio\u2010metabolic disease was defined as patients who had 1 or more doctor\u2010diagnosed diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and dyslipidemia. All of the above diseases were ascertained from hospital admission records and discharge registries. Hypertension was defined according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute criteria,8 or by use of antihypertensive drugs. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a history of diabetes mellitus, high blood glucose levels (fasting glucose \u22657\u00a0mmol/L or hemoglobin A1c \u22656.5%) at laboratory measurements or treatment of diabetes mellitus. Coronary heart disease was defined as a history of coronary heart disease, included myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Cerebrovascular disease was defined as a history of cerebrovascular disease.9 Transient ischemic attacks were excluded from this definition. Acute kidney injury was doctor\u2010diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines.10 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was physician\u2010diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition.11 Acute cardiac injury was defined according to the criteria mentioned in the literature.12 Coagulopathy was defined as a 3\u2010second extension of prothrombin time or a 5\u2010second extension of activated partial thromboplastin time.13 Hypoproteinemia was defined as blood albumin of <30\u00a0g/L.OutcomesThe primary outcome was in\u2010hospital mortality after admission. Secondary outcomes were incidences of COVID\u201019\u2010related complications, including ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infection, shock, hypoproteinemia, and coagulopathy; the proportion of severe outcomes, such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation therapy, classification of disease severity, and length of hospital stays. According to the Chinese management guideline for COVID\u201019 (version 7.0), the illness severity of COVID\u201019 was divided into 4 groups (mild, general, severe, and critical).14 We divided the patients into 2 groups: the nonsevere group (mild and general types) and the severe group (severe and critical types).Statistical AnalysisDifferences in demographic, history of diseases, clinical symptoms, laboratory measurements, radiological examinations, treatment, and clinical outcome between patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease were tested using the independent sample t test or Mann\u2013Whitney test for continuous variables and Pearson \u03c72 or the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality among patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease (or each cardio\u2010metabolic disease). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of secondary outcomes, including the ICU admission and the rate of severe type of COVID\u201019, among patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease (or each cardio\u2010metabolic disease). All analyses were adjusted for age and sex (Model 1); and then for smoking and systolic blood pressure (Model 2); and further for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, other than the variable for stratification (Model 3); the CRP, white blood cell count, d\u2010dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin were added in Model 4. The Kaplan\u2013Meier plot was performed to compare 40\u2010day survival probability for those with and without diabetes mellitus by log\u2010rank test. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS statistics version 23.0 for Windows software package (IBM). Two\u2010sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsPatient CharacteristicsBy March 25, 2020, clinical data were collected on 1402 adult patients. The final sample comprised 1303 patients after excluding 55 patients physician\u2010diagnosed without positive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 data (clinical diagnosis cases), and 44 patients with incomplete data on main medical information or outcome. Figure\u00a01 shows a flowchart for patient recruitment. The median age was 56\u00a0years (range, 42\u201366\u00a0years), and 658 cases (50.5%) were male.Open in a separate windowFigure 1\nFlowchart of patient recruitment.\nClinical Features, Vital Signs, Laboratory Parameters, and Radiology Findings on AdmissionGeneral characteristics of the study population at baseline are given in Table\u00a01. A total of 520 patients (39.9%) had cardio\u2010metabolic disease. Patients who had cardio\u2010metabolic disease were slightly older (64.00 versus 49.00\u00a0years; P<0.001), their baseline systolic blood pressure was higher (130.00 versus 122.00\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; P<0.001), and they had less fever (68.1% versus 73.4%; P=0.036), more often dyspnea (25.0% versus 18.3%; P=0.003), and more with blood oxygen saturation <93% (17.9% versus 7.4%; P<0.001) as compared with those who remained free of cardio\u2010metabolic disease. There were no significant differences in the gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.Table 1Baseline Characteristics of Patients With Cardio\u2010Metabolic Disease and Non\u2010Cardio\u2010Metabolic Disease and COVID\u201019TotalNon\u2010Cardio\u2010Metabolic GroupCardio\u2010Metabolic GroupP ValueNo. of participants1303783 (60.1%)520 (39.9%)\u2026Male sex, n (%)658 (50.5%)374 (47.8%)284 (54.6%)0.017Age, y56.0 (42.0\u201366.0)49.0 (36.0\u201361.0)64.0 (56.0\u201370.0)<0.00118\u201349, n (%)475 (36.5%)409 (52.2%)66 (12.7%)<0.00150\u201364, n (%)452 (34.7%)254 (32.4%)198 (38.1%)\u2026\u226565, n (%)376 (28.9%)120 (15.3%)256 (49.2%)\u2026Current smoking, n (%)107 (8.21%)58 (7.41%)49 (9.42%)0.194Onset of symptoms to hospital admission, d9.00 (5.00\u201314.0)7.50 (5.00\u201314.0)10.0 (6.00\u201315.0)0.007Wuhan exposure, n (%)1069 (82.1%)609 (77.8%)460 (88.6%)<0.001SymptomsFever, n (%)929 (71.3%)575 (73.4%)354 (68.1%)0.036Dyspnea, n (%)273 (21.0%)143 (18.3%)130 (25.0%)0.003Cough, n (%)757 (58.1%)446 (57.0%)311 (59.8%)0.308Sputum production, n (%)182 (14%)108 (13.8%)74 (14.2%)0.823Hemoptysis, n (%)3 (0.20%)2 (0.30%)1 (0.20%)0.816Fatigue, n (%)360 (27.6%)220 (28.1%)140 (26.9%)0.643Headache, n (%)47 (3.61%)32 (4.09%)15 (2.88%)0.254Nausea or vomiting, n (%)47 (3.61%)25 (3.19%)22 (4.23%)0.325Diarrhea, n (%)107 (8.21%)59 (7.54%)48 (9.23%)0.275Admission vital signsTemperature<37.3\u00b0C868 (67.2%)485 (62.5%)383 (74.2%)<0.00137.3\u201338.0\u00b0C261 (20.2%)180 (23.2%)81 (15.7%)\u202638.1\u201339.0\u00b0C132 (10.2%)94 (12.1%)38 (7.4%)\u2026>39.0\u00b0C31 (2.38%)17 (2.17%)14 (2.69%)\u2026Pulse \u2265100\u00a0beats/min241 (18.6%)137 (17.5%)104 (20.1%)0.243Blood oxygen saturation <93%, n (%)128 (11.6%)49 (7.45%)79 (17.9%)<0.001Respiratory rate >24\u00a0breaths/min, n (%)96 (7.37%)42 (5.36%)54 (10.38%)0.001SBP, mm\u00a0Hg125 (120\u2013135)122 (118\u2013132)130 (120\u2013140)<0.001DBP, mm\u00a0Hg80.0 (74.0\u201385.0)80.00 (73.8\u201383.0)80.0 (74.0\u201386.0)0.021Open in a separate windowData are expressed as n (%), or mean (interquartile range.

Table\u00a03 shows the treatments and outcomes among patients with COVID\u201019 with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease. Compared with patients without cardio\u2010metabolic disease, more patients with cardio\u2010metabolic disease had COVID\u201019\u2010related complications including ARDS (9.81% versus 3.32%; P<0.001), acute kidney injury (4.23% versus 1.40%; P=0.001), secondary infection (13.9% versus 9.83%; P=0.026), hypoproteinemia (12.1% versus 5.75%; P<0.001), and coagulopathy (19.4% versus 10.3%; P<0.001), had higher incidences of the severe type of COVID\u201019 (32.9% versus 16.7%; P<0.001), were admitted to ICU (11.7% versus 7.92%; P=0.021), required more mechanical ventilation (included noninvasive mechanical ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, 9.81% versus 4.34%; P<0.001), and renal replacement (2.50% versus 0.13%, P<0.001). There were no significant differences on the antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, and use of corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobin treatment between patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease. The ORs of secondary outcomes, including the ICU admission, the rate of severe type of COVID\u201019, and mechanical ventilation therapy among patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease (or each cardio\u2010metabolic disease) are respectively shown in Tables\u00a0S2 through S4.Table 3Treatments and Outcomes of Patients With Cardio\u2010Metabolic Disease and Non\u2010Cardio\u2010Metabolic Disease and COVID\u201019TotalNon\u2010Cardio\u2010Metabolic GroupCardio\u2010Metabolic GroupP ValueTreatmentsAntiviral therapy1196 (91.8%)728 (93.0%)468 (90%)0.055Antibiotic therapy1124 (86.3%)681 (87.0%)443 (85.2%)0.360Use of corticosteroid521 (40.0%)320 (40.9%)201 (38.7%)0.424Intravenous immunoglobin391 (30.0%)224 (28.6%)167 (32.1%)0.176Oxygen supportNasal cannula782 (60.0%)454 (58.0%)328 (63.1%)0.066Mechanical ventilation85 (6.52%)34 (4.34%)51 (9.81%)<0.001Renal replacement14 (1.07%)1 (0.13%)13 (2.50%)<0.001Illness severityNonsevere1001 (76.8%)652 (83.3%)349 (67.1%)<0.001Severe302 (23.2%)131 (16.7%)171 (32.9%)\u2026ComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome77 (5.91%)26 (3.32%)51 (9.81%)<0.001Acute cardiac injury135 (10.4%)80 (10.2%)55 (10.6%)0.835Acute kidney injury33 (2.53%)11 (1.40%)22 (4.23%)0.001Secondary infection149 (11.44%)77 (9.83%)72 (13.85%)0.026Hypoproteinemia <30\u00a0g/L108 (8.29%)45 (5.75%)63 (12.12%)<0.001Coagulopathy182 (14.0%)81 (10.3%)101 (19.4%)<0.001Shock21 (1.61%)9 (1.15%)12 (2.31%)0.104Length of hospital stay, d17.0 (10.0\u201324.0)18.0 (11.0\u201324.0)17.0 (9.00\u201324.0)0.043Intensive care unit admission123 (9.44%)62 (7.92%)61 (11.73%)0.021PrognosisDischarge, No1195 (91.7%)750 (95.8%)445 (85.6%)<0.001Death, No108 (8.29%)33 (4.21%)75 (14.42%)<0.001Open in a separate windowData are expressed as n (%), or mean (interquartile range).

The number of patients with cardio\u2010metabolic disease is associated with the mortality of COVID\u201019. When the number of the patients' cardio\u2010metabolic diseases was 0, 1, and \u22652, the mortality was 4.2%, 11.1%, and 19.8%, respectively. The multivariable\u2010adjusted (age, sex, smoking, and systolic blood pressure) OR of mortality among patients with cardio\u2010metabolic disease, compared with those without it, was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.17\u20132.97). The survival curve of patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease with COVID\u201019 is shown in Figure\u00a03. Among the patients with cardio\u2010metabolic disease, 75 of 520 (14.42%) patients died, while of those who were without cardio\u2010metabolic disease, 33 of 783 (4.21%) died. Patients with COVID\u201019 with cardio\u2010metabolic disease appeared to have an elevated risk of death compared with patients without cardio\u2010metabolic disease.Open in a separate windowFigure 2\nRisk factors with the severity and mortality of disease in patients with COVID\u201019.\nA, Component of cardio\u2010metabolic disease in the nonsevere and severe patients with COVID\u201019.

Furthermore in the adjusted model 4, which added the coagulation and inflammation\u2010related biomarkers such as CRP, white blood cell count, d\u2010dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin, there was no statistically significant difference in HR between different cardio\u2010metabolic diseases.Table 4Hazard Ratio of Death According to Cardio\u2010Metabolic Disease Status and Its Individual ComponentsNo. of ParticipantsNo. of DeathsHazard Ratio (95% CI)Model 1Model 2Model 3Model 4Cardio\u2010metabolic diseases520751.77 (1.15\u20132.71)1.80 (1.17\u20132.77)\u20260.98 (0.41\u20132.34)One cardio\u2010metabolic disease323361.46 (0.89\u20132.37)1.48 (0.91\u20132.40)\u20260.78 (0.33\u20131.85)More than 2 cardio\u2010metabolic diseases197392.24 (1.38\u20133.65)2.31 (1.42\u20133.77)\u20261.28 (0.53\u20133.09)Hypertension356601.80 (1.20\u20132.68)1.87 (1.25\u20132.79)1.86 (1.23\u20132.82)1.20 (0.52\u20132.75)Diabetes mellitus200261.09 (0.69\u20131.69)1.09 (0.69\u20131.69)0.93 (0.59\u20131.46)0.65 (0.23\u20131.81)Hyperlipidemia10070.87 (0.40\u20131.87)0.88 (0.41\u20131.89)0.91 (0.42\u20131.97)0.43 (0.06\u20132.94)Coronary heart disease63141.36 (0.76\u20132.41)1.34 (0.75\u20132.38)1.18 (0.65\u20132.12)1.08 (0.34\u20133.47)Cerebrovascular disease44152.59 (1.49\u20134.54)2.0 (1.58\u20134.96)2.78 (1.57\u20134.93)2.15 (0.61\u20137.53)Open in a separate windowModel 1 adjusted for age and sex; model 2 adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and systolic blood pressure; model 3 adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease, other than the variable for stratification; model 4 adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, C\u2010reactive protein, white blood cell count, d\u2010dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios of mortality among patients with and without cardio\u2010metabolic disease (or each cardio\u2010metabolic disease). DiscussionCoronavirus is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection. Two highly pathogenic viruses, SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV, respectively, resulted in outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Middle Eastern countries.15 SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV are associated with cardio\u2010metabolic disease. In a Hong Kong retrospective cohort study, diabetes mellitus was found to be an important risk factor for adverse outcome.16 Another retrospective study reported that hypertension was one of the frequent underlying conditions associated with death among MERS\u2010CoV\u2010infected patients.17 Although SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV have the same origin, the relationships between cardio\u2010metabolic disease and the different outcomes among patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection remain unclear.Several recent studies have found that patients with COVID\u201019 have high morbidity of cardio\u2010metabolic disease. In 1 study of 99 cases with COVID\u201019 in China, 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (40%), and endocrine system disease (13%).4 In the other study of 5700 patients in New York City, the most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes mellitus (1808; 33.8%).6 The present study indicated that 39.9% of patients with COVID\u201019 had cardio\u2010metabolic disease including patients with more than 2 diseases (197 of 520 [37.9%]), 27.32% patients had hypertension, and 15.35% patients had diabetes mellitus. Race, selection of population, and study design are all important factors contributing to the heterogeneity of prevalence estimates. One recent study by Guo et al reported that diabetes mellitus was a risk factor for rapid progression and poor prognosis of COVID\u201019.18 A meta\u2010analysis including 6263 COVID\u201019 cases has identified that preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus were strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID\u201019.19 However, very few studies have assessed the direct association between cardio\u2010metabolic disease and several important outcomes including in\u2010hospital mortality, COVID\u2010related complications, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation among patients with COVID\u201019. The present study found that patients with COVID\u201019 with cardio\u2010metabolic disease were more common in COVID\u2010related complications including ARDS, acute heart injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infection, hypoproteinemia, and coagulopathy, were more admitted to the ICU, required more mechanical ventilation therapy, and had a higher risk of mortality compared with patients without cardio\u2010metabolic disease. Moreover, our study demonstrated that patients with COVID\u201019 with hypertension and cerebrovascular disease may be independent risk factors for all\u2010cause mortality in patients with COVID\u201019. All these data suggest that patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection who had underlying cardio\u2010metabolic disease should be hospitalized earlier and get more medical intervention.Several studies of COVID\u201019 have proposed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 induces a cytokine storm in the body, generates a series of immune responses, and causes changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes.4, 20 In the present study, we found that patients with COVID\u201019 with cardio\u2010metabolic disease had higher levels of several inflammation\u2010related biomarkers such as CRP, procalcitonin, the absolute count of neutrophils and white blood cells, and lactate dehydrogenase compared with patients without cardio\u2010metabolic disease. These data provide further evidence for the presence of cytokine storm that can further contribute to complications. For the inflammatory storm, several studies indicated that d\u2010dimer was significantly higher in severe cases than in moderate cases with COVID\u201019.21 Our study found that patients with cardio\u2010metabolic disease had higher levels of d\u2010dimer and higher incidence of coagulopathy than patients without cardio\u2010metabolic disease. According to our results, we found that the coagulation and inflammation\u2010related biomarkers had a strong relationship with COVID\u201019 related death, influenced the relationship between cardio\u2010metabolic diseases and the COVID\u201019 related death. So we speculated that the relationship between cardio\u2010metabolic diseases and COVID\u201019\u2010related death may be modified by coagulation and inflammation\u2010related biomarkers. Guo et al hypothesized that hypoxia\u2010induced molecules can activate thrombin directly, and the activation of monocyte\u2010macrophages would also secrete a mass of tissue factors and activate the exogenous coagulation pathway, which lead to an overall hypercoagulable state or even disseminated intravascular coagulation.18\nRecent studies have confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 uses the same cell entry receptor (angiotensin\u2010 converting enzyme II) as SARS\u2010CoV, which does not use other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4.22 This leads to the activation of CD4+ T cells, which proliferate and differentiate into Th1 cells that secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20106, interferon, and granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor; this can eventually develop into a cytokine storm, which can cause progression to ARDS, multiple organ failure, and even death.23 Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are the 2 types of renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system inhibitors widely used for treating hypertension. This may be one of the underlying mechanisms why patients with COVID\u201019 with hypertension or cerebrovascular disease had more rates of worse outcomes. But there were also studies that did not support the significant interference of hypertension on COVID\u201019 lethality.24 Previously published data have shown that use of renin\u2010angiotensin\u2010aldosterone system inhibitors by patients with COVID\u201019 was associated with a reduced risk of all\u2010cause mortality.25, 26 Therefore, some researchers have hypothesized that high angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme II expression could be deleterious during the contamination phase, whereas the high angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme II expression could, in contrast, be beneficial during the inflammation phase and may possibly prevent organ injury in COVID\u201019.27\nAn earlier report of 72\u00a0314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the overall case\u2010fatality rate was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44\u00a0672 confirmed cases).28 A research study of 1099 patients with COVID\u201019 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China reported that the morality was 1.4%.5 In the present study the mortality is 8.29%, higher than the reports mentioned above. We proposed that our data were from mortality in hospital patients in Hubei province; the patients had more severe disease than those in the temporary treatment centers (as Fangcang hospitals), and the patients out of Hubei province, subsequently the mortality was higher. Moreover, our study demonstrated that patients with COVID\u201019 with hypertension and cerebrovascular disease also had an increased risk of death, and the more cardio\u2010metabolic diseases the patients had, the higher the morbidity patients with COVID\u201019 presented.The study also has some limitations. First, because of the retrospective, multiple\u2010center, and real\u2010world study design, some information, such as patients' height, weight, several laboratory items (such as glycosylated hemoglobin) and lipid\u2010lowering and other cardio\u2010preventive treatments were not available for all patients. We can only draw correlations rather than causal relationships between cardio\u2010metabolic disease and COVID\u201019. Second, study samples were only from Hubei province, China; thus more studies in other regions or even other countries might provide a more comprehensive understanding of COVID\u201019. For the data analysis, there was no adjustment for multiple testing and an inflated type\u20101 error was made. However, this study is one of the largest retrospective, multicenter, and real\u2010world studies among patients with COVID\u201019. Compared with the study in New York City,16 all the cases of the present study had a definite end point, and we all have more than 1\u00a0month follow\u2010up of these cases. The relatively rich clinical data and numerous events also strengthen the results. The conclusion will help clinicians to identify high\u2010risk patients. ConclusionWe found that cardio\u2010metabolic disease was a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019, and was associated with higher risks of in\u2010hospital mortality. Hypertension and cerebrovascular disease may be 2 important diseases associated with in\u2010hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, and smoking. More intensive attention should be paid to those patients with COVID\u201019 who had underlying cardio\u2010metabolic disease.
