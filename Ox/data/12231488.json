{"title": "High-frequency oscillatory ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: a randomized, controlled trial", "pubDate": "2002", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1164/rccm.2108052", "PMID": "12231488", "abstract": "Observational studies of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in adults with the acute respiratory distress syndrome have demonstrated improvements in oxygenation. We designed a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation with conventional ventilation in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome; 148 adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pa(O2)/fraction of inspired oxygen <or= 200 mm Hg on 10 or more cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure) were randomized to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (n = 75) or conventional ventilation (n = 73). Applied mean airway pressure was significantly higher in the high-frequency oscillation group compared with the conventional ventilation group throughout the first 72 hours (p = 0.0001). The high-frequency oscillation group showed early (less than 16 hours) improvement in Pa(O2)/fraction of inspired oxygen compared with the conventional ventilation group (p = 0.008); however, this difference did not persist beyond 24 hours. Oxygenation index decreased similarly over the first 72 hours in both groups. Thirty-day mortality was 37% in the high-frequency oscillation group and was 52% in the conventional ventilation group (p = 0.102). The percentage of patients alive without mechanical ventilation at Day 30 was 36% and 31% in the high-frequency oscillation and conventional ventilation groups, respectively (p = 0.686). There were no significant differences in hemodynamic variables, oxygenation failure, ventilation failure, barotraumas, or mucus plugging between treatment groups. We conclude that high-frequency oscillation is a safe and effective mode of ventilation for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults.", "author": [{"author": "Stephen Derdak", "affiliation": ["Pulmonary/Critical Care Medicine, Wilford Hall Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas 78236, USA. sderdak@mac.com"], "href": "/?term=Derdak+S&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Sangeeta Mehta", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Mehta+S&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Thomas E Stewart", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Stewart+TE&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Terry Smith", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Smith+T&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Mark Rogers", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Rogers+M&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Timothy G Buchman", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Buchman+TG&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Brian Carlin", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Carlin+B&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Stuart Lowson", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Lowson+S&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "John Granton", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Granton+J&cauthor_id=12231488"}, {"author": "Multicenter Oscillatory Ventilation For Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (MOAT) Study Investigators", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Multicenter+Oscillatory+Ventilation+For+Acute+Respiratory+Distress+Syndrome+Trial+%28MOAT%29+Study+Investigators%5BCorporate+Author%5D"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["12231488", "35054013", "34765495", "33898903", "33638098", "32313052", "32005285", "31297448", "31258917", "31197492", "31110864", "31060090", "30460252", "30419903", "30202530", "30105416", "29743121", "29675732", "29236845", "28930639", "28785882", "28770093", "28151425", "27855477", "27799777", "27790273", "27577052", "27525106", "27522446", "27043185", "26955891", "26662814", "26495977", "26380993", "26266914", "26078614", "25997046", "25929255", "25829644", "25041589", "24887179", "24886674", "24760513", "24667919", "24550626", "24215377", "23974630", "23881653", "23853049", "23844839", "23825769", "23754904", "23546490", "23497577", "23354252", "23339640", "23132266", "23093038", "22850883", "22383921", "22096349", "22035562", "22034606", "21738527", "21725276", "21647845", "21560002", "21538204", "21369813", "21336109", "21156085", "21119333", "20949287", "20948686", "20732987", "20639755", "20614248", "20562704", "20232043", "20130832", "19548120", "19475349", "19291279", "19257907", "19014575", "18826605", "18820119", "18670760", "18581171", "18427090", "17952404", "17885748", "17855672", "17805492", "17680186", "17565024", "17563879", "17375267", "17184554", "17029653", "16999870", "16936359", "16934131", "16848915", "16836767", "16792808", "16750078", "16606436", "16584548", "16542488", "16539706", "16507163", "16469130", "16464246", "16137379", "16137357", "16044251", "15753721", "15717186", "15650866", "15221119", "12974971", "12974963", "12923623", "12897997", "12493065"], "body": ""}
