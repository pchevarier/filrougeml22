The co-transcriptional nature of mRNA processing has permitted the evolution of coupling mechanisms that coordinate transcription with mRNA capping, splicing, editing and 3\u2032 end formation. Recent experiments using sophisticated new methods for analysis of nascent RNA have provided important insights into the relative amount of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional processing, the relationship between mRNA elongation and processing, and the role of the Pol II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) in regulating these processes. Messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) are made by a three-step process: first, the transcription of a DNA template by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to make a pre-mRNA; second, the maturation of the pre-mRNA by processing factors; and third, packaging of the mature mRNA with proteins to make a particle that is competent for export to and translation in the cytoplasm. Maturation of most pre-mRNAs requires attachment of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5\u2032 end, intron excision together with exon ligation, and formation of a 3\u2032 end by cleavage and addition of a non-templated poly(A) tail (FIG. 1). Some mRNAs are also edited by selective deamination of adenosines and cytosines.Open in a separate windowFigure 1The major co-transcriptional mRNA processing stepsHuman protein names are given throughout. a | The RNA is shown in green; both GTP and the added guanosine cap (Gp) are shown in blue. The mRNA-capping enzyme in metazoans is bifunctional and has both triphosphatase and guanylyl-transferase activities that remove the \u03b3-phosphate of the nascent transcript and transfer GMP from the GTP donor, respectively. The methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is converted to S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), which results in the 7-methylguanosine cap (shown in pink). b | Splicing clips out an intron or intervening sequences as a lariat and ligates the flanking exons together through two transesterification reactions. Conserved intronic splicing elements are indicated in red. Spliceosomal U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) are shown, but numerous spliceosomal proteins are omitted79. c | 3\u2032 ends of mRNAs are formed by coupled cleavage and polyadenylation. Cleavage of mammalian pre-mRNAs occurs \u223c25 bases downstream of a consensus sequence (AAUAAA) and is carried out by the multisubunit complex (shown in purple), which comprises cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) that bears the endonuclease, and cleavage factors I and II (CFIm and CFIIm). Poly(A) polymerase (PAP) adds the poly(A) tail. 3\u2032 ends of non-polyadenylated histone mRNAs (not shown) are also made co-transcriptionally by a cleavage complex that has many subunits in common with CstF and CPSF. The 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 RNA exonuclease 2 (XRN2) degrades RNA downstream of the cleavage site and facilitates transcription termination. d | Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is carried out by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR), which deaminate adenosines into inosines. The folded GLUR-2 pre-mRNA substrate is shown with the exon in blue and intron in grey. Pi, inorganic phosphate. Part b is modified with permission from Chen & Cheng (2012) Biosci. Rep.\n32, 345-359. \u00a9 Biochemical Society.187Textbooks often describe mRNA biogenesis as a pathway in which transcription is followed by capping, 3\u2032 end formation and finally splicing. This scheme is consistent with the reconstitution of all of these reactions in vitro independently of one another. However, in living cells, transcription and processing are mostly not sequential but simultaneous; that is, processing is co-transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional. This is graphically shown by \u2018Miller spread\u2019 electron micrographs of introns being excised from nascent transcripts that are still attached to Pol II on the DNA template1 (FIG. 2a). Co-transcriptionality enhances the efficiency and the accuracy of pre-mRNA maturation2 and allows novel interactions with regulatory implications. These include communication between splicing and chromatin modifications3,4,5, as well as control of 3\u2032 end processing by the spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)6. Powerful imaging and next-generation sequencing methods have recently yielded a wealth of new information about when and where transcripts are processed in the nucleus.Open in a separate windowFigure 2The co-transcriptional nature of pre-mRNA processinga | Transcription of a gene and co-transcriptional processing of nascent transcripts are shown.\u2018Miller spread\u2019 electron micrograph (left) and its interpretation (right) are shown for a Drosophila melanogaster embryonic gene. The electron micrograph shows the DNA template with several engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules and their associated nascent RNA transcripts with bound proteins (seen as dark blobs) that extend on either side of the DNA. Grey and white arrows mark introns that are spliced out co-transcriptionally. The black arrow indicates the direction of transcription along the DNA template. b | A co-transcriptional mRNA processing scheme is shown. A transcribed gene is shown with multiple polymerases, and the transcription start site is indicated with a green flag. Processing reactions (shown by curved black arrows) are carried out by Pol II-associated factors that act on the nascent transcript (shown in red) at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites (5\u2032SS and 3\u2032SS) and the poly(A) site (AAUAAA). Capping factors (CFs, including the mRNA-capping enzyme and guanine-7-methyltransferase) and 3\u2032 end processing/termination factors all bind directly to the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II (but not all factors that bind to the CTD are shown). Transcription elongation (shown by straight black arrows) occurs at variable rates with strong pauses near the transcription start site and downstream of the poly(A) site (shown by pause signs). Proteins that make direct contacts with the CTD are shown in bold, and the dynamic nature of binding is indicated by dashed arrows. CTD phosphorylation changes during the transcription cycle with high levels of phospho-Ser5 (represented by the CTD in blue) at the 5\u2032end (which binds to CFs) and high levels of phospho-Ser2 (represented by the CTD in green) at the 3\u2032end (which binds to the PCF11 subunit of cleavage factor II (CFIIm) (shown in orange)). Note that some 3\u2032end processing factors \u2014 including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), CFs and the cap-binding complex (CBC) \u2014 are present on transcription elongation complexes throughout the length of genes. Nucleosomes that wrap the DNA template have different densities and methylation patterns in exons and introns3. Splicing and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (shown as green balls) by the methyltransferase SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2) may influence one another to establish and maintain splicing patterns (shown by the grey arrow).

Even post-transcriptional mRNA processing is not necessarily uncoupled from transcription, as commitment to a processing step such as splicing could occur co-transcriptionally even though actual intron excision is completed after release of pre-mRNA from a gene. Groundbreaking work showed that promoter elements can affect the decision to include an alternatively spliced exon7, and transcription initiation and elongation factors were subsequently found to influence capping8, splicing9\u201311 and 3\u2032 end formation12,13. Conversely, processing factors have been implicated as effectors of transcription initiation or elongation14\u201318. In summary, the interdependence of transcription and processing has blurred the once clear distinction between transcription and processing factors.The cellular transcription, processing and export machineries seem to have co-evolved to allow spatio-temporal coupling of the reactions that they carry out. Coupling in space is achieved by recruitment mechanisms that localize RNA packaging and processing factors to the right place to act on the nascent transcript. Coupling in time, or kinetic coupling, is achieved by coordinating the rates of elongation and processing of the transcript (BOX 1). The transcription elongation rate determines the delay between the appearances of upstream and downstream elements in the nascent pre-mRNA, which might compete with one another for RNA-binding and processing factors.Box 1Kinetic coupling and transcription elongationThe notion that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the splicing apparatus have co-evolved to permit kinetic coupling is consistent with the fact that slow elongation seems to be a selected trait. Conserved amino acid residues with charged side chains that project into the side channel of Pol II are predicted to greatly impede diffusion of nucleoside triphosphates into the active site and thereby slow elongation163.During the elongation phase of the transcription cycle (that is, initiation, elongation and termination), Pol II spends most of its time in a paused state. Pausing is detected experimentally in vivo as a local build-up of Pol II density by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) or by nuclear run-on assay. However, variations in apparent Pol II density should be interpreted cautiously, as its relationship to elongation rate in vivo is not fully understood164.On many metazoan genes, transcription is punctuated by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 pauses, which causes Pol II to pile up at the 5\u2032 end near the transcription start site and at the 3\u2032 end 1\u20132 kb downstream of the poly(A) site. The 5\u2032 pause is imposed by negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), and it is relieved by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which phosphorylates NELF and the carboxy-terminal domain of Pol II165. In budding yeast, which lacks NELF, there is a much less prominent 5\u2032 pause72. In addition to two major pauses, Pol II pauses for shorter periods at numerous sites within genes.The average net rate of transcription (\u223c2 kb per minute on human genes) is therefore a function of the maximum elongation rate between pauses (which is estimated at 4.3 kb per minute59), and the frequency and duration of pauses. By using global run-on sequencing (Gro-seq)166 to study the progress of Pol II along genes following gene activation, one study uncovered a remarkable variation in elongation rate by more than fourfold between genes and cell types. Elongation rate even accelerated markedly within a gene58. Similarly, a threefold change in elongation rate was observed at a yeast gene in different phases of the cell cycle167. Therefore, kinetic coupling mechanisms probably need to be able to adjust to considerable variation in elongation rate.In this Review, I discuss mRNP biogenesis from the perspective of the recruitment and kinetic competition models for coupling transcription with mRNA capping, splicing, editing and 3\u2032 end formation. I highlight recent experiments that illuminate the following questions: how much mRNA processing is co-transcriptional and how much of it is post-transcriptional? What is the relationship between elongation of the nascent RNA transcript and mRNA processing? And what is the role of the Pol II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and its phosphorylation \u2018code\u2019 in controlling recruitment of processing factors to the transcription elongation complex (TEC)? Mechanism of co-transcriptional couplingThe recruitment modelTranscription by an \u2018in appropriate\u2019 RNA polymerase, such as Pol I or Pol III, impairs pre-mRNA maturation19,20. The \u2018fate\u2019 of a transcript is therefore determined by the polymerase that made it, and RNA Pol II is unique in that it supports coupling and hence efficient pre-mRNA processing. For the purpose of spatial coupling of transcription and pre-mRNA processing, Pol II is uniquely equipped with an appendage \u2014 the conserved CTD of the large subunit, which comprises heptad repeats with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS21 (BOX 2). The CTD acts as a \u2018landing pad\u2019 (REF. 22) that recruits processing factors to the TEC and binds directly to capping factors, splicing factors and 3\u2032 end processing factors (FIGS 2b, \u200b,3;3; reviewed in REFS 23\u201325). Recruitment of these factors to the CTD enhances mRNA maturation by the mass action effect of concentrating factors to their site of action, by allosteric activation26 and possibly also by facilitating co-transcriptional assembly of multisubunit processing factors27,28. In vitro, this domain stimulates all three major mRNA processing reactions26,29,30. The advantage of processing in close proximity to the CTD is shown by the fact that processing is inhibited if the CTD is deleted31 or if the transcript is cut loose from the polymerase prematurely by ribozyme cleavage32,33. The CTD interaction surface is modified in a programmed way during the cycle of transcription initiation, elongation and termination by reversible phosphorylation at multiple positions24,34 (BOX 2; FIG. 3). It has been suggested that these changes constitute a CTD code that directs the traffic of factors on and off the landing pad.Open in a separate windowFigure 3The carboxy-terminal domain \u2018landing pad\u2019 of RNA polymerase IIThe core yeast RNA polymerase II structure (which consists of ten subunits and has a mass of \u223c500 kDa) and its extended carboxy-terminal domain (CTD, which contains 26 heptads with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS) are shown to scale. The human CTD has 52 heptads with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. The five phosphorylation (P) sites, two peptidyl-prolyl bonds (\u223c) that are converted between cis and trans conformations and three sites of O-GlcNAcylation (*) are indicated. Heptads with phospho-Ser5 make conserved direct interactions with the mRNA-capping enzyme, whereas heptads with phospho-Ser2 and phospho-Ser7 directly interact with the 3\u2032 end processing/termination factor Pcf11, and the integrator complex, respectively. The figure is modified, with permission, from REF. 188 \u00a9 (2001) American Association for the Advancement of Science.Box 2The carboxy-terminal domain \u2018landing pad\u2019 and its codeThe carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit comprises a series of heptad repeats with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS that is conserved from fungi to humans but is absent from Pol I and Pol III. The CTD is the target of numerous modifications that are remodelled in a synchronized manner with the transcription cycle24,168. The human CTD has 52 repeats, and each heptad can be modified by phosphorylation at five positions (Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5 and Ser7)24,169, by peptidyl-prolyl bond isomerization at two positions and by O-GlcNacylation at three positions (Thr4, Ser5 and Ser7)170 (FIG. 2b). As a result, the potential number of CTD isoforms is far greater than the number of atoms in the universe. Each CTD phospho-isoform has a profile along the length of the average gene that reflects its particular dynamics. On a typical gene, the levels of phospho-Ser5 and phospho-Ser7 decrease in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction; conversely, the levels of phospho-Ser2, phospho-Thr4 and phospho-Tyr1 increase in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction110,111,143,169,171 (FIG. 2b). It should be borne in mind that studies that map phosphorylated CTDs rely on reactivity with antibodies that are specific to each phospho-isoform, which do not necessarily give a linear readout. This is because phospho-epitopes could be masked by interacting proteins, and when they are accessible, they may not be recognized equally well in all contexts within the tandem heptad array169.Whereas 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 profiles of Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation in the CTD are fairly uniform in yeast, there is more variation among metazoan genes. For example, at the 5\u2032 ends of some human genes there are non-canonical peaks of phospho-Ser2, the functional importance of which is unknown107 but could be related to recruitment of cleavage and polyadenylation factors that can occur at 5\u2032 ends50. On polycistronic genes in Caenorhabditis elegans, peaks of phospho-Ser2 in the CTD are reiterated at each poly(A) site172. Whether poly(A) sites dictate where hyperphosphorylation of Ser2 occurs or whether phospho-Ser2 dictates processing at a poly(A) site remains to be resolved.Phosphates in the CTD are attached and detached during transcription by multiple kinases and phosphatases. In metazoans, phospho-Ser2 is added by cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) and CDK12 (REF. 173), in addition to CDK9, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and several super-elongator complexes with distinct activities174,175. Additions of phosphate groups to Ser5 and Ser7 are mediated by the CDK7 subunit of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), but CDK9 can also modify these residues, at least in vitro176,177,178. Several CTD phosphatases probably work both co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally to remodel the \u2018landing pad\u2019; an example is SSU72, which is coupled to mRNA 3\u2032 end formation179 through interaction with the cleavage and polyadenylation factor symplekin180. In summary, cycles of CTD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation integrate with the cycle of transcription initiation, elongation and termination, and prepare the landing pad to receive and release proteins.In yeast, almost 100 proteins bind to the phosphorylated CTD either directly or indirectly181. The CTD interaction domain (CID) is conserved among several binding proteins from yeast to mammals, but many other protein domains are able to contact the CTD138,182. The CTD is remarkably flexible, and CIDs have adapted to bind to it in multiple conformations28,183,184. CTD phosphorylation can either enhance or inhibit binding interactions. Therefore, phospho-Ser2 enhances binding of the yeast 3\u2032 end processing/termination factors Pcf11 and Rtt103 (REFS 145,185), and probably also the mammalian splicing factor U2 auxiliary factor 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65)121,147. Phospho-Ser5 promotes binding of the mRNA-capping enzyme26 and the yeast termination factor Nrd1 (REFS 144,184), whereas phospho-Ser7 binds to the integrator complex that processes the 3\u2032 ends of mammalian small nuclear RNAs186. Contacts with the aromatic side chain of Tyr1 stabilize most complexes with the CTD, and phosphorylation of this residue probably triggers release of CTD-bound factors171,182. The tandem repeat of heptads in the CTD provides an excess of binding sites over what is absolutely required149 and also permits cooperative binding to adjacent sites, which may promote co-transcriptional assembly of the 3\u2032 end processing machinery28.Many proteins that land on the CTD do not remain there but \u2018hop off\u2019 onto other proteins or onto the transcript. As reactions that exchange these proteins are important for coordinated biogenesis of messenger ribonucleoproteins, interactions with the CTD have probably evolved to be easily reversible23, which is consistent with the observation that mutation of a conserved residue in the CID of Pcf11 actually increases its affinity for the CTD28.The kinetic coupling modelKinetic coupling (also known as kinetic competition)35,36 is a generalization of the \u2018first come, first served model\u2019 of splicing, which proposed that 5\u2032 introns will be removed before 3\u2032 introns because they get a \u2018head start\u2019 on spliceosome assembly37. As transcription proceeds, RNA sequence targets on the nascent transcript become available to bind to proteins and complementary RNA elements in a progression, the timing of which is set by the rate of elongation. If these RNA targets compete with one another for binding partners, then the elongation rate could affect the outcomes of co-transcriptional RNA processing events, because slow elongation lengthens the \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 for an upstream event to occur on the nascent transcript before facing competition from a downstream RNA sequence element (FIG. 4). Kinetic competition could have a major influence on alternative splicing, which occurs at \u223c100,000 sites on >95% of human pre-mRNAs and is a major source of proteome diversity36. If a weak upstream 3\u2032 splice site that borders an alternative exon competes with a strong downstream 3\u2032 splice site, then slow elongation and a long window of opportunity for recognition of the upstream site should favour inclusion of the alternative exon (FIG. 4a). Consistent with this prediction, slow Pol II elongation enhanced inclusion of some, but not all, alternative exons, including exon 33 of the human fibronectin 1 gene (FN1)38.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Kinetic coupling of transcription with folding and processing of the pre-mRNATranscription elongation rate determines the length of the \u2018window of opportunity\u2019 for an upstream event to occur on the nascent RNA before it must compete with a downstream event. Slow elongation widens the window of opportunity for commitment to processing at upstream splice sites and poly(A) sites. This could lead to inclusion of alternative exons (part a) and 3\u2032end formation at upstream poly(A) sites (part b), which results in mRNAs with shorter 3\u2032untranslated regions. Slow elongation also favours RNA folding by base-pairing of proximal complementary sequences (represented by interlocking shapes) (part c), which results in sequential rather than non-sequential folding72,126. Part c is modified, with permission, from REF. 134 \u00a9 (2006) Annual Reviews. Co-transcriptional cappingThe first step in the maturation of a pre-mRNA is attachment of a 7-methylguanosine cap by a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 linkage (FIG. 1a). Nascent transcripts as short as 20\u201330 nucleotides become capped39 shortly after their 5\u2032 ends emerge from the RNA exit channel, which is adjacent to the CTD attachment point on Pol II. This reaction was thought to proceed to completion on all Pol II transcripts, but there is now reason to doubt the infallibility of capping. Newly discovered nuclear and cytoplasmic quality control mechanisms in yeast and human cells specifically remove unmethylated caps and then degrade the transcripts in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction40\u201342. Moreover, a cytoplasmic capping activity has been reported, which is consistent with the possibility of post-transcriptional capping43,44. The extent of co-transcriptional capping has yet to be determined by a genome-wide analysis of nascent transcripts, but these recent findings suggest that it is not as universal as previously suspected and may even be regulated45. Capping is the only processing step that can be reversed in vivo, and recent evidence suggests that decapping occurs not only in the cytoplasm but also co-transcriptionally in the nucleus, where it provokes premature termination of transcription46,47. The CTD with phospho-Ser5 residues in the heptad repeats has a crucial role in co-transcriptional capping by directly interacting with both guanine-7-methyltransferase and the mRNA-capping enzyme, which it then activates26,48,49 (FIG. 3).Capping and transcriptional pausingCapping of short nascent transcripts coincides approximately with the promoter-proximal pause in transcription elongation at many metazoan genes39 (BOX 1). The human mRNA-capping enzyme, guanine-7-methyltransferase and the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) are all recruited to genes at this pause and can remain associated with Pol II all the way to the 3\u2032 ends of genes50,51 (FIG. 2b). The mRNA-capping enzyme interacts with the elongation factor DSIF (also known as SPT4/5) (BOX 1), and DSIF-dependent pausing may be a checkpoint to ensure proper capping before transcription resumes in mammals52\u201354. Interestingly, the HIV-1 Tat protein, which activates transcription elongation by binding to positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), is one of the few transcription factors that have been reported to stimulate co-transcriptional capping directly8. The capped nascent transcript can also enhance elongation indirectly through interaction of CBC with P-TEFb15. An important future challenge is to clarify the cause-and-effect relationships that link capping with transcriptional pausing and elongation. Co-transcriptional splicingAssessing the extent of co-transcriptional splicingSplicing can happen co-transcriptionally because it occurs over a period of several minutes, which coincides with the time needed to transcribe a gene of average length. On the basis of intron half-lives (0.4\u20137 minutes55\u201357) and transcription rates (1.8\u20134.0 kb per minute57\u201360) in vivo, it is predicted that splicing will occur by the time Pol II has elongated \u223c5 kb past a 3\u2032 splice site, and this is exactly what was seen in seminal electron microscopy studies in Drosophila melanogaster and Chironomus tentans1,61. Processing of non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) from within introns in mammalian cells can also occur co-transcriptionally62. Moreover, classic pulse-labelling studies detected a proportion of large heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) molecules, which were presumably unspliced, with 3\u2032 ends that had already been polyadenylated63. Assuming that hnRNAs are precursors of mRNAs, splicing of these transcripts must occur post-transcriptionally. Only in the past two years has the extent of co-transcriptional splicing been compared with that of post-transcriptional splicing in comprehensive genome-wide studies.This breakthrough was achieved by deep sequencing of RNA populations (RNA-seq) of human, mouse and fly samples that were enriched for nascent transcripts (reviewed in REF. 64). When interpreting these experiments, it is important to recall that, unlike mature mRNA, a clean nascent RNA preparation is enriched in sequences from 5\u2032 ends of genes because most transcripts are incomplete (FIG. 5a). Several studies sequenced RNA from urea-washed chromatin fractions65. However, chromatin-associated RNA is not precisely equivalent to nascent RNA, as these preparations can contain transcripts with mature polyadenylated 3\u2032 ends66,67, and it is also difficult to eliminate the possibility of artefactual RNA interactions that are formed during cell extraction68.Open in a separate windowFigure 5Global co-transcriptional splicing detected by deep sequencing of nascent RNAa | Nascent transcripts are mostly incomplete, and 5\u2032 sequences are therefore over-represented relative to 3\u2032 sequences across the gene in nascent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles. b | Co-transcriptional splicing of nascent transcripts causes a saw-tooth profile in read counts from sequencing of total RNA owing to rapid removal and degradation of sequences from the 3\u2032 ends of introns shortly after the 3\u2032 splice site has been transcribed. Figure is modified, with permission, from REF. 74 \u00a9 (2011) Macmillian Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved.Notwithstanding this caveat, sequencing of chromatin-associated RNA from human, mouse and fly samples66,69\u201371 detected an enrichment of exon over neighbouring intron sequences as expected if splicing is substantially co-transcriptional. In budding yeast, extensive co-transcriptional splicing was also detected by native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq; that is, sequencing of the 3\u2032 ends of RNAs that co-immunoprecipitated with Pol II)72 and by micro-array analysis of chromatin-associated RNA73. In D. melanogaster S2 cells and fly heads, introns were more frequently spliced co-transcriptionally than post-transcriptionally in >75% of cases70. Similarly, at a subset of constitutively expressed genes in mouse macrophages, most introns were spliced co-transcriptionally most of the time66; in a human erythropoietic cell line, the median level of co-transcriptional splicing was 75%71. However, the frequency of co-transcriptional splicing in mouse liver cells was reported to be only about half of that69.An unambiguous indicator of co-transcriptional splicing is the specific under-representation of sequences at the 3\u2032 ends of introns due to the excision and degradation of these sequences shortly after transcription of the 3\u2032 splice site74. As a result, the total RNA-seq read counts have saw-tooth profiles (FIG. 5b). Using this criterion, the frequency of co-transcriptional splicing was shown to differ between tissues; in humans, it is higher in the liver than in the brain and higher in adult brain than in fetal brain74.Independent support for widespread co-transcriptional splicing was provided by sequencing of pulse-labelled RNA from human B lymphocytes, which showed that 65% of intron sequences had already been spliced out and degraded after only five minutes75. Furthermore, by using an antibody against a specific phosphorylated isoform of the splicing protein SF3B to detect active spliceosomes, researchers found that >80% of active spliceosomes were bound to chromatin in HeLa cells27, which suggests that they are working co-transcriptionally. The 10\u201320% of active spliceosomes that act post-transcriptionally localize at nuclear speckles76. In summary, several independent approaches show that, in multiple species and cell types, co-transcriptional splicing operates on a large proportion of introns most of the time. However, a substantial amount of splicing is also completed post-transcriptionally, and such delayed splicing can control the timing of gene activation77,78.Kinetic regulation of splicingBy its nature, the degree of co-transcriptional splicing for each intron depends on how quickly it is spliced relative to the time for Pol II to travel from the 3\u2032 splice site to the end of the gene and for the transcript to be cut loose at the poly(A) site. Hence, relative rates of splicing, transcription elongation and poly(A) site cleavage can all affect the extent of co-transcriptional splicing. Consistent with this model, upstream introns that have longer windows of opportunity are, with some exceptions70, spliced more co-transcriptionally than downstream introns69\u201371 as predicted by the first come, first served model37.One general conclusion from nascent RNA-seq is that alternatively spliced introns are removed more slowly than constitutive introns70,71,79,80. In two well-studied cases \u2014 human FN1 exon 33 and SRC exon N1 \u2014 splicing that skips the alternative exon is slower than splicing that includes the alternative exon, but all of these events are completed co-transcriptionally most of the time79. The reasons that alternative splicing tends to be slower are unclear, but the relative weakness of their splice sites is probably a contributing factor81.Elongation rate can affect alternative splicing decisions38 by determining the duration of windows of opportunity for competing upstream and downstream events on the nascent transcript36 (FIG. 4). Elongation rate could influence where spliceosome components assemble and where sequence-specific splicing regulators bind, which may in turn determine whether they enhance or inhibit exon inclusion (reviewed in REF. 82).The first come, first served model predicts that when an alternatively spliced exon is included, the 5\u2032 flanking intron should be removed before the 3\u2032 flanking intron (FIG. 4a) but, unexpectedly, examination of nascent RNA intermediates showed that when human FN1 exon 25 or exon 33 is included, it is actually the 3\u2032 flanking intron that is removed first79,83. One can rationalize these findings if a stable commitment complex84 forms on the 5\u2032 intron before the 3\u2032 intron is recognized, even though excision of the 5\u2032 intron is delayed83. Formation of a commitment complex on the 5\u2032 intron would be favoured by slow transcription elongation that affords a longer window of opportunity for upstream events (FIG. 4a). Currently, little is known about the stability of committed splicing complexes in vivo, but U2 and U5 snRNPs dwell at the site of transcription for 15\u201330 seconds85 and intermediates can persist in vitro for >10 minutes86,87. An important future challenge is to gain a genome-wide perspective on how elongation rate affects constitutive and alternative splicing. In this regard, it is interesting to note that, in fly and yeast cells, slow elongation is associated with enhanced intron removal70,88.Kinetic coupling implies that factors that coordinate elongation with mRNA processing exist. Such coupling factors are predicted to directly modulate both splicing and transcription elongation. Of note, nascent RNA-binding factors can also indirectly affect transcription elongation by preventing formation of R-loops (that is, extended RNA\u2013DNA hybrids) that slow down Pol II89. One candidate kinetic coupling factor is the abundant serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2; also known as SC35) that acts as a positive effector of elongation by interacting with P-TEFb18,90. Another candidate coupling factor is the DBC1\u2013ZIRD (DBIRD) complex, which associates with hnRNPs, enhances elongation and promotes selective exon skipping91. The RNA-binding protein KHDRBS1 (KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated protein 1; also known as SAM68) is another possible coupling regulator that influences alternative splicing and impairs transcription elongation in collaboration with BRM (also known as SMARCA2), which is the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeller. However, this effect of BRM is independent of chromatin remodelling92. An intriguing question is how kinetic coupling factors could modulate elongation rate to affect splicing of specific exons. One possibility is that it is achieved by local re-decoration of phosphate groups in the CTD of Pol II92,93, and another possibility is by local \u2018opening\u2019 of chromatin by hyperacetylation94 to accelerate elongation or \u2018closing\u2019 of chromatin by heterochromatinization95,96 to decelerate elongation.Interdependent pausing and splicingThe kinetic coupling model has provoked great interest in the relationship between splicing and transcriptional pausing. In yeast, in which most genes are short, Pol II pausing at 3\u2032 ends can provide time for co-transcriptional splicing73. Alternatively, there is evidence in yeast that the splicing machinery can manipulate transcription to induce pausing downstream of introns and to allow time for splicing to occur co-transcriptionally93. Whether splicing can induce pausing in metazoan cells has yet to be demonstrated97. Pausing imposed by a protein \u2018speed bump\u2019 that binds to a specific DNA sequence can also influence alternative splicing. Thus, binding of CCCTC-binding factor CTCF within genes correlates with the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons98. CTCF binding is prevented by CpG methylation, which indicates a potential mechanism for regulation of alternative splicing by DNA methylation.Widespread pausing at the front edge of positioned nucleosomes was revealed by NET-seq in yeast72. Pausing also often occurs at the beginning of mammalian exons99 either because of a higher density of nucleosomal speed bumps100 or because splicing induces pausing93. A strongly positioned nucleosome can slow down an elongating Pol II molecule by approximately six seconds relative to naked DNA; this delay is slightly reduced by histone acetylation101, which is implicated in splicing regulation94,102. It remains to be established whether such pauses, which are usually measured in seconds, have a meaningful effect on splicing that usually occurs on a timescale of minutes.Co-transcriptional versus post-transcriptional splicing: does it matter?Are there functional consequences associated with whether introns are spliced co-transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally? Whereas co-transcriptional splicing takes place at the gene, post-transcriptional splicing can occur either close to the gene in a chromatin environment or at distant sites throughout the nucleoplasm80, including at the periphery of nuclear speckles76. The location of splicing in the nucleus could be important if different RNA-binding proteins, which can determine RNA stability and cellular localization, were associated with transcripts that are spliced at different locations. Whether post-transcriptional splicing occurs close to the gene or elsewhere depends on how rapidly the RNA is released from the chromatin after cleavage at the poly(A) site. Estimated release times range from a few seconds to many minutes. Retention at the gene is characteristic of transcripts with processing defects that are destined for degradation by the exosome103\u2013105, but such retention might also facilitate completion of post-transcriptional processing66,67. It remains to be clarified whether retention at the gene following cleavage at the poly(A) site is common for mRNAs that are processed in a normal way. It will also be important to establish whether the local environment of splicing \u2014 be it at the gene, a speckle or elsewhere in the nucleus \u2014 can influence the ultimate fate of the transcript.Some introns have evolved to be spliced slowly, such as many alternatively spliced introns70,71, introns that harbour small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)75, and those that are substrates for RNA editing106. The hairy and enhancer of split 7 gene (Hes7), which controls somite segmentation in the mouse embryo, has a 1.8-kb intron that causes a 19-minute delay in expression of the protein when it is spliced. Hes7 regulates itself by a negative-feedback loop, and the splicing-dependent delay causes its expression to oscillate in a way that is abolished when the intron is deleted78.Most evidence suggests that slow splicing, which tends to be post-transcriptional, is specific to individual introns, but an apparent exception occurs when FUS expression is disrupted. FUS is a protein that binds to both RNA and the Pol II CTD107 and that is mutated in some patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The knockdown of fus in Xenopus laevis embryos specifically inhibited splicing of 3\u20135% of mRNAs, including those encoding regulators of gastrulation. Remarkably, all introns in the affected transcripts were retained to the same extent when expression of the fus protein was compromised, which suggests that, in these cases, the entire gene functions as an integrated unit with respect to splicing activity108. How FUS stimulates splicing throughout an entire pre-mRNA and whether it works co-transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally is still a mystery, but it could be related to its influence on phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD107. Adenosine-to-inosine editingRNA editing by deamination of adenosine residues to inosine residues is widespread in multicellular organisms and is necessary for maturation of a few mRNAs (including those encoding ion channels) and many non-coding RNAs. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is carried out by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR), the substrates of which are double-stranded guide RNA structures that are often formed by introns folding back on themselves and adjacent exon sequences (FIG. 1d). Such editing must therefore precede splicing, and introns that participate in A-to-I editing are characterized by slow splicing106. Nascent RNA-seq in D. melanogaster confirmed that editing is mainly co-transcriptional and that slow splicing of edited introns is an intrinsic property that does not require ADAR106. The Pol II CTD is implicated in delaying splicing of some edited introns by an unknown mechanism that ensures that editing can precede splicing109. In summary, slow splicing can enhance proper gene expression in several ways and seems to be a selected characteristic of specific introns. Co-transcriptional 3\u2032 end formationIndirect evidence suggests that co-transcriptional poly(A) site cleavage is the major pathway of mRNA 3\u2032 end maturation. Hence, yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factors localize at the 3\u2032 ends of transcribed genes throughout the genome110,111. Moreover, termination of transcription is a poly(A) site-dependent event112\u2013114, which means that poly(A) site recognition precedes or accompanies termination and must therefore be co-transcriptional. At most (but not all) genes115, cleavage at the poly(A) site probably provides the entry point for the RNA 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease XRN2 (or its yeast homologue Rat1) (FIG. 1c), which acts as a \u2018torpedo\u2019 to promote polymerase eviction from the DNA template116. In this scenario, both recognition and RNA cleavage at the poly(A) site must precede termination and therefore occur co-transcriptionally.In mammalian cells at least, mRNA 3\u2032 end processing can be fairly slow, with reaction times of 1\u20135 minutes60. Consequently, the rate of poly(A) site processing could be an important determinant of whether there is time for splicing to be completed co-transcriptionally. Splicing of the last intron is facilitated by recognition of the poly(A) site117; conversely, recognition of the last intron facilitates cleavage and polyadenylation118. This is one reason that introns stimulate gene expression119. Coupling of splicing with 3\u2032 end processing occurs through direct interaction of the U1 and U2 snRNPs and U2 auxiliary factor 65 kDa subunit (U2AF65) with cleavage factor I (CFIm) and with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF)120, all of which localize to transcribed genes50,121,122.Co-transcriptional coupling of terminal intron splicing and 3\u2032 end processing means that these reactions can occur in quick succession, but the order of events can differ between genes. At the C. tentans BR1 gene, most chromatin-associated polyadenylated transcripts are already spliced123. Similarly, splicing precedes 3\u2032 end processing at various human cellular genes55. By contrast, adenovirus transcripts are processed in the reverse order119. In summary, although 3\u2032 end processing and terminal intron splicing are coupled reactions, they do not occur in an obligatory order but in a gene-specific way that is probably determined by the strengths of the processing sites.Kinetic competition and alternative polyadenylationThe decision between processing alternative poly(A) sites controls the sequences that are present in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of >60% of human mRNAs. As 3\u2032UTR sequences are recognized by miRNAs and regulatory RNA-binding proteins, alternative polyadenylation can modulate both mRNA abundance and translational efficiency124. In some cancer cells, the balance between alternative poly(A) sites becomes biased in favour of upstream or proximal sites, which results in production of mRNAs with truncated 3\u2032UTRs that can evade normal regulatory mechanisms125,126. As most mRNA 3\u2032 end processing occurs co-transcriptionally, it is likely that the same is true for alternative polyadenylation decisions. Indeed, an important negative regulator of 3\u2032 end processing is the U1 snRNP6, which can access poly(A) sites in the nascent transcript through its association with Pol II127.The kinetic competition model predicts that if alternative poly(A) sites in the nascent transcript compete for processing factors, then slow elongation will lengthen the window of opportunity for processing at proximal sites128,129 (FIG. 4b). At several genes in mutant D. melanogaster with slow Pol II, proximal poly(A) sites were indeed favoured relative to wild type130. Similarly, a slow Pol II mutant in yeast favoured proximal termination sites for non-coding RNAs131. Kinetic competition is therefore likely to modulate the choices of co-transcriptional poly(A) sites and termination sites. It will be interesting to determine whether slow elongation contributes to the shift to the proximal poly(A) site in cancer cells. RNA folding and processingThe extent of co-transcriptional RNA processing depends on the position of the processing site relative to the end of the gene, the elongation rate and the sequence determinants that control reaction rate, including accessibility to processing factors. The way the nascent RNA folds can affect how it is processed, as such folding determines which elements are sequestered within secondary structures and which are available for interaction with proteins and other RNA sequences80,132. Sequestration of the intronic polypyrimidine tract (FIG. 1b) by folding into an RNA secondary structure impedes splicing and makes it post-transcriptional80. Folding of a nascent RNA depends on its rate of transcription (FIG. 4c). Slower transcription favours base-pairing between elements in the order in which they are transcribed (that is, sequential folding). Conversely, faster transcription permits more base-pairing between distant complementary sequences (that is, non-sequential folding), which favours the formation of branched structures over rodlike structures133,134. RNA folding at the 3\u2032 ends of yeast introns affects 3\u2032 splice site selection by sequestering cryptic 3\u2032 splice sites135. The way the RNA folds can also feedback on the rate of elongation, as regions of high secondary structure can favour faster transcription in vitro by impeding backtracking136. The physiological importance of the interplay between elongation rate, nascent RNA folding and mRNA processing remains an intriguing topic for future investigations. Recruiting RNA processing factorsRecruitment by the Pol II CTDThe CTD facilitates the two processing steps that are common to all Pol II transcripts \u2014 capping and 3\u2032 end formation \u2014 by making protein\u2013protein contacts that recruit, and in some cases allosterically activate, processing factors that work co-transcriptionally (BOX 2; FIG. 2b; reviewed in REFS 137,138). By contrast, splicing is not a universal processing step, and splicing factors could, in principle, be recruited either constitutively or on an \u2018as needed\u2019 basis to intron-containing genes.In budding yeast and mammalian cells, the U2, U5 and U6 snRNPs in the activated spliceosome are specifically located at intron-containing genes, which is consistent with recruitment by recognition of splicing signals in the nascent transcript51,97,139,140. However, the U1 snRNP is recruited to some mammalian genes regardless of intron status97,140, which is consistent with the fact that it co-purifies with Pol II124,140. The core splicing factor with the best characterized direct CTD interaction is U2AF65 (REF. 121) (FIG. 2b), which is not found at intron-less genes97,140. This indicates that it may be recruited through the CTD in an intron-specific way. In vitro, however, U2AF contacts short nascent transcripts that lack splice sites soon after they emerge from the Pol II exit channel141. In summary, there is rather heavy traffic of processing factors going to and from the TEC. A remaining problem is how this traffic is controlled to ensure that the right factors will be present when they are required.Satisfyingly, in some cases a CTD-binding factor colocalizes on genes in vivo with the CTD phosphoisoform that it recognizes in vitro (FIG. 2b). For example, the mRNA-capping enzyme and Nrd1 colocalize with peaks of CTD phosphorylated at Ser5 at 5\u2032 ends of yeast genes142\u2013144, and Pcf11 colocalizes with CTD phosphorylated at Ser2 at 3\u2032 ends145. These correlations are consistent with a code in which modifications of the CTD direct the binding and release of protein passengers on the TEC146 but, of course, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. It is also possible that, conversely, CTD-binding proteins modulate phosphorylation of the CTD as suggested for FUS, which regulates Ser2 phosphorylation107. Phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 has also been implicated in the control of transcription elongation, which suggests that the recruitment and kinetic coupling mechanisms do not operate entirely independently147,148.The CTD code has been elegantly tested in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using mutants that substitute each of the phosphorylation sites (Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, Ser5 and Ser7) in every heptad repeat149,150. Remarkably, the only phosphorylated residue required for viability is Ser5, which recruits the mRNA-capping enzyme. As few as two repeats that comprise ten residues with the sequence YSPT[pS]PSYSP (where pS denotes phosphoserine) are sufficient for viability. In a compelling experiment, the lethal Ser5Ala mutation was rescued by fusing the mRNA-capping enzyme to the carboxyl terminus of the Pol II large subunit, proving that the essential function of Ser5 phosphorylation in S. pombe is to recruit the mRNA-capping enzyme149.Although the phospho-Ser5 CTD code word for the mRNA-capping enzyme seems to be universal, other coded signals affect mRNA processing in gene-specific ways. The major Ser2 kinase in budding yeast Ctk1 is dispensable for viability151, but its inactivation causes gene-specific defects in transcription elongation and/or termination and in 3\u2032 end processing110,152. Thr4 and Ser7 phosphorylation of the CTD also have gene-specific effects on maturation of the non-polyadenylated 3\u2032 ends of histone mRNAs and small nuclear RNAs, respectively24.CTD-independent recruitmentIn addition to binding specified by the CTD code, proteins are also recruited to the TEC by other means. The yeast 3\u2032 end formation and termination factor Nrd1 binds to phospho-Ser5 heptads through the CTD interaction domain (CID) that is located in its amino terminus. However, this domain is not required for viability144, presumably because the protein can also bind to the nascent transcript through its RNA-binding domain. The CTD is not the only protein surface on the TEC that can recruit factors. The yeast mRNA localization factor She2 is passed to the nascent transcript after initial recruitment to the elongation factor Spt4/5, which travels with Pol II153. The mRNA-capping enzyme can also interact with a surface on Pol II that is distinct from the CTD154.Another potential platform for recruitment of processing factors to the site of transcription is the chromatin itself. Histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) can recruit RNA-binding proteins that are presumed to act on the nascent transcript when a polymerase passes by155,156. In this way, histone modifications could modulate alternative splicing (FIG. 2b). Similarly, H3K4me3 may indirectly recruit the U2 snRNP and thereby promote splicing157. How histone modifications are established at appropriate places to influence splicing is poorly understood, but this might involve binding of histone modifiers, such as deacetylases158 and the H3K36 methyltransferase SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2)159, to the phosphorylated CTD. Conversely, splicing promotes local H3K36 methylation, and histone modifications could therefore help to both establish and maintain stable patterns of alternative splicing160,161. ConclusionsRecent work has established a framework for understanding the spatiotemporal integration of mRNA processing with transcription by mechanisms of recruitment and kinetic competition. However, many questions about how these coupling mechanisms work to achieve accurate and regulated mRNP biogenesis remain to be resolved.We know little about how these coupling mechanisms intersect through factors (such as CTD phosphorylation) that affect both recruitment of processing factors and transcription elongation. The important CTD phosphorylation code words that regulate processing factor recruitment in metazoans have yet to be defined precisely, and how they are interpreted in gene-specific ways is still quite mysterious. Kinetic competition suggests ways in which elongation rate could affect alternative processing outcomes, such as whether to add a cap or not, to include or exclude an exon or a retained intron, to splice co-transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally, and to use an upstream or downstream poly(A) site. The model remains an intriguing but incompletely tested one. We do not yet know how widespread the effect of transcription elongation rate is on alternative mRNA processing decisions nor do we have a grasp on whether elongation rates within a gene are modulated to affect alternative processing. In vivo elongation rates seem to be far more variable than previously suspected, which raises the question of whether kinetic coupling can adjust rates of processing to compensate for changes in elongation rate. It remains possible that aspects of transcription other than elongation rate influence co-transcriptional mRNA processing, such as whether initiation of RNA synthesis occurs randomly or in bursts162. We also know little about whether cellular signalling pathways target coupling mechanisms to regulate whether splicing occurs co-transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally. Furthermore, the functional consequences of whether a transcript is processed co-transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally remain unexplored.

GlossaryCarboxy-terminal domain (CTD)Located in the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, the CTD is a signature feature of this polymerase that contains conserved heptad repeats (52 YSPTSPS repeats in humans) and is not found in RNA polymerases I and IIITranscription elongation complex (TEC)A complex of RNA polymerase that is stably bound to the DNA template, polymerase-bound proteins and the nascent RNA chainAlternative splicingThe most important mechanism by which the transcriptome is diversified through production of multiple mRNAs from a single gene. Alternatively spliced mRNAs differ in their coding and non-coding sequences as a result of selective inclusion and exclusion of exon and intron sequencesTranscription start siteThe site on the DNA where the first phosphodiester bond in a RNA transcript is formedCommitment complexA stable complex formed between an intron-containing pre-mRNA, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle bound to the 5\u2032 splice site, branch point-binding protein bound to the branch point and U2 auxiliary factor bound to the 3\u2032 splice site. Once formed, it remains committed to the completion of splicing even when challenged with an excess of pre-mRNA substrateR-loopsStructures that are formed by the hybridization of RNA transcripts to double-stranded DNA in which the displaced non-template DNA strands are looped out. Their recombinogenic nature causes genomic instabilityAlternative polyadenylationThe decision to process at one of multiple poly(A) sites that are present at the 3\u2032 ends of most human genes. This decision can have important functional consequences because it determines the sequence content of the 3\u2032 untranslated region, which controls mRNA stability and translational efficiency Footnotes Competing interests statement: The author declares no competing interests.
