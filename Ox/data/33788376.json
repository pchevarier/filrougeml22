Yet how it may influence important aspects of animal physiology like aging remains unclear. RNAPII pausing occurs at a huge fraction of eukaryotic genes (Core et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Min et\u00a0al.,\u00a02011) and is mediated by the functionally conserved negative elongation factor (NELF) complex comprised of four subunits (A, B, C/D, and E; Narita et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003; Wu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02005). NELF complex interacts with 5,6\u2010dichloro\u20101\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010ribobenzimidazole sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) and the hypophosphorylated form of RNAPII to induce its pausing at ~30\u201360 nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS; Wada et\u00a0al.,\u00a01998; Wu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003; Yamaguchi et\u00a0al.,\u00a01999). Phosphorylation of NELF complex and RNAPII by the positive transcription elongation factor\u2010b (P\u2010TEFb) evicts NELF complex, thereby releasing RNAPII for productive elongation (Lis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02000).Interestingly, perturbations of different NELF subunits impact transcriptional output and expression patterns in cell\u2010types specific manner (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010). In vivo studies showed that NELF\u2010mediated promoter\u2010proximal stalling of RNAPII ensures robust and coordinated gene activation in response to different types of signals and external stimuli (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010, 2012; Saunders et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013; Williams et\u00a0al.,\u00a02015). In Drosophila S2 cells and larvae, genes affected by NELF depletion are enriched for heat\u2010shock and immune responses (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008, 2012). As many of these genes are linked to the process of aging, it is plausible that NELF may play a role in regulating animal lifespan.We found that the level of NELF\u2010A, but not other subunits, regulates adult fitness and lifespan in fly. Both heterozygous NELF\u2010A mutants and neuronal\u2010depleted NELF\u2010A flies exhibited increased locomotor activity and lifespan as compared to their control siblings. Halving the level of NELF\u2010A reduces RNAPII pausing at heat\u2010shock protein (Hsp) genes, leading to significant upregulation of their expression. Elevated level of HSPs in the brain and head tissues suppresses the accumulation of protein aggregates and reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuates systemic inflammation, and enhances animal resistance against external oxidative stress during aging. Similarly, we observed enhanced stress resistance in human cells depleted of NELF\u2010A, whose N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal region is highly conserved to Drosophila NELF\u2010A protein (Wu et\u00a0al.,\u00a02005). In heterozygous NELF\u2010A mutant flies, reduced DNA damage and increased S\u2010adenosyl methionine (SAM) concentration coincide with the maintenance of the repressive H3K9me2\u2010marked heterochromatin and the repression of specific classes of TEs during aging. Taken together, NELF\u2010A\u2010mediated RNAPII pausing influences animal healthspan by regulating HSP\u2010mediated cellular protection and H3K9me2\u2010dependent maintenance of genome integrity. 2.\u2003RESULTS2.1. Neuronal expression of NELF\u2010A regulates lifespan and locomotor activityTo examine the regulatory roles of NELF genes in Drosophila lifespan, we first examined the highly expressed NELF\u2010A gene and backcrossed heterozygous mutant Nelf\u2010AKG09483/Tm3 line (Chopra et\u00a0al.,\u00a02009; Tsai\u00a0al.,\u00a02016; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010) to w1118 male for at least 10 consecutive generations. Compared to their control siblings, backcrossed heterozygous male Nelf\u2010AKG09483/+ (herein NelfA*/+) flies expressed less than half the level of NELF\u2010A mRNA (Figure\u00a01a) and protein (Figures\u00a01b and S1A,B). Both the male and female NelfA*/+ flies showed approximately 10% and 20% increase in their lifespan, respectively (Figures\u00a01c and S1C), suggesting that animal longevity may be affected by NELF\u2010A expression level. To test this, we ectopically expressed low level of NELF\u2010A protein by crossing UAS\u2010NelfA\u20106myc line to Hsp70\u2010Gal4 driver. When cultured at 30\u00b0C, their F1 offspring expressed higher level of NELF\u2010A mRNA (Figure\u00a01a), produced exogenous myc\u2010tagged NELF\u2010A protein (Figures\u00a01b and S1A), and had significantly shorter lifespan than their control siblings (Figures\u00a01c and S1C). This indicates that the level of NELF\u2010A expression is inversely correlated to animal lifespan.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Lower neuronal level of NELF\u2010A improves animal lifespan and locomotor activity.

Right: Climbing assay (n\u00a0=\u00a0100\u2013120 flies, Mann\u2013Whitney test)\nDrosophila undergoes age\u2010dependent decline in their locomotor activity (Jones & Grotewiel,\u00a02011). Negative geotaxis assays showed that heterozygous NelfA*/+ male flies consistently exhibited faster locomotor activity than their control siblings at different ages in adulthood (Figure\u00a01d), suggesting that lowering the level of NELF\u2010A expression may improve overall fitness or healthspan of the animals.We next used GeneSwitch (GS) system to determine the organs by which NELF genes may regulate animal healthspan. As depletion of NELF genes affects the expression of immune\u2010response genes in Drosophila S2 cells (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012), we examined the effect of RNAi\u2010mediated depletion of NELF gene in the fat bodies from the brain (Bun\u2010GS) and abdomen (106\u2010GS; Hwangbo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004). In addition, NELF genes were also knockdown (KD) in the neurons using Elav\u2010GS line given that NF\u2010\u03baB immune signaling in the brain regulates Drosophila lifespan (Kounatidis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). To mimic the heterozygous NelfA*/+ flies, the level of RU486 administrated in fly food was optimized to induce ~50% KD of NELF\u2010A expression in the brain (Figure\u00a01e). Pan\u2010neuronal RNAi KD of NELF\u2010A gene led to modest yet statistically significant increase in the lifespan of male flies (~8%\u201310%; Figures\u00a01e and S1D) and their locomotor activity (Figure\u00a01e). On the other hand, knocking down of NELF\u2010A expression in the fat bodies in the brain or abdomen has no statistically significant effect on adult lifespan (Figure\u00a0S1E,F). This suggests that the improved longevity and locomotor activity observed in heterozygous NelfA*/+ flies may be largely attributed to the regulatory roles of NELF\u2010A in the neuronal populations. To ascertain if other NELF subunits may exert similar effect as NELF\u2010A, Elav\u2010GS line was used to KD NELF\u2010B and NELF\u2010E genes. Surprisingly, despite substantial reduction in the level of NELF\u2010B and NELF\u2010E expression by tissue\u2010specific RNAi KD, the male flies did not show significant change in their adult lifespan as compared to the control siblings (Figure\u00a0S1G). Similarly, overexpression of UAS\u2010Nelf\u2010E\u20106myc gene by Hsp70\u2010Gal4 driver also did not reduce their lifespan as seen with the NELF\u2010A overexpressing flies (Figure\u00a0S1H). Taken together, these results suggest that the healthspan of Drosophila is highly dependent on the expression level of NELF\u2010A, rather than other NELF subunits, within the neuronal populations.2.2. \nNELF\u2010A reduction leads to pro\u2010longevity transcriptional signaturesTo identify downstream molecular pathways that may be responsible for the improved healthspan observed in NelfA*/+ flies, RNA\u2010sequencing was performed on the mRNA isolated from the heads of Day 50 (herein D50) male heterozygous mutants and their control siblings. Differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 package revealed two cluster of genes that were highly elevated in either control siblings (+/+) or heterozygous mutants (NelfA*/+; Figure\u00a02a, Table\u00a0S1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the Drosophila heads revealed transcriptional changes in several stimulus\u2010responsive genes that resembled NELF\u2010B/E depleted S2 cells (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008, 2012; Table\u00a0S2). Like NELF\u2010B/E depleted S2 cells, NelfA*/+ flies had reduced expression in genes that are enriched for defense response and response to bacterium (Figure\u00a02b). In addition, the NelfA*/+ mutants also showed upregulation of genes that are involved in different signaling pathways, heat\u2010shock response, and protein folding (Figures\u00a02b and S2).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Pro\u2010longevity transcriptome in NELF\u2010A depleted fly heads.

(e) Quantification of AMP genes expression in the brains isolated from either male NelfA*/+ flies or pan\u2010neuronal NELF\u2010A KD flies (RU486\u2010treated ElavGal4. Switch/NelfA\u2010RNAi) and their respective control siblings. Data presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, n\u00a0=\u00a02 biological replicates, unpaired two\u2010tailed t testDuring aging, elevated expression of immune\u2010response pathway genes such as the induced immune molecules (IM) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may trigger excessive inflammation that leads to morbidity in older flies (Badinloo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02018; Cao et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013; Kounatidis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). In accordance, overexpression of Rel (NF\u2010\u03baB) transcription factor can induce AMP genes in the absence of upstream signals; whereas reducing Rel level may attenuate inflammation and promote longevity (Kounatidis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). Consistent with these findings, there was a significant increase in the expression of Rel and AMP (AttC, DptA) genes in w1118 male flies during aging (Figure\u00a0S2A). In contrast, elevated expression of genes involved in heat\u2010shock responses and protein refolding has been well\u2010documented to promote animal health and longevity (Biteau et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010; Morrow et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004).The dichotomy in the expression of immune\u2010response and heat\u2010shock response genes led us to investigate if their transcription is directly regulated by NELF\u2010A in the Drosophila heads. The lower expression of AMP (Dro, DptA), IM1, and IM2 genes in the heads of NelfA*/+ flies as compared to their control siblings was first validated by RT\u2010PCR (Figures\u00a02c and S2B). Conversely, ectopic expression of NELF\u2010A caused the upregulation of AMP and IM genes in heads of HspGal4/UAS\u2010NelfA\u20106myc flies as compared to their control siblings (Figures\u00a02d and S2C). These results suggest that the level of NELF\u2010A is positively correlated to the expression of AMP and IM genes in the head of the flies. To determine the tissue\u2010specific role played by NELF\u2010A, D50 brains from both NelfA*/+ and ElavGal4. Switch/NelfA\u2010RNAi flies were dissected and analyzed by RT\u2010PCR. Like the NelfA*/+ flies, neuronal NELF\u2010A KD by RU486 treatment led to reduced Dro and IM1 expression in the brains as compared to ethanol (EtOH) treated control siblings (Figures\u00a02e and S2D). This indicates that neuronal NELF\u2010A can regulate the expression of AMP and IM genes in the brains. In S2 cells, NELF\u2010B/E depletion reduces the transcription of Rel and concomitant downregulation of AMP genes (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02012). As Rel expression is relatively similar between NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings (Figure\u00a02c,e), NELF\u2010A is likely to affect AMPs level indirectly or via distinct mechanism in the fly heads.Elevated AMPs level can cause neurodegeneration in old adult fly brains, marked by increased number of vacuoles in the brain sections (Cao et\u00a0al.,\u00a02013; Kounatidis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017). In accordance, vacuoles (red arrow) were observed in D50 but not D20 w1118 fly brains (Figure\u00a0S2E). Since climbing ability of older flies is impaired by age\u2010dependent neurodegeneration (Kounatidis et\u00a0al.,\u00a02017), we asked if the improved locomotor activity in NelfA*/+ flies was due to reduced AMPs level, and hence lower neurodegeneration as compared to their control siblings. Histological examination of D50 brains harvested from NELF\u2010A*/+, RU486\u2010treated ElavGal4. Switch/NelfA\u2010RNAi and their respective control sibling flies did not show any morphological difference (data not shown). This unexpected observation might be explained by the significantly lower level of Rel and AMPs expression in NelfA*/+ and their control siblings as compared to age\u2010matched w1118 flies (Figure\u00a0S2A). Nevertheless, the lower AMPs expression in NelfA*/+ flies is indicative of less systemic inflammation (Figure\u00a02b,c), presumably attributed to other pro\u2010longevity molecular changes.2.3. \nNELF depletion induces HSPs to protect against oxidative stressHSPs are molecular chaperones that regulate protein homeostasis in response to environmental stress (Richter et\u00a0al.,\u00a02010). In accordance, ectopic expression of specific Hsp genes could lead to extension in Drosophila lifespan (Morrow et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004; Wang et\u00a0al.,\u00a02004). This suggests that the elevated expression of Hsp genes may promote the healthspan of NelfA*/+ flies. RT\u2010PCR was first used to validate their expression genes in male fly heads (Figure\u00a03a) and brains (Figure\u00a0S3A). The presence of specific DNA elements, including GAGA factor binding site, initiates the recruitment and pausing of RNAPII at the promoters of Hsp genes (Core & Adelman,\u00a02019). It is plausible that reduced NELF\u2010A level in NelfA*/+ flies (Figures\u00a01b and S1A) may facilitate the release of paused RNAPII at Hsp promoters, leading to higher transcriptional output that is similar to NELF\u2010depleted S2 cells (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008). To test this, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed on D50 heads harvested from NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings. Site\u2010specific primers on Hsp68 and Hsp83 genes were designed based on RNAPII\u2010ChIP\u2010seq data from KC167 cells (Figure\u00a0S3B,C). IgG\u2010ChIP yielded undetectable signal whereas opposite patterns of RNAPII\u2010ChIP signals were observed at the highly transcribed Rpl32 gene and silenced Het3R2 region (Figure\u00a0S3D). Compared to control siblings, there was significantly higher level of RNAPII enrichment at >100 nucleotides downstream of TSS, in the gene body (GB) and at the transcriptional end site (TES) of Hsp68 and Hsp83 genes in NelfA*/+ fly heads (Figures\u00a03b, S3E,F). This result is consistent with the notion that lower NELF\u2010A protein level releases paused RNAPII for more productive transcription of Hsp68 and Hsp83 genes.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Elevated HSPs enhances stress resistance and protein homeostasis.

Bottom: Graphs of individual and mean (\u00b1SD) level of total and insoluble Ref(2)P fractions. Paired two\u2010tailed t testIn S2 cells, RNAi KD of different NELF subunits led to increased expression of many Hsp genes (Gilchrist et\u00a0al.,\u00a02008). The possibility of HSPs acting downstream of NELF\u2010A led us to question why genetic manipulation of only NELF\u2010A, but not other NELF subunits, affects animal lifespan (Figures\u00a0S1G & S1H). To this end, we examined the effect of depleting either NELF\u2010A or NELF\u2010E gene in S2 cells which were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment (Figure\u00a03c). Double\u2010stranded (ds) RNA\u2010mediated KD of NELF\u2010A or NELF\u2010E gene led to significant reduction in their mRNA expression as compared to \u03b2gal KD cells (Figure\u00a03c). Interestingly, depletion of both NELF genes led to elevated expression of Hsp27 and Hsp83 genes upon H2O2 treatment, although the level of Hsp genes was significantly higher in NELF\u2010A KD cells (Figure\u00a03c). This suggests that NELF\u2010A might play a more dominant role in RNAPII pausing as compared to NELF\u2010E, such that its depletion can cause higher Hsp expression and thus better responses against oxidative stress. To test this, the level of DNA double\u2010stranded breaks caused by H2O2 treatment was measured by \u03b3\u2010H2AV antibody. In contrast to untreated control S2 cells (C1 and C2), 16 hours of incubation with 1\u00a0mM H2O2 triggered DNA damage, as shown by \u03b3\u2010H2AV accumulation in \u03b2gal KD cells (Figure\u00a03d). Importantly, NELF\u2010A KD cells have ~five\u2010fold and ~two\u2010fold (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) lower \u03b3\u2010H2AV level as compared to \u03b2gal and NELF\u2010E KD cells, respectively (Figure\u00a03d). This indicates that NELF\u2010A KD confers more robust protection against DNA damage induced by oxidative stress as compared to depleting other NELF subunits. As Hsp27 gene has been shown to suppress ROS (Wyttenbach et\u00a0al.,\u00a02002), we also examined its expression level in the brains harvested from flies where either NELF\u2010A or NELF\u2010E gene has been KD by RNAi (Figures\u00a01e and S1G). Similar to S2 cells, KD of NELF genes led to elevated Hsp27 expression as compared to their control siblings, with significantly higher expression observed in NELF\u2010A KD brains (Figure\u00a03e). The higher expression of Hsp genes, coupled with more enhanced resistance against oxidative stress upon NELF\u2010A KD as compared to NELF\u2010E KD, may explain why only perturbation of NELF\u2010A can extend animal lifespan (Figure\u00a01c,e).2.4. Reduced DNA damage and protein aggregation in aged NelfA*/+ fliesTo gain mechanistic insight into the extended healthspan, we examined several markers of aging in the head/brain tissues harvested from NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings. Consistent with the notion that Drosophila undergoes age\u2010dependent accumulation of DNA damage, \u03b3\u2010H2Av level in old D50 w1118 male fly heads is significantly higher than young D10 flies (Figure\u00a03f). In contrast, \u03b3\u2010H2Av level in the heads of D50 NelfA*/+ flies was drastically lower than their control siblings and aged\u2010matched w1118 flies (Figure\u00a03f).ROS accumulation can disrupt protein homeostasis to cause protein aggregation during aging (Reichmann et al., 2018). Given their roles in mediating proteostasis (Richter et al., 2010), we asked if elevated HSPs observed in NelfA*/+ fly heads may regulate the level of protein aggregation. In Drosophila brains, Ref(2)P marks ubiquitinated protein bodies for autophagic degradation such that the accumulation of insoluble Ref(2)P fraction denotes the formation of protein aggregates (Bartlett et al., 2011; Nezis et al., 2008). Although Ref(2)P protein in the total head lysates was relatively similar across biological replicates, the level of insoluble Ref(2)P fraction is significantly lower in NelfA*/+ fly heads as compared to their control siblings (Figures \u200b(Figures3g3g and S3G). Similarly, the level of insoluble Ref(2)P protein detected in the NELF\u2010A KD brains is also significantly lower than their control siblings (EtOH\u2010 versus RU486\u2010treated ElavGal4. Switch/NELFA\u2010RNAi flies; Figure S3H,I). These results suggest that elevated level of HSPs in NelfA*/+ flies may attenuate DNA damage and protein aggregation during aging.2.5. Lower ROS level is linked to enhanced stress resistance in NelfA*/+ fliesTo determine if age\u2010dependent ROS accumulation is substantially different between NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings, D50 brains were stained with MitoSOXTM Red reagent, a dye that produces red fluorescence when oxidized by superoxide in the mitochondria. Imaging showed that the normalized MitoSOX signal in NelfA*/+ brains is significantly lower than their control siblings (Figures 4a,b, and S4A). Similarly, MitoSOX fluorescent signal is also reduced in the head, but not in the body lysates prepared from NelfA*/+ flies (Figure \u200b(Figure4b),4b), suggesting that NELF\u2010A may modulate ROS level specifically in the head/brain tissues. To determine the effect of knocking down NELF\u2010A gene in neuronal populations, MitoSOX signal was measured in the head and body lysates prepared from male ElavGal4. Switch/NELFA\u2010RNAi flies. Interestingly, pan\u2010neuronal KD of NELF\u2010A reduces the level of ROS in the head, but not in the body lysates (Figure S4B). This suggests that manipulating the level of NELF\u2010A in the brains, presumably through HSPs, is sufficient to inhibit ROS accumulation in the heads during aging. To further test if the lower ROS level translates into better protection against environmental stress, D30 NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings were exposed to 16 hours of 1% H2O2 treatment. Surprisingly, male NelfA*/+ flies lived longer (~10% higher than untreated NelfA*/+) after H2O2 treatment whereas the mean lifespan of control siblings was reduced (~5% lower than untreated control siblings; Figure \u200bFigure4c).4c). In contrast, female flies appeared to tolerate this short\u2010term H2O2 treatment (Figure S4C). Taken together, halving the level of NELF\u2010A not only lowers the accumulation of ROS, DNA damage, and protein aggregation in the head/brain tissues, it also enhances resistance against environmental stress in male NelfA*/+ flies.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4\nNELF\u2010A depletion enhances stress resistance in fly and human cells.

Consistent with this notion, genes with highly paused RNAPII promoters are associated with DNA damage pathways in human SH\u2010SY5Y cells (Figure S4D, Table\u00a0S2). It is plausible that depleting NELF\u2010A gene can facilitate productive transcription of these genes to enhance cellular stress responses like in Drosophila. To test this, NELF\u2010A gene in SH\u2010SY5Y cells was KD for two consecutive days (D1 and D2) by independent siRNA molecules (NelfA\u201013.2 and NelfA\u201013.3) before 14\u00a0h of 1\u00a0mM H2O2 treatment (D3). Cells were then harvested immediately after H2O2 treatment (D4) or allowed additional 24\u00a0h of recovery (D5; Figure \u200bFigure4d).4d). Compared to scrambled (Scr) siRNA KD, halving the level of NELF\u2010A expression in SH\u2010SY5Y cells led to lower production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine TNF\u2010A (Figure \u200b(Figure4d),4d), reduced DNA damage marker \u03b3\u2010H2AX, and apoptotic cleaved Parp1 molecules after 14\u00a0h of H2O2 treatment (Figure \u200b(Figure4e).4e). This indicates that depleting NELF\u2010A in SH\u2010SY5Y cells confers better protection against H2O2\u2010induced oxidative stress. Consistent with this notion, propidium iodide (PI) staining on D4 or after additional day of recovery (D5) showed that Scr KD cells have significantly higher incidence of apoptosis than NELF\u2010A KD cells (Figure \u200b(Figure4f).4f). Taken together, our results from Drosophila S2 and human SH\u2010SY5Y cells demonstrate that reducing the level of NELF\u2010A is sufficient to prevent DNA damage and enhance resistance against oxidative stress.2.7. H3K9me2\u2010mediated repression of retrotransposons in NelfA*/+ fliesAccumulation of ROS and DNA damage can impact genome integrity through the activation of transposable elements (TEs; Stoycheva et al., 2010). Using TEtranscripts software, which includes TE\u2010associated ambiguously mapped reads in the differential expression analysis (supplementary experimental procedure), we saw significant changes in the level of specific classes of retrotransposons between D50 male NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings (Figure \u200b(Figure4g).4g). Their differences were further validated by RT\u2010PCR with additional biological replicates (Figure \u200b(Figure4h).4h). The repression of Gypsy retroelements in NelfA*/+ flies might partially explain their improved climbing ability (Figure \u200b(Figure1d)1d) since age\u2010dependent locomotor decline has been attributed to Gypsy activation in the neuronal populations (Li et al., 2013).Loss of H3K9me2/3\u2010heterochromatin during aging has been linked to increased TEs activation in older flies (Chen et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2016). Since heterochromatin can be regulated by transcription activities and oxidative DNA damage (Frost et al., 2016), we examined the level of H3K9me2/3 in male NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings. Immunoblot of head lysates showed that the level of H3K9me2 in NelfA*/+ flies is about 1.4\u2010fold higher than their control siblings (Figure \u200b(Figure4i).4i). Similarly, imaging of D50 NelfA*/+ fly brains also showed higher level of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 staining than their control siblings (Figures 5a,b, and S5A). To understand how TEs are regulated by genome\u2010wide H3K9me2 distribution, ChIP\u2010seq was performed in heads of D50 male NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings (Figure S5B). In line with its regulatory roles in the heterochromatin, H3K9me2 peaks were enriched across the pericentromeric regions where majority of the retrotransposons reside (Figure \u200b(Figure5c).5c). Using adjusted p\u2010value <0.05 as cut\u2010off, MACS bdgdiff identified approximately 20,712 non\u2010differential, common H3K9me2 peaks; 9363 peaks with higher H3K9me2 level in NelfA*/+ flies; and 1,796 peaks with higher H3K9me2 level in the control siblings (Figure \u200b(Figure5d,5d, Table\u00a0S3). More than 70% (6700/9363) of the differential H3K9me2 peaks in NelfA*/+ flies overlap with known TEs; and are located within the promoter, intronic, and distal intergenic regions (Figures \u200b(Figures5d5d and S5C). The expression of Gypsy and Diver in NelfA*/+ flies is significantly lower than their control siblings. Of the TEs bound by H3K9me2, about 25% of the Gypsy and Diver TEs contain differential H3K9me2 peaks that are more enriched in NelfA*/+ flies (Figure S5D, Table\u00a0S3). The differential enrichment of H3K9me2 across specific Diver2 and Gypsy1 loci was furthered validated by ChIP\u2010qPCR (Figure \u200b(Figure5f).5f). In contrast, there is lower percentage of differential H3K9me2 peaks at DMRC1A, whose expression is highly similar between NelfA*/+ flies and their control siblings (Figure S5D). These results suggest that lower NELF\u2010A level may promote the maintenance of H3K9me2\u2010marked heterochromatin regions, which in turn represses specific TEs like Gypsy and DIVER in the NelfA*/+ flies.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Repression of specific TEs by H3K9me2 in aging NelfA*/+ fly heads.

GNMT may promote H3K9me2 level through SAM in NelfA*/+ fly headsTo understand what contributes to the increased H3K9me2/3 level in old NelfA*/+ flies, we examined the expression pattern of genes that regulate H3K9me2/3 modifications directly or via carbon metabolism (Table\u00a0S1). Unlike Su(var)3\u20139, dKDM4A,, and dKDM4B genes, the expression of glycine N\u2010methyltransferase (Gnmt) was significantly downregulated in NelfA*/+ flies (Figure \u200b(Figure5g).5g). GNMT is a metabolic enzyme that regulates the ratio of S\u2010adenosylmethionine (SAM) to S\u2010adenosylhomocysteine (SAH; Luka et al., 2009). Histone methyltransferase (HMT) utilizes SAM as the methyl donor to methylate histone residues, in the process releasing SAH which may inhibit HMT via negative feedback mechanism. In w1118 fly heads, there is significant increase in Gnmt expression and concomitant drop in SAM concentration during aging (Figure S5G). The lower expression of Gnmt, which coincides with increased SAM concentration, might contribute to the maintenance of H3K9me2\u2010enriched heterochromatin in the heads/brains of old NelfA*/+ flies as compared to their control siblings. 3.\u2003DISCUSSIONThrough functional analyses and epigenome profiling, we showed that the level of NELF\u2010A in the head tissues plays an important role in regulating Drosophila healthspan. As RNAPII pausing is the rate\u2010limiting step in the transcription of many Hsp genes (Lis et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2003), lowering the level of NELF\u2010A in either NelfA*/+ flies or by pan\u2010neuronal NELF\u2010A KD might facilitate the release of paused RNAPII and increase its productive elongation of these genes (Figure 3a,b). Consistent with their roles in extending lifespan (Biteau et al., 2010; Morrow et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004) and suppressing neurotoxicity in fly Huntington's disease model (Warrick et al., 1999), our data indicate that elevated HSPs are likely driving the improved healthspan in NELF\u2010A depleted flies (Figure \u200b(Figure1).1). Indeed, the level of systemic inflammation (Figure \u200b(Figure2),2), DNA damage (Figure \u200b(Figure3f),3f), protein aggregation (Figure \u200b(Figure3g),3g), and ROS (Figure \u200b(Figure4)4) in the brains/heads of NelfA*/+ flies is significantly lower than their control siblings. These molecular signatures also coincide with their enhanced resistance against external oxidative stress during aging (Figure \u200b(Figure4c).4c). Moreover, as oxidative DNA damage can lead to chromatin relaxation and heterochromatin loss (Frost et al., 2016), reduced ROS may also promote the maintenance of H3K9me2\u2010enriched heterochromatin and concomitant repression of TEs in aged NelfA*/+ flies as compared to their control siblings (Figure \u200b(Figure5).5). Although H3\u00a0K9 methylation is more favorable with the increased SAM concentration, it remains unclear how Gnmt expression may be downregulated in NelfA*/+ flies.Unexpectedly, animal lifespan is only affected by NELF\u2010A perturbation even though depleting other NELF subunits was sufficient to induce the expression of Hsp genes in S2 cells (Gilchrist et al., 2008). Biochemical and structural studies showed that NELF\u2010A mobile C\u2010terminal domain plays a more important role in stabilizing RNAPII pausing complex than NELF\u2010E subunit (Narita et al., 2003; Vos et al., 2018). Consistent with these findings, there is higher expression of Hsp genes in conjunction with reduced DNA damage in NELF\u2010A KD cells as compared to NELF\u2010E KD cells (Figure 3c\u2010e). In vitro RNA extension assay reveals that NELF\u2010A, and not NELF\u2010E, is required for RNAPII pausing (Vos et al., 2018). It is likely that perturbating NELF\u2010E or other subunits might not elicit sufficient change in the level of HSPs to influence animal lifespan. Moreover, the expression of NELF\u2010A gene in fly heads is ~7\u201310\u2010fold higher than NELF\u2010E and NELF\u2010B respectively (Figure S2F), suggesting that NELF\u2010A may play a more dominant role in gene regulation than other NELF subunits in the head tissues.In aging flies, elevated Rel level in the fat bodies and brains triggers systemic inflammation to cause gut hyperplasia (Chen et al., 2014) and neurological decline, respectively (Kounatidis et al., 2017). Interestingly, NELF depletion has been shown to attenuate immune responses via distinct mechanisms in different model systems. In S2 cells and Drosophila larvae, NELF KD downregulates the basal expression of many components of the immune signaling pathways (including Rel), thereby reducing the activation of AMP genes (Gilchrist et al., 2012). In mouse macrophage, knocking out NELF increases the expression of key anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010 through AP\u20101\u2010dependent transcriptional circuit (Yu et al., 2020). Despite having similar level of Rel, the brains/heads of D50 NelfA*/+ flies has significantly lower AMPs expression than their control siblings. This is indicative of less systemic inflammation, a likely consequence of enhanced HSP\u2010mediated protection. The potential pro\u2010longevity effects of other neuropeptides and signaling pathways in NelfA*/+ flies will warrant further studies (Figure \u200b(Figure2b2b).The pro\u2010longevity role of NELF\u2010A appears to be restricted to the brains since depleting NELF\u2010A in the neuronal populations, but not in fat bodies, affects the animal healthspan (Figure S1). Similarly, ROS level is significantly reduced only in the brain/head tissues of NelfA*/+ flies as compared to their control siblings (Figure \u200b(Figure4b).4b). In developing mouse cortex, epigenetic profiling of neural progenitor cells (NPC) and differentiated neurons revealed that the promoters of many DNA damage response and repair genes have highly paused RNAPII (Liu et al., 2017). Moreover, GO analysis showed that these genes are associated with molecular functions like NF\u2010\u03baB and HSP binding (Figure S5D, Table\u00a0S2), suggesting the release of paused RNAPII may be the rate\u2010limiting step in their transcription. In human cells, activation of P\u2010TEFb by RNA\u2010binding motif protein 7 is necessary to release paused RNAPII for productive transcription of DNA damage response genes upon genotoxic stress (Bugai et al., 2019). Consistent with these findings, NELF\u2010A KD in human SH\u2010SY5Y cells led to better protection against H2O2\u2010induced DNA damage and apoptosis than Scr KD cells (Figure 4d,f). These results suggest that regulation of stress\u2010responsive genes by NELF\u2010A mediated RNAPII pausing is likely to be conserved across different species.Although it remains to be seen if NELF\u2010A affects lifespan in mammals, several lines of evidence indicate that lowering the level of NELF may have wider implications in regulating human health and disease state. NELF\u2010A is a prognostic marker of liver cancer such that higher level of protein expression correlates with unfavorable survival probability in patients (proteinatlas.org). Conversely, knocking down NELF\u2010B gene in hepatocellular carcinoma cells is sufficient to reduce cellular proliferation and migration (El Zeneini et al., 2017). In mouse, microRNA\u2010133\u00a0has been demonstrated to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy through repressing the translation of RhoA, Cdc42, and NELF\u2010A mRNA (Care et al., 2007). Conversely, overexpression of NELF\u2010A in cardiomyocytes can induce hypertrophic gene program (Care et al., 2007). Further studies on RNAPII pausing in mammalian systems under different contexts might provide insights into its roles in regulating stress responses and aging transcriptome. Investigation of direct NELF targets would complement these studies and potentially lead to the discovery of pro\u2010longevity or specific therapeutic strategies.3.1.

Transgenic fliesPCR amplified full\u2010length NELF\u2010A (SD07139, DGRC) and NELF\u2010E (RE14181, DGRC) cDNAs were cloned into pENTR/D\u2010TOPO and pAWM vectors with Gateway kit (Invitrogen). NELF cDNAs with c\u2010terminal myc\u2010tag were PCR amplified from pAWM vector, cut with BamHI/XbaI, and cloned into BglII/Xbal sites on pUAST vector. Constructs were sequenced and sent to Bestgene Inc to make transgenic fly. Homozygous lines (w1118 background) are denoted as UAS\u2010NelfA\u20106myc and UAS\u2010Nelf\u2010E\u20106myc.3.4. Ectopic expression or tissue\u2010specific depletion of different NELF subunits\nHsp70\u2010Gal4 females were backcrossed to w1118 males for >10 generations to obtain Hsp70\u2010Gal4/+ flies. Backcrossed Hsp70\u2010Gal4/+ virgin females were mated with homozygous UAS\u2010NelfA\u20106myc or UAS\u2010Nelf\u2010E\u20106myc males. F1 offspring were cultured in 30\u00b0C to induce ectopic NELF expression.The UAS\u2010RNAi males were mated to GeneSwitch drivers. F1 offspring were cultured in media containing either ethanol or 120\u00a0mg/ml of mifepristone (RU486, Sigma).3.5. Lifespan assay\nNelf\u2010AKG09483/Tm3 virgin females were backcrossed to w1118 males for >10 generations to obtain Nelf\u2010AKG09483/+ mutants (NelfA*/+) and control siblings (+/+) with similar genetic background. Twenty flies were housed in a vial (diameter 2.5\u00a0cm, height 9.5\u00a0cm) with 5\u00a0ml of standard fly media. Food was changed every two days with daily recording. Data were plotted with Prism GraphPad and statistical significance calculated by log\u2010rank Mantel\u2010Cox's test. There were at least 100 flies per aging assay.3.6. Negative geotaxis (climbing) assayAbout 10\u201315 age\u2010matched flies were transferred to fresh food a day before assay. On the day of assay, flies were transferred without CO2 anesthesia into glass cylinder (height 22\u00a0cm, diameter 2.5\u00a0cm, capacity 50\u00a0ml, AS ONE) capped with cotton plug. The flies were tapped to the bottom and distance ascended in 6\u00a0s (D20, 30) or 10\u00a0s (D50) was captured by digital camera. This was repeated to obtain sizeable number for each genotype. Data were plotted with Prism GraphPad and statistical significance calculated by Mann\u2013Whitney test.3.7. Oxidative stress test and ROS measurementFor short\u2010term stress, Day 30 (D30) flies were transferred to 1% agar containing 1% sucrose, 1% nipagin, 1% H2O2 for 16\u00a0h and returned to regular media. To image brain ROS level, D50 fly brains dissected in cold Hank's Balance Salt solution (HBSS) were incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM MitoSOX (Invitrogen, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"M36008\",\"term_id\":\"214108\",\"term_text\":\"M36008\"}}M36008) and Hoechst for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. After three rounds of cold PBS wash, brains were mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs). Z\u2010stack images were taken with confocal microscope (FV3000, 20X objective) and the total fluorescence intensity was quantified with ImageJ. Relative cells fluorescence unit (CFU) was obtained by dividing MitoSOX signal over Hoechst staining. To quantify ROS level in the lysates, 10 heads or bodies dissected from D50 flies were homogenized in cold PBS with protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche) and sonicated (30\u00a0s ON/OFF, high settings, 5 cycles, Bioruptor UCD\u2010200TO). 10\u00a0\u03bcl of diluted (1:5) lysates were incubated in 300\u00a0\u03bcl of 5\u00a0\u03bcM MitoSOX for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. Fluorescence was measured by luminescence spectrometer (Tecan Spark Multimode Reader, SCIMED) at 510\u00a0nm excitation and 580\u00a0nm emission. The absorbance was normalized to the protein concentration (Bradford assay, Bio\u2010Rad).3.8. Immunoblot and antibodiesFor total lysates, 10 fly heads were homogenized in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of 1\u00a0x\u00a0Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10\u00a0min. To separate soluble from insoluble fraction (Bartlett et al., 2011), 10 fly brains/heads were homogenized in ice\u2010cold 1% Triton\u2010X 100 in PBS with protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche). About 10% volume was kept as total fraction while the rest centrifuged at 14,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant collected is the soluble fraction while the pellet was resuspended in SDS extraction buffer (50\u00a0mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, protease inhibitors cocktail) and sonicated. Following 10 minutes of 14,000\u00a0g centrifugation at room temperature, the supernatant from the SDS extraction buffer was collected as the insoluble fraction. Antibodies used are: NELF\u2010A (in\u2010house, 1:500), Myc (A14, Santa Cruz, 1:3000), Ref(2)P (ab178440, Abcam, 1:500), \u03b3\u2010H2Av (UNC93\u20105.2.1, DSHB, 1:500), \u03b2\u2010tubulin (E7, DSHB, 1:3000), lamin\u2010Dm0 (67.10\u2010s, DSHB, 1:3000), H3K9me2 (ab1220, Abcam, 1:1000), and histone H3 (ab1791, Abcam, 1:5000).3.9. RNA isolation, RNA\u2010seq, and data processingTotal RNA was isolated from 20\u00a0x\u00a0D50 fly heads using RNAzol\u00aeRT (Sigma) protocol and sequenced by BGI (Hong Kong). RNA\u2010seq dataset was processed and analyzed according to previous methods detailed in SI.3.10. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencingChIP and library amplification were performed according to previous protocol detailed in SI. For each biological replicate, 100 fly heads and 5\u00a0\u03bcg of antibody (H3K9me2, ab1220 and RNAPII, CTD4H8) were used.3.11. S2 cells culture, dsRNA KD, and H2O2 treatment\nNELF\u2010A and NELF\u2010E dsRNA was generated with Ambion MEGAscript T7 kit using PCR template. On Day 0 (D0), 0.5e6 of S2 cells were seeded in 0.5\u00a0ml of serum\u2010free medium (SFM, Gibco\u2122, 21720024) in a 24\u2010well plate. Cells were transfected with 4\u00a0\u00b5g of dsRNA (\u03b2gal, NELF\u2010A, and NELF\u2010E) with 4\u00a0\u00b5l of Cellfectin\u2122 II (ThermoFisher, 10362100) for 2\u00a0h. SFM was replaced with 0.5\u00a0mL of full media. After 24\u00a0h (D1), second round of transfection was performed with 8\u00a0\u00b5g of dsRNA and 8\u00a0\u00b5l of Cellfectin. On D2, cells were split evenly into two wells and incubated with either 1 or 5\u00a0mM of H2O2 for 16\u00a0h. On D3, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested for analyses.3.12. siRNA KD and H2O2 treatment of SH\u2010SY5Y cellsAbout 0.2e6\u00a0cells/well were seeded in a 24\u2010well plate on Day 0 (D0). Cells were transfected with 40\u00a0nM of Dicer\u2010Substrate Short Interfering RNAs (DsiRNA) using 0.75\u00a0\u00b5l of LipofectamineTM 3000 and 1\u00a0\u00b5l of P3000 per reaction (Invitrogen) on D1. Scrambled control (51\u201001\u201019\u201009) and NELF\u2010A (hs. Ri.NELFA.13.2 or hs. Ri.NELFA.13.3). DsiRNA were purchased from IDT. Following 24\u00a0h of incubation, cells were replenished with 0.5\u00a0ml of fresh media and transfected again with 40\u00a0nM of DsiRNA (D2). On the following day, cells were replaced with fresh media containing 1\u00a0mM of H2O2 (D3). Following 14\u00a0h of H2O2 treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove dead floating cells (D4). The attached cells were either harvested for analyses (western/mRNA/staining with propidium iodide and DAPI) or replenished with fresh medium (D4). Following 24\u00a0h recovery, cells were stained with PI and DAPI (D5). The antibodies used were phospho\u2010H2AX (sc\u2010517348), PARP\u20101 (Active Motif 39561), and \u03b2\u2010actin (A2228, Sigma).3.13. Primers listPrimers sequences are listed in Table\u00a0S4.
