Inhaled nitric oxide results in a transient improvement in oxygenation but does not reduce mortality and may be harmful, as it seems to increase renal impairment. Plain language summaryUse of inhaled nitric oxide in patients with acute respiratory failure with low blood oxygen does not improve survivalBackgroundWhen a person has acute respiratory failure, some physicians administer nitric oxide (NO), which is a colourless gas that can dilate the pulmonary vasculature. This gas has been hypothesized to improve acute respiratory failure, as it could improve oxygenation by selectively improving blood flow to healthy lung segments.Our objective was to evaluate whether this treatment improves outcomes of adults and children with acute respiratory failure.Study characteristicsWe included in this updated review 14 trials with 1275 participants. We found the overall quality of trials to be moderate, with little information provided on how experiments were carried out. Results were limited, and most included trials were small. In most trials, we identified risk of misleading information. Thus, results must be interpreted with caution. The evidence is up\u2010to\u2010date to 18 November 2015.Key resultsNo strong evidence is available to support the use of INO to improve survival of adults and children with acute respiratory failure and low blood oxygen levels. In the present systematic review, we set out to assess the benefits and harms of its use in adults and children with acute respiratory failure. We identified 14 randomized trials comparing INO versus placebo or no intervention. We found no beneficial effects: despite signs of oxygenation and initial improvement, INO does not appear to improve survival and might be hazardous, as it may cause kidney function impairment. Summary of findings BackgroundDescription of the conditionSince this review was first published (Sokol 2003a), the definition of acute respiratory failure has changed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) in any adult or child older than one month of age were initially defined by the American\u2010European Consensus Conference (AECC) in 1994 (Bernard 1994).. The ARDS definition task force produced the latest definition and has developed the Berlin definition (ARDS Definition Task Force 2012). Acute lung injury no longer exists and has been replaced by a gradation of ARDS that is based on the severity of hypoxaemia: mild (200 mm Hg < partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2264 300 mm Hg with positive end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) \u2265 5 cm H2O), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 200 mm Hg with PEEP \u2265 5 cm H2O) or severe (PaO2/FiO2 \u2264 100 mm Hg with PEEP \u2265 5 cm H2O). The Berlin criteria also include onset within one week of a known clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms, bilateral opacities on chest x\u2010ray not explained by effusion, collapse or nodule and no cardiac failure or fluid overload.ARDS is characterized by an inflammatory process of the alveolar\u2010capillary membrane that may arise from a primary lung disease or secondary to several systemic disease processes (Jain 2006). It is mainly due to a ventilation\u2010perfusion mismatch, resulting in increased intrapulmonary shunting due to pulmonary vasodilatation in non\u2010ventilated lung regions and vasoconstriction in ventilated areas, as well as pulmonary hypertension (Dahlem 2007).The incidence of ARDS is reported to be between 14 and 86 persons per 100,000 per year in a general adult population (Luhr 1999; Rubenfeld 2005). However, a recent report from Finland indicates a smaller incidence of ARDS of five per 100,000 per year (Linko 2009). In Minnnesota, during an eight\u2010year period of study between 2001 and 2008, the incidence decreased from 82.4 to 38.9 per 100,000 person\u2010years (Li 2011). Mortality among adults with ARDS has been reported as 24% to 60%, depending on age and underlying health status of the patient (Anderson 2003; MacCallum 2005; Rubenfeld 2005). The worst prognosis is seen among patients with sepsis or multi\u2010organ failure, those who are immunocompromised and those without improvement in oxygenation after six days (TenHoor 2001; Ware 2000).Recent evidence indicates that the incidence of ARDS among children is 2.0 to 12.8 persons per 100,000 per year (Zimmerman 2009). Paediatric in\u2010hospital mortality was recently reported at 18% to 27%, with pneumonia, aspiration and sepsis as primary causes of the condition (Dahlem 2003; Dahlem 2007; Flori 2005; L\u00f3pez\u2010Fern\u00e1ndez 2012; Zimmerman 2009).Description of the interventionNitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator that can be exogenously administered via inhalation. It is synthesized by conversion of the terminal guanidine nitrogen atom of L\u2010arginine via endothelial cell calcium\u2010dependent enzyme nitric oxide synthetase, then diffuses across the cell membrane to activate the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This enzyme enhances the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), causing relaxation of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle and vasodilatation of blood vessels (Palmer 1998). Inhaled NO (INO) was first used in clinical practice in 1991 (Hsu 2008; Rossaint 1993).Inhaled NO has the ability to provide selective pulmonary vasodilatation in well\u2010ventilated lung units, to improve ventilation\u2010perfusion mismatch and subsequently to reduce the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension seen in ARDS (Dellinger 1998; Sokol 2003b). A reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure and a decrease in intrapulmonary shunting occur within 40 minutes of INO treatment initiation (Rossaint 1993). Inhaled NO also increases the right ventricular ejection fraction and decreases right end\u2010systolic volume, thus preventing decompensation of acute cor pulmonale (Fierobe 1995).How the intervention might workInhaled NO has a half\u2010life of three to five seconds and is rapidly inactivated on contact with haemoglobin. As a result, its vasodilatory effect may be limited to well\u2010ventilated regions of the lung (Hsu 2008). Nitric oxide is involved in production of and protection from oxidative injury, regulates both immune and inflammatory responses, decreases neutrophil sequestration in the lung, decreases oedema formation and regulates its own production (McAndrew 1997; Prodhan 2004).Inhaled NO is rapidly converted to active intermediates, including nitrogen dioxide, peroxy\u2010nitrite and nitro\u2010tyrosine, in the presence of superoxide (Pryor 1995). However, systemic exposure to INO, which is a cytotoxic free radical, or accumulation of its degradation products could result in deleterious side effects through formation of other free radicals, causing further lung tissue damage (Beckman 1990), impaired surfactant function (Haddad 1996) or aggravated circulatory failure (K\u00f6stler 2005).Nitric oxide alters immune function by modifying the release of cytokines and other components of the inflammatory cascade from alveolar macrophages (Chollet\u2010Martin 1996; Thomassen 1997); it inhibits active adhesion molecules and the neutrophil oxidative burst involved in neutrophil migration (Kubes 1991).Inhaled NO rapidly binds to haemoglobin, with high affinity, to form methaemoglobin at doses of 40 ppm or greater (Sokol 2003a). This occurs after INO diffuses from alveoli to vascular smooth muscle cells adjacent to the alveoli.Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen\u2010induced platelet aggregation are significantly inhibited by INO via an increase in intraplatelet cGMP during passage of platelets through the lung, and bleeding time is significantly prolonged in a non\u2010dose\u2010related manner during inhalation (Barrington 2007; Gries 1998; Gries 2000).Why it is important to do this reviewInhaled NO is still used extensively worldwide as a rescue agent in severely hypoxaemic patients with ARDS. A survey from Canada found that 39% of specialists still used INO in the treatment of ARDS (Meade 2004). Most patients with ARDS who receive INO respond with improved oxygenation, but the benefit appears to be transient, lasting less than 72 hours (Adhikari 2007; Calfee 2007). Furthermore, two systematic reviews found little evidence on clinical outcomes and increased risk of adverse effects, for example, renal dysfunction (Adhikari 2007; Sokol 2003a; Sokol 2003b). Thus INO application remains controversial, especially in the light of recent evidence. The aim of this review was to update the best available evidence on this topic and to assess whether INO therapy has any role in the treatment of patients with ARDS.We aimed to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of INO administration in children and adults with ARDS. More compelling evidence is needed on this topic and on its potential benefits. This is an update of a review first published in 2003 (Sokol 2003a) and updated in 2010 (Afshari 2010). ObjectivesThe primary objective was to examine the effects of administration of inhaled nitric oxide on mortality in adults and children with ARDS.Secondary objectives were to examine secondary outcomes such as pulmonary bleeding events, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, etc. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses, examined the role of bias and applied trial sequential analyses (TSAs; Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA)) to examine the level of evidence. MethodsCriteria for considering studies for this reviewTypes of studies We included RCTs irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published or language. We contacted trial investigators and study authors to ask for relevant data. We included unpublished trials only if trial data and methodological descriptions were provided in written form or could be retrieved from the trial authors. We excluded cross\u2010over trials. We identified no cluster\u2010RCTs but planned to include these, if found, in future updates.Types of participants We included participants with a diagnosis of ARDS or ALI, according to the various definitions present in the literature. In the case of an intervention effect, we performed a subgroup analysis based on enrolment of participants to the ARDS groups. We chose to accept the terms 'standard treatment' of ARDS and critically ill patients as reported by many study authors, despite the ongoing controversy. We excluded neonates described as having 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia' or 'chronic lung disease' because of different pathophysiology, treatment, prognosis and progression of the disease.Types of interventions We included trials comparing INO versus placebo or no intervention in adults and children with ARDS. We included any type or dose of INO and any duration of administration. We permitted a co\u2010intervention if it was administered in both groups. We excluded trials that compared only different INO treatment regimens and those in which INO was compared with interventions other than placebo or no intervention.Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes Overall mortality (longest follow\u2010up, regardless of the duration of follow\u2010up).Overall 28\u2010day mortality (studies reporting mortality at 25 to 30 days were included in the same analysis).Secondary outcomes Bleeding events: defined as pulmonary bleeding or systemic bleeding requiring transfusion.Complications during the in\u2010patient stay (e.g. hypotensive episodes, direct irritation on administration, thrombosis, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, renal failure, cerebrovascular accident).PaO2/FiO2 ratio.Ventilator\u2010free days.Duration of mechanical ventilation.Oxygenation index.Improvement in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mm Hg).Methaemoglobin concentration > 5%.Nitric oxide concentration > 3 ppm.Resolution of multi\u2010organ failure (according to different organ dysfunction scores).Quality of life assessment, as defined by authors of included studies.Length of stay in intensive care unit and in hospital.Cost\u2010benefit analyses.Search methods for identification of studiesElectronic searches For this review update, we performed a search update to 18 November 2015. Thus, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11); SilverPlatter MEDLINE (WebSPIRSOvid SP, 1950 to 18 November 2015); SilverPlatter EMBASE (WebSPIRSOvid SP, 1980 to 18 November 2015); SilverPlatter BIOSIS Previews (WebSPIRS 1993 to 18 November 2015); International Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1964 to 18 November 2015); Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (via BIREME) (1982 to 18 November 2015); the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database; advanced Google; and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (via EBSCO host) (1980 to 18 November 2015) (see Appendix 1).Searching other resources We handsearched the reference lists of reviews, randomized and non\u2010randomized studies and editorials for additional studies. We contacted the main authors of included studies to ask about any missed, unreported or ongoing studies. We searched for ongoing clinical trials and unpublished studies on the following Internet sites.http://www.controlled\u2010trials.comhttp://clinicaltrials.govhttp://www.centerwatch.comWe applied no language restriction to eligible reports and performed the latest search on 18 November 2015.Data collection and analysisThree review authors (FG, OK, AA) independently screened and classified all citations as potential primary studies, review articles or other. All review authors independently examined all potential primary studies and decided on their inclusion in the review (Figure 3). We evaluated all trials for major potential sources of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, funding and completeness of follow\u2010up) (Figure 4; Figure 5). We assessed each trial quality factor separately and defined trials as having low risk of bias only if they adequately fulfilled all of the criteria. We independently extracted from each trial and evaluated data on methods and outcomes in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We resolved disagreements by reaching consensus among review authors.Open in a separate window3INO search result.Open in a separate window4Methodological quality graph: review authors' judgements about each methodological quality item presented as percentages across all included studies.Open in a separate window5Methodological quality summary: review authors' judgements about each methodological quality item for each included study.Selection of studies We assessed the articles identified via the described searches and excluded obviously irrelevant reports. Three review authors (FG, OK, AA) independently examined articles for eligibility and screened titles and abstracts to identify studies for eligibility (Figure 3; see Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies). We performed this process without blinding of study authors, institutions, journals of publication or results. We resolved disagreements by reaching consensus among review authors. We provide here a detailed description of the search and assessment.Data extraction and management We independently extracted and collected data without blinding to study authors, source institutions or publication source of trials. We resolved disagreements by discussion and approached all first authors of included trials for additional information on risks of bias. For more detailed information, please see Contributions of authors.Assessment of risk of bias in included studies We evaluated the validity and design characteristics of each trial.We evaluated trials for major potential sources of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) analysis and completeness of follow\u2010up; see Appendix 2). We assessed each trial quality factor separately and defined trials as having low risk of bias only if they adequately fulfilled all of the criteria described below.Measures of treatment effect Dichotomous data We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data (binary outcomes). These included the following:Primary outcomes Mortality by duration and overall mortality.Secondary outcomes Number of infectious complications.Adverse events.Continuous data We used the mean difference (MD) or the RR if data were continuous and were measured in the same way between trials as follows:Length of stay in an intensive care unit (ICU).Number of days on a ventilator.Length of hospital stay.Unit of analysis issues Cross\u2010over trials We excluded cross\u2010over trials from our meta\u2010analyses because of the potential risk for \u201ccarry\u2010over\u201d of treatment effect.Studies with multiple intervention groups In studies designed with multiple intervention groups, we combined groups to create a single pair\u2010wise comparison in accordance with Higgins 2011. In trials with two or more groups receiving different doses, we combined data for primary and secondary outcomes.Dealing with missing data We contacted the authors of trials with missing data to retrieve the relevant information. For all included studies, we noted levels of attrition and any exclusion of participants. In cases of missing data, we chose \u2019complete\u2010case analysis\u2019 for our primary outcomes, thus excluding from the analysis all participants with missing outcomes. Selective outcome reporting, which occurs when non\u2010significant results are selectively withheld from publication (Chan 2004), is defined as selection, on the basis of results, of a subset of the original variables recorded for inclusion in publication of trials (Hutton 2000). The most important types of selective outcome reporting are selective omission of outcomes from reports; selective choice of data for an outcome; selective reporting of different analyses using the same data; selective reporting of subsets of the data; and selective under\u2010reporting of data (Higgins 2011).Assessment of heterogeneity We explored heterogeneity using the I\u00b2 statistic and the Chi\u00b2 test. An I\u00b2 statistic higher than 50% represents substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). In case of an I\u00b2 statistic > 0%, we tried to determine the cause of heterogeneity by performing relevant subgroup analyses. We used the Chi\u00b2 test to obtain an indication of heterogeneity between studies, with P value \u2264 0.1 considered significant.Assessment of reporting biases Funding bias is related to possible publication delay or discouragement of undesired results in trials sponsored by the industry (Higgins 2011). To explore the role of funding, we planned to conduct a sensitivity analysis based on our primary endpoint.Data synthesis We used Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3.5) and calculated RRs with 95% CIs for dichotomous variables and MDs with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. We used the Chi\u00b2 test to obtain an indication of heterogeneity between studies, with P value \u2264 0.1 considered significant. We quantified the degree of heterogeneity observed in the results by using the I\u00b2 statistic, which can be interpreted as the proportion of total variation observed between studies that is attributable to differences between studies rather than to sampling error (Higgins 2011). An I\u00b2 statistic value > 75% is considered very heterogeneous. We used both a random\u2010effects model and a fixed\u2010effect model. If the I\u00b2 statistic value was 0%, we reported only results from the fixed\u2010effect model, and with an I\u00b2 statistic value > 0%, we reported only results from the random\u2010effects model.Trial sequential analysis Risk of type 1 errors in meta\u2010analyses due to sparse data and repeated significance testing following updates with new trials remains a serious concern (Brok 2009; Thorlund 2009; Wetterslev 2008; Wetterslev 2009). As a result, spurious P values due to systematic errors from trials with high risk of bias, outcome reporting bias, publication bias, early stopping for benefit and small trial bias may result in false conclusions. In a single trial, interim analysis increases the risk of type 1 errors. To avoid type 1 errors, group sequential monitoring boundaries (Lan 1983) are used to decide whether a trial could be terminated early because of a sufficiently small P value, thus the cumulative Z curve crosses the monitoring boundary.Equally, sequential monitoring boundaries can be applied to meta\u2010analyses and are labelled \u2019trial sequential monitoring boundaries\u2019. In 'trial sequential analysis\u2019 (TSA), the addition of each new trial to a cumulative meta\u2010analysis is viewed as an interim meta\u2010analysis, which provides useful information on the need for additional trials (Wetterslev 2008).It is appropriate and wise to adjust new meta\u2010analyses for multiple testing on accumulating data to control overall type 1 error risk in cumulative meta\u2010analysis (Pogue 1997; Pogue 1998; Thorlund 2009; Wetterslev 2008).When TSA is performed, the cumulative Z curve crossing the boundary indicates that a sufficient level of evidence has been reached; as a consequence, one may conclude that no additional trials may be needed. However, evidence is insufficient to allow a conclusion if the Z curve does not cross the boundary or does not surpass the required information size.To construct trial sequential monitoring boundaries (TSMBs), one needs a required information size, which is calculated as the least number of participants required in a well\u2010powered single trial with low risk of bias (Brok 2009; Pogue 1998; Wetterslev 2008).In this updated review, we adjusted the required information size for heterogeneity by using the diversity adjustment factor (Wetterslev 2009). We applied TSA, as it prevents an increase in the risk of type 1 errors (20%). If the actual accrued information size was too small, we provided the required information size in the light of actual diversity (Wetterslev 2009).Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We conducted the following subgroup analyses:Benefits and harms of INO in participants with ALI or ARDS based on the cause (primary lung injury vs secondary lung injury).Benefits and harms of INO in paediatric participants (paediatric participants (< 18 years) vs adult participants).Benefits and harms of INO based on duration of drug administration (short\u2010term vs long\u2010term administration).If analyses of various subgroups were significant, we performed a test of interaction (Altman 2003). We considered P values < 0.05 as indicating significant interaction between INO treatment and subgroup categories.Sensitivity analysis We decided to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the results by applying fixed\u2010effect and random\u2010effects models to assess the impact of heterogeneity on our results.Summary of findings We used the principles of the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to provide an overall assessment of evidence related to all of our outcomes. We constructed a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEpro software. As outcomes of public interest, we chose to present overall mortality (regardless of the follow\u2010up period), ICU length of stay, days on ventilator and length of hospital stay (see Table 1).Summary of findings for the main comparisonINO compared with control group for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) in children and adultsINO compared with control group for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) in children and adultsPatient or population: critically ill participants with ALI and ARDSSetting: intensive care units, worldwide\nIntervention: INOComparison: controlOutcomesIllustrative comparative risks* (95% CI)Relative effect\n(95% CI)Number of participants\n(studies)Quality of the evidence\n(GRADE)CommentsAssumed riskCorresponding riskControlINOOverall mortality375 per 1000(337 to 415)382 per 1000(346 to 420)RR 1.04 \n(0.9 to 1.19)1243\n(13 studiesa)\u2295\u2295\u2295\u229d\nmoderatea,bTSA alfa\u2010spending\u2010adjusted analysis results in an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0. to 1.23; I\u00b2 = 0%, diversity D\u00b2 = 0%).

A total of 1275 participants were included in this review update. We found one of the studies (Bronicki 2015) by handsearching. We have provided the flow chart for this updated review in Figure 3.Included studies All included trials except two (Day 1997; Taylor 2004) used the ARDS definition based on the European\u2010American consensus statement as an entry criterion (Table 14). No currently included study used the Berlin ARDS definition, as patient enrolment for the most recent study took place from 2003 through 2005 (Bronicki 2015). One trial used the Murray Lung Injury Score > 2.5 (Troncy 1998), and another used oxygenation index (OI) criteria (Dobyns 1999). Two trials (Ibrahim 2007; Lundin 1999) used a definition of ALI that was modified from that used the consensus statement. Two studies were published in abstract form (Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997). We identified no duplicate reports. In Angus 2006, study authors described the 'activity of daily living scale' (ADL) and the 'quality of well being scale' (QWB), hospital costs and resource use, as well as long\u2010term mortality, on the basis of Taylor 2004. All studies except one (Schwebel 1997) reported mortality. Analyses of the impact of INO on oxygenation were hindered as the result of application of different indicators of oxygenation, different time points for oxygenation measurement and demonstration of therapeutic effects in graphic form without adjacent numerical data in most publications. Investigators inconsistently reported other clinical outcome variables in line with our defined primary and secondary outcomes.1Details of included studiesStudyPopulation and inclusion criteriaINO group characteristics and details of INO administrationControl group characteristicsVentilation strategyDuration of longest follow\u2010upCo\u2010interventionsBronicki 201553 children, 9 centres, oxygenation index (OI) \u2265 12; chest radiograph with pulmonary infiltrates; mechanically ventilated \u2264 7 days24 participants, 5 ppm INO until death, ventilator\u2010free or at day 28 after enrolment (whichever came first)29 participants, 5 ppm nitrogenCMV: low\u2010volume tidal strategy (4\u20108 mL/kg and plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O); PEEP based on serial chest radiographs.

Sample size varied from 14 to 385 participants with ALI or ARDS (Table 14).Intervention duration ranged from less than 24 hours to four weeks. The estimated median length of interventions was seven days. Follow\u2010up ranged from 24 hours to one year. The comparison group received placebo in six trials (Bronicki 2015; Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997; Taylor 2004). Nitrogen was used as placebo, except in one trial, which used air (Dobyns 1999).Nine trials applied a fixed dose of INO (median 10 ppm; range 5 to 10 ppm) (Bronicki 2015; Day 1997; Dobyns 1999; Gerlach 2003; Ibrahim 2007; Park 2003; Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997; Taylor 2004). Four trials used the lowest dose to achieve an oxygenation response (Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Michael 1998; Troncy 1998), and one trial used different doses of INO (Dellinger 1998). One trial enrolled only INO responders (Lundin 1999).In five trials, a few participants allocated to the control group crossed over to INO as rescue therapy after randomization, according to predefined protocols (Dobyns 1999; Lundin 1999; Michael 1998; Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997). In one trial, all randomized participants (in control and INO groups) received INO after 24 hours (Day 1997). Thus, we chose to report only mortality data gathered before this cross\u2010over took place (Day 1997). At the clinician's discretion, nitric oxide treatment was discontinued (Schwebel 1997) or was tapered after a pre\u2010specified time period (Dobyns 1999; Ibrahim 2007; Michael 1998) or after pre\u2010defined gas exchange endpoints were reached (Day 1997; Dellinger 1998; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Michael 1998; Payen 1999). Only one trial did not provide information on INO discontinuation criteria (Park 2003). Investigators applied various co\u2010interventions, such as the recruitment manoeuvre (Park 2003), the prone position (Bronicki 2015; Gerlach 2003; Ibrahim 2007; Taylor 2004)) and use of corticosteroids (Dellinger 1998).Four unblinded trials (Gerlach 2003; Ibrahim 2007; Park 2003; Troncy 1998) and one blinded trial used pre\u2010defined protocols for mechanical ventilation (Schwebel 1997); three unblinded trials adhered to guidelines (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Taylor 2004).Excluded studies We excluded nine potentially relevant publications (Cuthbertson 2000; Johannigman 1997; Khan 2009; Meade 2003; Perrin 2006; Puybasset 1994; Puybasset 1995; Rossaint 1995; Tang 1998;) for reasons detailed in the Characteristics of excluded studies section.Studies awaiting assessment No studies are awaiting assessment.Ongoing studies We identified one ongoing study (Godinez). This study was reported to be completed in 2006 but no results have been published so far; for details, see the Characteristics of ongoing studies section.Risk of bias in included studiesWe classified four trials as having low risk of bias for the main outcome \u2010 overall mortality (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004) (see Analysis 2.1). For a more detailed description of individual trial qualities, see the table Characteristics of included studies. We have presented the various bias domains in the 'Risk of bias graph' and a 'Risk of bias summary' figure (Figure 4; Figure 5).Open in a separate window2.1AnalysisComparison 2 Mortality: INO versus control (bias assessment), Outcome 1 Mortality: sensitivity analysis based on overall risk of bias.Allocation Six trials (43%) adequately reported random sequence generation (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004), whereas seven trials (50%) reported allocation concealment (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Gerlach 2003; Lundin 1999; Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997; Taylor 2004) (see Appendix 3).Blinding Six trials provided sufficient data to be categorized as double\u2010blinded (46%) (Bronicki 2015; Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Payen 1999; Schwebel 1997; Taylor 2004). Remaining trials were open\u2010label studies or did not provide sufficient data on how double\u2010blinding was achieved (see Appendix 3).Incomplete outcome data All trials except two provided complete follow\u2010up for the primary outcome (Angus 2006; Schwebel 1997) (see Appendix 3). The Angus 2006 publication is based on one\u2010year follow\u2010up of the same cohort of participants as were described in Taylor 2004, which presented complete follow\u2010up. Study authors reported 90.2% follow\u2010up at one year (Angus 2006). In Schwebel 1997, study authors did not provide data on mortality nor on length of follow\u2010up. Six trials (43%) performed analysis according to the ITT method or provided sufficient data to permit ITT analyses (Dellinger 1998; Gerlach 2003; Lundin 1999; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004; Troncy 1998). Additionally, some trials did not provide explicit information on duration of the longest follow\u2010up (Appendix 3). Many of our analyses were subject to limitations because most studies demonstrated therapeutic effects in graphic form, without providing numerical data.We found one trial on Clinical Trial.gov (Godinez) and found that no other data had been published yet. We tried to contact study authors without success.Selective reporting Thirteen trials provided adequate information to be classified as low\u2010risk trials (Bronicki 2015; Day 1997; Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Gerlach 2003; Ibrahim 2007; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Michael 1998; Park 2003; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004; Troncy 1998). Supplementary information was often obtained through online registration, available protocols or clarifying responses to our questions as provided by study authors. One trial did not provide sufficient data on selective reporting (high\u2010risk) (Schwebel 1997).Other potential sources of bias Seven trials reported a sample size calculation (Dellinger 1998; Gerlach 2003; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Michael 1998; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004), but only two were powered to show statistically significant benefit for primary endpoints (Lundin 1999; Taylor 2004) (see Appendix 3). Lundin 1999 was stopped early for slow enrolment (at 45% of calculated sample size), Taylor 2004 enrolled only 75% of the planned sample size, for unknown reasons, and Bronicki 2015 was terminated prematurely because of slow enrolment (planned 338 participants, enrolled 55 participants).The funnel plot of standard error versus risk ratio for overall longest follow\u2010up mortality (Figure 6) and the funnel plot for 28\u2010day to 30\u2010day mortality (Figure 7) showed a symmetrical distribution that indicated no bias or publication bias. As we noted no asymmetry or heterogeneity in the funnel plot, we found no need to apply the arcsine\u2010Thompson test, as proposed by R\u00fccker (R\u00fccker 2008). Additionally, we found no statistical significance (P value = 0.33) upon applying Egger's regression intercept test.Open in a separate window6Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Mortality, outcome: 1.1 Longest follow\u2010up, mortality.Open in a separate window7Funnel plot of comparison: 1 Mortality, outcome: 1.2 28\u2010 to 30\u2010day mortality.Effects of interventionsSee: Table 1Primary outcomes Overall mortality (longest follow\u2010up, regardless of the duration of follow\u2010up) Combining data from the 13 included trials (1243 participants) and applying complete\u2010case analysis revealed no statistically significant effects of INO on longest follow\u2010up mortality: 250/654 deaths (38.2%) in the INO group compared with 221/589 deaths (37.5%) in the control group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.19; I\u00b2 = 0%) (see Analysis 1.1).

However, the test of interaction for the RR of renal impairment from trials with low risk of bias (Dellinger 1998; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004; 765 participants) (see Analysis 4.1) versus the one trial with high risk of bias (Lundin 1999; 180 participants) (see Analysis 4.1) did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.22). We accepted various definitions of renal impairment as proposed by study authors (see Appendix 4).

One trial (Lundin 1999) involving 180 participants provided data on reversal of ALI, showing no statistically beneficial effects of INO (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.46).

The quality of evidence was high.PaO2/FiO2 ratio Eleven trials (Day 1997; Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Gerlach 2003; Ibrahim 2007; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; Michael 1998; Park 2003; Schwebel 1997; Troncy 1998 ; 614 participants) indicated an improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 hours (MD 15.91, 95% CI 8.25 to 23.56; I\u00b2 = 25%) (Analysis 5.1). An additional analysis of PaO2/FiO2 difference from baseline at 24 hours, based on data from three trials (Dobyns 1999; Park 2003; Troncy 1998; 155 participants), revealed a similar finding (MD 42.90, 95% CI 20.57 to 65.23; I\u00b2 = 58%) (see Analysis 5.5). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 48 and 72 hours no longer showed a statistically significant beneficial effect (see Analysis 5.2; Analysis 5.3), but the analysis at 96 hours, based on four trials (Dellinger 1998; Gerlach 2003; Lundin 1999; Mehta 2001; 334 participants), showed improved oxygenation in the INO group (MD 14.51, 95% CI 3.64 to 25.38; I\u00b2 = 0%) (see Analysis 5.4).

We did not conduct a subgroup analysis to assess the effects of different INO dosages as no evidence appears to support this and many reported trials did not use a fixed dose of INO but applied dose titration (Adhikari 2007; Sokol 2003a) (Table 14).Open in a separate window1.4AnalysisComparison 1 Mortality: INO versus control group, Outcome 4 Mortality: subgroup analysis based on duration of drug administration.Definition of respiratory failure Studies designed before 2012 used the AECC definition (Bernard 1994) of acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereas more recent studies use the 2012 definitions (ARDS Definition Task Force 2012).

We identified four trials with low risk of bias (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004), which showed no statistically significant findings for our primary endpoint.Trial sequential analysis (TSA) We conducted trial sequential analysis (TSA) of INO versus control to examine longest follow\u2010up mortality (see Analysis 1.1; Figure 1). The TSA alfa\u2010spending\u2010adjusted confidence interval for meta\u2010analysis of the primary outcome with continuity correction for zero event trials (0.001 event in each arm) in a fixed\u2010effect model resulted in an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; I\u00b2 = 0%, diversity D\u00b2 = 0%). However, for trials with low risk of bias, the TSA\u2010adjusted RR was 1.02 with 95% CI of 0.79 to 1.33 (I\u00b2 = 0%, diversity D\u00b2 = 0%). With an accrued information size of 1243 participants (for all trials) and no boundaries crossed so far, only 41.92% of the required information size is actually available at this stage for rejection or acceptance of a 4% relative risk increase for overall mortality. However, solid evidence may be obtained with fewer participants if eventually the cumulative meta\u2010analysis z\u2010curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary constructed for a required information size of 3015 randomized participants. However, when the TSA analysis for this outcome is examined, it is important to bear in mind that only four out of the 14 included studies are classified as trials with low risk of bias. Therefore, TSA is not able to directly adjust for the impact of bias.Open in a separate window1TSA of all trials of the effect of INO on mortality (longest follow\u2010up). The TSA\u2010adjusted confidence interval for the meta\u2010analysis of the primary outcome with continuity correction for zero events trials (0.001 event in each arm) in a fixed\u2010effect model results in an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; I\u00b2 statistic = 0%, diversity D\u00b2 = 0%). With an accrued information size of 1243 participants and no boundaries crossed so far, only 41.92% of the required information size is actually available at this stage for rejection or acceptance of a 4% RRI for overall mortality. However, solid evidence may be obtained with fewer participants if eventually the cumulative meta\u2010analysis z\u2010curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary constructed for a required information size of 3015 randomized participants. However, regarding the TSA analysis for this outcome, it is important to bear in mind that only 4 out of the 14 included studies are classified as low risk of bias trials. Therefore, TSA is not able to directly adjust for the impact of bias.Application of TSA to analysis of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 hours did indicate statistical significance in favour of improved oxygenation, even with adjustment for repetitive testing of accumulating data in the cumulative meta\u2010analysis, as the z\u2010curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary (Figure 2). The a priori information size (335 participants) is determined by a TSA alfa\u2010spending\u2010adjusted mean difference (MD) of 15.91. The cumulative z\u2010curve (blue line with filled squares) at the current accrued information size of 614 participants crosses the boundary (red lines with open diamonds) (with 80% power and alpha 0.05, assuming a double\u2010sided type 1 risk of 5% and type 2 risk of 20%). However, it is important to note that only two trials were at low risk of bias, and the TSA alfa\u2010spending\u2010adjusted confidence interval for the meta\u2010analysis in a random\u2010effects model results in an MD of 15.91 with substantial heterogeneity and diversity (95% CI 9.67 to 22.15; I\u00b2 = 25%, diversity D\u00b2 = 49%). However, the required information size based on the two trials (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; 276 participants) with low risk of bias is 5137 participants (MD 14.94, TSA\u2010adjusted 95% CI \u201073.70 to \u2010103.58; I\u00b2 = 87%, diversity D\u00b2 = 91%).Open in a separate window2TSA of all trials of the effect of INO on PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 hours. Application of TSA to analysis of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 hours indicates statistical significance in favour of improved oxygenation, even with adjustment for repetitive testing on accumulating data in the cumulative meta\u2010analysis, because the z\u2010curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary.

The cumulative z\u2010curve (blue line with filled squares) at the current accrued information size of 614 participants crosses the boundary (red lines with open diamonds) (with 80% power and alpha 0.05, assuming a double\u2010sided type 1 risk of 5% and type 2 risk of 20%).

DiscussionIn this systematic review of 14 trials with 1275 participants with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF), we found no benefits of inhaled nitric oxide (INO) for survival. The analysis on mortality showed no heterogeneity and was robust when different subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Conversely, INO increased the risk of renal failure among an adult population and transiently improved oxygenation, only for the first 24 hours. Sparse data on mortality are not promising but do not provide evidence of the absence of a beneficial effect; the data suggest that a potentially beneficial effect of INO must be modest, and the actual point estimate suggests harm (see Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2). In addition, our mortality analysis on the longest follow\u2010up may have been influenced by the fact that only one trial (Taylor 2004) provided long\u2010term follow\u2010up for more than six months (Angus 2006).The point estimate of the potential intervention effect, as suggested by low\u2010bias trials, shows a 2% relative risk increase (RRI) (Analysis 1.1). To demonstrate or reject an a priori anticipated beneficial effect on mortality in a single trial, assuming a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 10%, at least 3015 participants should be randomized (Figure 1) (with 80% power and alpha 0.05, assuming a double\u2010sided type 1 risk of 5% and type 2 risk of 20%). However, solid evidence may be obtained with fewer participants if the RRR is higher than 10%, that is, if the cumulative meta\u2010analysis z\u2010curve crosses the trial sequential monitoring boundary before the required information size of 3015 randomized participants is reached.We found no statistically significant differences when examining effects in subgroups according to duration of the intervention, looking at interventions among different populations (paediatric, adult) and performing sensitivity analyses, which excluded trials published only as abstracts. The three paediatric trials (Bronicki 2015; Day 1997; Dobyns 1999) that provided information on mortality had a combined total of 185 participants, which is insufficient to demonstrate any benefits or harms of INO therapy in paediatric acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of varied primary origins, reversal of ALI resolution of multi\u2010organ failure and assessments of quality of life and bias did not result in statistically significant findings. Additional analyses, such as those involving adverse events, indicated increased risk of renal failure among adults with no signs of increased risk of bleeding, methaemoglobinaemia or increased nitrogen dioxide concentration, except possibly among participants receiving INO doses greater than 80 ppm. Outcomes such as duration of stay in both ICU and hospital and other clinically relevant outcomes were inconsistently reported. We did not perform a subgroup analysis of reversal of ARDS, as insufficient data were provided. We contacted study authors to request missing data. Few responded, and they did not provide much additional information beyond that originally published.Despite evidence of initial but transient improved oxygenation in the INO group, these analyses were hampered by the fact that various trials described effects on oxygenation differently, thus preventing adequate pooling of data. Even though a beneficial effect may be noted, oxygenation may be only a surrogate outcome, and it is uncertain whether it predicts any clinical benefits. Additionally, many trials were conducted before the general recommendation of a lung protective, low tidal volume ventilation strategy was introduced (Petrucci 2013). The latter combined with oxygen toxicity, surfactant inhibition and ongoing fibrosis resulting from ARDS may have influenced the results of these trials. However, given that no differences in the mode of ventilation were noted between INO and control groups, this should not account for our findings of lack of benefit for survival and potential harm.We suggest several possible explanations for why INO may not be beneficial. By reducing ventilation\u2010perfusion mismatch in patients with ARDS, INO appears to initially improve oxygenation. However, theoretically, INO could worsen the clinical condition by reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, thereby causing vasodilatation of poorly ventilated areas, increasing the ventilation\u2010perfusion mismatch and resulting in worsening oxygenation (Kass 1998). However, we found little evidence to support the latter based on both published data and our respiratory analyses (Adhikari 2007) (see Analysis 5.1).Additonally, prolonged exposure to INO and its toxic metabolites could cause sensitization, over\u2010riding the possible benefits of INO (Gerlach 2003). Improved oxygenation is not associated with increased survival because improved oxygenation does not necessarily indicate improved lung function, reduction of lung injury or resolution of the underlying cause of ARDS and often co\u2010existing multi\u2010organ failure (ARDS network 2000; Petrucci 2013). Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of renal vascular tone and a modulator of glomerular function. At the same time, it has been suggested that changes in NO production could cause acute renal failure by altering the function of mitochondria, various enzymes, deoxyribonucleic acid and membranes (Adhikari 2007; Valdivielso 2002). The latter suggestion is consistent with our finding of a possible harmful effect of INO on renal function.Summary of main resultsOur systematic review showed that INO, despite transiently improving oxygenation, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and the oxygenation index, and despite providing signs of reducing the rate of severe respiratory failure, does not reduce mortality or length of stay in ICU or hospital. Conversely, it appears that INO results in impairment of renal function among adults. We conducted multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and none indicated relevant benefits of INO. We classified only four trials as having low risk of bias. Current evidence does not support the routine use of INO for severe respiratory failure.Overall completeness and applicability of evidenceThe overall quantity of data on which robust conclusions can be based is limited to 14 trials with 1275 participants. Evidence indicating that INO was not beneficial for patients with acute respiratory failure is of moderate to high quality. The definition of acute respiratory failure was usually that provided by the American\u2010European Consensus Conference (AECC) in 1994 (Bernard 1994), which allows for appropriate comparison between trials. Primary outcomes of mortality were generally well reported, and secondary outcomes were often reported as well.Therefore, despite the limited number of studies and participants identified, available evidence seems to be applicable to intensive care patients.Quality of the evidenceThe randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered the most rigorous method of determining whether a cause\u2010effect relationship exists between an intervention and an outcome. The strength of the RCT lies in the process of randomization.The quality of findings ranks from moderate to high across different outcomes. The main limiting factors that accounted for a decrease in quality included high risk of bias and small and poorly described trials.Four trials were reported as having low risk of bias (Dellinger 1998; Dobyns 1999; Payen 1999; Taylor 2004). We applied several statistical methods to explore and reduce the extent of bias, such as complete case analysis, trial sequential analysis, overall methodological bias assessment and analyses of various relevant clinical and physiological outcomes.Application of the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach enables us to incorporate risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimate and risk of publication bias. On the basis of the criteria mentioned above, we deemed the quality of evidence in this review to be moderate to high.Potential biases in the review processUpon reading the systematic review (Adhikari 2007) and acknowledging that very few trials had been published subsequently, we became aware of some of the conclusions that we would reach. Addtitionally, we realized that retrieving data from the authors of included trials relatively close to the latest systematic review could be difficult because providing additional data is a time\u2010consuming process for trial authors. This has been the case.Our systematic review has several potential limitations, that is, our findings and interpretations are limited by the quality and quantity of available evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of included trials mainly by using published data, which ultimately may not reflect the truth. We contacted all study authors, but only a few responded and provided further information. We were not able to retrieve protocols of the published trials and thus could not compare published outcomes versus outcomes proposed in the protocols. The value of these analyses is limited by the fact that only a small number of trials contributed to our subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Further, two trials with 51 participants did not report mortality during the trial (Ibrahim 2007; Schwebel 1997).We noted variation in participant populations; type, dose and duration of INO treatment; and length of follow\u2010up, along with consistent lack of improved survival across trials; we found the most beneficial effect among the subgroup of trials with high risk of bias, although these findings did not reach statistical significance (see Analysis 2.1). This minimizes the possibility that some subgroups of patients may benefit from INO. No trial has used short\u2010term INO among the subgroup of patients with critically low oxygenation to buy valuable time to instigate other treatments to improve lung function, and this issue remains controversial.Although we noted minimal heterogeneity among trial results on mortality, we are aware that we pooled heterogeneous trials in terms of age, participants, settings and treatment regimens. Thus, the validity of our meta\u2010analysis may be criticized. However, all trials included patients with acute respiratory failure with similar inflammatory pathways, providing in our opinion good biological reasons to perform a broad meta\u2010analysis, which also considerably increases the generalizability and usefulness of the review. Further, a broad meta\u2010analysis increases power, reduces the risk of erroneous conclusions and facilitates exploratory analyses that can generate hypotheses for future research (Gotzsche 2000).Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviewsIn general, our review presents the same conclusions as were provided by Adhikari et al (Adhikari 2007) and by authors of previous versions of this Cochrane review. However, we included more trials and thus were able to determine more precise estimates of mortality. Furthermore, we applied several sensitivity and subgroup analyses, trial sequential analysis and GRADE, which supported the overall results. It is important to note that Dr. Neill Adhikari has provided us with valuable data on physiological and clinical outcomes, such as PaO2/FiO2, oxygenation index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, duration of mechanical ventilation and number of ventilator\u2010free days up to 30 days, on behalf of several authors of included trials. Authors' conclusionsImplications for practiceEvidence is insufficient to support the use of INO in patients with any category of ARDS and ALI. Despite signs of improved oxygenation, we did not find a statistically significant effect of INO on mortality or other clinical outcomes. Additionally, INO appeared to increase the risk of renal failure. Subgroup analyses performed according to duration of intervention, length of follow\u2010up and different patient groups did not show differences in the estimates of intervention effects. In terms of the paediatric population, data are insufficient to support or refute the routine use of INO. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that no evidence from randomized trials is available to support application of INO in the clinical setting among children or adults.The GRADE approach only reaffirmed our interpretation of the level of evidence, and we are confident that at this stage, the quality of evidence related to our outcomes is moderate to high, despite the fact that many trials have some risk of bias.Implications for researchLarge randomized trials with low risk of bias with a sample size of up to several thousand participants are needed to evaluate INO for adults and children before this intervention can be definitively rejected or accepted for critically ill patients with ALI and ARDS. However, current results are not promising, and the potential for benefit seems modest, with the actual point estimate of the intervention effect on mortality suggesting harm. Despite the heterogeneity that might exist in the patient population of included trials, and despite the high mortality rate among patients with ARDS and ALI, we believe that INO should be used as only one part of randomized clinical trials. Additional trials need to focus on other relevant outcomes, such as long\u2010term survival, duration of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, number of ventilator\u2010free days and assessment of quality of life.

However, no results have been published so far. We tried to contact study authors but unsuccessfully.FiO2: fraction of inspired oxygen;INO: inhaled;NO: nitric oxide;PaO2: partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood;PEEP: positive end\u2010expiratory pressure;RCT: randomized controlled trial Differences between protocol and review2016Title of the review changed. Acute lung injury is no longer mentioned in the title of the review. This is because as the Description of the condition section states, acute lung injury no longer exists and has instead been replaced by a gradation of ARDS that is based on the severity of hypoxaemia; the title of the updated review reflects this change.
