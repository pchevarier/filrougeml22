{"title": "Oncogenic SNORD12B activates the AKT-mTOR-4EBP1 signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via nucleus partitioning of PP-1\u03b1", "pubDate": "2021", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1038/s41388-021-01809-2", "PMID": "33941854", "abstract": "Esophageal cancer is a complex malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In Eastern Asia including China, about 90% of all incident cases have esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mounting evidence elucidates that aberrant expression of various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) contributes to ESCC progression, but it remains unclear how small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in ESCC development. We systemically screened clinically relevant snoRNAs in ESCC via integrative analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and validation in ESCC tissues. We found that snoRNA SNORD12B was one of the most evidently upregulated snoRNAs in ESCC specimens and its high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients. SNORD12B profoundly promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating its oncogene nature. In particular, SNORD12B could interact with PP-1\u03b1, one of the three catalytic subunits of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1, which is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates AKT to suppress its activation. Interestingly, high levels of SNORD12B in ESCC cells could break interactions between 14-3-3\u03b6 and PP-1\u03b1, abolish the retention of PP-1\u03b1 in the cytosol by 14-3-3\u03b6 and relocate PP-1\u03b1 from the cytosol to the nucleus. This led to sequestered PP-1\u03b1 in the nucleus, enhanced phosphorylation of AKT in the cytosol, activated AKT-mTOR-4EBP1 signaling, and, thus, ESCC progression. These insights would improve our understanding of how snoRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis and highlight the potential of snoRNAs as future therapeutic targets against cancers.", "author": [{"author": "Baoqing Tian", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Tian+B&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Jiandong Liu", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Liu+J&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Nasha Zhang", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Zhang+N&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Yemei Song", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Song+Y&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Yeyang Xu", "affiliation": ["Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Xu+Y&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Mengyu Xie", "affiliation": ["Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Xie+M&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Bowen Wang", "affiliation": ["Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Wang+B&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Hui Hua", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Hua+H&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Yue Shen", "affiliation": ["Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Shen+Y&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Yankang Li", "affiliation": ["Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong Province, China."], "href": "/?term=Li+Y&cauthor_id=33941854"}, {"author": "Ming Yang", "affiliation": ["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong Province, China. aaryoung@yeah.net."], "href": "/?term=Yang+M&cauthor_id=33941854"}], "refPMID": ["28823862", "15455378", "15054463", "19123468", "29379198", "25129146", "22960999", "22323360", "21642993", "20833657", "20729853", "20729852", "19698717", "25538231", "32308763", "32198345", "30463848", "31732666", "29253179", "28920960", "24522499", "32123074", "31125107", "30858545", "17318225", "24735946", "25879954", "16239144", "28911119", "20846955", "16357227", "19026782", "23022379", "26957605", "26595770", "26384739", "28650479", "29141226", "29702115", "29616119", "20186153", "24956593", "28283069", "20227039", "22367541", "32802198", "31866302", "32815538", "32939012"], "citedInPMID": ["33941854", "35095099", "34775914"], "body": ""}
