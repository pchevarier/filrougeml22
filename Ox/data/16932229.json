{"title": "Neuromuscular blocking agents decrease inflammatory response in patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome", "pubDate": "2006", "PMCID": "", "DOI": "10.1097/01.CCM.0000239435.87433.0D", "PMID": "16932229", "abstract": "Objective:                       To evaluate the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) on pulmonary and systemic inflammation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ventilated with a lung-protective strategy.                  Design:                       Multiple-center, prospective, controlled, and randomized trial.                  Setting:                       One medical and two medical-surgical intensive care units.                  Patients:                       A total of 36 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao2/Fio2 ratio of < or =200 at a positive end-expiratory pressure of > or =5 cm H2O) were included within 48 hrs of acute respiratory distress syndrome onset.                  Interventions:                       Patients were randomized to receive conventional therapy plus placebo (n = 18) or conventional therapy plus NMBAs (n = 18) for 48 hrs. Both groups were ventilated with a lung-protective strategy (tidal volume between 4 and 8 mL/kg ideal body weight, plateau pressure of < or =30 cm H2O).                  Measurements and main results:                       Bronchoalveolar lavages and blood samples were performed, before randomization and at 48 hrs, to determine the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8. Pao2/Fio2 ratio was evaluated before randomization and at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hrs. A decrease over time in IL-8 concentrations (p = .034) was observed in the pulmonary compartment of the NMBA group. At 48 hrs after randomization, pulmonary concentrations of IL-1beta (p = .005), IL-6 (p = .038), and IL-8 (p = .017) were lower in the NMBA group as compared with the control group. A decrease over time in IL-6 (p = .05) and IL-8 (p = .003) serum concentrations was observed in the NMBA group. At 48 hrs after randomization, serum concentrations of IL-1beta (p = .037) and IL-6 (p = .041) were lower in the NMBA group as compared with the control group. A sustained improvement in Pao2/Fio2 ratio was observed and was reinforced in the NMBA group (p < .001).                  Conclusion:                       Early use of NMBAs decrease the proinflammatory response associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanical ventilation.", "author": [{"author": "Jean-Marie Forel", "affiliation": ["R\u00e9animation M\u00e9dicale, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Marseille, H\u00f4pital Sainte Marguerite, Marseille, France."], "href": "/?term=Forel+JM&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Antoine Roch", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Roch+A&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Val\u00e9rie Marin", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Marin+V&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Pierre Michelet", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Michelet+P&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Didier Demory", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Demory+D&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Jean-Louis Blache", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Blache+JL&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Gilles Perrin", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Perrin+G&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Marc Gainnier", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Gainnier+M&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Pierre Bongrand", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Bongrand+P&cauthor_id=16932229"}, {"author": "Laurent Papazian", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Papazian+L&cauthor_id=16932229"}], "refPMID": [], "citedInPMID": ["16932229", "35101098", "35065599", "34992415", "34987415", "34860978", "34789851", "34714496", "34702332", "34599691", "34548139", "34301439", "34034782", "34025757", "33934595", "33738034", "33713156", "33627570", "33549310", "33526308", "33479442", "33444180", "33159530", "33134949", "33104824", "33095344", "33071092", "32376592", "32288733", "32066488", "32063852", "32030529", "32030306", "32015880", "31961896", "31931794", "31903290", "31728362", "31656637", "31392279", "31380507", "31365111", "31334568", "31258917", "31236307", "31197492", "30610519", "30460261", "30460260", "30460256", "30402484", "30247273", "30053961", "29788993", "29706811", "29568488", "29523157", "29241014", "28828366", "28770545", "28770093", "28127231", "28102521", "28101605", "28074228", "28013329", "27790273", "27783382", "27408729", "27255913", "27158460", "27040102", "27022981", "26988416", "26781952", "26598954", "26399892", "26399891", "26399890", "25586462", "25266883", "25182388", "25114697", "25110462", "25024936", "24885241", "24667919", "24469236", "24413319", "23982029", "23825769", "23822630", "23796602", "23497608", "23361625", "23062076", "22866017", "22835162", "19281886", "18087690", "17300737"], "body": ""}
