During transcription, several transcription elongation factors communicate with RNAP and regulate the velocity of RNA synthesis, transcriptional pausing, and termination (1). Recent genome-wide analyses of transcription elongation revealed the importance of transcription elongation in the regulation of gene expression (2\u20134). For example, a large fraction of transcribing eukaryotic RNAP II (Pol II) pauses near promoters to facilitate rapid changes in gene expression during cell development.Bacterial NusG is perhaps the best characterized transcription elongation factor in vivo and in vitro. Diverse functions of NusG have been reported, e.g., Escherichia coli NusG reduces RNAP pausing and intrinsic termination (5, 6), whereas Bacillus subtilis and Thermus thermophilus NusG enhance pausing (7, 8). NusG consists of the NusG amino-terminal (NGN) domain and Kyprides\u2013Onzonis\u2013Woese (KOW) motif at the C-terminal domain (hence also called KOW domain), and these two domains fold independently and are connected by a flexible linker of 13 amino acids (9, 10) (Fig.\u00a01B and Fig.\u00a0S1C). The NGN domain has been assigned the function for regulating transcription elongation. The KOW domain, on the other hand, plays important roles in interacting with other proteins. For example, it contacts the elongation factor NusE, which is also the ribosomal S10 subunit. This interaction is essential for forming rRNA and \u03bb gene antitermination complexes, as well as for the coupling of transcription and translation. Furthermore, the KOW contacts Rho for transcription termination (9, 11).Open in a separate windowFig. 1.X-ray crystal structure of the P. furiosus Spt4/5.

Thermophilus.Eukaryotic Spt5 is the functional and structural counterpart of bacterial NusG. In addition to the NGN and KOW domains, eukaryotic Spt5 contains additional motifs including the N-terminal acidic region, four to five additional KOW motifs, and C-terminal repeats that are targets of regulatory kinases (12) (Fig.\u00a0S1A). Eukaryotic Spt5 associates with Spt4 to form a Spt4/5 heterodimer, which is also called the DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) in higher eukaryotes (13). The Spt4/5 complex plays important roles in regulating transcription elongation both positively (14) and negatively (15).Structural and biochemical studies of the archaeal RNAP transcription system revealed that it is an excellent model for dissecting the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription, as well as providing unique data that may unify basic transcription mechanisms across all three domains of life (16\u201318). The archaeal transcription apparatus, which includes RNAP and general transcription and elongation factors, is similar to the eukaryotic system. Archaeal Spt5 has only two domains, NGN and KOW, similar to the bacterial NusG, but it forms a heterodimer with Spt4 like the eukaryotic Spt4/5 complex (19) (Fig.\u00a0S1). To understand how Spt4/5 regulates transcription elongation, we determined the crystal structure of archaeal Spt4/5 and the complex structure of RNAP-Spt4/5 using cryoelectron microscopy and single particle analysis. Results and DiscussionX-ray Crystal Structure of Pyrococcus furiosus Spt4/5. Crystal structures of archaeal Spt4/5 from Methanococcus jannaschii (19) and eukaryotic Spt4/5 from yeast (12) and human (20) revealed a highly conserved overall structure and architecture of the Spt4 and Spt5 dimerization surface. However, as these structures contain only the NGN of Spt5, the orientation of the KOW relative to NGN remains unknown. Here we have determined the crystal structure of the complete P. furiosus Spt4/5 at 1.8-\u212b resolution (Table\u00a0S1). The P. furiosus Spt4 and Spt5 were produced independently in E. coli and purified as an Spt4/5 complex to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weights of His6-tagged Spt4 and Spt5 are 11 and 17\u00a0kDa, respectively, and a native molecular mass of 25\u00a0kDa determined by size exclusion column chromatography indicates that Spt4/5 exist as a heterodimer in solution. The crystal structure of P. furiosus Spt4/5 was determined by molecular replacement, and refinement statistics are detailed in Table\u00a0S1.The overall structures of P. furiosus Spt4 and Spt5-NGN as well as the dimerization interface are similar to their homologues from M. jannaschii (19), yeast (12), and human (20) (Fig.\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a0S1). P. furiosus Spt4 consists of a NGN-binding domain (residues 30\u201361) and a zinc-binding domain (residues 2\u201329), with a zinc atom surrounded by four highly conserved cysteine residues (Fig.\u00a01A). Spt5 consists of the NGN (residues 2\u201383) and KOW (residues 92\u2013148) domains connected by an eight amino acid linker. There are two Spt4/5 heterodimers per asymmetric unit, and these structures are almost identical (0.257-\u212b root mean square deviations over 207 residues) and are related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axis. The two heterodimers interact between NGN and KOW domains and also between KOWs (Fig.\u00a01A).We concluded that the Spt5-KOW is able to form multiple orientations relative to the Spt5-NGN in solution for the following reasons. First, about 78% of the total contact area (2,367\u00a0\u212b2) of Spt5 for Spt4 binding was found in the Spt5-NGN, and there is no interaction between NGN and KOW in the same Spt5 molecule. Several amino acid residues in the Spt5-KOW are involved in protein\u2013protein contact with another Spt5 molecule in the asymmetric unit (contact area is 2,767\u00a0\u212b2, Fig.\u00a01A). This crystallographic contact between two Spt5 molecules in the asymmetric unit may force orienting the KOW relative to the NGN. Accordingly, a solution structure of P. furiosus Spt4/5 in the complex with RNAP showed a different conformation of the NGN and KOW domains, as well as an extended linker compared with the crystal structure (described below).Cryo-EM Reconstruction of the P. furiosus RNAP-Spt4/5 Complex. Deletion mutagenesis studies of the bacterial and archaeal RNAPs have suggested that the RNAP clamp coiled-coil motif in the largest subunit, \u03b2\u2032 in bacteria and RpoA1 in archaea, is a binding platform for NusG and Spt4/5 (19, 21). Nonetheless, the lack of structural models of the RNAP-NusG and RNAP-Spt4/5 complexes has hampered our understanding of how these factors influence RNAP transcription. To obtain molecular details of the interactions between RNAP and the elongation factor and structural insight into how the elongation factor influences RNAP transcription, we obtained the structure of P. furiosus RNAP in complex with Spt4/5 at 13-\u212b resolution using cryoelectron microscopy single particle analysis under a physiological condition (Figs.\u00a0S2 and S3).Eukaryotic Spt4/5 is only able to form a stable complex with the Pol II elongation complex with a nascent transcript longer than 18\u00a0nt (22, 23). In contrast, archaeal Spt4/5 is able to associate with RNAP independent of nucleic acids (19), and we took advantage of the simple and robust archaeal transcription system for obtaining homogeneous RNAP-Spt4/5 complexes suitable for cryo-EM studies.The cryo-EM structure of the P. furiosus RNAP has been reported by two different groups (24, 25), one of which used an RNAP sample provided by us (24). In both cryo-EM maps, the P. furiosus RNAP resembles a \u201ccrab claw\u201d with a protruding \u201cstalk,\u201d similar to the crystal structure of Sulfolobus sulfataricus RNAP (Fig.\u00a0S4 A and B). There is a large cleft between the RNAP claw comprising the RpoA1 and RpoB subunits, which is proposed for binding the downstream and upstream double-stranded DNA.The cryo-EM map of P. furiosus RNAP-Spt4/5 complex determined in this study also shows the characteristic overall shape of RNAP including the protruding stalk (Fig.\u00a02A), allowing us to fit the crystal structure of S. sulfataricus RNAP (16) into the map unambiguously (Fig.\u00a02B). In the cryo-EM reconstruction, however, a clear region of extra density lies across the cleft (labeled \u201ca\u201d in the panel). Instead of a clear cleft, the extra density bridges the RNAP claw, which together encircle a large channel. The extra density is positioned at the center of three RNAP domains called clamp, protrusion, and lobe and is weakly connected to another smaller extra density (labeled \u201cb\u201d in the panel) protruding from the large density (Fig.\u00a02 B and C). We have assigned these two density regions to be Spt4/5. The Spt5-NGN has been assigned to be the RNAP binding domain (19); thereby we assigned density region a to be Spt4/Spt5-NGN and b to be the Spt5 KOW, respectively. To validate that density region a indeed corresponds to the Spt4/Spt5-NGN, not the Spt5-KOW domain, we carried out antibody labeling experiments against the 6xHis-tag at the N terminus of Spt4 as shown in Fig.\u00a03. Briefly, we imaged the antibody labeled RNAP-Spt4/5 complex using negative stained EM. The labeled particles were picked and aligned to the cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex. Euler angles were assigned to these images by projection matching (Fig.\u00a03 A\u2013D). Comparisons with the reprojections of the cryo-EM reconstructions along the same angles (Fig.\u00a03 B and C) show a good correspondence between the particles and the reprojections. Additional density regions could be observed that have a characteristic Y shape of the IgGs (Fig.\u00a03 C and D). The antibodies are clearly colocalized with the density a, which we assigned to be the Spt4/5-NGN domain (as indicated by magenta arrows), and have no overlap with density b (as indicated by orange arrows), which we have assigned to be the KOW domain.Open in a separate windowFig. 2.Surface representations of the P. furiosus RNAP-Spt4/5 complex reconstruction.

White circles indicate the IgG density. Red outline shows the position of reprojected particle from B. (D) Same as C with arrows, showing the position of Spt4/5-NGN (magenta) and Spt5-KOW (orange). IgG density is also indicated (blue).Next, we carried out rigid body fitting of the X-ray structure of P. furiosus Spt4/5 determined in this study (Fig.\u00a02C), which showed good agreement between the crystal structure and the density shape. We also carried out energy minimization calculation for modeling the complex of RNAP coiled-coil motif and Spt4/5 (Fig.\u00a02D). The hydrophobic patch of Spt5-NGN, including Y45 and F47, faces the tip of the coiled coil of the RpoA1 subunit as suggested by site-directed and deletion mutagenesis studies (19). In addition to the main interactions, our cryo-EM structure identified an additional previously undescribed contact site; \u03b11 and \u03b12 of Spt5-NGN fit into a cleft between the lobe and the protrusion (Fig.\u00a02C). There is no interaction observed between RNAP and Spt4 in our model. This observation is in good agreement with biochemical data that the Spt5-NGN is the sole factor to form a complex with RNAP (19). The Spt5-KOW fits nicely into density b (Fig.\u00a02C), outside the main RNAP density. To fit the Spt5-KOW into the cryo-EM map, the KOW was rotated about 90\u00a0\u00b0 toward the upstream DNA side starting from the crystal structure. No steric clash between Spt4 and the Spt5-KOW nor Spt4 and the Spt5-linker is observed for this KOW fitting. A binding site of bacterial transcription elongation factor RfaH, which is a paralog of E. coli NusG, was mapped on the coiled coil of RNAP, and the docking model of RNAP transcription elongation complex with RfaH was constructed (21). A location and orientation of RfaH relative to the coiled coil in the docking model are similar to those of the Spt5-NGN in the cryo-EM RNAP-Spt4/5 complex structure.Modeling of the Transcription Elongation Complex with Spt4/5. The DNA binding channel of multisubunit RNAP is positioned between the RNAP claw, and the space of the channel is modulated by the position of the RNAP clamp. The crystal structures of transcription elongation complexes consisting of RNAP and the DNA/RNA hybrid, from T. thermophilus (26) and Pol II (27), showed that the clamp is in the closed position in the transcribing RNAP, but the channel is still partially open, perhaps explaining the property for transcription to pause in the absence of elongation factors. The cryo-EM reconstruction of the RNAP-Spt4/5 complex in this study revealed that Spt4/5 binds between the RNAP claw, thereby completely encircling the DNA binding channel. This closure would prevent DNA from disengaging from the transcribing RNAP and may provide an explanation as to why Spt4/5 is able to enhance transcription processivity. Complete closure of the DNA channel is reminiscent of the DNA sliding clamp in the DNA replication fork, the \u03b2-clamp in bacteria, and PCNA in eukaryotes, which enhances the processivity of DNA polymerase (28). The enclosure of DNA by proteins is also found in many processive ring helicases such as RuvB, E1, Large T-antigen, and MCM (minichromosome maintenance) (29).In the cryo-EM reconstruction of the RNAP-Spt4/5 complex, the diameter of the channel for the downstream DNA is much wider than that for upstream DNA (Fig.\u00a02A). To obtain further structural insight into how the transcription bubble is accommodated in the RNAP-Spt4/5 complex and also how Spt4/5 influences RNAP transcription, the DNA/RNA scaffold was modeled into the RNAP-Spt4/5 complex. Although many crystal structures of eukaryotic and bacterial elongation complexes have been determined, none of them shows a clear location for the nontemplate DNA in the transcription bubble nor the upstream double-stranded DNA. Recent single-molecule FRET experiments constructed the complete elongation complex model of yeast Pol II (30), and we have used this DNA/RNA scaffold for modeling the archaeal elongation complex. The yeast elongation complex model is overlaid with the archaeal RNAP using secondary structure matching. The downstream DNA fits perfectly into the DNA binding channel whereas the upstream DNA had to be tilted \u223c30\u00b0 toward the RNAP wall to avoid steric clash with the density corresponding to Spt4/5 (Fig.\u00a04A). It is important to note that the position of the upstream DNA has not been determined structurally. Only a small region of the upstream DNA is protected by RNAP in the DNA footprinting experiment, and a limited amount of DNA cross-linking was observed in this area (31). The upstream DNA in the elongation complex is therefore intrinsically flexible and may occupy multiple positions during transcription elongation. Spt4/5 in the elongation complex is ideally positioned to function as an \u201cupstream DNA holder\u201d and may be able to hold the upstream DNA in a confined location.Open in a separate windowFig. 4.Model of the P. furiosus RNAP transcription elongation complex with Spt4/5. (A) Two different views\u2014front and side\u2014of the RNAP cryo-EM reconstruction with the DNA/RNA model (template DNA, cyan; nontemplate DNA, black; RNA, red). Positions of D/L and E/F subunits, RNAP domains and Spt4/5 domains (Spt4/Spt5-NGN, NGN; Spt5-KOW, KOW) are indicated. Locations of downstream (d-DNA) and upstream (u-DNA) double-stranded DNAs are indicated. A map of the side view was sliced to show a transcription bubble and the active site (AC) inside the DNA binding channel. (B) The interaction between Spt4/5 and nucleic acid in the transcribing RNAP. A magnified view showing only DNA/RNA, Spt4/Spt5-NGN, and coiled coil (cc) of clamp. An orientation of this view is the same as A, Right. The surface of Spt4/5 is color coded according to electrostatic surface potential (negative, red; neutral, white; positive, blue).A basic region of Spt5-NGN is located near the nontemplate DNA within the transcription bubble (Fig.\u00a04B). In this basic patch, R9, K43, and R67 are highly conserved in archaea, but R61 and R64 are less conserved (Fig.\u00a01B). Some of these residues are conserved in eukaryotic Spt5 and bacterial NusG, but interestingly, each residue is conserved only in either eukaryote or bacteria; e.g., R9/K43/R67 and R61 are conserved in only eukaryote and bacteria, respectively. The different amino acids in this region may explain their unique functions only found in particular domains of life. The close proximity of the Spt5-NGN and the nontemplate DNA within the transcription bubble in the model is able to explain the result whereby B. subtilis NusG contacts the nontemplate DNA for stabilizing transcriptional pausing (7).In addition to the interaction with proteins, the KOW motif has been shown to bind DNA and RNA (32). In the model of the transcription elongation complex with Spt4/5 (Fig.\u00a04A), the Spt5-KOW locates near the upstream DNA, which allows it to contact DNA. A recent photo-cross-linking experiment with the Drosophila Pol II transcription elongation complex in the presence of Spt4/5 has shown that the Spt5 subunit contacts a nascent transcript if the RNA length is longer than 18\u00a0nt (22). In our model (Fig.\u00a04A), the Spt5-KOW locates far from the 16\u00a0nt RNA, which just begins to emerge from the surface of RNAP suggesting that eukaryotic Spt5 uses its second to fifth KOW motifs but not the first KOW motif (Fig.\u00a0S1A) for contacting nascent RNA in the transcription elongation complex. Concluding RemarksA recent single-molecule study of E. coli RNAP transcription revealed that NusG enhances the processivity of transcription by increasing the pause-free speed of RNAP elongation and suppressing the entry into long-lifetime pauses (6). In this study, the cryo-EM structure of the RNAP-Spt4/5 complex revealed that the elongation factor encircles the DNA, similar to the DNA clamp in DNA polymerase, to promote processivity. Furthermore, Spt4/5 is able to contact two different positions of DNA in the transcribing RNAP that include the upstream DNA and the single-stranded nontemplate DNA (Fig.\u00a04). The restriction of the upstream DNA by Spt4/5 may facilitate (i) ejecting the transcribed DNA template from the DNA channel and (ii) reannealing between the template and nontemplate DNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble (Fig.\u00a04), promoting the RNAP toward its posttranslocated state. The interactions between the nontemplate DNA in the transcription bubble and the basic patch of Spt5-NGN could prevent DNA secondary structure formation in the transcription bubble. Combinations of these effects by the transcription elongation factor would prevent elemental and backtracked pauses of RNAP transcription thereby improving the processivity of transcription (1, 6). The interesting remaining questions are which interaction affects what aspect of transcription and whether one interaction influences only one set of parameters? The structure of archaeal RNAP-Spt4/5 complex presented in this study provides a structural framework for further biochemical and biophysical studies to answer these questions.
