Trauma is now a global health problem and is one of the important causes of death in the young population (1). Thoracic trauma is a common site of involvement when the body is traumatized, and the lungs are the main organ involved in the early onset of severe thoracic trauma patients when they are admitted to the hospital (2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute diffuse lung injury that occurs within a short period of time and can cause severe hypoxemia leading to hypoxic damage to various organs throughout the body, and is the most common complication in patients with severe trauma (3). The current clinical treatment of severe thoracic trauma combined with acute respiratory distress syndrome mostly uses mechanical ventilation to ensure respiratory support. Therefore, reasonable and effective mechanical ventilation has an important impact on improving the treatment effect and reducing the mortality rate (4). Lung-protective ventilation therapy is a treatment with low tidal ventilation and permissive high carbon dioxide (CO2) while meeting the patient's basic oxygenation, which can prevent pulmonary compression injury due to large tidal ventilation (5). Some studies (6, 7) have shown that the application of lun-protective ventilation therapy in the treatment of patients who have thoracic trauma combined with ARDS can achieve better therapeutic results.Different from ARDS caused by infection, aspiration and other reasons, patients with ARDS secondary to trauma are usually younger, and effective interventions at an early stage of onset can lead to better outcomes and a good patient prognosis (8). Yet the difficulty in salvage lies in the early identification of severe trauma as secondary to ARDS, so screening for predictive risk factors to guide early clinical intervention is necessary (9). In this study, the basic data and pathophysiological characteristics of 206 patients with thoracic trauma treated in our hospital in the past 3 years were collected, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the risk factors for secondary ARDS after thoracic trauma. The clinical effects of different ventilation modalities in patients with ARDS combined with thoracic trauma were analyzed, aiming to provide a reference basis for clinical treatment. Information and MethodsCase Sources and Basic InformationTotal of 206 cases of thoracic trauma patients admitted to our hospital from September 2017 to March 2021 were selected as the study subjects. Eighty two patients with severe thoracic trauma combined with ARDS admitted during this period were taken as the main observation objects, and they were divided into 41 cases each in the observation group and the control group by double-blind randomization method, with the control group receiving conventional ventilation treatment and the patients in the observation group receiving lung-protective ventilation protocol. In the control group, 24 males and 17 females were aged from 34 to 60 years, with an average of (47.35 \u00b1 10.37) years. In the observation group, 23 males and 18 females were aged from 35 to 59 years, with an average of (48.29 \u00b1 10.52) years. The differences between the two groups in general data such as gender and age were not statistically significant (P > 0.05) and were comparable.Diagnostic CriteriaThoracic trauma (10): \u2460 multiple rib fractures leading to a shackled chest; \u2461 severe pulmonary contusion; \u2462 moderate or greater haemopneumothorax; \u2463 tracheobronchial rupture; \u2464 large vessel injury to the heart. The diagnosis can be made on the basis of one of the above.The diagnosis of ARDS was made according to the Berlin-defined diagnostic criteria for ARDS (11): new onset of dyspnoea or worsening of pre-existing respiratory symptoms within 1 week of a known clinical diagnosis; and an arterial Oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/Fraction of inspiration O2, PaO2/FiO2) <300.Inclusion Criteria \u2460 All patients met the diagnostic criteria for both thoracic trauma and ARDS and had an injury severity score (ISS) of \u226516, and the diagnosis was made by combining the patient's clinical symptoms, pulmonary infiltrative shadow, and oxygenation index; \u2461 required mechanical ventilation; \u2462 age \u2265 18 years; \u2463 the only causative factor was trauma; \u2464 were admitted to the hospital within 24 h of the causative injury and were first seen in our hospital; \u2465 the patient's clinical information was complete and the patient or family had informed the study group and had signed the relevant consent form.Exclusion Criteria \u2460 patients with a long history of chronic lung disease; \u2461 patients with a history of lung surgery; \u2462 those with autoimmune diseases; \u2463 those with infections; \u2464 those with ARDS due to non-traumatic causes or those who have been treated at other hospitals for a longer period of time and then transferred to our hospital; \u2465 those with active acute bleeding conditions. MethodsTreatment MethodFirst aid and basic treatment of trauma: Upon admission, the patient was thoroughly assessed and the management was tailored to the patient's individual circumstances. For patients with fractures, the ribs were first fixed with chest straps, and then internal fixation was performed after communication with the patient and family and obtaining consent. Patients with hemothorax were treated with thoracal closed drainage. For patients with shock, rehydration and blood transfusion were performed. For patients with inflammatory symptoms, corticosteroids were given to reduce tissue damage and improve microcirculation for 4\u20137 days and then reduced. Patients were given broad-spectrum antibiotics as necessary to prevent the development of infection. After emergency trauma management, all patients were orotracheally intubated or tracheotomized and connected to a ventilator for assisted breathing, with the control group on conventional ventilation and the observation group on lung protective ventilation.The ventilator parameters for the conventional ventilation protocol were set as follows: positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3\u201310 cmH2O, tidal volume (VT) of 10\u201315 mL/kg, respiratory rate of 15\u201318 breaths/min, inspiration-exhalation ratio (I:E) = 1:1.5\u20132.0, frequency was 12\u201316 breaths/min.Lung-protective ventilation protocol: low tidal volume ventilation combined with optimal PEEP, and low tidal volume sequential pulmonary resuscitation (RM) when the abdominal pressure (IAP) has basically returned to normal (grade I abdominal hypertension, IAP \u2264 15 mmHg). The parameters were set as PEEP of 5\u201315 cmH2O, I:E = 1:1.0\u20132.0; VT of 6\u20138 mL/kg, and frequency of 18\u201320 breaths/min.Observed IndicatorsThe treatment status such as mechanical ventilation time (MVT), ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) incidence and case fatality rate (CFR) were collected from both groups. The blood gas analysis indexes such as PaO2, arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) and PaO2/FiO2 were observed and recorded at different times before and after treatment.The gender, age, body mass index (BMI), causes of trauma, nature of injury, massive blood transfusion, acute physiology and chronic health score (APACHE II), ISS Score were collected from 206 patients with thoracic trauma. In addition, the following index were used: underlying disease, history of long-term smoking, history of alcohol abuse, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels within 1 week of admission. We compared the differences in the above indicators between patients who had a combined ARDS and those who did not have a combined ARDS in thoracic trauma, and used logistic regression to analyze the risk factors for combined ARDS in patients with thoracic trauma.Statistical MethodsSPSS 22.0 software was used for data processing, and the measurement data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (Mean \u00b1 SD), the t-test was used for two-by-two comparisons. The count data were expressed as (n, %) and the chi-square (\u03c72) test was used. Logistic regression model was used for multi-factor analysis of thoracic trauma combined with ARDS. P < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant difference. ResultsUnivariate Analysis of Thoracic Trauma in Combination With ARDSEventually, statistics revealed that 82 of 206 patients with thoracic trauma had combined ARDS, with an incidence of 39.81%; 124 patients without combined ARDS (60.29%). The basic data of patients with thoracic trauma in different conditions were analyzed, and the results showed that there were differences between patients with combined ARDS and those without combined ARDS in long-term smoking, nature of injury, massive blood transfusion, APACHE II score, ISS score, CRP, PCT, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, etc. (P < 0.05). There were no differences in gender, age, BMI, causes of trauma, alcoholism and underlying diseases were not different (P > 0.05) (Table 1). This suggests that long-term smoking, blunt injuries, massive blood transfusion, high APACHE II, ISS score, high CRP, PCT, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels may be associated in patients with thoracic trauma secondary to ARDS.Table 1Univariate analysis of thoracic trauma combined with ARDS.\nInfluencing factors\n\nMerged ARDS (n = 82)\n\nUnconsolidated ARDS (n = 124)\n\nt value or \u03c72 value\n\nP-value\nGender (n, %)Male47 (57.32)69 (55.65)0.0560.813Female35 (42.68)55 (44.35)Age (years, Mean \u00b1 SD)47.93 \u00b1 10.4545.69 \u00b1 8.761.5880.114BMI (kg/m2, Mean \u00b1 SD)25.26 \u00b1 4.2625.19 \u00b1 4.030.1190.905Causes of trauma (n, %)Traffic Accidents31 (37.80)43 (34.68)1.0260.906Sharp objects15 (18.29)26 (20.97)Falling19 (23.17)25 (20.16)Crushing12 (14.63)19 (15.32)Explosion5 (6.10)11 (8.87)Alcoholism (n, %)Yes20 (24.39)38 (30.65)0.9550.329No62 (75.61)86 (69.35)Long-term smoking (n,%)Yes40 (48.78)42 (33.87)4.5790.032No42 (51.22)82 (66.13)Underlying disease (n, %)Diabetes22 (26.83)35 (28.23)0.0480.826High blood pressure17 (20.73)28 (22.58)0.0990.753Coronary heart disease11 (13.41)25 (20.16)1.5560.212Nature of injury (n, %)Blunt injury57 (69.51)44 (35.48)22.870<0.001Penetrating injury25 (30.49)80 (64.52)Massive blood transfusion (n, %)Yes37 (45.12)32 (25.81)8.2670.004No45 (54.88)92 (74.19)APACHE II score (points, Mean \u00b1 SD)22.26 \u00b1 3.0220.13 \u00b1 2.415.607<0.001ISS score (points, Mean \u00b1 SD)21.74 \u00b1 3.2520.86 \u00b1 2.982.0010.047CRP (mg/L, Mean \u00b1 SD)153.32 \u00b1 31.25138.59 \u00b1 22.283.948<0.001PCT (\u00d7109/L, Mean \u00b1 SD)28.47 \u00b1 5.9616.16 \u00b1 2.0413.572<0.001IL-6 (ng/L, Mean \u00b1 SD)36.59 \u00b1 11.0427.52 \u00b1 8.386.690<0.001TNF-\u03b1 (ng/L, Mean \u00b1 SD)46.74 \u00b1 12.2536.19 \u00b1 11.776.196<0.001Open in a separate windowMulti-Factor Analysis of Thoracic Trauma Combined With ARDSWhether thoracic trauma patients had combined ARDS was used as the dependent variable (yes = 1, no = 0), and the relevant factors with statistically significant differences in the univariate analysis were used as independent variables for multifactor logistic regression analysis (Multi-factor assignments were shown in Table 2), which showed that blunt injury, massive blood transfusion, APACHE II score, PCT level, and TNF-\u03b1 level were all independent risk factors affecting thoracic trauma patients with independent risk factors for secondary ARDS in patients with thoracic trauma (P < 0.05, Table 3).Table 2Assignment for multivariate analysis of factors.\nFactors\n\nAssignment\nBlunt injuryYes = 0, No = 1Massive blood transfusionYes = 0, No = 1APACHE II score>25 = 0, 15\u201325 = 1, <15 = 2PCT>30 = 0, 15\u201330 = 1, <15 = 2TNF-\u03b1>60 = 0, 40\u201360 = 1, 20~40 = 2, <20 = 3Open in a separate windowTable 3Multifactorial analysis of ARDS in combination with thoracic trauma.\nInfluencing factors\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nSE\n\n\n\nWald\u03c72\n\n\nOR value\n\n95%CI\n\nP-value\nBlunt injury0.9370.3226.0122.5521.358\u20134.7980.013Massive blood transfusion1.4260.9229.3434.1621.631\u201310.6220.003APACHE II score0.7120.25011.3242.0381.249\u20133.3270.001PCT0.8780.3056.3522.4061.323\u20134.3750.017TNF-\u03b11.2540.5305.2353.5041.240\u20139.9030.031Open in a separate windowNote: B is the regression coefficient, SE is the standard error, Wald is the test statistic, OR is the dominance ratio, and 95% CI is the 95% confidence interval.Comparison of Clinical EfficacyAfter different ventilation treatments in the two groups, the time to MVT, incidence of VALI and CFR were (10.26 \u00b1 3.23) days, 26.83% (11/41) and 4.88% (2/41) in the control group, respectively; and (6.95 \u00b1 2.51) days, 9.76% (4/41) and 12.20% (5/41) in the observation group, respectively.

Comparison with control group over the same period, *P <0.05. DiscussionSevere trauma is always a major problem in clinical treatment, among which the chest is a common site of trauma. Severe trauma to the patient's chest from multiple causes can often cause direct damage to the lungs, and if the trauma does not receive timely and effective intervention, the patient's condition can further develop into acute hypoxic respiratory failure, shock, and other symptoms, eventually leading to the development of ARDS (12, 13). However, the early recognition rate of severe thoracic trauma combined with ARDS is currently not high in clinical practice, so there is an urgent need to screen for independent risk factors for thoracic trauma combined with ARDS to guide early recognition and effective interventions (14, 15).The results of this study showed that blunt injuries, massive blood transfusion, and APACHE II score were all independent risk factors for combined ARDS in patients with thoracic trauma and had some predictive value for ARDS secondary to thoracic trauma. Blunt injuries represent a significant proportion of traumatic injuries, and some studies (16) have pointed out their relationship with the development of ARDS. When a blunt blow occurs in the chest, the strong external force can cause rib fractures that can damage the integrity of the thorax or even produce a flail chest, and is often accompanied by hemothorax and pneumothorax at an early stage, leading to respiratory and circulatory dysfunction and then develop progressive dyspnea and refractory hypoxemia (17, 18). The infusion of a large number of blood products can induce inflammatory cells to activate in the lungs and secrete more inflammatory mediators, leading to capillary leakage and lung injury which in turn leads to ARDS (19). The APACHE II scoring system is used to evaluate the patient's condition based on the patient's vital signs and biochemical indicators, and an excessively high APACHE II score within 24 h of admission usually indicates that the patient's respiratory function is already significantly impaired (20). Moreover, the damage of trauma is mostly progressive, especially in patients with thoracic trauma there are mostly pulmonary contusions, which are accompanied by a gradual increase in exudation and a further decrease in pulmonary ventilation aggravating hypoxemia, leading to the rapid development of ARDS (21). The results also showed that inflammatory cells such as PCT and TNF-\u03b1 were also independent risk factors for ARDS secondary to thoracic trauma. To analyze the reasons for this, vascular endothelial damage after severe thoracic trauma can cause a large release of thrombomodulin (TM) and participate in regulating the coagulation process of the body, leading to microthrombus formation in the lung, microcirculatory blockage and structural damage, inducing pulmonary capillary spasm and increased permeability, activating inflammatory cells, and thus inducing the development of ARDS (22).The results of this study showed that lung-protective ventilation therapy was more advantageous in improving oxygenation indices and protecting lung function in patients suffering from thoracic trauma combined with ARDS, and was able to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of VALI in patients with a very low morbidity and mortality rate. At the present stage, ventilator-assisted ventilation is often used to treat patients with Thoracic trauma combined with ARDS on the basis of symptomatic treatment, which can precisely control oxygen therapy to avoid ventilator fatigue and obtain satisfactory treatment results (23). For the traditional conventional ventilation in clinical practice, patients are subjected to high airway pressure due to the large ventilation volume, which predisposes them to lung air pressure injury and thus has a serious impact on their prognosis. Lung-protective ventilation treatment can be used clinically according to the patient's specific situation, and this ventilation method with a lower tidal volume of 6\u20138 ml/kg and optimal PEEP can avoid overinflation and expansion of lung tissue, shorten expiratory time, ensure adequate ventilation, and help reduce the incidence of VALI (24).Inconclusion, blunt injury, massive blood transfusion, APACHE II score, PCT, and TNF-\u03b1 level are all risk factors for the occurrence of Thoracic trauma combined with ARDS, and early identification of these high-risk factors to guide clinical adoption of anticipatory treatment measures is expected to reduce the incidence of ARDS combined with Thoracic trauma. Lung-protective ventilation therapy is important to improve the ventilation effect of patients, reduce the occurrence of VALI and improve respiratory function.
