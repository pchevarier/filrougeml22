(A) ROC curves for discriminating between R1 and R2 groups. (B) ROC curves for discriminating between ARDS\u2212 and ARDS+ groups. Multiple comparison of the discriminatory performance of calprotectin with other laboratory parameters between mild and severe groups in the patients with COVID\u201019. This research revealed that calprotectin's performance surpassed other parameters' performances in predicting COVID\u201019 severity. Therefore, we suggest that serum calprotectin is a potentially valuable biomarker for predicting the clinical severity of COVID\u201019, independently or in combination with other conventional parameters. Calprotectin and CRP levels were measured in this research. Lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, NLR and CD4+ T cells count were obtained from the hospital's electronic medical records, in which the data for each parameter was selected within 48\u00a0h from the research sample collection time (n\u00a0=\u00a085).

Although COVID\u201019\u00a0most commonly presents with influenza\u2010like illness and viral pneumonia, its critical cases often have a profound hypercoagulable state leading to coagulopathy, and this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi\u2010organ failure.\n1\n Recently, some researchers reported an important role of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in thrombotic events in critical cases of COVID\u201019,\n2\n while others suggested a poor correlation between aPL and thrombotic events; therefore, its association with thrombotic events remains controversial.\n3\n\nCalprotectin (myeloid\u2010related protein [MRP]8/14) is released under inflammatory conditions and is involved in neutrophil\u2010related inflammatory processes.\n4\n Calprotectin levels in the blood are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID\u201019, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease.\n5\n\nIn this study, the authors measured aPL (anticardiolipin antibody [aCL] and anti\u2010\u03b22\u2010glycoprotein I antibody [a\u03b22GPI]) in the sera of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients using two different solid\u2010phase assays. While functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant [LA]) were unavailable for this study, we performed anti\u2010phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibody (aPS/PT) assay as a surrogate test for LA.\n6\n\u00a0We also assayed calprotectin and C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) levels in the sera of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients and assessed the possible relationship between oxygenation status and the lung involvement. 2.\u2003MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1. Study populationBetween July 4, 2020, and November15, 2020, 105\u00a0hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients (60 women and 45\u00a0men with a mean age of 68.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.8\u00a0years) and 38\u00a0healthy controls (21 females and 17\u00a0males with a mean age of 53.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5\u00a0years) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Overview of the characteristics of COVID\u201019 cases, including demographic features, comorbidities, therapy received, complications, treatment, and final outcome, are summarized in Table\u00a01. COVID\u201019 diagnosis was confirmed in all the patients based on a positive result of real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) test of routine nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Remnant serum samples were collected after completing routinely ordered laboratory tests for COVID\u201019 or healthy controls and stored at \u221280\u2103 until the time of research testing. This study complied with all relevant ethical regulations and was approved by the Inha University Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB ID: 2020\u201012\u2010018) and Seoul Clinical Laboratories IRB (ID: IRB\u201020\u2010086), which waived the requirement for informed consent given the discarded nature of the samples.TABLE 1Overview of characteristics of COVID\u201019 casesDemographic featuresNumber105Age (years)\na\n\n68.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.8 (56\u201383)Female60 (57.1%)BMI (kg/m2)\na\n\n24.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5 (21.8\u201326.5)ComorbiditiesDiabetes47 (44.8%)Hypertension60 (57.1)Cardiovascular diseases10 (9.5%)Renal disease1 (1.0%)Cancer6 (5.7%)Autoimmune disease1 (1.0%)Dementia/mental retardation16 (15.2%)Pregnancy2 (1.9%)Hyperlipidemia6 (5.7%)Hepatitis B virus infection1 (1.0%)Obesity (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a030\u00a0kg/m2)11 (8.8%)Medications or therapyAnticoagulant78 (74.3%)Antivirals37 (35.2%)Corticosteroids53 (50.5%)Intravenous immunoglobulin4 (3.8%)Renal replacement therapy2 (1.7%)Oxygen therapyRoom air70 (66.7%)Low flow oxygen therapy (flow rates <10\u00a0L/min)5 (5.7%)High flow oxygen therapy (flow rate \u226510\u00a0L/min)24 (22.9%)Mechanical ventilation19 (18.1%)Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation5 (4.8%)ComplicationsLung26 (24.8%)Renal12 (11.4%)Systemic infection6 (5.7%)Disseminated intravascular coagulation1 (0.9%)In\u2010hospital thrombosis2 (1.6%)Final outcomeDischarged alive92 (87.6%)Died9 (8.6%)Transfer to other hospital4 (3.8%)Length of hospital stay (days)\na\n\n21.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7 (13.0\u201327.0)Sampling time (days)\n\na\n\n, \n\nb\n\n\n5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6 (3.0\u20137.8)Open in a separate windowAbbreviations: ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BMI, body mass index; COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease; IQR, interquartile range.\na\nMean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (IQR).\nb\nTime from first symptom onset to sampling.2.2. Data collectionThe date of symptom onset, previous history, clinical features including comorbidities, laboratory findings, treatment, respiratory status, complications, and final outcome were obtained from the hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. The highest results of CRP, procalcitonin (PCT), ferritin, D\u2010dimer, fibrinogen, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) for each patient during hospital admission were defined as the peak levels and were selected as representative of each parameter; in contrast, the lowest values of platelet count and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were defined as the minimum levels and were selected as representative data.The data for neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CD4+ T cell count values were selected within 48\u00a0h from the research sample collection time.2.3. Stratifying COVID\u201019 patients by oxygen therapy or clinical severityCOVID\u201019 patients were stratified into two groups based on the degree of oxygen therapy during hospitalization as follows: Group R1 (N\u00a0=\u00a075) which included patients who were breathing in room air and patients requiring low flow oxygen therapy (flow rates\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0L/min); and Group R2 (N\u00a0=\u00a030) which included patients requiring high flow oxygen therapy (flow rate\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0L/min), mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In addition, we stratified COVID\u201019 patients based on the presence or absence of ARDS during hospitalization into two groups, including ARDS\u2212 (N\u00a0=\u00a079) and ARDS+ (N\u00a0=\u00a026) groups. ARDS was defined according to the 2012 Berlin Definition.\n7\n\n2.4. Laboratory assays2.4.1.  Measurement of aPL aCL and a\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM/IgA were measured by a multiplex flow immunoassay (MFIA) using BioPlex 2200\u00ae (Bio\u2010Rad, Laboratories, CA, USA) and the APLS IgG, IgM, and IgA kits (Bio\u2010Rad, Laboratories, CA, USA) (cutoff: 20\u00a0U/ml). To compare the aPL results by MFIA, aCL IgG/IgM/IgA and a\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM were also assayed by different methods as follows: aCL IgG/IgM by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using semiquantitative test kits (Corgenix, Colorado, USA) (cutoff: IgG, 23 GPL; IgM, 11\u00a0MPL); aCL IgA by ELISA using ORG 515A Anti\u2010Cardiolipin IgA\u00ae (Orgentec Diagnostika, Mainz, Germany) (cutoff: 10 APL U/ml); and a\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM by ELISA using IgG/IgM a\u03b22GPI semiquantitative test kits (Corgenix, Colorado, USA) (cutoff: IgG, 20\u00a0G unit; IgM, 10\u00a0M unit). aPS/PT IgG/IgM were quantified by ELISA using QUANTA Lite\u00ae aPS/PT IgG/IgM (Inova Diagnostics, CA, USA) (cutoff: 30 unit). All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and interpreted based on the manufacturers' cutoff values, which had been locally validated.2.4.2.  Quantification of serum calprotectin and CRP Serum calprotectin levels were measured by ELISA using the MRP8/14 (S100A8/S100A9) (B\u00dcHLMANN\u00ae Laboratories AG, Switzerland) (reference interval, <2.9\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum CRP was quantified by particle\u2010enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay using Modular P800 (Roche\u00ae, Basel, Switzerland) and interpreted based on the manufacturers' cutoff value (<0.5\u00a0mg/dl), which had been locally validated.2.5. Statistical analysisThe data of the groups were expressed as medians and interquartile range (IQR), wherever appropriate. When two groups were compared, normally distributed data were analyzed using a two\u2010sided t test, and skewed data were analyzed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. For three or more groups, one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with correction by Dunn's test for multiple comparisons was performed. Correlations between calprotectin levels and other biomarkers were estimated using Spearman's correlation analysis. The clinical performance of the biomarkers was tested by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Hanley and McNeil method), considering the area under the curve (AUC) and pairwise comparison between laboratory parameters. The Youden index optimal cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity were also evaluated. Data were analyzed using the MedCalc Statistical Software ver. 20.006 (Ostend, Belgium), and statistical significance was defined as p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Prevalence and concentration of aPL in COVID\u201019 patientsThe overall prevalence of aPL (any aCL IgG/IgM/IgA or a\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM) by ELISA was significantly higher in COVID\u201019 cases than in controls: 29.5% (31/108) versus 10.5% (4/38), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020). On the contrary, the prevalence of aPL (any positive result of aCL IgG/IgM/IgA or \u03b22GPI IgG/IgM/IgA) by MFIA was similar between COVID\u201019 cases and controls: 1.9% (2/105) versus 2.6% (1/38), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.790). The prevalence of aPS/PT IgG/IgM was also similar between COVID\u201019 cases (2.9% [3/105]) and controls (2.5% [1/38]) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.941).For the aPL assay by ELISA, the prevalence of aCL IgM was significantly higher in COVID\u201019 cases than in controls: 27.6% (29/105) and 2.5% (1/38), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) (Table\u00a02); however, most of the positive cases had low titers (Figure\u00a01A). Although the background level of aCL IgM (MFIA) in COVID\u201019 patients was also higher than that of controls (Figure\u00a01B), the difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.243) and most values were below the cutoff value. A low degree of positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.3163, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) was observed between MFIA and ELISA for aCL IgM (Figure\u00a01C). However, the prevalence of aCL IgG/IgA (ELISA), \u03b22GPI IgG/IgM (ELISA), and aPS/PT IgG/IgM (ELISA) was similar in COVID\u201019 cases and controls (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) (Table\u00a02). We did not find any association between aPL positivity and thrombotic events in COVID\u201019 patients.TABLE 2Prevalence of aPL in COVID\u201019 cases (N\u00a0=\u00a0105) and healthy controls (N\u00a0=\u00a038)MFIAELISAaCLa\u03b22GPIaCLa\u03b22GPIaPS/PTCOVID\u201019ControlCOVID\u201019ControlCOVID\u201019ControlCOVID\u201019ControlCOVID\u201019ControlIgG0.7 (1)2.5 (1)0.7 (1)2.5 (1)1.9 (2)2.5 (1)3.8 (4)5.3 (2)0 (0)0 (0)IgM0.7 (1)0 (0)0.7 (1)0 (0)27.6 (29)*2.5 (1)*3.8 (4)2.5 (1)2.9 (3)2.5 (1)IgA1.9 (2)0 (0)0.7 (1)0 (0)0.7 (1)0 (0)NDNDNDNDOpen in a separate windowNoteValues are expressed as percentage (n) of positive patients.Abbreviations: aCL, anticardiolipin antibodies; aPL, antiphospholipid antibodies; aPS/PT, anti\u2010phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies; a\u03b22GPI, anti\u2010\u03b22\u00a0glycoprotein I antibodies; COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease; ELISA, enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay; MFIA, multiplex flow immunoassay; ND, not determined.*p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 by chi\u2010square test.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Concentrations of aCL IgM in COVID\u201019 patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0105) and controls (N\u00a0=\u00a035) determined by two solid\u2010phase assays.

Correlation of serum calprotectin with CRP and other routinely used laboratory parametersSubsequently, we assessed the correlation between serum calprotectin and CRP levels, which were assayed using the same samples for measuring calprotectin. Calprotectin levels demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with CRP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5294, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similarly, we assessed the potential correlation between calprotectin levels and various laboratory parameters, which were measured during each patient's hospital admission period. Calprotectin levels were significantly positively correlated with the neutrophil count (r\u00a0=\u00a00.3697, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), NLR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.4827, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), peak CRP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.7199, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), peak ferritin (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5056, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), peak PCT (r\u00a0=\u00a00.4397, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and peak BUN (r\u00a0=\u00a00.4625, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Calprotectin levels were significantly negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.3838, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and CD4+ T cell count (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.3501, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) (Table\u00a05).TABLE 5Correlation of calprotectin with other laboratory parametersLaboratory parameters\nr\n95% CI\np*\nn\nCalprotectin (log) versusCRP (log)0.52940.3759 to 0.6546<0.001105Peak CRP (log)0.71990.6115 to 0.8017<0.001105Peak ferritin (log)0.50560.3467 to 0.6362<0.001104Peak PCT (log)0.43970.2691 to 0.58360.001103Peak fibrinogen0.1980\u22120.01453 to 0.39330.06895Peak D\u2010dimer (log)0.27220.0855 to 0.44090.005105Peak BUN (log)0.46250.3480 to 0.6382<0.001103Neutrophil count (log)0.36970.1916 to 0.5242<0.001105Lymphocyte count (log)\u22120.3838\u22120.5403 to \u22120.2016<0.00199NLR (log)0.48270.3154 to 0.6210<0.00199CD4+ T cell count (log)\u22120.3501\u22120.5241 to \u22120.14800.00185Minimum eGFR (Log)\u22120.2517\u22120.435 to \u22120.07580.01085Minimum platelet (Log)\u22120.2315\u22120.4092 to \u22120.04450.019103Open in a separate windowNoteThe highest results of CRP, ferritin, PCT, fibrinogen, D\u2010dimer, and BUN for each patient during hospital admission were defined as the peak levels; in contrast, the lowest values of eGFR and platelet count were defined as minimum levels.Abbreviations: BUN, blood urea nitrogen; CRP, C\u2010reactive protein; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; NLR, neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio; PCT, procalcitonin.\u201cn\u201d represents specific patients with available data.*by Spearman's correlation.3.5.

APS is a complex thrombo\u2010inflammatory disease with a broad clinical spectrum.\n8\n\nApproximately 57% of COVID\u201019 patients have prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Yet, only a minimal proportion of COVID\u201019 patients have aCL and a\u03b22GPI antibodies. This suggests that other factors are responsible for the prolonged aPTT phenomenon and likely for the LA activity.\n9\n LA may be affected by the concomitant heparin treatment\n10\n and the high CRP levels.\n11\n Since aPS/PT can be associated with a prolonged aPTT and with the presence of LA,\n12\n aPS/PT antibodies were included as a partial surrogate for LA in this study.The threshold for clinically relevant levels of aPL for the diagnosis of APS remains debatable. Defining cutoff reference values for aPL solid\u2010phase assays is a determining factor for the diagnosis of APS. However, aCL and a\u03b22GPI results are not expressed in International Units because of the lack of an international reference standard; rather, they are expressed in arbitrary units according to the calibration curve used in the method.\n13\n\u00a0The Scientific and Standardization Committee (SSC) on lupus anticoagulant/antiphospholipid antibodies (SSC\u2010aPL) of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) states that the nonparametric 99th percentile cutoff appears to be more specific than the cutoff value for >40 GPL. Additionally, it recommends that only medium and high aPL levels are included as diagnostic criteria for APS.\n14\n\nIn this study, positive cases of aCL IgM (\u226511\u00a0MPL) by ELISA in COVID\u201019 patients mostly had low to medium titers; however, MFIA revealed that they majorly had below the cutoff values for aCL IgM. Therefore, we concluded that they did not meet the laboratory criteria (medium or high titer of aCL IgG/IgM or a\u03b22GPI IgG/IgM [i.e., \u226540 GPL/MPL]) for the diagnosis of APS. According to the manufacturer's information, the cutoff value (11\u00a0MPL) of aCL IgM for ELISA was derived from the 95th percentile of the sera of 94\u00a0healthy blood donors, while aCL IgM for MFIA (20\u00a0U/ml) was derived from the 99th percentile using the sera of 300 blood bank donors. The number of 120 which SSC\u2010aPL of ISTH recommends as an optimal sample size for calculating 99th percentile\n14\n is actually derived from the number needed to determine the 90% CIs of the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of a population using nonparametric statistics,\n13\n whereas the minimum sample size required for reliably estimating the 99th percentile is at least 300.\n15\n\nAdditionally, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of \u201cnon\u2010criteria aPL,\u201d including that between aCL IgA and a\u03b22GPI IgA, as well as aPS/PT IgG/IgM, in COVID\u201019 patients. Thus, our research determined an extremely low overall prevalence of aPL in COVID\u201019 patients, and these results are in accordance with several other recent observations.\n3\n In the past few decades, common bacterial and viral infections have been implicated in the induction of APS. Many infections are accompanied by transient aPL; with aCL (usually the IgM isotype) being the most frequent during infections.\n16\n, \n17\n In some cases, both aPL and clinical manifestations resembling those of APS are triggered, while in others, aPL often does not have any pathological role.\n3\n Specifically, regarding aPL associated with COVID\u201019, several reports suggested a possible role of aPL in COVID\u201019\u2010induced thrombotic complications.\n18\n, \n19\n However, some researchers have reported that aPL is not elevated in patients with severe COVID\u201019 and is poorly associated with thrombotic events or suggested a different epitope specificity from the antibodies in APS.\n9\n\nNeutrophils have recently received attention as key perpetuators of arterial, venous, and microvascular thrombosis. Neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation have only recently been investigated, while many studies of general thrombosis research have revealed that activated neutrophils, particularly NET formation, contribute to the propagation of thrombi.\n20\n A relatively recent discovery in APS pathogenesis relates to the implication of NET in thrombin formation and the initiation of inflammatory cascades.\n21\n, \n22\n Regarding COVID\u201019, several investigators have recently demonstrated significantly elevated levels of NETs in COVID\u201019\u2010induced ARDS and suggested that NETs negatively influence COVID\u201019 outcomes.\n23\n Some researchers have also suggested NETs as therapeutic targets in COVID\u201019.\n24\n\nCalprotectin, which accounts for 45% of the cytoplasmic proteins in neutrophils, is released during a specific form of holocrine secretion referred to as NETosis\n25\n and has been found to bind to NETs.\n26\n Although fecal calprotectin measurement represents a well\u2010established and reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, the role of serum calprotectin in the pathogenesis of diseases is not well established.\n27\n Serum calprotectin has recently gained attention as a marker of disease activity and a predictor of response to methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.\n28\n High levels of serum calprotectin have also been found in many types of infectious and inflammatory diseases, including bacterial sepsis,\n29\n\u00a0lupus,\n30\n acute respiratory infections,\n31\n community\u2010acquired pneumonia,\n32\n and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,\n33\n wherein it correlates closely with disease severity. In addition to serving as an inflammatory biomarker, calprotectin may play a direct role in the self\u2010amplifying thrombo\u2010inflammatory storm that afflicts many COVID\u201019 patients.\n5\n\nOur research showed that calprotectin levels positively correlated with several other biomarkers of inflammation, including neutrophil count, NLR, peak levels of CRP, PCT, ferritin, and D\u2010dimer, but negatively correlated with lymphocyte count and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Among the inflammatory biomarkers, calprotectin, peak CRP, and NLR were especially superior for discriminating severe clinical cases of COVID\u201019. These findings are consistent with those of other studies. Lymphopenia has been considered a cardinal laboratory finding with prognostic potential in COVID\u201019.\n34\n\u00a0NLR has been reported to have prognostic value in determining severe cases.\n35\n During the disease course, the longitudinal evaluation of inflammatory indices revealed CRP, PCT, and ferritin as poor prognostic factors and may identify cases with poor prognosis to enable prompt intervention and improved outcomes.\n1\n, \n36\n\nTo estimate the severity of COVID\u201019, variable methods were developed and researched; scoring systems (such as sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score, a modified version thereof [qSOFA], and COVID\u2010GRAM score), as well as classification based on clinical parameters (such as systolic blood pressure, multi\u2010lobar chest radiography involvement, albumin level, respiratory rate, tachycardia, confusion, oxygenation status, mechanical ventilation, and the presence of ARDS) or final outcomes (intensive care unit admission or death), have been used by various studies.\n5\n In this research, we first stratified COVID\u201019 patients based on severity into two groups by the degree of oxygen therapy, and such classification has been used in previous studies\n37\n, \n38\n that reported elevated plasma calprotectin level to discriminate severe from mild COVID\u201019 cases. Additionally, we stratified the severity of COVID\u201019 patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of ARDS, and this classification is similar to that used in the research by Ma et al.\n39\n that reported NLR as a predictive biomarker of moderate to severe ARDS in COVID\u201019 patients.Due to the retrospective nature of our study design, there are some limitations to this study. First, because of the unavailability of longitudinal sample collection, aPL and calprotectin were measured using samples collected at a single point in time. Similarly, we could not arrange the time of sample collection evenly between samples. Although a considerable proportion of samples were collected in the early phase of COVID\u201019 illness after hospital admission, the sampling days from disease onset still varied among patients (5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0days from the first symptom onset) (Table\u00a01). By measuring the longitudinally collected serial samples, the kinetics and exact performance of a new biomarker, calprotectin, could be clearly elucidated. Second, we could not validate the manufacturer's cutoff value for serum calprotectin, nor established a locally derived cutoff. The calprotectin levels of a considerable proportion of the healthy controls (36.8% [14/38]) were elevated above the manufacturer's cutoff value (\u22652.9\u00a0\u00b5g/ml); however, most of the cases were distributed to a mild degree of elevation; the median (IQR) calprotectin level was 1.85 (1.30\u22123.60)\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Similarly, slight elevation in serum calprotectin levels related to pre\u2010analytical problems in healthy controls cannot be completely excluded. Pre\u2010analytical issues in calprotectin measurement have been suggested by several researchers, with some proposing that neutrophil activation, by either clotting or centrifugation, should be avoided during the pre\u2010analytical process.\n40\n In serum, calprotectin levels have been shown to increase over time, reaching a maximum overestimation of 5\u201310\u00a0h.\n41\n Furthermore, there is a report suggesting distinct exercise intensity\u2010dependent changes in calprotectin following extreme physical exertion.\n42\n Pre\u2010analytical standardization in sample collection and processing, as well as proper validation of reference intervals, would be mandatory in future research.In this study, representative data for conventionally used parameters were selected based on their peak levels (CRP, ferritin, PCT, and D\u2010dimer) or minimal levels (platelet count and eGFR), with multiple measurements during each patient's hospital admission. Although serum calprotectin levels were measured at one point in sera collected during the relatively early phase of COVID\u201019 illness, calprotectin's performance surpassed other parameters' performances in predicting COVID\u201019\u00a0severity. Therefore, we suggest that serum calprotectin is a potentially valuable biomarker for predicting the clinical severity of COVID\u201019, independently or in combination with other conventional parameters. Nevertheless, further studies using multivariate analyses will be needed to identify independent predictors of severe disease and define the best combination of markers to facilitate risk stratification and management of COVID\u201019 cases.In summary, the prevalence of clinically significant aPL among COVID\u201019 patients was low and was not associated with clinical severity. We observed significantly elevated levels of serum calprotectin in severe cases of hospitalized COVID\u201019 patients, requiring more intensive oxygen therapy. Our research suggests strong evidence supporting that neutrophils are potentially involved in severe COVID\u201019 cases. The link between calprotectin and the inflammatory pathway in COVID\u201019\u00a0may open new opportunities to improve its management and outcomes.
