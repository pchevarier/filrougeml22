In the most severe cases (termed \u201cCritical COVID-19\u201d), infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\n\n1\n. ARDS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph and arterial hypoxaemia that develops acutely in response to a known or suspected insult. ARDS is known to be the consequence of disordered inflammation\n\n2\n, and is characterised by a protein-rich oedema in the alveoli and lung interstitium, driven by epithelial and vascular injury\n\n2,\n3\n and increased vascular permeability\n\n4,\n5\n. Limited data exists regarding the mechanisms causing hypoxaemia and lung inflammation following infection with SARS-CoV-2, although post-mortem case reports provide evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, with the presence of proteinaceous exudates in the alveolar spaces, intra-alveolar fibrin and alveolar wall expansion\n\n6\n. In previously described ARDS cohorts in which SARS-CoV-2 was not an aetiological factor, alveolar damage is associated with worsening hypoxia and increased mortality\n\n7\n. In this context, hypoxia is a key driver of dysfunctional inflammation in the lung, augmenting neutrophil persistence and survival\n\n8,\n9\n and promoting the release of pro-inflammatory mediators that cause ongoing tissue injury\n\n2,\n3\n. Non-dyspnoeic hypoxia is widely described in patients with severe COVID-19\n\n10\n, where it is associated with altered circulating leukocyte profiles with an increase in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios and the presence of lymphopaenia\n\n11,\n12\n. More recently, post-mortem studies have revealed that the diffuse alveolar damage does not directly associate with the detection of virus, supporting the concept of aberrant host immune responses as drivers of tissue injury and pulmonary disease progression\n\n13\n. A disordered myeloid response is further evidenced by analysis of gene clusters and surface protein expression of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) layers of patients with mild and severe COVID-19\n\n14\n. However, the functional relevance of these transcriptional signatures remains to be explored given the limited reliance of neutrophils on transcription to regulate protein expression\n\n15\n. It also remains to be addressed whether the observed changes in neutrophil sub-populations are specific to COVID-19 ARDS or a reflection of the aberrant neutrophil inflammatory responses more broadly associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is also unclear as to how these may be impacted by anti-inflammatory strategies including dexamethasone, which has been shown to lower 28-day mortality for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone\n\n16\n.One of the distinct features of COVID-19 that has emerged is the clinical evidence of a pro-thrombotic state, neutrophil retention within the lung microvasculature and the colocalisation of neutrophils with platelets in fibrin rich clots\n\n17\n. Together with evidence of the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)\n\n18,\n19\n, this raises the important question as to whether neutrophils are inappropriately activated within the circulation, thus contributing to vascular injury and thrombosis in COVID-19. Exploring the differences in neutrophil responses between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS provides an opportunity to understand the mechanisms common to ARDS and those that drive the hypercoagulable hyperinflammatory state specific to COVID-19, thus identifying urgently required therapeutic targets.In this program of work, we compared the blood neutrophil populations of patients with COVID-19 ARDS to those of patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID-19 and healthy controls to define the neutrophil host response to SARS-CoV-2. Prior to SARS-CoV-2, a significant confounder of ARDS studies has been the heterogeneity of the underlying processes that result in ARDS with hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes described. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides a unifying trigger to this aberrant host response, whilst comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS allows us to identify neutrophil responses that are observed following infection with SARS-CoV-2, or associated with all-cause ARDS. MethodsEthics statementHuman peripheral venous blood was taken from healthy volunteers with written informed consent obtained from all participants prior to sample collection as approved by the University of Edinburgh Centre for Inflammation Research Blood Resource Management Committee (AMREC 15-HV-013). The collection of peripheral venous blood from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or presenting with ARDS was approved by Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (20/SS/0002, 20/SS/0052). Patient recruitment took place from April 2020 through January 2021 from The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK through the ARDS Neut (20/SS/0002) and CASCADE (20/SS/0052) Study, with informed consent obtained by proxy. Initial approach was made by a member of the clinical care team to participants or where participants lacked capacity due to underlying physiological compromise to their relative, welfare attorney or legal representative. During this initial approach information sheets were provided and following consideration, where appropriate separate contact made by the research team with either the participant or their representative. Individuals were then guided through the information sheet details, and formal written consent obtained.Healthy donor and patient recruitmentThe presence of ARDS was defined using the Berlin criteria\n\n20\n. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score = acute physiology score + age points + chronic health points, was undertaken (minimum score = 0; maximum score = 71), where increasing score is associated with increasing risk of hospital death\n\n21\n. Functional Comorbidity Index data (FCI) was also captured as an 18-item list of comorbidities used to adjust for the effect on physiological function\n\n22\n. Scores were performed by the clinicians responsible for the patients care on intensive care unit admission or earliest time possible, and collated at a later date by the research team. Nasopharyngeal swabs were undertaken at point of hospital admission for all patients included in this study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in the clinical hospital laboratories by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as part of routine clinical care. Where initial swab results were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but high clinical suspicion remained, deep airway samples were obtained at point of intubation and clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 was repeated. Isolation of human peripheral blood neutrophilsUp to 80 mL of whole blood was collected into citrate tubes. An aliquot of 5 mL of whole blood was treated with red cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and with the remaining volume, human blood leukocytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous Percoll gradients as described by Dransfield\net al. (2015)\n\n23\n. Briefly, blood was first centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g (acceleration 5, deceleration 5) for 20 minutes and the platelet-rich plasma layer removed. Erythrocyte sedimentation and leukocyte-rich plasma were obtained by incubating the remaining contents in the tube with 6 mL of 6% Dextran 500 (Pharmacosmos) in saline and final volume adjusted to 50 mL with 0.9% NaCl (Baxter) for at least 20 minutes at room temperature. The leukocyte-rich portion was centrifuged at 350 \u00d7 g (acceleration 5, deceleration 5) for 6 minutes, with the pellet resuspended in 3 mL of 49.5% Percoll (GE Healthcare) and overlayed onto 61.2% Percoll and 72.9% Percoll. Gradients were centrifuged at 720 \u00d7 g (acceleration 1, deceleration 0) for 20 minutes to obtain PMN and PBMC layers.Cell cultureNormal density neutrophils (NDNs) obtained from the polymorphonuclear (PMN) layer of healthy donors were resuspended at 5 \u00d7 10\n6 cells/mL in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Gibco) with 10% dialyzed foetal calf serum (Gibco) and 50 U/mL streptomycin and penicillin in normoxia (19 kPa) or hypoxia (3 kPa) at 5% CO\n2 as previously described\n\n24\n. Briefly, an InvivO\n2 400 hypoxic work-station (BakerRuskinn) was used to create a hypoxic environment where a gas mix of 5% CO\n2/ 94% N\n2/ 1% O\n2 was delivered into the chamber to achieve oxygen tension of 3 kPa and culture medium was equilibrated for at least 4 h prior to use. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of interferon (IFN)\u03b1/IFN\u03b2 (500 units/mL) and/or resiquimod (15 \u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated time prior to harvest. For flow cytometry studies using dexamethasone and resiquimod, cells were cultured in hypoxia and pre-treated with varying doses of dexamethasone (0\u20131 \u03bcM) for 4 h, followed by treatment with resiquimod (15 \u03bcM) for 1 h. For heavy glutamine tracing studies, NDN were cultured in the presence of 2 mM U-\n13C\n5 glutamine (Cambridge). For extracellular flux analysis, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of interferon in hypoxia as above before transfer to an extracellular flux cell culture microplate after three hours.Flow cytometryLysed whole blood, PMN and PBMC layers isolated from Percoll gradients, as well as healthy control NDN used for dexamethasone/resiquimod studies were stained with Zombie Aqua\u2122 Fixable viability dye (1:400) (Biolegend) to exclude dead cells from analysis. Cells were subsequently treated with Human TruStain FcX\u2122 (1:100) (Biolegend) and stained for 30 min on ice with antibodies listed in\nTable 1 with appropriate fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls. Cells were then washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Fisher Scientific) and acquired using BD LSRFortessa\u2122 flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). Compensation was performed using BD FACSDiva\u2122 software version 8.0 and data analysed in FlowJo version 10.2 (\nWinMDI is a freely available alternative). Gating strategies to identify neutrophils, maturity and surface expression of various markers are outlined in\nFigure 1. Samples with neutrophil purity of <95% (CD66b+CD49d-) were excluded from analysis.Open in a separate windowFigure 1. Representative plots of the gating strategy to analyse neutrophil populations.Strategy shown in the direction of the arrows. Cells were gated for singlets on a forward scatter height (FSC-H) vs. forward scatter area (FSC-A) plot. Singlets were then gated for cells on a side scatter area (SSC-A) vs. FSC-A plot, with non-viable cells excluded according to SSC-A vs. Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Dye parameter. Viable single cells were gated for CD66b+ cells to identify neutrophils and eosinophils excluded according to SSC-A vs. CD49d, with fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls used to set gates. CD66b+CD49d- cells (neutrophils) were gated for mature (CD16+) and immature (CD16-) neutrophils, with FMO controls used to set gate.Table 1.

Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Thermo Fisher), pelleted at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 372 \u03bcL of freshly made 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, BioRad) lysis buffer and vortexed. Samples were then heat denatured in a heat block for 5 min at 100\u00b0C and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. Cell lysates were thawed and tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) and triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) were added to a final concentration of 10 mM and 50 mM, respectively. Lysates were shaken at 500 rpm at 22\u00b0C for 5 min before being incubated at 98\u00b0C for 5 min. Samples were allowed to cool and were then sonicated with a BioRuptor (30 cycles: 30 s on and 30 s off). Tubes were centrifuged at 17,000 \u00d7 g to collect the cell lysate and 1 mL of benzonase (27.8 units) was added to each sample and samples incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Samples were then alkylated with addition of 20 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at 22\u00b0C in the dark. Protein lysates were processed for mass spectrometry using s-trap spin columns following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Protifi)\n\n25\n. Lysates were digested with Trypsin at a ratio 1:20 (protein:enzyme) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Peptides were eluted from s-trap columns by sequentially adding 80 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by 80 mL of 0.2% formic acid with a final elution using 80 mL of 50% acetonitrile + 0.2% formic acid.Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysisFor each sample, 2 mg of peptide was analysed on a Q-Exactive-HF-X (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Scientific). LC buffers were the following: buffer A (0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v)). 2 \u03bcg aliquot of each sample were loaded at 15 \u03bcL/min onto a trap column (100 \u03bcm \u00d7 2 cm, PepMap nanoViper C18 column, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, Thermo Scientific) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The trap column was washed for 3 min at the same flow rate with 0.1% TFA then switched in-line with a Thermo Scientific, resolving C18 column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 50 cm, PepMap RSLC C18 column, 2 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5). The peptides were eluted from the column at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min with a linear gradient from 3% buffer B to 6% buffer B in 5 min, then from 6% buffer B to 35% buffer B in 115 min, and finally to 80% buffer B within 7 min. The column was then washed with 80% buffer B for 4 min and re-equilibrated in 3% buffer B for 15 min. Two blanks were run between each sample to reduce carry-over.

Cleavage Rules were set to Trypsin/P, Peptide maximum length was set to 52 amino acids, Peptide minimum length was set to 7 amino acids and Missed Cleavages set to 2. Calibration Mode was set to Automatic. Search criteria included carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification, as well as oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine and acetylation (protein N-terminus) as variable modifications. The FDR threshold was set to 1% Q-value at both the Precursor and Protein level. The single hit definition was to Stripped sequence. The directDIA data were searched against the human SwissProt database (July 2020) and included isoforms. The Major Group Quantity was set to the Sum of peptide quantity and the Minor Group Quantity was set to the Sum of the precursor quantity; Cross Run Normalization was disabled.

The Q-values provided were generated in R using the \u201cqvalue\u201d package version 2.10.0. Estimates of protein copy numbers per cell were calculated using the histone ruler method\n\n29\n. The mass of individual proteins was estimated using the following formula: CN \u00d7 MW/NA = protein mass (g cell\n\u22121), where CN is the protein copy number, MW is the protein molecular weight (in Da) and NA is Avogadro\u2019s Constant.Raw mass spectrometry data files and Spectronaut analysis files have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange\n\n30\n Consortium via the PRIDE\n\n31\n partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD023834.Cell immunostaining for microscopyPMN and PBMC layers isolated from Percoll gradients were fixed with 1.5 % PFA (Fisher Scientific). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of NDN and LDN from PMN and PBMC layers, respectively, were performed using BD FACSAria\u2122 Fusion flow cytometer fitted with a 70 \u00b5m nozzle and running BD FACSDiva\u2122 software version 8.0 (Beckton Dickinson). Singlets were gated according to forward scatter height vs. forward scatter area (FSC-H vs. FSC-A) and side scatter height vs. side scatter area (SSC-H vs. SSC-A) parameters and NDN and LDN identified according to forward vs. side scatter (FSC vs. SSC) parameters. NDN and LDN were collected at 4\u00b0C in 15 mL Falcon tubes pre-coated with DPBS (Thermo Fisher).Cells were pelleted and blocked with Fc Receptor Blocking Solution followed by staining with anti-CD41 antibody (Biolegend) and counterstaining with propidium iodide (Biolegend) according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Multichamber slides (Ibidi) were used to image the samples in a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). Image acquisition was performed at 63x magnification with the same settings across all images. Fiji software was used to process the images\n\n32\n. Scale bars depict 5 \u03bcm.Measurement of granule protein levelsEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol to quantify myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Abcam, ab119605), lactoferrin (Abcam, ab108882) and elastase levels (Abcam, ab119553) in plasma from healthy donors, non-COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 patients and cell media supernatant of resiquimod treated NDN cultures from healthy donors (15 \u03bcM, Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, a standard curve with known concentrations of the corresponding enzymes was generated to obtain their equivalent optical densities in a colorimetric assay. The concentration of the relevant enzymes in each sample was inferred from their optical densities by using the standard curve.\nMetabolomic analysis 2.5 \u00d7 10\n6 neutrophils freshly isolated from the PMN layer of patients were centrifuged at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, with pellets resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of 80% methanol. Alternatively, 5 \u00d7 10\n6 NDN from healthy controls were cultured in hypoxia for 4 h in the presence or absence of IFN\u03b1/IFN\u03b2, washed twice in ice cold saline following culture and lysed in 200 \u03bcL of 50:30:20 methanol:acetonitrile:water. Following extraction, samples were stored at \u201380\u00b0C. Relative metabolite abundance was determined using ion-pairing reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to a Q-exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. Data were analysed in a targeted manner, using Xcalibur (Thermofisher Scientific) against an in-house compound library to integrate the area under the curve at the expected retention time. Individual metabolites were expressed relative to the mean of the healthy control population and analysed in Prism 9.00 (Graphpad Software Inc).Extracellular flux analysisAfter culture, cells were harvested into sealed Eppendorfs and maintained in hypoxia for one wash in warm saline. Cells were resuspended at 3 \u00d7 10\n6/mL in XF DMEM pH 7.4 (Agilent), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and IFN\u03b1/IFN\u03b2 added to the appropriate cells at the concentrations described previously. 3 \u00d7 10\n6 neutrophils were adhered into each well of a 24-well cell culture microplate (Agilent) pretreated with cell-tak (Corning) to give triplicate samples per condition with four wells left as media controls. After allowing CO\n2 to degas for 45 min in a hypoxic incubator, the plate was loaded into a Seahorse XFe 24 Analyzer (Agilent) operated in a hypoxic chamber (3% O\n2, 0.1% CO\n2; SCI-tive hypoxic workstation, Baker Russkinn). Treatment compounds were resuspended in XF DMEM and cells were sequentially treated by injection of resiquimod (15 \u03bcM), glucose (10 mM, Sigma), oligomycin A (1 \u03bcM, Sigma) and 2-deoxyglucose (50 mM, Sigma). All media and compounds were pre-equilibrated in hypoxia. Data were acquired using Seahorse Wave Controller (version 2.6, Agilent) and analysed using Wave before exporting to GraphPad to pool for final analysis.Statistical analysesStatistical tests were performed using Prism 9.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). Data were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test and outliers excluded according to Grubb\u2019s test, with significance testing detailed in figure legends. Significance was defined as a p value of <0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons where applicable.

ResultsStudy population cohortsTo define the circulating neutrophil response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 we studied peripheral blood neutrophil populations isolated from hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 ARDS, comparing these to critical care patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS and healthy controls (male, n = 4; female, n = 5; age range: 20 \u2013 50 years) (\nFigure 2A)\n\n33\n.

CD66b+CD16+ and CD66b+CD16- cells were observed, indicating the presence of a heterogenous population of mature and immature neutrophils in ARDS patients, regardless of COVID-19 status (\nFigure 2B). Given immature neutrophils are characteristically low-density neutrophils (LDN) and associated with disease\n\n35\n, flow cytometry analysis was performed on PMN and PBMC layers isolated using Percoll density gradients. Further characterisation of neutrophil maturity was undertaken by CD10 expression and showed both a mature (CD66b+CD16+CD10+) and immature (CD66b+CD16-CD10-) LDN population in the PBMC layer of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 ARDS patients (\nFigure 2C). In contrast, these populations are notably absent in the PBMC layer of healthy control individuals (\nFigure 2C). Importantly, these LDN populations demonstrated evidence of increased activation states with loss of CD62L (\nFigure 2D), and upregulation of both CD66b and CD63 (\nFigure 2E\u2013F). Total neutrophil counts generated from Percoll preparations showed a large expansion of neutrophils in ARDS (\nFigure 2G). Though a major proportion of the neutrophil population consisted of mature NDN from the PMN layer, we detected the presence of immature and mature low density neutrophil populations in ARDS patients (\nFigure 2H). Of note, the increase in immature LDN in the COVID-19 ARDS cohort was significantly reduced in those receiving dexamethasone despite a retained expansion of NDN and mature LDN populations (\nFigure 2H and\nFigure 2I).Circulating neutrophils restructure their proteomes whilst retaining global cellular processes in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDSA growing body of studies have described a disordered myeloid response following infection with SARS-CoV-2 using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These studies provide important insights to the reprogramming of myelopoiesis and the emergence of precursor neutrophil populations. However, there is a real need to understand how these transcriptional signatures relate to functional changes in myeloid cell responses, which requires information at a protein level. To understand changes in the functional proteome of circulating neutrophils we used a label free DIA mass spectrometry approach. Estimates of protein copy numbers per cell were calculated using the histone ruler method\n\n29\n, along with total cellular protein content and the mass of subcellular compartments. We compared protein abundance between non-COVID-19 ARDS, COVID-19 ARDS and healthy control neutrophil populations. Analysis of the NDN populations common to both healthy control and ARDS identified around 4500 proteins (\nFigure 3A), with a subtle reduction in the total protein content of COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (\nFigure 3B). We observed preservation of global cellular processes across all disease groups evidenced by equivalent mitochondrial protein content, ribosomal protein content, nuclear envelope protein abundance and cytoskeletal protein abundance (\nFigure 3C). Key components of the translation initiation complex were also conserved across health and disease groups (\nFigure 3D). This would suggest that any differences observed in key neutrophil functions are not driven by a loss of core cellular processes and, therefore, more likely to be consequent upon activation of signalling pathways in response to infectious and inflammatory challenges. Globally we only detected a small number of proteins involved in transcription factor activity whose abundance was modified in response to COVID-19 (\nFigure 3E). These included the interferon regulated proteins TRIM22 and STAT1, which were induced in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils and the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 which was down regulated.Open in a separate windowFigure 3. Circulating neutrophils preserve global cellular processes in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS.(\nA) Number of proteins identified by proteomic analysis in normal density neutrophils (NDN) isolated from healthy controls (HC, n = 4), non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (NA, n = 6) and COVID-19 ARDS patients (CA, n = 7), with open circles depicting the data corresponding to dexamethasone-treated patients.

The DNA binding transcription factor proteins TRIM22, STAT1 and NR3C1 are highlighted.To determine which components of the neutrophil proteome remodel in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS we undertook Linear Models for Microarray data (LIMMA) analysis to identify significant differences in protein abundance (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023834). We identified more than 200 proteins to be increased in abundance between COVID-19 ARDS and healthy control neutrophils which were not significantly changing in non-COVID ARDS (\nFigure 4A\u2013B). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of these differentially regulated proteins identified a COVID-19 signature which was defined by a greater abundance of proteins in type I IFN signalling pathways and platelet degranulation (\nFigure 4B). Change in expression of cullin 2, cyclin dependent kinase 2, minichromosome maintenance complex components (MCM3-5 and MCM7) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, proteins associated in other cell types with cell cycle control, was common to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, whilst proteins important for mitochondrial translational termination and cell surface receptor signalling pathways were enriched in non-COVID-19 ARDS samples (\nFigure 4B). We identified 115 proteins with reduced abundance in ARDS (all cause) versus healthy control neutrophils, including some proteins that were specific to COVID-19. However, distinct biological processes impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection were not identified among those proteins with reduced abundance.Open in a separate windowFigure 4.

With previous evidence of NET formation\n\n18,\n19\n, together with the colocalization of neutrophils with platelets in fibrin rich clots and our identification of a platelet degranulation signature within the COVID-19 ARDS samples, this led us to question the mechanism by which neutrophils could be contributing to immune mediated thrombosis in COVID-19. NDN displayed an overall increase in proteins associated with fibrin clot formation; fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta and coagulation factor XIII alpha chain (F13A1) and a failure to induce proteins that inhibit fibrin clot formation in NDN like antithrombin-III (\nFigure 5A). This signature was greatest in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (\nFigure 5A). We also detected a platelet protein signature indicated by the presence of the platelet proteins platelet factor 4, platelet basic protein (\nFigure 5B). Confocal imaging on sorted mature neutrophil populations from COVID-19 ARDS patients subsequently revealed the existence of a direct physical association between LDN and platelets in these patients, as opposed to neutrophils from healthy donors (\nFigure 5C). To understand how neutrophil platelet aggregates were forming we looked for evidence of platelet activation on the neutrophil surface, and neutrophil expression of adhesion molecules involved in platelet interactions. Initial measurements for expression of CD41, a marker of platelet activation, revealed the presence of CD41 on mature LDN isolated from COVID-19 patients (\nFigure 5D). This coincided with a significant increase in mature neutrophil expression of the CD11b component of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex (\nFigure 5E). This phenotype was specific to the mature neutrophil populations, with only low-level surface expression of CD41, CD18, CD11b observed in the immature LDN population (\nFigure 5D\u2013E).Open in a separate windowFigure 5.

TLR family members 7 and 8 have been previously reported to enable recognition of single stranded RNA viruses including influenza and SARS-CoV-2\n\n37,\n38\n. To directly address whether neutrophil sensing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was important for the regulation of Mac-1, we stimulated healthy control neutrophils with TLR 7 and 8 agonist resiquimod\n\n39\n. Additionally, hypoxic culture conditions were used to replicate the systemic hypoxia that circulating neutrophils are exposed to in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Resiquimod up-regulated neutrophil expression of both components of the Mac-1 platelet binding complex, CD11b and CD18 (\nFigure 5F) replicating the observed phenotype of COVID-19. In keeping with the patient data, the addition of dexamethasone to resiquimod stimulation did not impact CD11b or CD18 expression (\nFigure 5F).The presence of neutrophil platelet aggregates in patients with COVID-19 ARDS led us to question why neutrophils were binding to activated platelets, and whether there was evidence that neutrophils themselves were becoming inappropriately activated in the blood. Neutrophils express a plethora of cell surface receptors to enable them to respond to noxious stimuli. A key element of this response is the highly regulated release of cytotoxic granule proteins. However, inappropriate degranulation in the lung tissue during ARDS is associated with epithelial and vascular damage which in turn potentiates lung injury\n\n40\n. In health, the release of toxic granules by neutrophils in the circulation is limited by the requirement of a second activation stimulus following neutrophil priming\n\n41\n. Comparison of the proteomes of NDN populations revealed that granule cargo proteins are highly abundant and account for approximately 20% of the neutrophil protein mass (\nFigure 6A). In both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, whilst we observed an equivalent abundance of primary (CD63, CD68 and Presenilin-1), secondary (Ras related proteins 1A-B and 2A-C), secondary and tertiary (secretory carrier membrane protein 1\u20134, vesicle associated membrane protein 2) and specifically tertiary (solute carrier 11A1) granule membrane proteins (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023834), there is a relative reduction in the abundance of the granule cargo proteins within these circulating cells (\nFigure 6B). Survey of these individual proteases reveals these changes to be modest, but to occur across the different granule compartments and to be amplified in COVID-19 (\nFigure 6C\u2013J). To address whether this relative reduction in intra-cellular granule protein content was consequent upon neutrophil degranulation, we quantified surface expression of CD63, a protein known to be externalised upon degranulation, and CD66b, whose surface expression augments in response to degranulation. We observed a significant increase in CD63 and CD66b expression which was specific to the COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (\nFigure 6K). Importantly an increase in serum levels of the neutrophil granule proteins MPO, lactoferrin and elastase in the COVID-19 ARDS patient cohort (\nFigure 6L) confirmed a phenotype of enhanced circulating neutrophil degranulation in the COVID-19 ARDS patient cohort, which was not impacted by dexamethasone (\nFigure 6M). Consistent with neutrophil sensing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA promoting activation and degranulation, stimulation of healthy control neutrophils with the TLR7 and 8 agonist resiquimod increased neutrophil shedding of CD62L and upregulated expression of CD66b and CD63 (\nFigure 6N). This resulted in an increase in detectable levels of the granule proteins MPO and lactoferrin in the cell culture supernatants (\nFigure 6O).Open in a separate windowFigure 6.

Persistent high levels of circulating type I IFN are associated with more severe disease in the late stages of disease\n\n42\n, thought to be due to dysfunctional inflammation rather than uncontrolled viral infection. This complexity is further reflected in the divergent signals in IFN stimulated genes (ISG) described in whole blood and PBMC myeloid cell populations, where select changes in transcript abundance are used to identify specific cell clusters\n\n14\n. Here, we report using LIMMA analysis of NDN proteomes a type I IFN signature within the COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils (\nFigure 4B). We therefore surveyed the abundance of proteins involved in anti-viral responses downstream of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR). This revealed across the pathway a greater abundance of proteins important for type I IFN signalling and anti-viral responses in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils including 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase proteins which activate RNase L (\nFigure 7A), Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2-alpha Kinase 2 (EIF2AK) which inhibits viral transcription (\nFigure 7B) and the GTP binding Mx proteins which inhibit viral replication (\nFigure 7C).Open in a separate windowFigure 7.

Data are mean \u00b1 SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 determined by one-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak\u2019s post hoc-testing.Another important effect of IFN signalling in viral infection is to stimulate antigen presentation of intracellular (i.e. viral) antigens via the proteosome to alert T-cells to the infected cell. Analysis of the antigen presentation and processing pathway showed preserved levels of the immunoproteasome subunits in COVID-19 neutrophils (\nFigure 7D), but a global increase in the expression of proteins implicated in immune cell development, regulation, antigen processing and presentation (\nFigure 7E). These included a greater copy number of the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) proteins required for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (\nFigure 7F), and in class I MHC molecules themselves (\nFigure 7G).ARDS neutrophils and type I interferon stimulated healthy neutrophils have altered metabolic profiles with enhanced glutamine utilisationType I IFNs have been found to drive metabolic adaptations in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) with upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation promoting pDC activation in response to TLR 9 agonists\n\n43\n. To address whether neutrophils have the capacity to adapt their metabolic programs in response to type I IFN or TLR 7 and 8 activation, blood neutrophils from healthy controls were stimulated in the presence or absence of resiquimod, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 and glycolysis was assessed by extracellular flux analysis (\nFigure 8A). Resiquimod induced a significant uplift in glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, which was partially abrogated by the addition of type I IFNs (\nFigure 8A). To further characterise the metabolic rewiring in response to type I IFN we undertook LC-MS quantification of individual metabolic intermediaries. In keeping with the real time reduction in extracellular acidification rates, IFN treated neutrophils showed a reduced lactate content (\nFigure 8B). This was associated with preservation of TCA cycle intermediaires including citrate, alphaketoglutarate, malate and succinate (\nFigure 8C) and a significant increase in the amino acid glutamate (\nFigure 8D). Together with (U)-\n13C\n5 glutamine tracing into glutamate this would support the ability of neutrophils to substrate switch in response to exposure to type I IFN (\nFigure 8E). To address whether this metabolic rewiring was observed in blood neutrophils isolated from patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS we undertook LC-MS analysis of freshly isolated cells. In contrast to type I IFN stimulation of healthy control neutrophils, neutrophils from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients demonstrated an increase in intracellular levels of free glucose (\nFigure 8F) while preserving their lactate content (\nFigure 8G) and TCA cycle intermediaries (\nFigure 8H) compared to healthy control neutrophils, suggesting these cells have equivalent glycolytic flux and TCA cycle activity. However, in keeping with the capacity of ARDS neutrophils to substrate switch, glutamate levels were elevated in both COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS neutrophils (\nFigure 8I).Open in a separate windowFigure 8. Metabolic rewiring of COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils correspond to changes in neutrophil metabolism in response to type I interferon.(\nA) Glycolytic behaviour as determined by extracellular flux analysis during the glycolysis stress test in hypoxia (3% O\n2).

Data are mean \u00b1 SD (\nF,\nG and\nI) or median \u00b1 I.Q.R (\nH). HC, NA and CA were compared by student\u2019s t-test (\nF,\nG and\nI) or Mann-Whitney (\nH) where *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. DiscussionARDS continues to result in significant mortality despite considerable research endeavour. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection has confounded this, with 10\u201320% of hospitalised patients progressing to ARDS\n\n44\n. Urgent understanding of the immunological features specific to COVID-19 ARDS is therefore required. Moreover, the pathophysiological consequences of myeloid dysfunction as determined by scRNA-seq, mass flow cytometry and blood count studies is as yet unclear, as is the mechanism by which dexamethasone improves clinical outcomes in COVID-19 ARDS\n\n14,\n42,\n45,\n46\n. We therefore employed flow cytometry and mass spectrometry to characterise disease specific protein and metabolite signatures in ARDS neutrophil populations and explored their functional implications. Using this approach, we identify that the expansion of low density and normal density neutrophil populations previously observed in COVID-19 is also observed in non-COVID-19 ARDS. Whilst total cell counts are retained in patients receiving dexamethasone therapy, we report an associated contraction of immature LDN neutrophil populations. It will be important to understand moving forwards whether a key therapeutic effect of dexamethasone is the suppression of acute myelopoiesis in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2.Proteomic survey also allowed us to highlight key processes, including activation of type I IFN responses that are distinct to COVID-19 ARDS, but more notably, processes not previously detected by scRNA-seq including platelet degranulation and the expression of proteins implicated in immune cell development, regulation, antigen processing and presentation. Importantly, these protein signatures were observed within mature NDN, suggesting this not to be a consequence of disordered myelopoiesis. It is interesting to note that MCM proteins, that are responsible for the separation of DNA and as such are conventionally associated with DNA replication, were enriched in both COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS. In the context of neutrophils, a terminally differentiated cell, this may hint to processes involved in the unravelling of DNA for NET formation rather than cell cycle control and serves as an interesting concept for further exploration.A striking clinical divergence between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS is the prominence of micro and macrovascular thrombosis in COVID-19 ARDS. Here, we report proteomic signatures indicative of platelet degranulation and clotting cascade activation. These observations together with evidence of neutrophil platelet binding, extend the previously reported contribution of neutrophils to the pathogenesis of immune clot formation through the release of NETs to one of TLR mediated neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates. It is interesting to note that it is the neutrophils within the low density layer we observe by confocal microscopy to bind to platelets and to be associated with the upregulating the Mac-1 platelet binding complex in COVID-19 ARDS. Further work will be required to understand whether LDN also demonstrate a propensity for NETs formation, and whether these aggregates, previously reported in the lung tissue at post-mortem, impair neutrophil transmigration and directly contribute to vascular damage and to the formation of microthrombi\n\n17\u2013\n19\n. It will also be important to dissect whether the uplift in expression of proteins associated with fibrin clot formation in COVID-19 ARDS is consequent upon intrinsic neutrophil expression of these proteins, neutrophil processing of platelet proteins or reflective of adherent platelets contributing to the protein signatures of the circulating neutrophil populations.The importance of neutrophil activation of type I IFN signalling pathways in COVID-19 ARDS also requires further consideration given the disconnect between tissue injury and viral detection\n\n47\n. The ability of neutrophils to cross-present exogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells has previously been reported and is highly relevant for T cell priming\nin vivo\n\n48\n. This may be particularly relevant in a disease where early CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be protective\n\n49,\n50\n, but late responses are associated with damaging inflammation\n\n50\u2013\n53\n. Whilst activation of anti-viral responses including class I MHC antigen presentation would therefore appear beneficial with respect to viral control, if this is associated with a hyper-inflammatory neutrophil phenotype and delayed T cell activation, the net consequence could be persistent tissue injury. In this regard, we would predict that inappropriate degranulation of neutrophils in the circulation would be highly damaging and cause wide-spread inflammation within the microvasculature where neutrophils are known to be sequestered. Our evidence of expanded neutrophil numbers together with increased neutrophil activation and degranulation confirmed by the detection of plasma neutrophil granule proteins in patients with COVID-19 ARDS and TLR-agonist\nin vitro assays would support this concept of a hyper-inflammatory, damaging circulating innate response. These pro-thrombotic hyperinflammatory neutrophil protein signatures would appear to be retained in patients with COVID-19 ARDS receiving dexamethasone therapy. This is perhaps not surprising given the paucity of evidence for the impact of corticosteroids on neutrophilic inflammation, highlighting the need for additional therapeutic strategies.Finally, the mechanism by which type I IFN regulates neutrophil behaviour remains to be fully elucidated. In pDC, TLR 9 mediated activation is dependent upon autocrine production of type I IFNs and an increase in oxidative metabolism\n\n43\n. Neutrophils are unique in their reliance on non-oxidative metabolism for ATP production, even when oxygen is freely available. It is therefore of interest that in response to IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, neutrophils rewire their metabolic programme by reducing their glycolytic potential. Together with an increase in detectable levels of glutamate in neutrophils isolated from patients with COVID-19 ARDS, and existing evidence that neutrophils can undergo gluconeogenesis\n\n54\n, this raises the interesting possibility that ARDS neutrophils re-wire their metabolic processes to facilitate ongoing inflammatory responses which may be detrimental to the host. Future work will be required to better understand whether these metabolic changes potentiate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory innate immune responses following viral challenge. Of interest small molecules already exist for targeting glutamine utilisation and have been trialled in the cancer setting, raising the possibility of metabolic drug repurposing for the treatment of COVID-19\n\n55\n.In summary, using mass spectrometry we describe pathophysiological protein and metabolic neutrophil signatures that are common to ARDS and those distinct to COVID-19 ARDS. We identify a type I IFN response in COVID-19 ARDS neutrophils which is associated with metabolic rewiring, neutrophil degranulation and the formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates in the blood which persist irrespective of dexamethasone treatment. A clear limitation of this study is the relatively small number of patients recruited. This is balanced against the detailed analysis we have been able to perform in these patient groups and the move towards functional dissection of neutrophil responses not previously captured in transcriptional data sets. Further understanding of the mechanisms which regulate aberrant neutrophil responses will likely be important in developing strategies to target the innate responses following infection with SARS-CoV-2 to enable an effective therapeutic arsenal for COVID-19 ARDS.

This study explores the changes in neutrophils during ARDS and, more specifically, the differences in neutrophils between covid-ARDS and ARDS of other causes. The neutrophil changes are measured using several assays, including flow cytometry, liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS), immunochemistry, and biochemistry with a focus on metabolic changes. While exploratory in nature, the study generates a number of interesting hypotheses that would be tested in further studies.\u00a0 A major limitation of the study is the small size of the patient cohort.\u00a0 While the fraction of the covid positive patient who end with complications and death is relatively small, a larger number of subjects is needed in order to avoid any bias in the results. The presence of a larger number of low-density neutrophils (LDN) in covid-ARDS vs. non-covid-ARDS is interpreted as a stimulation of the myeloid production in the bone marrow that releases a larger than normal fraction of immature neutrophils. Further support to this hypothesis is provided by the observation that prednisone treatment reduces the proportion of LDN. Moreover, the expression of surface markers is also presented as being consistent with the presence of immature neutrophils in the circulation. Although interesting, these findings represent just one snap-shot in the evolution of the disease. A longitudinal study that observes the progression of the neutrophil subpopulation changes would be helpful in revealing how long after the SARS-CoV2 infection these changes can be detected and if the neutrophil changes can be measured before or after the ARDS is diagnosed. The study also finds that the neutrophils in circulation are more activated in covid than in non-covid ARDS patients. This finding is supported by proteomic data and a more detailed analysis points out the activation of IFN I pathways in covid-ARDS neutrophils, which is consistent with the viral origin of the condition. This finding is also supported by the immunochemistry of the neutrophil granules, and the analysis of metabolic changes. Overall, these findings are intriguing because they would suggest that other stimuli activating the neutrophils play a smaller role in changing the neutrophil phenotypes. A limitation of this analysis is the small number of samples analyzed. One of the most intriguing results reported in this study is that of the neutrophil-platelet aggregates. This finding may be potentially relevant to the higher rate of clotting observed in covid patients. However, this finding was not supported by results with the same level of detail as the other findings. The results presented are mostly qualitative, and, when quantitative measurements are performed, the variability within groups is often larger than the difference between groups. Thus, the interpretation of the results may be more interesting in the context of the disease severity; for example, were the patients with more neutrophil-platelet aggregates more likely to have complications than those with less. To overcome the issues due to the small cohort of patients enrolled in the study, the stratification of the patients based on disease severity, irrespective of the covid status may be more interesting. A larger study may also address other important issues, including the effect of neutrophil-platelet aggregation on 1. The activity of neutrophils, including their motility and 2. The activation of the platelets and the formation of small thrombi.Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?YesIf applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?YesAre all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?YesIs the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?YesAre the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?PartlyAre sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?YesReviewer Expertise:design of assays for neutrophil functional changes in patientsI confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. In this manuscript, Reyes et al. test various aspects of neutrophil biology in COVID-19-related and non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome using an unbiased proteomic and metabolomic analysis of peripheral blood neutrophils, along with parallel samples of healthy control and moderate COVID-19 patients. The authors reveal that COVID-related ARDS is characterized by neutrophil signatures indicating Type I interferon responsiveness, neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-platelet aggregates and metabolic changes. The authors' approach of proteomic and metabolic analyses provides important novel addition to the existing literature given that neutrophils are transcriptionally silent cells and are therefore underrepresented in gene expression (e. g. scRNASeq) studies. The experiments are appropriately designed and carefully conducted. Though the subject of the manuscript is of clear interest, the depth of the study is somewhat limited, given the small patient cohort sizes and the lack of further in-depth mechanistic studies (as mentioned by the authors at the end of the Discussion). This applies particularly to the analysis of dexamethasone treatment. Taken together, this is an important, although somewhat descriptive study on the possible contribution of neutrophils to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Specific comments:\nAlthough the authors had four different groups (HC, NA, MC, CA; not mentioning CD here), they somewhat randomly select the results of which groups to show or not to show. This makes the study somewhat unbalanced. The authors should either show the results of all groups or provide a rationale for why one or more groups have been excluded from certain experiments.To what extent may the observed metabolic changes be related to changes in neutrophil-platelet aggregation?The authors should make a more definitive distinction between components of the platelet activation and coagulation cascades. Though they are related to each other, they are two mechanistically different aspects of hemostasis.Fig 2C is a bit difficult to follow. The authors should consider showing the different samples in separate dot-plots.\nIs the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?PartlyIf applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?YesAre all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?YesIs the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?YesAre the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?YesAre sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?YesReviewer Expertise:neutrophil biology, inflammationI confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. \nGeneral comments\n This manuscript focuses on neutrophil state of activation in patients suffering from COVID-19-associated ARDS. Several reports have well demonstrated the key role of neutrophils during this condition but little is known about their functional disturbance. The aim of the study is to compare neutrophil populations in patients with COVID-19 ARDS to those of patients with non COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID and healthy controls. Of interest, the authors have studied the effect of dexamethasone on neutrophil parameters. Several aspects of neutrophil biology are covered including flow cytometry analysis of membrane marker phenotyping, proteomic and metabolomic analysis in a restricted number of patients which, as mentioned by the authors, represents a limiting aspect of the study. The methodology are carefully described. Overall the experiments reported have been well designed and performed. However, I have several issues and some potential suggestions that I would like to mention. This manuscript is a valuable study. It provides novel tracks of research on neutrophils in COVID-19 that will need to be investigated in more details to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n1) Analysis of membrane markers in NDN and in LDN\u00a0: relative importance of LDN\n The authors have determined the neutrophil phenotype in normal density neutrophils (NDP) and in low density neutrophils (LDN) isolated from the PBMC fraction which are supposed to be immature neutrophils generated during emergency hematopoiesis. These LDN have been described in different inflammatory conditions. Although ARDS is associated with a severe neutrophil-dominated inflammation, the fraction of LDN in the blood of patients from the NA or the CA group is rather small since it is not significantly increased as compared to controls (in which basically no LDN could be detected). Surprisingly, the LDN fraction is increased after dexamethasone treatment in the CA group. The authors also observed that only a small fraction of LDN could be considered as immature neutrophils with a CD66bhigh-CD16low-CD10low phenotype. It might be useful to the reader to note that CD16 is not only a marker of maturity but could also be considered as a marker of activation or apoptosis.\n2) Activation state in different subtypes of neutrophils\u00a0: LDN versus NDN versus whole blood analysis\n In Figure 2, the authors observe that NDN do not display an activated phenotype since no modulation of CD62L or CD63 (calculated as fold change with controls) is observed. This conclusion is different in Figure 6K, in which the Facs data are expressed in MFI. This discrepancy requires clarification. In contrast, the authors show a decreased CD62L in LDN which is significant only in immature LDN CD66bhigh-CD16low-CD10-low in all types of patients. However, as I mentioned previously, this LDN fraction is rather small representing less than 2 to 5 % (although this is higher in CA around 10% without being significantly different from the other groups either NA and MC). If one consider that the population of CD66bhigh-CD16low-CD10-low could be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 it might be relevant to quantify this population within whole blood. Maybe authors could show the data for each marker measured whithin whole blood in different groups with the percentage and the MFI. It could be important to question whether this non abundant sub-population of immature LDN could be physiologically relevant.\u00a0\nTaken together the role of LDN in the pathogenesis of ARDS in COVID-19 might not be prominent. \u00a0The authors might discuss this issue.\n\n3) Analysis of dexamethasone effect\n The authors show that dexamethasone treatment increases the percentage of mature LDN (\nFigure 2H). It could be informative to have the number of treated patients. In each patient, does dexamethasone affect both the percentage and/or the maturity state of LDN? It would also be more informative to display the data for each patients to see if the decrease of immature LDN occurs in all the cases (instead of showing an histogram).\n4) Proteomic analysis of expression of coagulation-related proteins in neutrophils\n The authors have observed several modifications of protein abundance using the label free mass spectrometry analysis. Although this analysis can give a quantitative view of each protein, the expression of specific proteins should be studied by Western blot analysis. It is not clear whether the mass spectrometry analysis would detect cleaved protein or whether only one isoform could be down or up-regulated. Western blot analysis is specially important for the proteins involved in fibrin clot formation which might be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Interestingly, the authors show that proteins involved in coagulation in neutrophils from dexamethasone-treated patients do not seem to be different from those of untreated patients when evaluated by proteomic analysis using the relative abundance. To strengthen this conclusion, it could be useful to do Western blot analysis of each patient (dexamethasone and untreated group should be analyzed) and to quantify the expression of this coagulation-related proteins with a control protein (actin or other non modulated protein). Dexamethasone might indeed modify the profil of these proteins by inducing post-translational modifications or cleavage in some of these proteins. This could be part of its potential anti-inflammatory activity.\n5) Expression of proteins involved in coagulation- expression of CD41 on neutrophils\n In Figure 5C, the authors observe an increased expression of CD41 which is a marker of platelet activation. What are the mechanisms of CD41 expression on neutrophils? Is it a transfer of membrane from platelets or platelets or soluble CD41? Do activated platelets associate more easily on neutrophils from COVID patients? The authors show some modulation of proteins that can bind coagulation proteins. Figure 5E shows that CD11b is increased in NDN both in NDN and CA and this is evaluated by MFI values. This representation is difficult to compare with the data expressed in fold changes displayed in Figure 5F. Could the authors use the same method to express the results? Figure 5D shows that the expression of CD41 is significantly higher in NDN from mild COVID (MC) patients who do not experience ARDS or any thrombotic complications. In contrast, no increase in CD41 is observed in NDN from CA patients who are at risk of developing thrombotic complications. In addition, the authors show that CD41 is significantly increased in mature LDN both in MC and in CA. Since the proportion of mature LDN is not very important (less than 5% in MC and CA) in the neutrophil population, the pathophysiological relevance of this observation is questionable. It seems that variation of CD41 is not associated with the clinical state of COVID patients because it is observed in both MC and CA. Maybe the authors could comment on this. It is not mentioned (or no clearly enough) if the LDN from CA are mature or immature in Figure 5C. In the Figure 5, there is no panel showing the effect of resiquinod which activate TLR7 and TLR8 (although it is mentionned in the legend). In the text, the authors describe that this results in upregulation of CD11b and CD18.\nThe author should include the missing panel.\n\n6) Evaluation of degranulation of neutrophils\n As mentionned above, in Figure 6K, the authors report an increase in CD63 and CD66b membrane expression in CA whereas this increased is not significant on the data presented in Figure 2F expressed in fold changes. Are the same patients included? What should we conclude\u00a0because there are two opposite comments after analysis of the same dataset? \u00a0The authors should clarify this discrepancy. In Figure 6N, the data depicting the effect of resiquinod on neutrophils from healthy controls under hypoxia are not shown although they are mentioned in the legend and in the text. Again,\nthe author should include the missing panel.\n The panel 6L showing plasma concentration of MPO\u00a0, lactoferrin and elastase would be more convincing with more than 3 patients.\n7) Metabolic analysis\n The metabolic analysis and the observation of a disturbance in neutrophil metabolism in COVID patients is very interesting but it seems that some additional experiments would clarify the message. In Figure 8, the authors show that resiquinod can modify the metabolic profile of neutrophils from healthy controls by increasing glycolysis and this is decreased by type I IFN. What is the effect of TypeI IFN alone on glycolysis? Is glycolysis increased only by the combination resiquinod and type I IFN? The authors show that type I IFN decrease lactate under hypoxic conditions. Does that mean that glycolysis is decreased\u00a0in the absence of activation of TLR7 and 8 by resiquinod? Could the authors show the analysis of glycolysis using the see horse technology\u00a0to compare with the data shown in Figure 8A? In contrast, type I IFN did not affect the levels of TCA intermediates but increased the level of glutamate. Is the intracellular glucose affected? The metabolic analysis of neutrophils in Covid patients show that there is no modulation of lactate but an increase in intracellular glucose. This is why is could be important to measure intracellular glucose in the neutrophils of healthy controls stimulated by resiquinod in the presence or absence of type I IFN. Interestingly, the authors show an increase in glutamate levels in ARDS patients both in NA and in CA suggesting that this metabolic change is more related to an adaptation of neutrophils to ARDS but is not specific of COVID-19 ARDS. It could be relevant to have similar representation of glutamate amounts in the different experiments: in Figure 8I it is expressed in abundance\u00a0(?) and in Figure 8D performed in healthy controls it is expressed in fold changes. To make the data consistent and get a clear picture of the metabolic changes that could occur in neutrophils from ARDS patients I would suggest to measure the glutamate abundance in neutrophils from heathy donors stimulated by either resiquinod in the presence or absence of type I IFN. Same suggestion applies to the analysis of glycolysis and glucose abundance.\nGeneral comment:\n Figures 5, 6 and 7 are very hard to understand because the size of the text is too small.\u00a0 This should be modified in order to make this figure readable.Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?YesIf applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?YesAre all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?YesIs the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?YesAre the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?PartlyAre sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?YesReviewer Expertise:NAI confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above. This study by Reyes et al describes a comprehensive molecular analysis of neutrophils isolated from people with ARDS. They find distinct neutrophil activation signatures in COVID-19 ARDS, perhaps not surprisingly, centred around anti-viral IFN responses. The study also sheds light on the association of COVID-19 with vascular thrombosis, by identifying evidence of platelet neutrophil binding and activation of the clotting cascade. Overall, this work has been performed to a very high standard, is beautifully written and given the significant mortality associated with ARDS of all aetiology, it is of great clinical importance. We have the following questions:\nCould the authors clarify and add detail to the neutrophil isolation method - is this a plasma/percoll gradient as per the Haslett reference cited, or it a modified protocol?For figure 2B, were equivalent numbers of events acquired for each dot plot? This would give a more accurate indication of the proportion of each cell type.Considering the overarching aim of the study is to compare COVID-19 ARDS vs non-COVID-19 ARDS, it is surprising to not see a direct comparison between CA and NA for figure 3E and figure 4A. Was this done and what was the outcome?In figure 5C, were the authors able to visualise neutrophil:platelet aggregates for more than one cell and could this quantified and data presented? This would add support to figure 5D.For figure 6 (M-N), consider performing stats on the raw data values and not fold changes.The legend for figure 5F and figure 6N suggests that normoxic conditions (N-U) were studied but this does not seem to be reflected on the figure. Could this be clarified?\nIs the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?YesIf applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?YesAre all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?YesIs the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?YesAre the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?YesAre sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?YesReviewer Expertise:Neutrophil biology, inflammation, cell survivalWe confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard."}
