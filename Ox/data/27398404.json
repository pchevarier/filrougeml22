Pol II is made up of 12 subunits (Rpb1\u2013Rpb12) 2. The carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II (Rpb1) comprises tandemly repeated heptapeptides with the consensus sequence Tyr1\u2010Ser2\u2010Pro3\u2010Thr4\u2010Ser5\u2010Pro6\u2010Ser7 3, 4. The CTD plays a central role in transcriptional and co\u2010transcriptional RNA processing 4, 5, 6, 7 by mediating the recruitment of transcription and processing factors at different steps of the transcription cycle through reversible modification of the residues within the heptapeptide repeats 8. CTD modification generates a code that regulates the interaction with transcription and RNA processing factors 9, 10, 11, 12. Among the CTD modifications, the phosphorylation of Ser2 (Ser2P) of pol II CTD, is catalyzed by the cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb). P\u2010TEFb also phosphorylates two negative transcription elongation factors: DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF), which are recruited to the elongation complex in the promoter proximal region to induce pol II pausing 13, 14. Phosphorylation of NELF promotes its dissociation from the elongation complex, whereas phospho\u2010DSIF remains associated with pol II as an elongation activator 14. The role of P\u2010TEFb in stimulating productive elongation was elucidated using 5,6\u2010dichloro\u20101\u2010\u03b2\u2010d\u2010ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), which is a purine nucleoside analog that inhibits CDK9 activity 15. Treatment of cells with DRB results in the production of shortened transcripts, diagnostic of the inability of pol II to transcribe through the early elongation checkpoint in the absence of P\u2010TEFb activity 16. In addition to Ser2 of the pol II CTD, NELF and DSIF, several serine residues in the key transcription factor p53 are phosphorylated by CDK9, which results in p53 activation 17, 18.Positive transcription elongation factor b comprises the CDK9 kinase and a cyclin partner 15. CDK9 is an ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr proline\u2010directed kinase 19, 20. It was identified in the early 1990s and initially named PITALRE 19, 21. It exists in two isoforms, CDK9\u201042 and CDK9\u201055, which arise from two transcription start sites 22. The ratio of CDK9\u201042/CDK9\u201055 is cell type\u2010dependent 23, and it is unclear if there are functional differences between the two isoforms. CDK9 interacts with T\u2010type cyclins \u2013 T1, T2a, T2b and cyclin K 24, 25. In this heterodimer, the CDK9 subunit provides the enzymatic activity, while the cyclin has a regulatory role 24, 26. However, mass spectrometry has failed to demonstrate that cyclin K is associated with CDK9 27. In addition, a recent study revealed that cyclin K associates with CDK12 and CDK13 28. Therefore, cyclins T1 and T2 may be the major cyclins associated with CDK9. In the cell, P\u2010TEFb exists in two major forms. A large amount of cellular P\u2010TEFb is sequestered in an inactive complex with the noncoding 7SK small nuclear RNA (7SK snRNA), hexamethylene bisacetamide\u2010induced protein 1 (HEXIM1) and/or HEXIM2 and the La\u2010related protein 7 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. The catalytically active form of P\u2010TEFb is instead generally associated with bromodomain\u2010containing protein 4 (Brd4) and the super elongation complex (SEC) 36, 37, 38. The transition between active and inactive forms is dynamic and tightly regulated 37, 38, reflecting the important role that P\u2010TEFb plays in cellular processes (Fig.\u00a01). Given the importance of P\u2010TEFb in regulating cellular gene expression, it is perhaps not surprising that this complex is also functionally integrated into the expression of human viruses (Table\u00a01). Several viral factors regulate CTD phosphorylation through recruitment or modulation of the activity of CDK9.Open in a separate windowFigure 1The role of positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb) in a regulation of pol II transcription. P\u2010TEFb, comprising cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and a cyclin T1 subunit, exists in a catalytically inactive small nuclear ribonucleic particle with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. Active P\u2010TEFb is bound instead to bromodomain\u2010containing protein 4 (Brd4) and stimulates elongation through phosphorylation of the pol II carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) on Ser2 and two negative transcription elongation factors: DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) and negative elongation factor (NELF). Phosphorylation converts DSIF from a repressor to an activator, whereas phosphorylated NELF leaves the elongation complex.Table 1Viral factors that interact with P\u2010TEFbVirusViral factors that interact with P\u2010TEFbReferencesHerpes simplex virusICP22\n50, 142\nHuman cytomegaloviruspUL69\n69, 70, 143\nIE2 86pUL97Epstein\u2013Barr virusEBNA2\n75\nHuman immunodeficiency virusTat\n144, 145\nHuman T\u2010lymphotropic virusTax\n110, 111\nHuman adenovirusE1A\n117\nInfluenza A virusvRNP\n121\nDengue virusDENV core protein\n129\nKaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated virusK\u2010cyclin\n59\nOpen in a separate windowP\u2010TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b; ICP22, immediate\u2010early protein 22; EBNA2, Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen 2; vRNP, viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases.The studies reviewed here present examples of DNA and RNA viruses that subvert the host cell CTD kinase CDK9 for their own needs. Understanding the requirements of CDK9 for viral infection and how viral infection alters pol II CTD phosphorylation patterns not only advances our knowledge of viral pathogenesis but also provides potential new anti\u2010viral drug targets.The \u03b1\u2010herpesvirus ICP22 protein has an intimate relationship with P\u2010TEFbAfter infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV\u20101 and HSV\u20102) goes through a lytic replicative phase and causes localized lesions. This is followed by a latent phase where viruses reside in sensory neurons and can be frequently reactivated by a range of stresses, including high temperature and ultraviolet light 39. Although HSV infections are generally self\u2010limiting in healthy individuals, they can cause cancer, inflammation of the brain and the eye, and pose a significant mortality risk in infants and immuno\u2010compromised adults 40, 41. The HSV immediate\u2010early protein 22 (ICP22) is encoded by the US1 gene and comprises 420 amino acid residues. Viral deletion mutants without the US1 gene have a reduced capacity to establish latency in animal models 42, 43. In addition, deletion of this gene causes viral growth defects in some cell lines 42. During HSV\u20101 productive infection, three classes of genes are sequentially expressed; first, the immediate\u2010early genes (\u03b1\u2010genes), next, the early genes (\u03b2\u2010genes), and finally, the late genes (\u03b3\u2010genes) 44, 45. It has been demonstrated that ICP22 represses transcription of the viral \u03b1\u2010genes, \u03b2\u2010genes and \u03b3\u2010genes by blocking the recruitment of P\u2010TEFb to their promoters. In contrast, the herpes viral protein 16 (VP16) overcomes the inhibitory effects of ICP22 on \u03b1\u2010gene transcription 46. It has been demonstrated that ICP22 alters the CTD phosphorylation state of pol II 47. ICP22 mediates two distinct effects on pol II: the induction of an intermediately migrating form of pol II (pol IIi) and the loss of pol II forms phosphorylated on Ser2 47, 48. Pol IIi replaces the normal hyperphosphorylated form of pol II in HSV\u20101 infected cells. The induction of pol IIi requires ICP22 and another viral factor, UL13 49. A recent study demonstrated that ICP22 interacts directly with cellular CDK9 and that a short segment of ICP22 (residue 193\u2010256) is sufficient for this interaction 50. However, this short segment does not interact with pol II, unlike the full length of ICP22. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of either full length of ICP22 or amino acids residues 193\u2010256, leads to the loss of Ser2 CTD phosphorylation and subsequently to the inhibition of transcriptional elongation of host cell genes 50. These findings suggest a model where ICP22 is recruited to the transcriptionally active host genes soon after infection, where its interaction with P\u2010TEFb inhibits the kinase activity of CDK9, resulting in the loss of productive elongation (Fig.\u00a02). Lytic infection with HSV\u20101 also causes a transcription termination defects on host cell genes 51. Termination of transcription of the viral genes is however, efficient, highlighting that HSV\u20101 proteins regulate transcription to maximize expression of the viral genome while down\u2010regulating expression of the host genome. Shutting down host cell gene expression could benefit the virus by, for example, helping to evade anti\u2010viral responses including production of type I interferon 52. Interaction of ICP22 with the CDK9 target, p53, is also important for efficient HSV\u20101 replication 53.Open in a separate windowFigure 2Immediate\u2010early protein 22 (ICP22) inhibits CDK9. HSV ICP22 interacts with cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). This results in the loss of Ser2 phosphorylation of the carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of pol II and inhibition of transcription elongation of host cell genes. P\u2010TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b.KSHV factors regulate P\u2010TEFb activity towards pol II and p53Kaposi sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is also known as human herpesvirus 8. KSHV causes Kaposi's sarcoma, multicentric Castleman's disease, and primary effusion lymphoma 54, 55, 56. K\u2010cyclin, encoded by the virus, can interact and activate CDK6 and can trigger apoptosis in cells with high levels of this cyclin 57, 58. In the search for new K\u2010cyclin partners, CDK9 was identified as a new interacting CDK. In addition, it was demonstrated that K\u2010cyclin stimulates CDK9 kinase activity towards p53, and that CDK9 is required for K\u2010cyclin\u2010induced p53\u2010dependent growth suppression 59. However, the role of CDK9 in KSHV replication goes beyond its interaction with K\u2010cyclin. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) of KSHV, K\u2010RTA, regulates the reactivation of KSHV from a latent state. As demonstrated by an in vitro kinase assay, RTA is a substrate of CDK9. Furthermore, CDK9 inhibitors suppress the expression of various K\u2010RTA target genes. This further suggests that CDK9 inhibitors could be used to disturb KSHV replication 60. Interestingly, transcription elongation of KSHV lytic genes is paused during latency and can be reactivated in an RTA\u2010independent manner. Chip\u2010on\u2010chip analysis revealed that during KSHV latent infection, pol II transcription complexes are associated with NELF at the promoters of a group of lytic genes including OriLytL, K5, K6, and K7 (Fig.\u00a03). The CTD of pol II at these promoters is hyperphosphorylated on Ser5 and hypophosphorylated of Ser2. It was hypothesized that hypophosphorylation of Ser2 might be due to the recruitment of enzymatically inactive P\u2010TEFb to promoters 61. Therefore, the negative control of transcriptional elongation of lytic gene expression by modulating CDK9 activity during KSHV latency could be a key regulatory mechanism.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Pol II transcription complexes are paused at the promoters of Kaposi sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic genes during latent infection. The action of negative elongation factor (NELF) and inhibition of cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) prevents expression of KSHV lytic genes OriLytL, K5, K6, and K7 during latency. Inhibition of CDK9 prevents phosphorylation of Ser2 of the pol II carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD), whereas Ser5 is hyperphosphorylated.P\u2010TEFb is a key player in HCMV trancriptosomesThe \u03b2\u2010herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also known as human herpesvirus 5, infects 50\u201390% of the human population 62. HCMV infections are the leading viral cause of birth defects and pose a significant mortality risk in immunosuppressed individuals. In addition, HCMV may contribute to atherosclerosis and restenosis after coronary atherectomy 62, 63. HCMV infection results in the formation of viral transcriptosomes in the nucleus 64, 65, 66. These are the sites of transcription of the viral immediate\u2010early (IE) genes to which various viral and cellular factors are recruited 67. Cellular transcription regulators present at these sites include pol II, CDK9, cyclin T1, CDK7, and Brd4 65, 66, 68. It is well documented that HCMV infection affects the level and kinase activity of the recruited CDKs 68. In addition, recruitment of CDK9 to transcriptosomes during lytic infection results in hyperphosphorylation of the pol II CTD 66, 68, 69. Increased CTD phosphorylation might provide docking sites for processing factors regulating the alternative splicing of the primary HCMV transcripts\u00a068. In addition, P\u2010TEFb activity is associated with the regulatory functions of HCMV\u2010encoded proteins pUL69, IE2\u201086, and pUL97 67, 69, 70 and thus appears to be important for HCMV replication.P\u2010TEFb is critical for immortalization of EBV\u2010infected cellsThe Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), a \u03b3\u2010herpesvirus, is another important human pathogen, and seropositivity to EBV is estimated to be >90% in adults 71. EBV is able to infect and immortalize human B\u2010cells and is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis 72, 73. It has been also associated with several cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma and subsets of Hodgkin's lymphomas and T\u2010cell lymphomas 74. One of the viral genes translated during latency and required for B\u2010cell transformation and proliferation of infected cells is Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) 75. EBNA2 is an activator of viral and cellular transcription, and P\u2010TEFb is required for its activity 76, 77, 78. EBNA2 activation is sensitive to inhibition by a dominant negative mutant of CDK9 and the CDK9 inhibitor DRB. In addition, EBNA2 promotes Ser5 phosphorylation of the pol II CTD 78. EBNA2 activates transcription from the viral C promoter (Cp) generating a long primary transcript encoding nuclear antigens necessary for immortalization of the host cells. In addition, EBNA2 activates the promoters of viral latent membrane protein genes (LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B) 79, 80, 81. Recently, Palermo et al. (2011) demonstrated that Cp directs the buildup of a high level of stalled pol II together with the pausing factors DSIF and NELF. The stalled pol II maintains a nucleosome\u2010depleted region as measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation for histone H3. Moreover, stalled pol II increases recruitment of Brd4\u2010associated P\u2010TEFb to drive high levels of Ser2 phosphorylation of the pol II CTD and facilitate productive elongation 82. These results highlight a key role for P\u2010TEFb in EBNA2\u2010dependent transcription activation and the immortalization of EBV\u2010infected cells.HIV Tat effectively hijacks P\u2010TEFbThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 83. The main target cells for HIV are CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages 84, 85. The most extensively studied in vivo latent reservoir is found within memory CD4+ T cells 86. HIV can also infect dendritic cells 87. Activation of latent viruses occurs at the level of elongation of transcription and requires binding of the HIV\u2010encoded elongation factor (Tat) to the transactivation response element at the start of HIV transcripts. The CDK9/cyclin T1 complex is an important factor for productive elongation of transcription of HIV genomes, and the inhibition of CDK9 can ameliorate HIV\u2010induced disease in animal models 88. In cultured human cells, dominant negative CDK9 mutants impair HIV\u20101 replication 89.Multiple levels of regulation of P\u2010TEFb impact HIV transcription. For example, P\u2010TEFb activity can be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the CDK9 subunit 90, and phosphatases involved in this process have been implicated in regulating HIV transcription 91, 92. HIV Tat targets CDK9/cyclin T1 to transactivation response element to stimulate transcription elongation through P\u2010TEFb\u2010dependent phosphorylation of NELF, DSIF, and Ser2 of pol II CTD 93, 94, 95. Tat competes with HEXIM1 for binding to cyclin T1 to promote the dissociation of P\u2010TEFb from the large inactive complex 96. In order to further stimulate viral gene expression, Tat recruits additional host factors including the human SEC (Fig.\u00a04). SEC contains a set of factors implicated in regulation of pol II transcription elongation, and its core components include the scaffold proteins AFF1 or AFF4, P\u2010TEFb, elongation stimulatory factors ELL1 or ELL2, and transcription factors ENL and AF9 97, 98, 99, 100, 101. The function of the SEC is to stimulate elongation of transcription by increasing the processivity of pol II 98. A recent study established that the AFF1\u2010containing form of the SEC is more potent in supporting HIV\u20101 transactivation than AFF4\u2010SEC 101. The ELL1/ELL2 components of the SEC promote Tat transactivation by suppressing pol II pausing and ELL2 is more effective than ELL1 in Tat transactivation 98.Open in a separate windowFigure 4Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) Transactivator of transcription (Tat) stimulates transcription elongation by recruiting positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb). The HIV\u2010encoded Tat extracts the P\u2010TEFb from the inactive complex containing the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleic particle (7SK snRNP), targets cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and a cyclin T1 to the transactivation response element (TAR) and assembles the super elongation complex (SEC) to activate HIV transcription. P\u2010TEFb triggers productive elongation by phosphorylating negative elongation factor (NELF), DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF), and Ser2 of carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of pol II. LTR, long terminal repeat.The crystal structure of Tat\u2010P\u2010TEFb 102 and the recently published Tat\u2010AFF4\u2010P\u2010TEFb crystal structure\u00a0103 provide insights into the mechanism of Tat activation. Tat interacts with both cyclin T and CDK9 and induces conformational changes in P\u2010TEFb upon binding. These structural studies can help in designing small\u2010molecule compounds that disrupt the Tat\u2010P\u2010TEFb and the Tat\u2010AFF4 interactions to specifically inhibit HIV transcription without affecting normal P\u2010TEFb function. The central role that P\u2010TEFb plays in Tat\u2010dependent activation of latent HIV genomes makes CDK9 an attractive target for the development of novel HIV therapeutics.More P\u2010TEFb please for HTLV\u20101 tooHuman T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) infections cause several human diseases such as adult T\u2010cell leukemia, the neurological disorder HTLV\u20101\u2010associated myelopathy, and uveitis 104, 105, 106, 107. HTLV encodes a transcriptional transactivator protein called Tax, which functions as an activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter 108, 109. Similarly to HIV\u20101 Tat, HTLV\u20101 Tax influences transcription by pol II 110. P\u2010TEFb is essential for Tax transactivation in vivo and in vitro, and siRNA treatment to CDK9 and the CDK9 inhibitor flavopiridol both inhibit transactivation by Tax 110. In vitro binding studies demonstrate that Tax competes with Brd4 for P\u2010TEFb binding through direct interaction with cyclin T1. In addition, Tax overexpression decreases the amount of 7SK snRNA associated with P\u2010TEFb and specifically stimulates Ser2 phosphorylation of the pol II CTD 111. These events give rise to a functional Tax/P\u2010TEFb complex for viral LTR activation (Fig.\u00a05). As Brd4 competes with Tax for P\u2010TEFb, LTR promoter activity is higher in HTLV\u20101\u2010transformed Brd4\u2010deficient cells 112. Interestingly, a recent study showed that in common with HIV\u20101 Tat transactivation, the ELL component of the pol II SEC is essential for Tax\u2010mediated transactivation. Tax enhances ELL incorporation into the histone acetyltransferase p300 and P\u2010TEFb transcriptional complexes. Depletion of ELL using an shRNA\u2010mediated approach abrogates Tax transactivation 113. Thus, the HTLV\u20101 virus uses similar strategies to HIV\u20101 to hijack cellular P\u2010TEFb.Open in a separate windowFigure 5A dual function for Tax in modulating positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb) activity. Human T\u2010lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV\u20101) transcriptional transactivator protein Tax disrupts the inactive 7SK snRNA/HEXIM1/P\u2010TEFb complex to create a novel Tax/P\u2010TEFb complex. Tax also acts as an antagonist of bromodomain\u2010containing the protein 4 (Brd4) and competes with Brd4 for interaction with P\u2010TEFb. The active Tax/P\u2010TEFb complex facilitates the phosphorylation of Ser2 of pol II carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) and enhances the activation of the HTLV\u20101 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter.Inhibiting CDK9 blocks adenovirus replicationHuman adenovirus (HAdV) is a double\u2010stranded DNA virus that causes upper and lower respiratory infections 114. The adenovirus large E1A (L\u2010E1A) protein is a transcriptional activator that functions through the action of an activation domain named \u201cconserved region 3\u201d (CR3). CR3 has been shown to recruit cellular transcription factors including mediator subunit 23 (Med23) 115, 116. Recent proteomic analysis in human cells infected with HAdv5 revealed that L\u2010E1A is associated with many subunits of the mammalian mediator complex 117. Interestingly, the presence of mediator subunits in the L\u2010E1A protein complex is greatly reduced in cells depleted of Med23, suggesting that Med23 links the transactivation domain CR3 with the mediator complex. The proteomic analysis also revealed that L\u2010E1A is associated with super elongation complex components, such as CDK9, cyclin T1, AFF4, ELL, and EAF. The catalytic constituent of the SEC, CDK9, was shown to be critical for the transcription of HAdv5 early genes by L\u2010E1A and HAdv5 replication 117. Interestingly, a newly developed CDK9 inhibitor, FIT\u2010039 (N\u2010[5\u2010fluoro\u20102\u2010(1\u2010piperidinyl)phenyl]isonicotinthioamide), suppresses HAdV replication 118. This further suggests that HAdV hijacks P\u2010TEFb activity for viral\u2010specific transcription.P\u2010TEFb influences influenzaThe best\u2010studied member of the orthomyxovirus RNA virus family is the influenza A virus, which is responsible for acute respiratory diseases in humans. After infection with influenza A, viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerases (vRNPs) are transported to the nucleus, where viral transcription takes place. vRNPs associate with the promoter region of protein\u2010coding genes with lower levels in the regions downstream of the promoter 119. This reflects the distribution of pol II in infected cells. In mock\u2010infected and influenza virus\u2010infected cells, there are similar levels of pol II associated with the promoter region of genes. However, in infected cells, there are decreased levels of pol II in coding regions suggesting that influenza virus infection inhibits pol II elongation 120. Zhang et al.\n121 demonstrated that CDK9/cyclin T1 interacts with the vRNP of influenza A virus and facilitates its association with cellular pol II phosphorylated on Ser2 of the CTD. CDK9 interacts with three subunits of influenza virus vRNP, PB1, PB2, and PA, when they are ectopically expressed in cells. Interestingly, in contrast to HIV transcription, the kinase activity of CDK9 is not crucial for influenza virus transcription as overexpression of the dominant negative form of CDK9 does not reduce influenza virus transcription activity. In addition, the CDK9 inhibitor DRB does not affect viral transcription 120. However, siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of cyclin T1 inhibits viral mRNA synthesis and overexpression of cyclin T1 promotes vRNP activity. It was suggested that interaction with P\u2010TEFb facilitates vRNP association with cellular pol II for cap\u2010snatching 121. Thus, P\u2010TEFb, but not its kinase activity, plays an important role in regulating expression of the influenza A virus.P\u2010TEFb co\u2010operates with DENV\u2010C to activate an inflammatory responseDengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito\u2010transmitted RNA virus and is one of the most common infectious pathogens worldwide 122. Viral infection results in dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever, or dengue shock syndrome 123, 124. At present, an effective dengue vaccine or anti\u2010viral drug is not available. A notable issue that impedes dengue vaccine development is the limited understanding of the immunopathology of DENV infection. The DENV single\u2010stranded RNA molecule is about 11\u2009kb in size. It encodes three structural proteins (core protein, non\u2010glycosylated membrane protein, and envelope protein) and seven non\u2010structural proteins 125. DENV infection is associated with increased levels of the inflammatory chemokines IL\u20108, IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and TNF\u2010\u03b2 126, 127, 128. A recent finding has shed new light of the role of P\u2010TEFb in the activation of IL\u20108 gene expression during DENV infection 129. Li et al.\n129 demonstrated that during DENV virus infection, P\u2010TEFb associates with DENV core protein (DENV\u2010C) to induce IL\u20108 expression. DRB treatment or siRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of cyclin T1 prior to DENV infection abolishes the increase of IL\u20108 induction. P\u2010TEFb and DENV\u2010C core protein co\u2010localize in vivo and co\u2010immunoprecipitate in DENV\u2010infected cells, and P\u2010TEFb and DENV core proteins are recruited to the IL\u20108 gene. These findings further implicate the association of P\u2010TEFb with DENV\u2010C in altering host gene expression. The IL\u20108 gene promoter contains sites for the transcriptional activator NF\u2010\u03baB. Interestingly, in DENV\u2010infected cells, the DENV\u2010C protein appears to promote NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010dependent activation only in the presence of P\u2010TEFb 129. The benefit to the virus of activating inflammation is unclear. However, the requirement of P\u2010TEFb association with DENV\u2010C to induce IL\u20108 expression in DENV\u2010infected cells emphasizes the importance of P\u2010TEFb in DENV immunopathogenesis and suggests that P\u2010TEFb could be a valid drug target to treat some of the symptoms of DENV infection.CDK9 inhibitors as anti\u2010viral agentsThe high mutation rate of viruses facilitates the emergence of strains resistant to drugs that target the virus directly, which represents a public health risk 130. In addition to combating viral drug resistance, the alternative strategy of targeting cellular proteins used by viruses increases the potential range of targets and could yield drugs active against several viruses. Given the importance of P\u2010TEFb for the replication of herpesviruses, HIV, HTLV, HAdV, influenza A virus and DENV, CDK9 and cyclin T are obvious potential drug targets. Drugs have already been developed that target P\u2010TEFb for the treatment of disease. For example, CDK9 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human malignancies 131.Given the regulation of CDK9 by viral proteins during HSV, EBV, HCMV, and KSHV infections, the potential use of CDK9 inhibitors as anti\u2010herpesvirus agents is particularly appealing. Acyclovir and its derivatives are effective, widely available, and have greatly reduced the burden of disease. However, the resistance to these drugs is becoming a major public health problem. The growing resistance is due to their frequent use in suppressive therapy and prophylaxis of HSV infection 132. There is therefore a pressing need for the identification of potential herpesvirus drug targets to facilitate the development of the next generation of anti\u2010herpesvirus drug. One of the most selective, non\u2010competitive inhibitors of CDK9 is flavopiridol 133. It was demonstrated that flavopiridol can suppress the replication of HSV, HCMV, HAdV, and HIV 88, 134. In HeLa cells, the anti\u2010HIV activity of CDK9 inhibitors, including flavopiridol, correlates with a dose\u2010dependent loss of the large form of P\u2010TEFb and reduction in HIV\u20101 infectivity. Unfortunately, studies in primary cell cultures indicate that cytotoxicity of the drugs used is a major drawback 135. Interestingly, studies by Salerno et al.\n136 demonstrated that effects of dominant negative CDK9 and flavopiridol are not equivalent. However, the next generation of small pharmacological compounds targeting CDK9 includes some promising anti\u2010HIV therapeutic agents.Roscovitine, a purine\u2010derived CDK inhibitor, inhibits replication of HSV, HCMV, and HIV 137, 138, 139. Roscovitine also reduces tumor size and plasma EBV DNA in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma 140. Unfortunately, these inhibitors affect a wide range of CDKs and often negatively affect cell cycle progression 141. It was recently demonstrated that R22, a novel selective CDK9 inhibitor, possess anti\u2010cytomegaloviral activity 67. In addition, a new CDK9 inhibitor (FIT\u2010039) that exhibits an anti\u2010viral effect on DNA and RNA viruses was identified 118. It was shown to inhibit the replication of DNA viruses such as HSV\u20101, HSV\u20102, HAdV, and HCMV in cultured cells. Furthermore, FIT\u2010039 also suppresses the replication of influenza virus H1N1 and of HIV. Interestingly, FIT\u2010039 has a less significant effect on the cellular transcriptome than flavopiridol, and it does not affect cellular proliferation 118. It is therefore a prospective drug that affects a broad spectrum of viruses. Concluding remarksP\u2010TEFb is an important regulator of cellular processes, and it is functionally integrated into the expression of many human viruses. In particular, the activity of CDK9 is crucial for the course of HSV, HCMV, EBV, HIV, HTLV, HAdV, DENV, and KSHV virus infection.P\u2010TEFb is therefore a key player not only in cellular processes but also in viral biology (Fig.\u00a06). Either by modifying its activity or regulating the amount of active and inactive complexes of P\u2010TEFb and/or physical interaction with components of P\u2010TEFb, viruses have evolved strategies to hijack this key factor via their own regulatory proteins and P\u2010TEFb functions as a central player in virus\u2010host interaction to facilitate the viral replication cycle. Importantly, studies of viruses that use P\u2010TEFb as a specific factor for efficient transcription will also help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling transcription in uninfected cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Positive transcription elongation factor b (P\u2010TEFb) as a master regulator of cellular and viral transcription. In uninfected cells (left panel), the negative elongation factor (NELF) and the DRB sensitivity\u2010inducing factor (DSIF) enhance pol II stalling. Subsequent recruitment of P\u2010TEFb allows phosphorylation of DSIF, NELF, and Ser2 of carboxyl\u2010terminal domain (CTD) of pol II, which leads to productive elongation. In the context of virus\u2010infected cells (right panel), various viral factors affect transcription by modulating or recruiting the activity of P\u2010TEFb. Consequently, the cellular genes are inhibited, whereas the viral genes become activated.
