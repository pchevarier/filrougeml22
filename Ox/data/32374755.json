Among the 49 patients with TPTD, EVLWI (4-day-mean AUC=0.696) and OI (4-day-mean AUC=0.695) were the best predictors. AUCs were 0.789 for OI on day-1, and 0.786 for EVLWI on day-2. In binary regression analysis of patients with TPTD, EVLWI (B=-0.105; Wald=7.294; p=0.007) and OI (B=0.124; Wald=7.435; p=0.006) were independently associated with 28-days-mortality.

IntroductionA reduction in mortality of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; [1]) has been shown for low-tidal volume ventilation [2], prone positioning [3\u20135] and in one study on neuro-muscular blocking agents (NMBA) [6]. Two RCTs suggest a potential to improve outcome by ECMO in selected patients [7, 8]. Nevertheless, mortality of ARDS is about 40% [1, 9, 10]. Protracted recognition or even complete non-recognition of ARDS at all contributes to its high mortality [1, 10, 11]. ARDS remains unrecognized in two of three patients at the time of fulfillment of the ARDS criteria [1]. These findings suggest a low acceptance and/or sensitivity of the current definition.ARDS is a syndromic disease without a sensitive and specific diagnostic test [12]. About 50 years after the first definition of ARDS and several modifications like the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC; [13]) also the most recent \u201cBerlin-definition\u201d is a matter of debate [14, 15]. AECC- and Berlin-definition are predominantly based on paO2/FiO2 and neglect the impact of pulmonary compliance and other markers on the outcome of ARDS [16].In addition to consensus-definitions several \u201cinformal\u201d scores emerged such as the Murray (Lung Injury Score (LIS); [17]) which is based on predefined categories of paO2/FiO2, PEEP, lung compliance and chest X-ray.The combination of mean airway-pressure (P_maw) with paO2/FiO2 defines the oxygenation-index (OI = P_maw * FiO2 * 100 / paO2). Several studies demonstrated better prognostic capabilities of OI compared to pO2/FiO2 [18\u201320].Furthermore, extravascular lung water index EVLWI has been suggested as ARDS-defining criterion [20\u201326].Sensitive, specific and early diagnosis of ARDS is important to improve timing and allocation to specific interventions such as PP, NMBAs and ECMO [27]. Regarding side effects and resources required, optimized indication of these interventions is of high clinical and socio-economic interest. There is consensus that strategies to improve the effectiveness of ECMO are crucial. These strategies include an optimized patient selection. To optimize timing, a too early intervention in patients not in need for ECMO should be avoided. On the other hand, a protracted initiation of ECMO in a rescue-setting results in poor outcome [28].Only few studies included systematic, repeated and early comparison of the predictive capacities of ARDS-definitions and scores regarding mortality (Table 1).Table 1Summary of studies comparing repeated prediction of outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS.ReferenceSetting; Number of patientsPredictorsEVLWI availableNo. of measurementsMain resultEndpointNo. of daysVillar et al.

No patients fulfilling this criterion were excluded. OI as well as grading according to the AECC- (acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS) and Berlin-definitions (mild, moderate, severe) of ARDS, modified Murray-score without radiological points (Murray_mod) were daily documented for four days after intubation and correlated with 28d-mortality. We did not include the radiological sub-score in the Murray-score, since the use of radiological assessment for the Murray-score has been questioned [34].Irrespectively of the study, 49 patients were equipped with transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) monitoring (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems SE; Feldkirchen, Germany) on the day of intubation. In these patients, EVLWI was documented daily. TPTD using the PiCCO-2-device was performed as described previously [20].Statistics and endpointsThere were two major goals of these analyses:To characterize the best early pulmonary predictor of 28-days-mortality in patients with ARDS.To characterize the best day(s) for early prediction of 28-days-mortality.Primary endpoint: ROC-AUCs (Receiver-operating-characteristic areas under the curve) regarding the prediction of 28-days-mortality by AECC-definition, Berlin-definition, OI, Murray_mod were calculated on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th day after intubation.In the subgroup with TPTD-monitoring, also EVLWI was investigated as potential predictor of 28-days-mortality (ROC-AUCs).Secondary endpoints: Since outcome of patients with ARDS is strongly associated with non-pulmonary organ impairment [35], we also investigated the prediction of 28-days-mortality by APACHE-II and SOFA.To account for interactions and potential independent associations of several predictors with outcome, we performed three binary regression analyses (Wald backward selection) regarding 28days-mortality.Two regression analyses were restricted to the subgroup with TPTD monitoring. This allowed for analysing prediction by EVLWI in addtion to standard ARDS-scores.In a first step, we included OI, Berlin, AECC, Murray_mod and EVLWI.In a second step, we also included the general ICU-scores APACHE-II and SOFA in addition to OI and EVLWI.Prevalence of TPTD-monitoring in about half of the patients allowed to analyse a potential impact of \u201eTPTD-monitoring per se\u201c with 28d-mortality as a major secondary endpoint. Necessarily, this analysis was performed in the totality of patients (49 patients with and 50 patients without TPTD-monitoring). For this analysis, we included APACHE-II, SOFA and TPTD-monitoring.For comparison of baseline or other characteristics between groups, we used the Chi-square-test and the Wilcoxon-test for unpaired samples.Due to the online documentation of all relevant data only few variables were missing due to technical or organizational reasons (e.g. absence from the ICU due to external examinations). In this case statistical tests were performed based on all measurements with valid data.The sample size was calculated based on the assumption of a rate of correct prediction of 67% regarding 28-days mortality. This would require a study population of n=65 to demonstrate a significantly better prediction of the outcome compared to prediction \u201cby chance\u201d (67% vs. 50%) with p <0.05 and a statistical power of 80% (one group; dichotomous primary endpoint).Assuming a drop-out rate (deaths, transfer within the first days) of 33% until day-4, n=100 patients were included.All statistical anlyses were performed using IBM SPSS 26. ResultsPatients\u00b4 characteristicsDue to early transfer to another hospital and early discharge, for one patient final information on 28-d mortality was missing. Therefore, 99 complete data sets were finally analyzed.Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics on day 1 are shown in Table 2. 40.4% of the patients suffered from primary, 59.6% from secondary ARDS.

The mean ROC-AUC over four days (AUC=0.604) was substantially smaller for the Berlin-definition than for EVLWI and OI.Murray_mod was predictive only on day-2 (AUC=0.675; p=0.049). The mean ROC-AUC (AUC=0.624) for Murray_mod was slightly larger than for the Berlin-definition.The AECC-definition did not predict 28-days-mortality on any day and provided the smallest mean ROC-AUC (AUC=0.585).Regarding the timing of prognosis, as for the totality of patients, the best prediction of 28-days-mortality was found on day-1 (mean AUC=0.703) and day-2 (mean AUC=0.705; Table 5; Fig 5).Multivariate analysis including ARDS-scores and EVLWIIn binary regression analysis regarding 28-days-mortality including OI, Berlin, AECC, Murray_mod and EVLWI, only EVLWI (p=0.007) and OI (p=0.006) were independently associated with 28-days-mortality.The B- (-0.105 and -0.124), Wald- (7.294 and 7.435) and p-values (p=0.007 and p=0.006) in the regression equation were similar for EVLWI and OI. This implicates that both parameters had a similar impact and similar absolute values in the model. These findings suggests that simple addition (OI+EVLWI) or multiplication (OI*EVLWI) could provide similar predictive capacities as the more complex model (prediction formula: 2.917-0.124*OI-0.105*EVLWI).As shown in Fig 5 the complete regression formula as well as the simplified formulas EVLWI+OI and EVLWI*OI outscored all ARDS-scores and single parameters on all four days.The best day to predict 28-days-mortality by the combination of EVLWI and OI was day-2 with ROC-AUCs of up to 0.824.A cut-off of 19 for the sum of EVLWI (mL/kg)772 + OI (cmH2O/mmHg) on day-2 provided a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 79% to predict 28-days-mortality.As for the totality of patients, SOFA better predicted mortality compared to APACHE-II. The largest AUCs for SOFA and APACHE-II were found on day-2 (SOFA: AUC=0.775; APACHE-II: AUC=0.614). However, the AUCs on day-2 were smaller than for the combinations of EVLWI and OI (0.822-0.824; Fig 5; Table 5).For validation, we re-analyzed an independent dataset from a previous study [20]. This analysis demonstrated significant and comparable ROC-AUCs for \u201eOI+EVLWI\u201c (day-1: AUC=0.676; p=0.046; day-3: AUC=0.772; p=0.002; Fig 6) and the more complex \u201eOI and EVLWI-model\u201c (day-1: AUC=0.686; p=0.036; day-3: AUC=0.789; p=0.001).Open in a separate windowFig 6Validation-study (dataset (n=50) from reference [20]): ROC-AUC regarding mortality.The models OI_and_EVLWI were calculated from the regression formula derived from this study (evaluation study). OI: oxygenation index; EVLWI: Extra-vascular Lung Water Index. AUC: area under the curve.Prediction of mortality: Combination of SOFA with EVLWI and OIIn the next step, we performed binary regression analysis regarding 28-days-mortality including SOFA-, APACHE-II-score, OI and EVLWI. While APACHE-II did not independently predict 28d-mortality, EVLWI (p=0.018), OI (p=0.022) and SOFA (p=0.015) were independent predictors of 28-days-mortality.Finally, univariate comparison of patients with and without PiCCO-monitoring showed a trend to lower mortality in patients with PiCCO-monitoring (16/49 (33%) vs. 24/50 (48%); p=0.12) despite a trend to a higher baseline-SOFA-score (11.45\u00b14.58 vs. 9.76\u00b14.24; p=0.070).In binary regression analysis including \u201cuse of PiCCO-monitoring\u201d, SOFA and APACHE-II, only \u201cuse of PiCCO-monitoring\u201d (p=0.007) and lower SOFA-score (p<0.001) were independently associated with a lower 28-days-mortality. DiscussionProtracted or even non-recognititon of ARDS contributes to its high mortalitiy. This might be due to low nurse-to-patient ratios, low physician-to-patient ratios, older patient age, higher paO2/FiO2 ratio, and the absence of of pneumonia or pancreatitis. In a recent trial, all these factors were independently associated with higher probability of non-recognition of ARDS [1]. However, early recognition and grading of ARDS is crucial, since the effectiveness of several therapeutic measures depends on their early initiation [2, 4, 6, 10, 36]. This also applies to ECMO [28, 37].Our analyses regarding timing and predictors of 28-days-mortality showed the following results:OI better predicts 28-days-mortality compared to Berlin-definition, AECC and Murray_mod.The best predictive capacities were found within the first two days after intubation.EVLWI is a strong and independent predictor of 28-days-mortality.The combination of EVLWI and OI further increases the predictive capacities of each parameter alone. \u201eOI+EVLWI\u201c provides larger ROC-AUCs than SOFA and APACHE-II on the first two days.SOFA better predicted 28-days-mortality than APACHE-II.EVLWI, OI and SOFA were independently associated with 28-days-mortality.Furthermore, TPTD-monitoring was independently associated with a lower 28-days-mortality.Similar to previous studies, we found poor prognostic capacities of predictors mainly based on paO2/FiO2. The predictive capacities of the Berlin-definition were poor even in the primary validation-study: the ROC-AUC was only slightly better compared to the AECC-definition (AUC 0.577 vs. 0.536) and below the minimum threshold of 0.6 [33]. Limited predictive capacities of AECC, Berlin and paO2/FiO2 were found in numerous more recent trials [32, 38\u201341].Also the Murray/LIS-score is strongly driven by paO2/FiO2. It includes four categories of paO2/FiO2, PEEP, compliance and radiological findings. Among these four parameters, only paO2/FiO2 and PEEP were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors in a recent study [34].Several reasons for the poor performance of paO2/FiO2, AECC, Berlin and Murray need to be discussed. The cut-offs of 100, 175, 200, 225 and 300mmHg used in these scores are arbitrary and poorly validated. Furthermore, paO2/FiO2 strongly dependends on ventilatory data including PEEP, inspiration/exspiration-ratio, driving-pressure and even FiO2 itself. Inclusion of minimum (Berlin) or categorized (Murray; [17] information of PEEP did not substantially improve prediction compared to AECC. Finally, all three scores do not account for the non-linear relationship of paO2 and FiO2: As shown by Allardet-Servent and co-workers [42], paO2/FiO2 strongly increases with higher values of FiO2 [42].The strong performance of OI in our study is in line with several previous studies [19, 30, 32, 38, 43\u201346]. Incorporation of P_maw includes substantial additional information, since P_maw in addition to paO2/FiO2 reflects PEEP, inspiration/expiration-ratio, peak-pressure, delta-pressure and ventilation-mode (assisted vs. controlled). The strong improvement of prediction by inclusion of P_maw is further emphasized by the strong performance of the oxygenation saturation index [47] in several recent studies [38, 48\u201350]. OSI replaces paO2 by percutaneous oxygen saturation:\nOSI=100*P_maw*FiO2/SaO2Best prediction of outcome on day-2 in our study is in line with some [30, 31, 41], but not all of the few studies performing sequential prediction of mortality in ARDS. The study by Balzer et al. [32] analyzed prediction of mortality on day-1 to day-7 in 442 patients. It showed increasing predictive capacities from day-1 to day-3 and comparable ROC-AUCs from day-3 to day-7. However, two thirds of the patients extracted from a seven-year-database had been transferred from other hospitals, and 58% were treated with extracorporeal lung-assist after transfer. Both, transfer with previous ventilation and extracorporeal lung-support might have influenced the best time of prediction.The strong performance of EVLWI in our study is supported by previous data, since EVLWI has been associated with mortality in numerous studies [20, 25, 51\u201356].Some of these studies also demonstrated independent association of EVLWI with mortality in addition to APACHE-II [20], SOFA [55, 57] and SAPS [56]. Interestingly, in the studies by Mallat [57] and Craig [55], EVLWI and SOFA had similar odds ratios in the multivariate analyses. These data suggest a similar impact in a combined model which supports our finding that EVLWI, OI and SOFA were independently and to similar degree associated with 28-days-mortality.While the combination of OI and EVLWI might be usefull for selection of patients for ECMO, SOFA might be used as an exclusion criterion for ECMO: Several ECMO registries and EOLIA suggest that even early ECMO does not improve outcome in patients with high SOFA-scores [3, 8, 58\u201361].Finally, the finding that the early use of TPTD-monitoring \u201eper se\u201c independently reduced mortality in patients with ARDS is of high interest.As expected according to the local standard, patients with PiCCO-monitoring available within 24h after intubation showed a trend to more severe organ impairment (mean SOFA 11.45 vs. 9.76; p=0.070).A recent study suggests increases in mortality of about 7% for each SOFA-point [62]. Accordingly, mortality should be about 13% higher in our patients with PiCCO-monitoring. However, it was 15% lower (33% vs. 48%). This reduction of the predicted mortality-difference by 28% by advanced monitoring \u201cper se\u201d should be interpreted with caution, although these findings are in line with previous studies suggesting potentially beneficial effects of PiCCO-monitoring with [63\u201367] and without [68, 69] pre-defined algorithms. Similar to our study, a RCT in patients with ARDS and septic shock demonstrated a comparable mortality between groups despite a 17% percent higher predicted mortality according to SOFA and APACHE-II in the PiCCO-group compared to the controls [65, 66].Strengths and practical applicationsThis is one of few studies comparing daily prediction of mortality in ARDS by AECC, Berlin, Murray/LIS and OI over four days after intubation. Availability of TPTD-monitoring in about 50% of the patients allowed for comparing these predictors to EVLWI in a substantial subgroup, and for analyzing the impact of PiCCO-monitoring per se.The usefulness of EVLWI and OI could be validated in an independent validation group.LimitationsEvaluation and validation were performed in a single center. TPTD-data were obtained in only half of the patients. Furthermore, prediction of a high mortality with high sensitvity and specifity by a single or few parameters in a mono-centric cohort rarely justifies limitation of therapy in an individual patient. However, in addition to a practical use (better allocation to different treatment options; in particular allocation of patients \u201eat need\u201c to limited ressources) predictors help to compare patient populations in studies or and audits.Another limitation is our \u201epragmatic\u201c approach with crossover\u2013comparison of several predictors of 28-days on four different days. This might induce a kind of \u201eimmortality bias\u201c: Since a substantial number of patients died or was transferred within the first three days, the basis of observation and the number of patients analysed on day-4 were different from day-1. From a statistician\u00b4s viewpoint, one could overcome this problem by a limitation of the anaylsis to patients surviving at least to day-5. However, this would eliminate half of the non-survivors (20 out 40) who died within the first four days. Regarding better allocation of patients to early treatment options such as ECMO, this approach would eliminate the most interesting subgroup of our study. On the other hand, this approach would focus on predictors of late mortality. Ex-post analyses of this study demonstrate that the SOFA-score best predicted late mortality, whereas P/F-ratio, AECC- and Berlin-definition and modified Murray-score were poor predictors (data not shown). Next to SOFA-score, the largest AUCs to predict death after day-4 were provided by Oxygenation-Index (AUC=0.700; p=0.008) on day-1, and by EVLWI on day-2 (AUC0.751; p=0.010) in the subgroup of patients with PiCCO-monitoring. ConclusionsPrognosis of ARDS-patients can be established within the first two days after intubation.EVLWI, OI and SOFA were the best predictors. Similar cut-offs and numerical values facilitate their use in simple models resulting from addition of the raw values.TPTD-monitoring \u201eper se\u201c was independently associated with reduced mortality.
