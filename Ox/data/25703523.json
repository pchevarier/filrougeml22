IntroductionThe term \u201cepigenome\u201d\ndescribes the array of chemical\nmodifications on DNA and histone proteins that dynamically regulate\ngene expression.1 The complex set of reversible\npost-translational modifications (PTMs) that decorate histones ultimately\ndetermines the overall state of chromatin, giving rise to the so-called\n\u201chistone code\u201d, a cellular language involving specific\nproteins that introduce (writers), remove (erasers), or recognize\n(readers) PTMs.2 \u03b5-N-acetylation\nof lysine residues is a widespread post-translational mark,3 deposited on proteins throughout the entire proteome\nby lysine acetyl transferases (KATs), removed by lysine deacetylases\n(KDACs), and recognized by evolutionary conserved protein modules\nsuch as bromodomains4 (named after the Drosophila melanogasterbrahma gene5) as well as the more recently discovered YEATS\ndomains.6 The human proteome encodes 61\nbromodomains (BRDs) found on 42 diverse proteins, including histone\nacetyl transferases (HATs) and HAT-associated proteins such as GCN5,\nPCAF, and bromodomain 9 (BRD9),7,8 transcriptional coactivators\nsuch as the TAF and TRIM/TIF proteins,9,10 ATP-dependent\nchromatin remodeling complexes such as BAZ1B,11 helicases such as SMARCA,12 nuclear scaffolding\nproteins such as the polybromo PB113 as\nwell as transcriptional regulators, such as the bromo and extra terminal\n(BET) proteins.14 The family of human BRD\nmodules has almost been completely structurally characterized resulting\nin a recent classification of eight distinct structural subfamilies.15The BET subfamily of BRDs has attracted\na lot of attention, as\nits members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and the testis specific BRDT) play\na central role in cell cycle progression, cellular proliferation,\nand apoptosis.16 BETs contain two N-terminal\nBRD modules that interact with acetylated histones,15 transcription factors17,18 or other acetylated\ntranscriptional regulators,19,20 an extra terminal (ET)\nrecruitment domain,21 and a C-terminal\nmotif (in the case of BRD4 and BRDT) responsible for the recruitment\nof the positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb),22 ultimately controlling transcriptional elongation.\nImportantly, BET BRDs have been successfully targeted by small molecule\ninhibitors, such as the triazolothienodiazepine (+)-JQ123 and the triazolobenzodiazepine IBET762,24 which were identified employing phenotypic screening\nand have in the past few years consolidated the emerging role of BRDs\nas viable therapeutic targets. Indeed, BET inhibition suppresses tumor\ngrowth in diverse mouse models of cancer, such as NUT midline carcinoma,\nacute myeloid and mixed lineage leukemia, multiple myeloma, glioblastoma,\nmelanoma, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, neuroblastoma and prostate cancer,\nleading to a number of clinical trials seeking to modulate BET function\nin diverse tumor settings.25The\ninitial success targeting BET proteins and the availability\nof robust recombinant systems of expression as well as biophysical\nassays to probe BET\u2013ligand interactions have spawned a number\nof medicinal chemistry efforts seeking to identify novel scaffolds\nthat can block binding of acetylated lysines to these protein interaction\nmodules. Phenotypic screening, molecular docking, and fragment-based\napproaches have emerged as successful tools for discovering other\nKac mimetics, leading to the identification of a number of new chemotypes,\nincluding 3,4-dimethylisoxazoles,26,27 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolinones,28 indolizinethanones, N-phenylacetamides,\nand N-acety-2-methyltetrahydroquinolines29 triazolopyrimidines, methylquinoline, and chloropyridones,30 thiazolidinones,31 4-acylpyrroles,32 and triazolophtalazines33 (summerized in Chart 1). Starting from fragment hits, highly potent and selective BET inhibitors\nhave also emerged,34,35 suggesting that it is possible\nto access new chemical space for inhibitor development via initial\nfragment screening. Druggability analysis based on the available structural\ninformation36 suggests that it is possible\nto target most BRD structural classes.15 In fact, BRDs annotated as \u201chard\u201d to target, such\nas BAZ2B, have recently been successfully targeted by highly selective\nand potent inhibitors37 and fragment based\napproaches have now yielded chemotypes targeting BRDs outside the\nBET family, including CREBBP/p300,38 ATAD2,39,40 BAZ2B,41 and BRPF1.42Open in a separate windowChart 1Acetyllysine Mimetic Templates Reported To Bind to\nBromodomain ProteinsaaThe Kac mimetic\nportion of\neach substructure is highlighted in red. (a) 3,4-Dimethylisoxazole;\n(b) 3-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolinone; (c) indolizinethanone; (d) N-phenylacetamide; (e) N-acetyl-2-methyltetrahydroquinoline;\n(f) triazolopyrimidine; (g) methylquinoline; (h) chloropyridone; (i)\nthiazolidinone; (j) 4-acylpyrrole; (k) triazolophtalazine; (l) methyltriazoles.An unexpected but interesting finding that recently\nattracted attention\nwas the identification of clinically approved kinase inhibitors and\ntool compounds that exhibited binding with high affinity, and selectivity\nacross the human BRD family, to BET BRDs.43 Crystal structures with the first bromodomain of BRD4 revealed acetyllysine\nmimetic binding of the PLK inhibitor BI-2536 and the JAK inhibitor\nfedratinib without any significant distortion of the inhibitors when\ncompared to kinase complexes, suggesting the potential to develop\npolypharmacology targeting both BRD and kinases at the same time.43 Interestingly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor\ndinaciclib was also identified as a binder of BRD4,44 suggesting that other inhibitor classes might be good starting\npoints for developing inhibitors for BRDs.In light of the successful\nfragment-based programs and the reliability\nfor discovering BRDs inhibitors, we started to investigate the purine\nscaffold as a putative Kac mimetic. Purine is a privileged chemical\ntemplate, as it is one of the most abundant N-based heterocycles in\nnature,45 and a number of purine-based\ndrugs are currently approved and used for the treatment of cancer\n(6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine), viral infections such as AIDS and\nherpes (carbovir, abacavir, acyclovir, ganciclovir), hairy cell leukemia\n(cladribine), and organ rejection (azathioprine).46 Moreover, purine based compounds have emerged as reliable\nchemical\u2013biology tools, since they can interact with a variety\nof biological targets involved in a number of diseases. Some such\nexamples include their activity as microtubule (myoseverin), 90-heat\nshock protein (PU3), sulfotransferase (NG38), adenosine receptor (KW-6002),\nand cyclin-dependent kinase (olomoucine, Figure \u200bFigure1A;1A; roscovitine) inhibitors.47,48Open in a separate windowFigure 1Purine fragments bind\nto human bromodomains.

PDB code 4MEN was used as the\nstarting model for docking. (E) Docking of compound 2a positions the 2-amine-9H-purine ring system of\nthe ligand within the Kac cavity, sterically packing between V87 and\nI146, suggesting that this scaffold topology can be further utilized\nto target bromodomains. The same color scheme as in (C) and (D) is\nused with the ligand shown as orange sticks. PDB code 4MEN was used as the\nstarting model for docking. (F) Fragments were tested in a thermal\nshift assay against bromodomains of the BET subfamily as well as representative\nmembers from other families. Thermal shifts are color-coded as indicated\nin the inset. 9H-Purines showed weak binding across\nthe panel.Computational analyses followed\nby in vitro evaluation of purine-based\nfragments identified this scaffold as a novel effective Kac mimetic.\nInterestingly, initial purine fragment hits also demonstrated affinity\noutside the BET subfamily of BRDs, toward the less explored BRDs of\nPB1, CREBBP, and BRD9. To our knowledge, the only known BRD9 inhibitors\ntoday show cross-reactivity toward BET BRDs and CREBBP employing a\ntriazolophthalazine template.33 The precise\nbiological function of BRD9 remains elusive, although it has been\nidentified as a component of the SWI/SNF complex49 and has been associated with a number of different cancer\ntypes, including non-small-cell lung cancer,50 cervical,51 and hepatocellular carcinoma.52 Notably, its BRD reader module has been frequently\nfound mutated in lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma,\nand uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.53\u221255We chose\na small purine fragment, compound 2a (Chart 2), from our fragment hits for structural optimization\nand found that some of its 6-aryl derivatives exhibited nanomolar\naffinity toward BRD9, with lower activity toward BRD4. Importantly,\nthe developed inhibitors induced an appreciable change in the three-dimensional\nshape of the receptor binding cavity, indicating that their binding\noccurs through an \u201cinduced-fit\u201d mechanism.56 Previously an induced fit binding was observed\nwhen a dihydroquinoxalinone was shown to insert under an arginine\nresidue of the CREBBP BRD, resulting in restructuring of the Kac binding\nsite of this bromodomain.57 In our case\nthe rearrangement of the binding site of BRD9 was more extensive,\nwith several side chains rotating and shifting to accommodate the\nsmall purine ligand. The optimized compound 11 (Chart 2) exhibited nanomolar affinity for BRD9 with weaker\nmicromolar affinity for BRD4 in vitro, displaced the BRD9 BRD from\nchromatin without affecting BRD4 binding to histones, and did not\nshow any cytotoxicity toward human embryonic kidney cells. Our work\nestablishes the proof-of-concept of using 2-amino-9H-purines as a starting point to develop Kac mimetic compounds targeting\nBRDs outside the BET family, with compound 11 representing\na promising low nanomolar starting point toward the discovery of selective\nBRD9 ligands to be used as chemical probes for deep biological and\npharmacological investigation of BRD9.Open in a separate windowChart 2Chemical Structures\nof Compounds 1\u201311 Experimental DetailsInput\nFiles Preparation for DockingProtein 3D models\nof BRD4 (first bromodomain, PDB code 4MEN(30)) and BRD9\n(apo form, PDB code 3HME(15)) were prepared using the Schr\u00f6dinger\nProtein Preparation Wizard workflow (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New\nYork, NY, 2013). Briefly, water molecules that were found 5 \u00c5\nor more away from heteroatom groups were removed and cap termini were\nincluded. Additionally, all hydrogen atoms were added, and bond orders\nwere assigned. The resulting PDB files were converted to the MAE format.\nChemical structures of investigated compounds were built with Maestro\u2019s\nBuild Panel (version 9.6; Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2013)\nand subsequently processed with LigPrep (version 2.8; Schr\u00f6dinger,\nLLC, New York, NY, 2013) in order to generate all the possible stereoisomers,\ntautomers, and protonation states at a pH of 7.4 \u00b1 1.0; the resulting\nligands were finally minimized employing the OPLS 2005 force field.Induced Fit DockingBinding sites for the initial Glide58\u221260 (version 6.1, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2013) docking\nphases of the Induced Fit Workflow (Induced Fit Docking protocol 2013-3,\nGlide version 6.1, Prime version 3.4, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New\nYork, NY, 2013)61,62 were calculated on the BRD4(1)\nand BRD9 structures, considering the centroid of the cocrystallized\nligand (N,5-dimethyl-N-(4-methylbenzyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine for BRD4(1), from PDB code 4MEN), or cocrystallized\nligand 7d (from the BRD9/7d complex), or\nTyr106 (for BRD9, PDB code 3HME) for grid generation. In all cases, cubic inner boxes\nwith dimensions of 10 \u00c5 were applied to the proteins, and outer\nboxes were automatically detected. Ring conformations of the investigated\ncompounds were sampled using an energy window of 2.5 kcal/mol; conformations\nfeaturing nonplanar conformations of amide bonds were penalized. Side\nchains of residues close to the docking outputs (within 8.0 \u00c5\nof ligand poses) were reoriented using Prime (version 3.4, Schr\u00f6dinger,\nLLC, New York, NY, 2013), and ligands were redocked into their corresponding\nlow energy protein structures (Glide Standard Precision Mode), considering\ninner boxes dimensions of 5.0 \u00c5 (outer boxes automatically detected),\nwith resulting complexes ranked according to GlideScore.Rigid DockingCalculations were performed using the\nGlide software package (SP mode, version 6.1, Schr\u00f6dinger package)58\u221260 in order to determine the binding mode of compound 11 into the acetyllysine cavity of BRD9. First the receptor grid was\ngenerated focused on the BRD9 binding site taking as a reference structure\nthe experimentally determined complex structure of compound 7d with BRD9, with inner- and outer-box dimensions of 10 \u00d7\n10 \u00d7 10 and 21.71 \u00d7 21.71 \u00d7 21.71, respectively. Standard\nPrecision (SP) Glide mode was employed accounting for compound flexibility\nin the sampling of compound 11. The sampling step was\nset to expanded sampling mode (4 times), keeping 10\u202f000 ligand\nposes for the initial phase of docking, followed by 800 ligand poses\nselection for energy minimization. A maximum number of 50 output structures\nwere saved for each ligand, with a scaling factor of 0.8 related to\nvan der Waals radii with a partial charge cutoff of 0.15. A postdocking\noptimization of the obtained docking outputs was performed, accounting\nfor a maximum of 50 poses based on a 0.5 kcal/mol rejection cutoff\nfor the obtained minimized poses.General Synthetic InformationAll commercially available\nstarting materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used\nas received.

A solution of NaNO2 (48.3 mg, 0.7 mmol) in H2O (200 \u03bcL) was added dropwise,\nand the release of nitrogen gas was immediately observed. The reaction\nmixture was then stirred at \u221210 \u00b0C for 2 h, and urea (24.0\nmg, 0.4 mmol) was added to decompose the excess of NaNO2. The mixture was then stirred at 50 \u00b0C for 1 h and neutralized\nwith 50% NaOH solution, diluted with water, and extracted three times\nwith EtOAc. The combined organic layers were dried with anhydrous\nNa2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The crude\nmixture was purified by semipreparative reversed-phase HPLC to get\nthe pure products in good yields (47\u201363%).

Compounds were added at a final concentration of 10 or 100\n\u03bcM. SYPRO Orange (Molecular Probes) was added as a fluorescence\nprobe at a dilution of 1 in 1000. Excitation and emission filters\nfor the SYPRO-Orange dye were set to 465 and 590 nm, respectively.\nThe temperature was raised with a step of 3 \u00b0C per minute from\n25 to 96 \u00b0C, and fluorescence readings were taken at each interval.\nThe temperature dependence of the fluorescence during the protein\ndenaturation process was approximated by the equationwhere \u0394uG is the difference in unfolding\nfree energy between the folded and unfolded state, R is the gas constant, and yF and yU are the fluorescence intensity of the probe\nin the presence of completely folded and unfolded protein, respectively.65 The baselines of the denatured and native states\nwere approximated by a linear fit. The observed temperature shifts,\n\u0394Tmobs, were recorded\nas the difference between the transition midpoints of sample and reference\nwells containing protein without ligand in the same plate and determined\nby nonlinear least-squares fit. Temperature shifts (\u0394Tmobs) for three independent measurements\nper proteins/compound are summarized in Supporting\nInformation Table S1.Isothermal Titration CalorimetryExperiments were carried\nout on an ITC200 titration microcalorimeter from MicroCal, LLC (GE\nHealthcare) equipped with a Washing module, with a cell volume of\n0.2003 mL, and a 40 \u03bcL microsyringe. Experiments were carried\nout at 15 \u00b0C while stirring at 1000 rpm, in ITC buffer (50 mM\nHEPES, pH 7.5 (at 25 \u00b0C), 150 mM NaCl). The microsyringe was\nloaded with a solution of the protein sample (300\u2212740 \u03bcM\nprotein for BRD9 and BRD4(1), respectively, in ITC buffer) and was\ncarefully inserted into the calorimetric cell which was filled with\nan amount of the ligand (0.2 mL, 20\u201325 \u03bcM in ITC buffer).\nThe system was first allowed to equilibrate until the cell temperature\nreached 15 \u00b0C, and an additional delay of 60 s was applied. All\ntitrations were conducted using an initial control injection of 0.3\n\u03bcL followed by 38 identical injections of 1 \u03bcL with a\nduration of 2 s (per injection) and a spacing of 120 s between injections.\nThe titration experiments were designed in such a fashion as to ensure\ncomplete saturation of the proteins before the final injection. The\nheat of dilution for the proteins was independent of their concentration\nand corresponded to the heat observed from the last injection, following\nsaturation of ligand binding, thus facilitating the estimation of\nthe baseline of each titration from the last injection. The collected\ndata were corrected for protein heats of dilution (measured on separate\nexperiments by titrating the proteins into ITC buffer) and deconvoluted\nusing the MicroCal Origin software supplied with the instrument to\nyield enthalpies of binding (\u0394H) and binding\nconstants (KB) in the same fashion as\nthat previously described in detail by Wiseman and co-workers.66 Thermodynamic parameters were calculated using\nthe basic equation of thermodynamics (\u0394G =\n\u0394H \u2013 T\u0394S = \u2212RT\u00a0ln\u00a0KB, where \u0394G, \u0394H, and \u0394S are the changes in free energy, enthalpy,\nand entropy of binding, respectively). In all cases a single binding\nsite model was employed, supplied with the MicroCal Origin software\npackage.

Twenty hours post-transfection 2 \u00d7 104 cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and exchanged into\nmedia containing phenol red-free DMEM, 10% FBS in the absence (control\nsample), or the presence (experimental sample) of 100 nM NanoBRET\n618 fluorescent ligand (Promega). Cell density was adjusted to 2 \u00d7\n105 cells/mL and then replated in a 96-well assay white\nplate (Corning Costar no. 3917). At the time of replating compound 7d or 11 were added at a final concentration\nspanning from 0.005 to 33 \u03bcM and the plates were incubated for\n18 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2.

Readings were performed within\n5 min using the CLARIOstar reader (BMG Lifetechnologies) equipped\nwith 450/80 nm bandpass and 610 nm long-pass filters. A corrected\nBRET ratio was calculated and is defined as the ratio of the emission\nat 610 nm/450 nm for experimental samples (i.e., those treated with\nNanoBRET fluorescent ligand) subtracted by and the emission at 610\nnm/450 nm for control samples (not treated with NanoBRET fluorescent).\nBRET ratios are expressed as milliBRET units (mBU), where 1 mBU corresponds\nto the corrected BRET ratio multiplied by 1000.Confocal ImagingHEK293 cells were transfected with\nhistone H3.3-HaloTag using FuGENE HD (Promega). Twenty-four hours\npost-transfection cells were labeled with 5 \u03bcM HaloTag TMR ligand\n(Promega) in complete medium (DMEM and 10% FBS) for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C\nand 5% CO2. Medium containing HaloTag-TMR ligand was then\nwashed twice with fresh complete medium. Cells were placed back at\n37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 30 min and then imaged. Images\nwere acquired on an Olympus Fluoview FV500 confocal microscope (Olympus,\nCenter Valley, PA, USA) containing a 37 \u00b0C and CO2 environmental chamber (Solent Scientific Ltd., Segensworth, U.K.)\nusing appropriate filter sets.In Vitro CytotoxicityFollowing NanoBRET substrate\naddition and NanoBRET measurements, to the same wells an equal volume\nof CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and the plates were incubated\nfor 30 min at room temperature. Total luminescence was measured, and\nrelative compound toxicity was determined by comparing the RLUs (relative\nlight units) of a sample containing DMSO vehicle (in the absence of\ncompound 11) to the RLUs of the samples containing 0.005\u201333\n\u03bcM compound 11.CrystallizationAliquots of the purified proteins were\nset up for crystallization using a mosquito crystallization robot\n(TTP Labtech, Royston, U.K.). Coarse screens were typically set up\nonto Greiner 3-well plates using three different drop ratios of precipitant\nto protein per condition (100 + 50 nL, 75 + 75 nL, and 50 + 100 nL).\nInitial hits were optimized further scaling up the drop sizes. All\ncrystallizations were carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion\nmethod at 4 \u00b0C. BRD9 crystals with 7d were grown\nby mixing 150 nL of the protein (17.9 mg/mL and 2 mM final ligand\nconcentration) with 150 nL of reservoir solution containing 0.20 M\nsodium bromate, 0.1 M BT-propane, pH 7.5, 20% PEG3350, and 10% ethylene\nglycol. BRD4(1) crystals with 7d were grown by mixing\n200 nL of protein (12 mg/mL and 2 mM final ligand concentration) with\n100 nL of reservoir solution containing 0.2 M sodium nitrate, 20%\nPEG3350, and 10% ethylene glycol. BRD4(1) crystals with 11 were grown by mixing 150 nL of protein (8.25 mg/mL and 2 mM final\nligand concentration) with 150 nL of reservoir solution containing\n0.1 M bis-tris-propane, pH 8.5, 20% PEG3350, and 10% ethylene glycol.\nIn all cases diffraction quality crystals grew within a few days.Data Collection and Structure SolutionAll crystals\nwere cryoprotected using the well solution supplemented with additional\nethylene glycol and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were\ncollected in-house on a Rigaku FRE rotating anode system equipped\nwith a RAXIS-IV detector at 1.52 \u00c5 (BRD9/7d) or\non a Bruker MicroStar equipped with an APEX II detector at 1.54 \u00c5\n(BRD4(1)/7d and BRD4(1)/11). Indexing and\nintegration were carried out using SAINT (version 8.3, Bruker AXS\nInc., 2013) or MOSFLM67 or XDS,68,69 and scaling was performed with SCALA70 or XPREP (version 2008/2, Bruker AXS Inc.).

Results and DiscussionIn order to assess the binding of\npurine fragments on human BRDs,\nwe first performed molecular docking experiments employing the previously\ndetermined crystal structure of the complex of BRD4(1) with a 5-methyltriazolopyrimidine\nligand (PDB code 4MEN(30)). To this end we investigated binding\nof purine fragments 1, 2a, and 2b (Figure \u200b(Figure1B),1B), seeking to determine acetyllysine\ncompetitive binding modes within the BRD cavity with promising predicted\nbinding affinities, ideally establishing favorable interactions with\nresidues implicated in acetyllysine peptide recognition. In order\nto account for putative conformational changes of the receptor\u2019s\nbinding site cavity upon ligand binding, we employed the Induced Fit\ndocking protocol61,62 (as implemented in the Schr\u00f6dinger\nsoftware package). Molecular modeling resulted in good accommodation\nof the investigated purine fragments within the Kac binding site of\nBRD4(1), mainly packing between the ZA-loop hydrophobic residues (Val87,\nLeu92, Leu94) and Ile146 from helix C, in a groove that is capped\non one end by Tyr97 and Tyr139 and Trp81 on the other end (Figure \u200b(Figure1C).1C). We observed different conformations of compound 1 within the BRD4(1) cavity, with the two chloro functions\npointing to the top of the pocket (Figure \u200b(Figure1C)1C) or adopting a Kac mimetic pose with one chlorine inserting deep\ninto the pocket (Figure \u200b(Figure1D).1D). Compound 2a was also found in two different states in our calculations,\neither orienting its primary amine function away from the conserved\nasparagine (Asn140, Figure \u200bFigure1E)1E) or directly\nengaging this residue while orienting its 6-Br substituent toward\nthe ZA-loop (Supporting Information Figure\n1A,B). In all cases the ligand poses resulted in promising predicted\nbinding energy values (\u22129.13 kcal/mol for 1, \u22129.95\nkcal/mol for 2a, and \u22129.13 kcal/mol for 2b). We identified in our calculations, in the case of compound 2a, poses that exposed the halogen in position 6 so that the\npurine core scaffold may be further optimized based on its topology\nwithin the BRD binding site. The opposite was true in the case of\nthe 2-Cl substituent or the methyl substituent at N9 (1 or 2b, respectively), which resulted in steric clashes\nand topologies that would not allow for subsequent optimizations.\nTo better understand the binding mode of the purine scaffold to BRDs,\ngiven the multiple docking conformations observed, we decided to systematically\nprobe the topology of these fragments employing synthetic chemistry\nand structure\u2013activity relationships.We purchased 2,6-dichloro-9H-purine 1 and 2-amino-6-bromo-9H-purine 2a and\nsynthesized compound 2b employing a TBAF-assisted N-9\nmethylation on the purine ring of 2a. To confirm binding\nof these fragments to human bromodomains, we employed a thermal shift\nassay (\u0394Tm assay) which we have\npreviously used successfully with fragments and various human bromodomains.23,26,28,76,77 Typically we perform the assay using 100\n\u03bcM compounds in the case of fragments and very weak ligands,\nbut in the case of the purine analogues tested we were surprised to\nsee binding at 10 \u03bcM compound to BET BRDs and in particular\nto BRD4(1); however, the optimized CDK inhibitor olomoucine did not\nshow any significant stabilization toward any proteins in the panel\n(Figure \u200b(Figure1F,1F, Supporting\nInformation Table S1). Encouraged by this result, we tested\nthese compounds at the same concentration against five other diverse\nBRDs in an effort to cover most of the human BRD phylogenetic tree\n(Supporting Information Figure 1C) and\nfound that despite their structural diversity, the BRDs of CREBBP,\nPB1(5), and BRD9 exhibited weak binding. We were particularly intrigued\nby the interaction of 2a with BRD9, since to our knowledge\nonly a small subset of compounds has been previously shown to bind\nto this module.33 To further evaluate binding\nof 2a onto BRD9, we performed docking experiments, using\nthe recently crystallized apo structure of the protein (PDB code 3HME(15)) accounting for the flexibility of key residues after ligand\nbinding.61,62 Similar to our BRD4(1) docking experiment,\nwe obtained two main binding poses for this compound, with the most\nenergetically favored one (predicted binding affinity of \u22129.06\nkcal/mol) exhibiting an extended hydrogen bond network with the conserved\nAsn100 and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions with the ZA-loop Tyr57\nand Tyr106 from helix C, while the 6-Br substituent was found oriented\ntoward the external part of the binding site toward the ZA-loop Phe47,\nsuggesting that modifications on this position for subsequent optimization\nwould not be tolerated without affecting the ligand orientation in\nthe acetyllysine cavity (Supporting Information Figure 1D). Conversely, we observed subtle rearrangement of the\nside chains of Phe44 and Tyr106 accompanied by almost a 90\u00b0 rotation\nof the side chain of Phe47, suggesting an induced-fit binding mode.\nWe also observed an alternative binding pose (predicted binding energy\nof \u22128.62 kcal/mol) in which the ligand maintained the hydrogen\nbond to Asn100, albeit from its primary amine function which inserted\ntoward the conserved asparagine, as well as the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0\ninteraction with Tyr106 from helix C, while orienting the modifiable\n6-Br substituent toward the top of the BRD cavity (Supporting Information Figure 1E), offering a promising vector\nfor subsequent modifications. Using both possible orientations as\nstarting points, we decided to further interrogate how the purine\ncore scaffold binds to this BRD.Encouraged by our initial findings,\nwe synthesized a number of\n2-amino-9H-purine analogues and tested their ability\nto interact with human BRDs, primarily of the BET subfamily (subfamily\nII), while systematically testing binding to representative BRDs from\nother structural subfamilies (family I, PCAF; family III, CREBBP;\nfamily IV, BRD9; family V, BAZ2B; family VIII, PB1(5); see Supporting Information Figure 1C) in order to\nprobe structurally diverse proteins against this core purine scaffold.\nWe utilized an aqueous-phase Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling\nreaction to synthesize 2-amino-6-aryl-9H-purine derivatives,\nyielding highly C-6 decorated 9H-purines in a one-step\nprocedure and performed a subsequent TBAF-assisted N-9 alkylation\nto access N-9 substituted analogues (Scheme 1 and Chart 2). We accomplished the coupling\nstep under microwave irradiation with Pd(OAc)2 and triphenylphosphine-3,3\u2032,3\u2033-trisulfonic\nacid trisodium salt as the catalytic system, with Cs2CO3 as base, in a water\u2013acetonitrile reaction solvent.\nThis approach allowed synthesizing 2-amino-6-aryl-9H-purines with very short reaction times (5\u201315 min) at high\nyields and purity.Open in a separate windowScheme 1General Procedures for the Synthesis of Purine Derivatives:\n(A) Suzuki\u2013Miyaura\nCross-Coupling of Free Halopurines and (B) TBAF-Assisted N-9 Alkylation\non the Purine RingReagents and conditions:\n(a)\nPd(OAc)2/P(C6H4SO3Na)3, Cs2CO3, MeCN/H2O (1:2),\nmicrowaves, 150 \u00b0C, 5\u201315 min; (b) CH3I or CH3COCH2Cl, TBAF, THF, rt, 10 min; (c) 50% H2SO4, NaNO2, \u221210 \u00b0C, 2 h, then 50\n\u00b0C, 1 h.First we introduced a phenyl\nsubstituent at position 6 of the core\npurine scaffold (compound 3a) only to find that BRD2(1),\nBRD4(1), and PCAF were stabilized in thermal melt assays by this compound\n(Figure \u200b(Figure2A,B).2A,B). We confirmed binding to BRD4(1)\nby isothermal titration calorimetry and measured a dissociation constant\nof 11.99 \u03bcM (Figure \u200b(Figure2C2C and Table 1). The interaction of 3a with BRD4(1)\nwas mainly driven by enthalpic contributions (\u0394H = \u22129.45 kcal/mol), opposed by negative entropy (T\u0394S = \u22122.97 kcal/mol). We were also\nintrigued by the lack of affinity toward BRD9 in the \u0394Tm assay, since our initial fragment hit, compound 2a, had exhibited a thermal shift of 1.6 \u00b0C toward that\ndomain. We therefore tested this scaffold by isothermal titration\ncalorimetry against BRD9 and measured a weak dissociation constant\nof 8.5 \u03bcM (Figure \u200b(Figure2D,2D, Table 2) suggesting that our primary assay (\u0394Tm) may not be very robust in the case of BRD9\nwhen applied to weak ligands. This is important, since the first bromodomain\nof BRD4 has been repeatedly shown to bind to weak compounds employing\nthis assay,76 while it has been noted that\nother BRDs do not always exhibit high temperature shifts although\nthey bind to several compounds very potently.37 Additionally, in the case of BET proteins it has been demonstrated\nthat thermal melt data correlate well with in vitro dissociation constants.23 Importantly, similar to the BRD4(1)/3a interaction, the compound interacted with BRD9 mainly driven by\nenthalpic contributions (\u0394H = \u22129.11\nkcal/mol) opposed by negative entropy (T\u0394S = \u22122.42 kcal/mol).Open in a separate windowFigure 2SAR of 9H-purines.

(D) Compounds bearing ortho,meta\u2032 substitutions gain\npotency toward BRD9 as demonstrated by ITC experiments. Data have\nbeen corrected and displayed as described in (C). All ITC titrations\nwere carried out in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (at 25 \u00b0C), 150 mM NaCl,\nand 15 \u00b0C while stirring at 1000 rpm.In order to better explore the structure\u2013activity\nrelationship\nof 6-phenyl substituted 9H-purines, we synthesized\na range of compounds carrying different patterns of functions, including\npara-substitutions (compounds 3b\u2013h), meta,para substitutions (compounds 4a\u2013e), meta,meta\u2032 substitutions (compounds 5a,b), ortho,ortho\u2032 substitutions (compounds 6a\u2013c), and ortho,meta\u2032 substitutions\n(compounds 7a\u2013e) (Figure \u200b(Figure2A2A and Chart 2). We tested\nbinding of these analogues to the eight BET BRDs, as well as the five\nmore diverse BRDs previously mentioned, employing the same thermal\nshift assay as above. Interestingly, compounds synthesized that carried\nan additional methyl modification at N9 (compounds 3c, 3e, 4e, 5b) exhibited very\nweak or no binding toward most BRDs while showing small thermal shits\n(1.0\u20131.3 \u00b0C) for the bromodomain of CREBBP. Para substitution\nof the 6-phenyl-9H-purines (compounds 3b\u2013h) resulted in lower stabilization of all BRDs;\nhowever, compound 3f showed binding toward all BRDs without\nany hints of selectivity toward BRD9. Meta substitutions (compounds 4a\u2013e) were also very weak across BRDs\nwith no affinity for BRD9, suggesting that modifications on that vector\nwere not tolerated. Interestingly meta,meta\u2032 substitution (compound 5a) resulted in binding to most BRDs albeit weak, with \u0394Tm values between 1.1 and 1.8 \u00b0C. As expected,\nthis binding event was abolished when the compound was methylated\nat N9 (compound 5b). Binding was not improved with ortho,ortho\u2032\nsubstitutions of the 6-phenyl 9H-purine scaffold\n(compounds 6a\u2013c) (Figure \u200b(Figure2B2B and Supporting Information\nTable S1). Since methyl substitution at N9 could not be tolerated\nin BRD4(1) or BRD9 binding, we concluded at this stage that the five-membered\nring is probably not oriented toward the top of the BRD cavity but\npoints toward the bottom of the acetyllysine binding cavity, as predicted\nin our docking model (Supporting Information Figure 1A,B), with the 6-substituted position toward the front of\nthe pocket in order to accommodate the larger phenyl-substituted functions.We decided to further test combinations in ortho,meta\u2032 substituted\ncompounds by first maintaining a methoxy functionality at the ortho\nposition while changing the steric bulk at the meta\u2032 position\n(compounds 7a\u2013d). 2-Methoxyphenyl\nsubstitution (compound 7a) yielded thermal shifts between\n1.4 and 2.5 \u00b0C for BET BRDs as well as 1.5 \u00b0C for the BRD\nof CREBBP while significantly stabilizing BRD9 compared to all previous\ncompounds tested (2.9 \u00b0C). We confirmed this binding by ITC and\nmeasured a dissociation constant of 641 nM against BRD9 (Figure \u200b(Figure2D,2D, Table 2). Notably the\nchange in affinity was accompanied by negative entropic contributions\n(T\u0394S = \u22124.55 kcal/mol).\nIntrigued by this step change in affinity, we tested halide analogues\nat the meta\u2032 position while retaining the ortho-methoxy functionality\n(compounds 7b\u2013d) and observed improved\nthermal shifts for all compounds tested against BRD9, while BET affinity\nseemed to be variable. Notably, we observed \u0394Tm values following the order H < F < Cl > Br,\nsuggesting\nthat steric bulk and charge at the meta\u2032 position is important,\nwith compound 7c showing a \u0394Tm of 3.8 \u00b0C against BRD9. We validated binding using ITC\nas an orthogonal method and measured dissociation constants of 351,\n297, and 397 nM against BRD9 following the same ranking as the thermal\nshift assay for compounds 7b, 7c, and 7d, respectively (Figure \u200b(Figure2D,2D, Table 2). Importantly, we observed a gradual increase in\nentropic contributions with increasing bulk of the 5-halide-2-methoxyphenyl\nsubstitution, with compound 7a exhibiting the lowest\nentropic term (T\u0394S = \u22124.55\nkcal/mol) and compound 7d the highest (T\u0394S = \u22121.57 kcal/mol). Interestingly,\nBRD4(1), which exhibited \u0394Tm values\nof 1.1 and 3.2 \u00b0C for compounds 7c and 7d, was found to bind weakly to these scaffolds by ITC, and the dissociation\nconstants that we measured were 2.04 and 4.7 \u03bcM, respectively,\nfollowing again the same trend seen in the thermal melt assay (Figure \u200b(Figure2C,2C, Table 1). Affinity for\nBRD9 was lost when we synthesized compound 7e which carried\na bromine function at the meta\u2032 position and an ethoxy substituent\nat the ortho position, suggesting that the longer and bulkier group\nprobably affects rotation of the 6-aryl ring with respect to the core\n9H-purine-2-amine fold.In order to verify\nthe mode of interaction of the 9H-purine core within\nthe BRD acetyllysine binding cavity, we crystallized\nand determined the complexes of compound 7d with the\nbromodomain of BRD9 and the first bromodomain of BRD4. The ligand\nwas found in both cases to occupy the acetyllysine recognition pocket\n(Figure \u200b(Figure3A3A and Supporting\nInformation Figure 2A) and was clearly defined in the electron\ndensity map (Figure \u200b(Figure3B3B and Supporting Information Figure 2B). Compound 7d directly engaged, via the primary amine function as well as the\nnitrogen at position 3, the conserved asparagine in both structures\n(Asn100 in BRD9; Asn140 in BRD4(1)) and was additionally held in place\nvia a number of hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone and the network\nof conserved water molecules previously described76 (Figure \u200b(Figure3C3C and Supporting Information Figure 2C). Notably, compound 7d initiated hydrogen bonds to a water molecule located on\ntop of the BRD cavity, which in turn linked the ligand to the top\nof the ZA-loop, either to the carbonyl of Ile53 (in the case of BRD9)\nor Asn93 (in the case of BRD4(1)). This tight network of interactions\nexplains the potency of this compound for BRDs. The mode of interaction\nis similar to that observed before for triazolothienodiazepine complexes\nsuch as (+)-JQ1, with the five-membered ring of the purine system\nacting as the acetyllysine mimetic moiety, superimposing well with\nthe methyltriazolo ring of (+)-JQ1 (Supporting\nInformation Figure 2D) while the bromomethoxyphenyl substituent\nof 7d stacks well between the ZA-loop Leu92 and the ZA-channel\u2019s\nPhe81/Pro82 of BRD4(1) (Supporting Information Figure 2E). Consistent with our induced fit computational models\nof binding of 2a to BRD9, superimposition of the BRD9/7d complex to the apo structure of BRD9 (PDB code 3HME)15 revealed rotations of the side chains of Phe47 and Phe44\nwhile the top of the ZA loop collapsed toward the ligand (Figure \u200b(Figure3D,E),3D,E), resulting in an unprecedented induced fit\npocket of BRD9. Particularly the side chain of Phe47 rotated 120\u00b0,\nthus blocking the ZA-channel of the protein resulting in a steric\nbulk around compound 7d. On the basis of our thermodynamic\nmeasurements showing high entropic contributions to binding (Table 2), we concluded that all compounds in this subseries\n(7a\u2013d) should be inducing a rearrangement\nof the binding cavity residues of BRD9 upon binding to the acetyllysine\nsite. Intriguingly as the substituent size increases, the affinity\nalso increases as exemplified by the determined dissociation constants,\nwith the chloro analogue (7c) exhibiting a dissociation\nconstant of 297 nM against BRD9 while the bromo analogue (7d) is slightly weaker (397 nM against BRD9; 4.65 \u03bcM against\nBRD4(1)). However, the structural rearrangement that we observed was\nunique to BRD9; the structure of compound 7d in complex\nwith the first bromodomain of BRD4 did not reveal any rearrangements\nof the acetyllysine binding cavity as the inhibitor packed between\nTrp81 and Leu92 of the ZA-loop (Supporting Information Figure 2D,E). It is tempting to speculate that the observed increase\nin entropic contributions within the series of compounds 7a\u2013d measured by ITC, following the increase in\nthe halide substituent size, is associated with the side chain rearrangement\nobserved by docking as well as the crystal structure of compound 7d with the bromodomain of BRD9. However, entropy changes\nmay be due to a number of factors, such as release of water molecules,\ntherefore making further interpretation of the small data set obtained\nvery difficult.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Induced fit binding of 9H-purines to\nBRD9.

Notably\nthe ligand engages a water molecule located on the top of the BRD\ncavity in a network of hydrogen bonds to the backbone of I53. (D)\nBinding of 7d to BRD9 results in a distinct rearrangement\nof the BRD fold.

The model and structure factors of the BRD9/7d complex\nshown have been deposited to the PDB with ascension code 4XY8.We next questioned whether the primary amine function\nat position\n2 of the 9H-purine core scaffold is necessary for\nbinding to bromodomains. First we substituted the amine with a chlorine\ngroup (compound 8a, Figure \u200bFigure4A)\nwhile4A)\nwhile retaining the 6-(5-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl) substitution, resulting\nin loss of affinity toward all BRDs in our panel (Figure \u200b(Figure4B).4B). In the case of BRD9 we confirmed this observation\nby performing an isothermal titration calorimetry measurement which\nyielded a Kd of 7.9 \u03bcM (Figure \u200b(Figure4C).4C). As with compounds from previous series, methyl\nsubstitution at position 9 completely abolished bromodomain binding\n(compound 8b, Figure \u200bFigure4A),4A), measured\nby both thermal melt (Figure \u200b(Figure4B)4B) and ITC assays\nin the case of BRD9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4C);4C); larger substituents\n(compound 8c) could not be tolerated suggesting that\nthe core scaffold retained its pose within the bromodomain binding\ncavity. Hydroxy substitution at position 2 while retaining a 6-(5-halide-2-methoxyphenyl)\nsubstituent (compounds 8d\u2013f) had\nvariable effects on the 9H-purine affinity toward\nBRDs. Moreover, fluoro (8d) and bromo (8f) substituted compounds lost affinity across the panel, while the\nchloro-substituted compound (8e) promiscuously bound\nto most bromodomains in the \u0394Tm assay,\nalbeit weaker than its primary amine analogue 7c (Figure \u200b(Figure4A,B),4A,B), thus suggesting that the interactions initiated\nby the hydroxyl group and the conserved asparagine (Asn100 in BRD9;\nAsn140 in BRD4(1)) are not favored over the primary amine.Open in a separate windowFigure 4BRD pocket\nSAR.

Solid lines represent a nonlinear least-squares\nfit using a single-site binding model. (D) Isothermal titration calorimetry\nvalidation of compound 11 binding to BRD4(1) showing\nraw injection heats for titrations of protein into compound. Data\nhave been corrected and displayed as described in (C). All ITC titrations\nwere carried out in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (at 25 \u00b0C), 150 mM NaCl,\nand 15 \u00b0C while stirring at 1000 rpm.The 9H-purine crystal structure complexes\nthat\nwe obtained with the bromodomains of BRD9 and BRD4(1) highlighted\nthe failure of the ligand to insert deep inside the bromodomain cavity,\nthus not replacing the conserved network of water molecules. In an\nattempt to reach deeper within the cavity, we synthesized compounds 9a and 9b, introducing a methyl group at position\n8 of the 9H-purine core. The low solubility of compound 9a did not allow for any measurements, but compound 9b exhibited very low affinity for all bromodomains in our\npanel with the exception of BRDT(2) (\u0394Tm of 2.9 \u00b0C), suggesting that substitution at this position\nof the 9H-purine core in the absence of a 2-amine\nfunction cannot be tolerated and these compounds could not displace\nthe conserved water molecule network deep inside the bromodomain pocket.\nOur synthetic efforts to insert a fluorine atom at position 8 through\na C-8 electrophilic fluorination on the bis(tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-protected\nderivative of 2a, following a reported metalation\u2013fluorination\nreaction with N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide,78 were also unsuccessful; we observed formation\nof the corresponding 8-phenylsulfonyl product instead of the 8-fluoro\nderivative, similar to reported work done by Roy and co-workers,79 even under heterogeneous conditions.Our\nstructural insight suggested that augmentation of the 6-(5-halide-2-methoxyphenyl)\nsubstituent would take a toll on BRD9, as it would force the structure\ntoward an apo-like conformation, sterically pushing Phe47 toward the\napo-conformation of BRD9, while it should not affect binding to BET\nbromodomains which contained an open channel between Trp81 and Leu92\n(Figure \u200b(Figure3E3E and Supporting\nInformation Figure 2E) . To test this hypothesis, we synthesized\ncompound 10 (Figure \u200b(Figure4A)4A) and tested\nits ability to bind to human BRDs. Unfortunately its bright yellow\ncolor and low solubility did not allow for further validation. We\ntherefore decided to increase the size of the substituent found in 7d by cyclizing the 2-methoxyphenyl ring into a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-7-yl\nwhile retaining the bromo function at position 5. We tested the resulting\ncompound 11 in the \u0394Tm assay against the panel of bromodomains and observed increased temperature\nshifts among BET BRDs (between 1.7 and 5.4 \u00b0C) together with\na remarkable increase in the case of BRD9 (6.5 \u00b0C). To verify\nthis observation, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry measurements\nand obtained a dissociation constant of 278 nM for BRD9 (Figure \u200b(Figure4C)4C) while BRD4(1) binding resulted in a much weaker\naffinity (1.4 \u03bcM) (Figure \u200b(Figure4D).4D). Notably\nthe entropic contribution of compound 11 binding to BRD9\nwas comparable to compound 7d for both BRD9 and BRD4(1),\nand thus we speculated that a similar rearrangement should be taking\nplace upon binding to the bromodomain of BRD9.In order to test\nour hypothesis that compound 11 binding\nwould also result in structural rearrangement of the bromodomain binding\ncavity of BRD9, in a similar way to compound 7d, while\nnot affecting the cavity of BRD4(1), we attempted to determine the\ncrystal structures of this compound in complex with these two bromodomains.\nCompound 11 readily crystallized with BRD4(1) and was\nfound to occupy the acetyllysine binding cavity of the bromodomain\n(Figure \u200b(Figure5A)5A) and was very well-defined in the\ndensity (Figure \u200b(Figure5B)5B) despite its weaker binding\naffinity of 1.37 \u03bcM toward BRD4(1) (Table 1). The ligand was found to directly interact with the conserved asparagine\n(Asn140) as well as with the conserved network of water molecules\nwhile packing between the ZA-channel tryptophan (Trp81) and the ZA-loop\nleucine (Leu92) (Figure \u200b(Figure5C).5C). Our efforts however\nto obtain a BRD9/11 complex did not yield diffracting\nquality crystals suitable for structure determination, and as such,\nwe employed computational methods to account for its binding to BRD9.\nRigid docking into the BRD9/7d complex structure resulted\nin a conformation similar to that observed with compound 7d, with the ligand engaging the conserved asparagine via its primary\namine function and the 6-aryl-substituted ring packing betweent the\nZA-loop Ile53 and Phe44 (Supporting Information Figure 3A). We then performed induced-fit docking employing the\nalgorithms previously described for purine fragments using the complex\nof BRD9/7d as starting point and obtained a pose whereby\nthe 2-amine function inverted and inserted in the BRD pocket, without\nany changes in the surrounding side chains of Phe44, Phe47, Ile53,\nand Tyr106 (Supporting Information Figure\n3B). Intrigued by this finding, we performed another induced fit docking\nexperiment, starting with the BRD9 apo structure and allowing residues\nto freely move in the presence of the ligand. We observed a similar\nset of side chain rearrangement within the BRD9 acetyllysine cavity,\nincluding a rotation of Phe47 resulting in capping of the binding\ngroove, accompanied by repositioning of Phe44 from helix C and Ile53\nfrom the ZA-loop (Supporting Information Figure 3C). We therefore concluded that the 2-amine-9H-purine scaffolds that we developed can induce a closed pocket within\nthe bromodomain of BRD9 resulting in tight binding, without at the\nsame time exhibiting high affinity for BRD4(1) or other BET family\nmembers. Indeed, we determined the dissociation constants for binding\nto BET domains employing ITC and found that both compounds 7d and 11 exhibited low micromolar affinities (1.4\u20134.6\n\u03bcM) correlating well with the higher thermal shifts observed\n(Supporting Information Table S1), while\nretaining higher affinity against the bromodomain of BRD9 (Supporting Information Figure 4 and Tables 2 and 3).Open in a separate windowFigure 5Complex of compound 11 and 9H-purine\nactivity in cells.

The model and structure factors of the BRD4(1)/11 complex shown in panels A, B, and C have been deposited\nto the PDB with ascension code 4XYA. (D) Titration of compounds 7d and 11 into HEK293 cells transfected with NanoLuc-fused\nbromodomain of BRD9 and Halo-tagged histone H3.3. The ligands disrupt\nthe histone/BRD9 interaction with an apparent IC50 of 3.5\n\u03bcM (7d) and 480 nM (11), resulting\nin loss of signal due to separation of the BRD9-histone complex. (E)\nTitration of compounds 7d and 11 into HEK293\ncells transfected with NanoLuc-fused full length BRD4 (UniProt code {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"O60885\",\"term_id\":\"20141192\"}}O60885) and Halo-tagged\nhistone H3.3. Although the ligands gradually disrupt the BRD4-FL/H3.3\ninteraction, they fail to elicit the same effect as in the case of\nBRD9 in the concentration range tested.Having obtained a small window of selectivity over BRD4,\nwe wanted\nto verify that the 2-amine-9H-purine scaffolds that\nwe developed are in fact active in a cellular environment and can\nperturb the interaction of BRD9 with acetylated histones. Previous\nstudies have established that potent compounds that competitively\nbind to the acetyllysine binding cavity of BET proteins can displace\nthe entire protein from chromatin in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching\n(FRAP) assays,23,35,77 while larger BRD-containing proteins that contain in addition multiple\nreader domains are harder to fully displace; in the case of CREBBP\nthis was solved by creating an artificial GFP-fusion construct that\ncontained three BRD modules of CREBBP and a nuclear localization signal.38 BRD9 is part of the large SWI/SNF complex,49 and its bromodomain has been shown to bind to\nacetylated histone H3 peptides.15 We speculated\nthat 9H-purines should be able to competitively displace\nthe bromodomain of BRD9 from chromatin and constructed a bioluminescence\nresonance energy transfer (BRET) system that combined NanoLuc luciferase\nfusions of the BRD9 bromodomain (Supporting Information Figure 5A) or full length BRD4 and Halo-tagged histone H3.3 as BRET\npairs. This assay is an excellent tool to quantify protein\u2013ligand\ninteractions in a cellular system80 and\nhas recently been used to determine cellular IC50 values\nfor the inhibition of the histone\u2013bromodomain interaction in\nthe case of BRPF1 using a 1,3-dimethylbenzimidazolone scaffold.42 First we established by fluorescence microscopy\nthat Halo-tagged histone H3.3 is readily incorporated into chromatin\n(Supporting Information Figure 5B). We\nthen performed dose\u2013response experiments and demonstrated the\nNanoLuc-BRD9 bromodomain was readily displaced from chromatin by compounds 7d and 11 with cellular IC50 values\nof 3.5 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM and 477 \u00b1 194 nM, respectively (Figure \u200b(Figure5D),5D), in agreement with the in vitro affinities determined\nby ITC (Table 2). In contrast, full-length\nBRD4 was not completely displaced in this assay up to concentrations\nof 33 \u03bcM of both compounds (Figure \u200b(Figure5E),\nsuggesting5E),\nsuggesting that the compounds retained the in vitro selectivity toward\nBRD9 in this cellular system. We further examined the toxicity of\ncompound 11 toward HEK293 cells, using cell viability\nin the presence of the compound in the concentration regime of our\nBRET experiments as a readout and did not observe any cytotoxicty\n(Supporting Information Figure 5C), suggesting\nthat this compound can be used in cellular systems to target BRD9/Kac\ninteractions without affecting BRD4/Kac interactions or causing any\ncytotoxic responses. ConclusionWe have described here\na structure-guided approach to identify\ninhibitors for diverse BRDs starting from small fragment-like 9H-purine scaffolds. Through structure\u2013activity relationship\nwe established compounds 7d and 11 and characterized\nthem as nanomolar binders for the BRD of BRD9 while retaining weak\nin vitro activity against the first bromodomain of BRD4. These compounds\nare not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 33 \u03bcM in a HEK293\nsystem and can competitively displace the BRD9 bromodomain from chromatin\nwhile failing to displace full length human BRD4 at the same concentration\nrange in bioluminescence proximity assays, despite the fact that the\nin vitro affinity difference for these two proteins is not large.\nImportantly, compound 7d induces structural rearrangement\non the acetyllysine binding cavity of BRD9 resulting in an unprecedented\ncavity shape which accommodates this scaffold, explaining the higher\naffinity toward this protein, while docking studies suggest that compound 11 elicits the same type of structural rearrangement. The\n9H-purine scaffold therefore offers a simple template\nthat can be used to generate initial tools that will no doubt prove\nuseful in interrogating the biology of bromodomains beyond the BET\nsubfamily, such as BRD9, which have not attracted attention until\nnow, avoiding cross-reactivity with BET bromodomains.
