{"title": "Genetic interactions of Spt4-Spt5 and TFIIS with the RNA polymerase II CTD and CTD modifying enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "pubDate": "2001", "PMCID": "PMC1461841", "DOI": "10.1093/genetics/159.2.487", "PMID": "11606527", "abstract": "Genetic and biochemical studies have identified many factors thought to be important for transcription elongation. We investigated relationships between three classes of these factors: (1) transcription elongation factors Spt4-Spt5, TFIIS, and Spt16; (2) the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; and (3) protein kinases that phosphorylate the CTD and a phosphatase that dephosphorylates it. We observe that spt4 and spt5 mutations cause strong synthetic phenotypes in combination with mutations that shorten or alter the composition of the CTD; affect the Kin28, Bur1, or Ctk1 CTD kinases; and affect the CTD phosphatase Fcp1. We show that Spt5 co-immunoprecipitates with RNA polymerase II that has either a hyper- or a hypophosphorylated CTD. Furthermore, mutation of the CTD or of CTD modifying enzymes does not affect the ability of Spt5 to bind RNA polymerase II. We find a similar set of genetic interactions between the CTD, CTD modifying enzymes, and TFIIS. In contrast, an spt16 mutation did not show these interactions. These results suggest that the CTD plays a key role in modulating elongation in vivo and that at least a subset of elongation factors are dependent upon the CTD for their normal function.", "author": [{"author": "D L Lindstrom", "affiliation": ["Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, 95064, USA."], "href": "/?term=Lindstrom+DL&cauthor_id=11606527"}, {"author": "G A Hartzog", "affiliation": [], "href": "/?term=Hartzog+GA&cauthor_id=11606527"}], "refPMID": ["10733565", "10594013", "11018013", "11040216", "11040217", "11390638", "6329902", "3304659", "3198603", "2693207", "10024883", "10199401", "10385623", "10445027", "10488128", "2284485", "1840633", "1922073", "1833637", "1330823", "1478941", "8273152", "8293972", "7759473", "7762301", "7565723", "7498765", "8649394", "8710856", "8759772", "8786137", "8887556", "8975720", "9199353", "9242904", "9334325", "9334326", "9450929", "9450930", "9468530", "9488431", "9489704", "9514752", "9702190", "9734358", "9832518", "9836642", "10546888", "10757782"], "citedInPMID": ["11606527", "33888559", "28366642", "27376968", "24385927", "24163256", "23418395", "22982195", "22511879", "22408743", "22286094", "21856751", "21467036", "21283673", "21127351", "21060864", "20385590", "19581288", "19384408", "19328068", "17913884", "17901206", "17404243", "17101794", "17001490", "16908835", "16581788", "16428435", "16172632", "15767671", "15643076", "15595826", "15520468", "15359273", "15121832", "15082542", "15047695", "14739930", "14585989", "12972617", "12684377", "12682017", "12556496", "12554661", "12455950", "12391174", "12370301", "12183367", "12096188", "11927560", "11884586"], "body": " AbstractGenetic and biochemical studies have identified many factors thought to be important for transcription elongation.
