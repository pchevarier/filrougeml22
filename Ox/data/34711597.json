IntroductionEach year 2\u20133\u2009million intensive care unit (ICU) patients receive invasive mechanical ventilation.1\u20133 Despite recent advances in lung-protective ventilation,4 in-hospital mortality among mechanically ventilated ICU patients remains 25%\u201335%.5\nMechanical ventilation for ICU patients universally involves titrating the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) within a goal range. Despite decades of ICU practice, however, the optimal SpO2 target remains unknown. Higher SpO2 targets (96%\u2013100%) provide a margin of safety against hypoxaemia, but may increase exposure to excess FiO2, hyperoxaemia, and tissue hyperoxia, causing oxidative damage,6\u20138 inflammation9 10 and increased alveolar-capillary permeability.11 Lower SpO2 targets (88%\u201392%) minimise exposure to excess FiO2, hyperoxaemia and tissue hyperoxia,4 12 13 but may increase the risk of hypoxaemia and tissue hypoxia.14 15 An intermediate SpO2 target (92%\u201396%) may avoid the risks of both hyperoxia and hypoxia or, conversely, may expose patients intermittently to both sets of risks.16 17\nThe relative risks and benefits of different SpO2 or PaO2 targets have been extensively examined in the setting of the neonatal ICU18\u201321 and have been examined among adult ICU patients in a series of recently published clinical trials.22\u201327 Together, these trials have suggested that both higher and lower oxygenation targets are safe\u2014although some trials have potentially suggested better outcomes with higher targets25 and other trials have suggested potentially better outcomes with lower targets.24\nGiven the still incomplete evidence from randomised trials, current guidelines offer divergent recommendations\u2014ranging from tolerating SpO2 values as low as 88%28\u201330 to pursuing SpO2 values as high as 98%.31 In clinical practice, hyperoxaemia remains common,32 33 even among patients cared for by clinicians who self-identify as avoiding high oxygen levels.34\nThe wide variation in current practice, conflicting guidelines and conflicting data from some available trials indicate the need for further clinical trials to determine the effect of SpO2 target on patient outcomes.12 35 We designed the Pragmatic Investigation of optimaL Oxygen Targets (PILOT) trial to examine the effects of higher, intermediate and lower SpO2 targets on the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Methods and analysisThis manuscript was prepared by the PILOT investigators (online supplemental file 1, section 1) in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (figure 1; SPIRIT checklist in online supplemental file 1, section 2).36 This manuscript describes key elements of the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan. The supplemental methods in online supplemental file 1 provide additional background on prior trials (section 3), rationale for design decisions (sections 4\u20135), SpO2 monitoring and management (sections 6\u20138), institutional protocols for mechanical ventilation (sections 9\u201317), a complete list of data elements (section 18), definitions of exploratory outcomes and measures of separation between groups (sections 19\u201321), and details of the interim analysis (section 22) and secondary analyses (sections 23\u201325).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials checklist.

PILOT compares use of a lower SpO2 target (target 90% and goal range: 88%\u201392%), an intermediate SpO2 target (target 94% and goal range: 92%\u201396%) and a higher SpO2 target (target 98% and goal range: 96%\u2013100%) with regard to the number of days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation among mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Consistent with the concept of a pragmatic clinical trial,37 the eligibility criteria are broad, the delivery of the intervention is embedded in routine clinical care and executed by clinical personnel, and data collection prioritises clinical outcomes over mechanistic evaluation. The trial was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB 171272). The trial is investigator initiated with funding provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (K23HL143053). The trial protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on 25 May 2018 prior to initiation of patient enrolment on 1 July 2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03537937\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03537937\"}}NCT03537937).Patient and public involvementMaterials used to communicate about the study with patients and families were developed with input from the Vanderbilt Community Engaged Research Core and the Vanderbilt Community Advisory Council.Study site and populationThe trial is being conducted in the adult ED and medical ICU at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.The inclusion criteria are Age \u226518 years.Receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy.Admitted to the study ICU or admission to the study ICU from the ED is planned.The exclusion criteria are Known pregnancy or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level greater than the laboratory upper limit of normal in a patient capable of becoming pregnant (if measured clinically).Known to be a prisoner.Adults located in the study ICU or for whom admission to the study ICU from the ED is planned who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria are enrolled immediately on receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a study location. The time of enrolment for the trial (\u2018time zero\u2019) is the time of first receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a participating study location.Randomisation and treatment allocationFor each of the 18 2-month blocks during the 36 months of enrolment in the PILOT trial, the medical ICU is assigned to a single SpO2 target (cluster-level allocation). Every 2\u2009months, the ICU will switch between use of a lower SpO2 target (target 90% and goal range: 88%\u201392%), use of an intermediate SpO2 target (target 94% and goal range: 92%\u201396%) and use of a higher SpO2 target (target 98% and goal range: 96%\u2013100%) in a randomly generated sequence (cluster-level crossover) (figure 2). The order of study group assignments for each 2-month block was generated by computerised randomisation using permuted blocks of three to minimise the impact of seasonal variation and temporal changes. For the 36 months of enrolment in the PILOT trial, patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ED for whom admission to the medical ICU is planned will receive the same SpO2 target assigned to the medical ICU. The study did not enrol in April and May of 2020 due to disruptions in research and clinical care from the COVID-19 pandemic (figure 2).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Group assignment during the trial. For each of the 18 2-month study periods, the study intensive care unit is randomly assigned to a higher, intermediate or lower SpO2 target. in this figure, The letters \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 each correspond to one of the three possible SpO2 targets, the allocation sequence of which remains concealed until the start of each 2-month study period. The study did not enrol in April and May of 2020 due to disruptions in research and clinical care from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, March and June of 2020 represent a single 2-month block assigned to one SpO2 target. SpO2, arterial oxygen saturation.Washout periodsThe last 7\u2009days of each 2-month block are considered an analytic washout period during which the ICU continues to target the assigned SpO2, but data from new patients are not included in the primary analysis. Assuming a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 3 (IQR: 3\u20135)\u2009days, a 7-day washout period will ensure that 98% patients in the primary analysis do not experience a \u2018crossover\u2019 from a period assigned to one assigned SpO2 target to a period assigned to another SpO2 target. Data from patients admitted during washout periods will be included in a prespecified sensitivity analysis (see Statistical analysis section). Any patient who does remain mechanically ventilated in the study ICU through a crossover from a period assigned to one SpO2 target to a period assigned to another SpO2 target will be analysed in the SpO2 target group to which the ICU was assigned at the time of the patient\u2019s enrolment in the trial (intention-to-treat analysis).Study interventionsChoice of SpO2 targets In clinical practice, 98% of SpO2 values experienced by mechanically ventilated adults fall between 88% and 100%.32 33 Within this range, current guidelines for oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated adults outline three contrasting approaches: (1) allowing the lower end of the range of acceptable SpO2 values to be as low as 88%28 29 to avoid excess FiO2, hyperoxaemia and hyperoxia; (2) titrating within an intermediate range of SpO2 values, such as 92%\u201396%38; or (3) targeting higher SpO2 to avoid the risks of hypoxaemia and hypoxia.31 The PILOT trial has three study groups, each emulating a different approach to SpO2 targets represented in guidelines and clinical practice (table 1).Table 1SpO2 and PaO2 targets and goal ranges by study groupStudy groupSpO2 targetSpO2 goal rangePaO2 target (mm Hg)PaO2 goal range (mm Hg)Lower SpO2 target90%88%\u201392%6055\u201365Intermediate SpO2 target94%92%\u201396%7065\u20138Higher SpO2 target98%96%\u2013100%110>80Open in a separate windowFor each study group, the SpO2 target and goal range are displayed. PaO2 is used to guide titration of FiO2 for participants without reliable pulse oximetry monitoring.FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO2, arterial oxygen tension; SpO2, arterial oxygen saturation.Oxygen titration In the study ED and ICU, titration of FiO2 to maintain SpO2 for mechanically ventilated adults is typically performed by respiratory therapists with input from nurses and physicians. In preparation for the PILOT trial, we collaborated with respiratory therapy leaders in the study ED and ICU to adapt existing ventilator management protocols to provide guidance for respiratory therapists in titrating FiO2 to achieve each of the three study SpO2 targets.For patients enrolled in the study, respiratory therapists are instructed to begin titrating FiO2 to the target SpO2 value within 15\u2009min of the initiation of mechanical ventilation. During the maintenance of invasive mechanical ventilation, SpO2 is assessed by continuous pulse oximetry. The protocol directs the respiratory therapist managing the patient\u2019s ventilator to target an SpO2 value of 90% in the lower SpO2 target group, an SpO2 value of 94% in the intermediate SpO2 target group and an SpO2 value of 98% in the higher SpO2 target group (table 1). Respiratory therapists and other treating clinicians titrate FiO2 when the SpO2 is out of the goal range, when the SpO2 is within the goal range but closer alignment with the assigned SpO2 target is desired, to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation, or for other clinical indications. SpO2 is reassessed 5\u2009min after each change in FiO2 or sooner if clinically indicated.The protocol determines the SpO2 target from enrolment until the first of: (1) discontinuation of invasive mechanical ventilation, (2) transfer out of a participating study location, (3) completion of an SpO2 target modification sheet by treating clinicians or (4) end of the 2-month study period. The protocol does not determine the SpO2 target during time periods in which the patient is not physically located in a study location (eg, during transport) or when FiO2 is being administered for purposes other than achieving a target SpO2 (eg, when an FiO2 of 1.0 is being administered for a procedure).At any time, if a treating clinician or a patient, family member or surrogate feels that an SpO2 target other than that assigned by the study would be best for the optimal treatment of the patient for any reason, the SpO2 target for that patient is modified. To modify the target, the respiratory therapist and supervising physician complete a one-page SpO2 target modification sheet documenting the new SpO2 target and the rationale for modifying the target. Examples of conditions for which the assigned SpO2 target may be modified that were specified in the initial trial protocol included pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness, bleomycin toxicity and paraquat toxicity. Examples of conditions for which the assigned SpO2 target may be modified that were not explicitly specified in the initial trial protocol include severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe anaemia, status post lung transplantation and receipt of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Trial protocol directs only the titration of FiO2 to the assigned SpO2 target. Other aspects of invasive mechanical ventilation, such as tidal volume,4 positive end-expiratory pressure39 40 and use of rescue therapies for hypoxaemia, are determined by institutional protocols and treating clinicians (see sections 9\u201317 of online supplemental file 1).BlindingSimilar to prior studies of SpO2 targets among critically ill adults,22 24 26 patients and clinicians will not be blinded to study group assignment.Data collectionThe PILOT trial uses data collected by two methods to minimise observer bias: (1) manual data collection by study personnel and (2) automated collection of structured data recorded in routine clinical care, exported daily from the institution\u2019s electronic health record and patient registration, billing and laboratory clinical information systems into an Enterprise Data Warehouse. We have previously validated the quality of the automated method of data collection against the reference standard of two-physician manual chart review41 and have employed this approach for the conduct of prior pragmatic trials.42 43 Data are stored, curated and secured in REDCap.44\nOutcomesPrimary outcome The primary outcome is VFDs to study day 28. VFDs will be defined as the number of whole calendar days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation beginning at midnight on the day of the final receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation through day 28 after enrolment.45 46 Outcome ascertainment will cease at the time of hospital discharge or 28 days after enrolment, whichever occurs first. Receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation will be considered to end when patients undergo the final tracheal extubation or disconnection of the ventilator from the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube between enrolment and 28 days after enrolment. Patients whose final receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation occurs on the day of enrolment will receive 27 VFDs. Patients who continue to receive invasive mechanical ventilation 28 days after enrolment will receive 0 VFDs. Patients who die prior to day 28 will receive 0 VFDs. Patients who are discharged from the hospital prior to day 28 and are receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at the time of discharge will receive 0 VFDs. Patients who are removed from invasive mechanical ventilation and are discharged from the hospital without invasive mechanical ventilation prior to 28 days will be assumed to remain free of invasive mechanical ventilation between hospital discharge and day 28. For patients who are removed from invasive mechanical ventilation, return to invasive mechanical ventilation, and are subsequently removed again from invasive mechanical ventilation prior to day 28, VFDs will be counted from the final receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation prior to day 28.Secondary outcome The sole prespecified secondary outcome is 28-day in-hospital mortality, defined as death from any cause between enrolment and the first of hospital discharge or 28 days after enrollment.Exploratory clinical outcomes ICU mortality\u2014death in the ICU between enrolment and the first of 28 days after enrolment or hospital dischargeFree-day outcomes\u2014defined as whole calendar days from last receipt of therapy until 28 days (online supplemental file 1, section 19)Vasopressor-free daysRenal replacement therapy-free daysICU-free daysHospital-free daysExploratory organ function outcomes Daily non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (online supplemental table S1)47\nPlasma creatinine concentration (mg/dL)Plasma lactate concentration (mmol/L)Presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome by Berlin criteria48\nStage II or greater acute kidney injury (AKI) by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria.49\nExploratory safety outcomes Atrial arrhythmiaVentricular arrhythmiaCardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulationPneumothorax or pneumomediastinumIschaemic strokeMyocardial infarction50\nAdditional long-term patientimportant outcomes The independently funded Cognitive Outcomes in the Pragmatic Investigation of Optimal Oxygen Targets (CO-PILOT) study (R21AG063126) will assess cognitive, physical and psychological outcomes at 12 months after enrolment in the PILOT trial. The protocol and statistical analysis plan for the CO-PILOT study will be published separately.Statistical analysis and reportingSample size estimation and power calculation In a prior cluster-randomised cluster-crossover trial in the same ICU,51 880 mechanically ventilated adults were enrolled per year (73.3 per month), with a median of 22 VFDs (IQR: 0\u201325 VFDs) and an intracluster intraperiod correlation of 0.01. We estimate 2640 mechanically ventilated adults will be admitted to the study ICU during the 36-month PILOT trial, of whom 390 will be excluded from the primary analysis for initial receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in a study location during a washout period and 2250 will be enrolled and included in the primary analysis. With a total enrolment of 2250 patients, a SD in the primary outcome of VFDs of 11.4\u2009days, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05, we calculated using a t-test that the PILOT trial will have 92% statistical power to detect an absolute reduction in VFDs of 2.0\u2009days (similar to the numerical difference in VFDs between SpO2 target groups reported in prior studies22 24).DSMB and interim analysis An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversees the trial. On 23 March 2020 the DSMB conducted a single, planned interim analysis at the anticipated halfway point of the trial and recommended the trial to continue without modification (see DSMB charter in online supplemental file 2) and details of interim analysis in online supplemental file 1, section 22). The DSMB is composed of two physicians outside the study institution with expertise in adult pulmonary and critical care medicine clinical practice and clinical research, one bioethicist and one biostatistician.Supplementary data\nbmjopen-2021-052013supp002.pdf\nStatistical analysis principles R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) will be used for analyses. Analyses will be conducted at the level of an individual patient during an individual hospitalisation in an intent-to-treat fashion, unless otherwise specified. Continuous variables will be reported as mean\u00b1SD\u2009or median and IQR; categorical variables will be reported as frequencies and proportions.Main analysis of the primary outcome The main analysis will be an intention-to-treat comparison of the primary outcome of VFDs between the higher, intermediate and lower SpO2 target groups among all patients enrolled in the trial except1 those admitted during one of the 7-day washout periods and2 those with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 will be excluded from the main analysis for two reasons. First, the majority of the PILOT trial occurred prior the COVID-19 pandemic, with too few 2-month study blocks occurring during the pandemic to ensure balance in the number of patients with COVID-19 between trial groups. Second, at the study hospital, ICU patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are transferred to a separate, dedicated COVID-19 ICU that was not participating in the PILOT trial. Thus, patients with COVID-19 are unlikely to have received significant exposure to the SpO2 target intervention in the PILOT trial. Patients enrolled during washout periods and patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be included in sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analyses below).It is possible to estimate a conditional effect, which is interpreted as the effect of a given SpO2 target on an individual patient given the values of the covariates for that patient, or a marginal effect, which is interpreted as the population effect of implementing a given SpO2 target as a general policy.52 Since an SpO2 target intervention may be applied both at the patient level as an individual intervention and at the unit level as a general policy, both may be of interest.To estimate the conditional effect, we will use a proportional odds model with independent covariates of group assignment (higher, intermediate or lower SpO2 target) and time.53 54 Time (in days) will be treated as a continuous variable with values ranging from 1 (first day of enrolment) to 1097 (final day of enrolment) and will be analysed using restricted cubic splines with multiple knots to allow for non-linearity resulting from seasonality or secular trends. For the purposes of declaring a statistically significant difference between groups in the primary endpoint, we will consider the conditional effect from the proportional odds model and a two-sided p value of 0.05.To estimate the marginal effect, we will use generalised estimating equations with study period as the cluster and an independent variable for group assignment (higher, intermediate or lower SpO2 target).For both approaches, in addition to assessing for an overall group effect within the model, we will estimate the differences between each pair of SpO2 targets by extracting 95% CIs from the model.Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome We will repeat the primary analysis using alternative statistical approaches to comparing the VFDs outcome between groups such as zero-inflated Poisson regression or zero-inflated negative binomial regression, global rank scale analysis55 and Fine and Gray competing risk regression.We will repeat the primary analysis with adjustment for prespecified baseline covariates of age, sex, race and ethnicity, source of ICU admission, vasopressor receipt, acute diagnoses at enrolment, and severity of illness as assessed by the non-respiratory SOFA score.We will repeat the primary analysis replacing the continuous covariate of time with a categorical covariate of season defined as: winter (January, February, March); spring (April, May, June); summer (July, August, September); and fall (October, November, December).We will repeat the primary analysis among all patients enrolled in the trial, including1 patients initiated on invasive mechanical ventilation in a study location during one of the prespecified 7-day washout periods and2 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19.Analysis of effect modification for the primary outcome We will examine whether prespecified baseline variables modify the effect of study group on the primary outcome using formal tests of statistical interaction in a proportional odds model. Independent variables will include study group assignment, the potential effect modifier of interest and the interaction between the two (eg, study group \u00d7 presence of sepsis or septic shock) and time. Significance will be determined by the p value for the interaction term, with values <0.10 considered to suggest a potential interaction and values <0.05 considered to confirm an interaction.We will examine whether the following baseline variables modify the effect of study group on the primary outcome:Age;Race and ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic white, Other);Source of admission to the ICU (ED, hospital ward, another ICU in the study hospital, operating room, outside hospital);Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation prior to enrollment;Chronic comorbidities (categories are not mutually exclusive)Receipt of supplemental oxygen at place of residence prior to hospital admission (yes, no);Coronary artery disease or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (yes, no);Acute diagnoses at enrollment (categories are not mutually exclusive)56\ncardiac arrest (yes, no);acute myocardial infarction (yes, no);sepsis or septic shock (yes, no);acute respiratory distress syndrome (yes, no);Receipt of vasopressors at enrollment (yes, no);Non-respiratory SOFA score at enrollment;Time period before the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2018 to December 2019), and during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020 to August 2021).Analysis of the secondary outcome The sole prespecified secondary outcome of 28-day in-hospital mortality will be compared between the three study groups in an intention-to-treat fashion in the main analysis population using a logistic regression model with independent covariates of group assignment (higher, intermediate or lower SpO2 target) and time. In addition to assessing for an overall group effect within the model, we will estimate the differences between each pair of SpO2 targets by extracting 95% CIs from the model.Analysis of the exploratory outcomes Each of the exploratory outcomes will be compared between groups in an intention-to-treat fashion in the main analysis population. Exploratory outcomes will be compared between study groups in a similar manner as for primary and secondary outcomes. A logistic model will be used for binary outcomes, a multinomial model for categorical outcomes, and a proportional odds model will be used for ordinal and continuous outcomes.Trial status PILOT is an ongoing pragmatic trial comparing higher, intermediate and lower SpO2 targets for mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. Patient enrolment began on 1 July 2018 and is anticipated to conclude on 31 August 2021.Ethics and disseminationIRB approval The trial was approved by the IRB of Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a waiver of informed consent (IRB# 171272), details of which are provided in (online supplemental file 1, section 26). Participants who regain capacity to provide informed consent, or legally authorised surrogate decision-makers for those patients who do not regain the capacity to provide informed consent, are approached to provide informed consent for assessment of long-term outcomes as a part of the independently funded CO-PILOT study (R21AG063126).Information for patients and families An information sheet providing an IRB approved lay language summary of the study and containing the contact information for investigators (who remain available throughout the study period to provide additional information to patients and families on request) is made available throughout the study period in glass display cases near the public entrance to the ICU and near the centre of the ICU, in the \u2018welcome packet\u2019 of information about the ICU, which is distributed at the time of ICU admission to patients, families and surrogates by the medical receptionist or charge nurse as a part of routine admission processes, in a brochure holder in the family waiting room for the study ICU, and by treating physicians and respiratory therapist to any patients, families, or surrogates with questions or concerns about the study.Protocol changes Any changes to the trial protocol will be recorded on ClinicalTrials.Gov as per SPIRIT guidelines (see section 27 of online supplemental file 1).Data handling and sharing For details of privacy, data handling and data sharing, see sections 28\u201329 of online supplemental file 1.Dissemination plan Trial results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for consideration of publication and will be presented at scientific conferences. The results of the study will be disseminated to patients and the public at the completion of the trial.The full list of the PILOT investigators may be found in (online supplemental file 1, section 1).
