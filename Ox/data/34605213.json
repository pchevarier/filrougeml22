Currently, ALI therapy is mainly limited to managed mechanical ventilation and mortality rate remains in excess of 20% (Phua et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2019). Despite extensive research in ALI during the past five decades, no standard clinical test exists to predict the severity of ALI other than the ratio of partial pressure of alveolar oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Force et al., 2012).The etiology of ALI is complex and can be induced by direct causes such as inhaled irritants and pneumonia or indirect extrapulmonary causes such as sepsis (Reiss et al., 2012). One ALI risk factor is smoke inhalation and smoke contains several irritants including acrolein (Calfee et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2017). Acrolein (Holter et al., 1986) is volatile at room temperature and is highly irritating to eyes and respiratory passages (Bein & Leikauf, 2011). Acrolein, as an \u03b1\u2010\u03b2\u2010unsaturated aldehyde, contains a carbonyl group and an electrophilic beta\u2010carbon that rapidly react with a variety of biological nucleophilic targets (Bein & Leikauf, 2020; Shao, 2011; Zarkovic et al., 2013). Acrolein can react with and adduct to the sulfhydryl of cysteine, imidazole of histidine, amino of lysine, guanidine of arginine, and deoxyguanosine of DNA (Stevens & Acrolein, 2008). The initial interaction of acrolein can alter the structure and functionality of the targeted molecule, which is followed by a cascade of complex cellular and pulmonary responses that progress with time and dictate the severity of the injury.In ALI, mortality is influenced by sex, age, and genetic susceptibility in patient populations, which can be experimentally modeled in mice (Erickson et al., 2008; Leikauf, Concel, et al., 2011; Leikauf, Pope\u2010Varsalona, et al., 2010; Manzano et al., 2005; Moss & Mannino, 1996; Prows, McDowell, et al., 2003; Prows, Shertzer, et al., 1997). Despite the extensive knowledge gained about the causes, risk factors, and biology of ALI, effective clinical pharmacotherapeutic practices and molecular markers are lacking. To develop effective therapeutic interventions, more studies are needed to understand the disease\u2010progression mechanisms underlying survival and mortality. The aim of the present work was to determine key mouse lung pathophysiological responses elicited after acrolein exposure. Reactions between acrolein and target proteins are complete within 3\u00a0h after exposure (Bein et al., 2020). However, the onset of lethality due to acrolein exposure can be delayed by 24\u00a0h. Thus, modeling ALI with acrolein in mice provides the capacity to investigate pathophysiological responses key to the ALI progression that leads to mortality. In this study, time\u2013course analysis was used to assess events that occur between acrolein exposure and the onset of lethality. 2.\u2003METHODS2.1. Mouse exposure and acrolein vapor generationThis study was performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Nine\u2010week\u2010old C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed under pathogen\u2010free conditions. Following 5\u00a0days of acclimation, mice were exposed to filtered air (control) or acrolein (50 or 75\u00a0ppm, 30\u00a0min). Acrolein vapor was generated by passing from a high\u2010pressure cylinder breathing air (157\u00a0ml/min for 50\u00a0ppm or 219\u00a0ml/min for 75\u00a0ppm) over liquid acrolein (Polysciences, Inc.) and introduced into a 0.32\u2010m3\u00a0stainless steel chamber. The acrolein concentration was continuously monitored using a Chemgard infrared monitor (MSA). After acrolein exposure, mouse survival time was recorded hourly during the day for the first 72\u00a0h and thereafter once every 3\u00a0h. Median lethal time (LT50) was calculated using logit\u2010probit analysis.2.2. Bronchoalveolar lavage collection and analysisAt various times after acrolein exposure (1\u201324\u00a0h), mice were euthanized by intraperitoneally injecting pentobarbital sodium followed by severing the posterior abdominal aorta. To obtain bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the diaphragm was punctured, a cannula was inserted in the trachea, and the lungs were lavaged five times in series with one 0.8\u00a0ml and four 0.5\u00a0ml of phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.4\u00a0mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The collected lavage was centrifuged (500\u00a0g, 10\u00a0min, 4\u00b0C) to pellet cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.2\u00a0ml of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Total BAL cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. To perform differential cell counts, cells were cytospun onto microscope slides and stained using Hema stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). BAL protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using BCA protein assay and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific).2.3. Mouse plasma preparationBlood samples collected via cardiac puncture were placed in 0.5\u00a0M EDTA/saline coated microcentrifuge tubes. The plasma was separated by centrifugation (2000\u00a0g, 10\u00a0min) and stored (\u221270\u2103) for later Western blotting analysis.2.4. Lung histologyLungs were collected 16\u00a0h after exposure. Lungs were fixed by tracheal instillation of 10% neutralized formalin in PBS and stored overnight in the same solution. After 24\u00a0h, the storage solution was removed and washed three times with PBS. For histological examination by microscopy, lungs were paraffin\u2010embedded, cut into 5\u2010\u00b5m sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histological scoring of lung injury was determined in \u226540 20\u00d7 field/mouse lung by the Matute\u2010Bello et al. (2008) method as modified by Aeffner et al. (2015). This method weights neutrophils in the alveolar space (20\u00d7), neutrophils in interstitial space (14\u00d7), proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces (7\u00d7), and alveolar septal thickening (2\u00d7).2.5. RNA sequencingTotal cellular RNA was isolated from control (n\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0lungs/sex group) and acrolein exposed (n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0lungs/sex group) mice (n\u00a0=\u00a028\u00a0mice) 6\u00a0h after exposure (30\u00a0min, 50\u00a0ppm) using TRI Reagent. mRNA, enriched using oligo(dT) beads, was randomly fragmented and used for cDNA synthesis using random hexamer primers. To construct the library, the double\u2010stranded cDNA was end\u2010repaired, poly\u2010A\u2010tailed, ligated to sequencing adapters, and subjected to HiSeq Illumina X Ten sequencing by Novogene Co. Ltd. The data generated were mapped to Mus musculus (GRCm38/mm10) reference genome. Normalized read counts and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained using DESeq2\u00a0software (Anders & Huber, 2010). Estimated p value was obtained by negative binomial distribution modeling method followed by Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons and the resulting adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered significant. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) murine pathways, Gene Ontology categories of Biological Process and Molecular Function, and LINCS L1000 Analysis 9 were assessed using Enrichr (Xie et al., 2021) and an adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 was considered statistically significant.2.6. C57BL/6J lung transcript analysesTotal cellular RNA was isolated from control and acrolein exposed mouse lungs using TRI Reagent and quantified by A\n260 absorbance determination (Take3; BioTek Instruments). The mRNA was analyzed by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR). To quantify H3F3B and PPBP transcripts by qRT\u2010PCR, DNase I\u2010treated RNA (0.9\u00a0\u00b5g) was reverse\u2010transcribed using an iScript cDNA synthesis system in a 30\u00a0\u00b5l reaction volume and diluted 5\u00d7 using RNase\u2010free water. An aliquot of the cDNA synthesis product (2\u00a0\u00b5l) was used in a subsequent qRT\u2010PCR analysis (Cat. No. 4369016, TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix; Applied Biosystems [ABI]). The qRT\u2010PCR analysis was performed with a 7900HT Fast Real\u2010Time PCR System using the following conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min, 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. The primers used were the internal control ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32, ABI Cat. No. Mm02528467_g1), H3F3B (ABI, Cat. No. Mm00787223_s1), and PPBP (ABI, Cat. No. Mm00470163_m1). The comparative cycle number threshold (C\nt) method (\u2206\u2206C\nt) was used to determine transcript change.2.7. Sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysisTo detect proteins, samples were incubated in Laemmli\u2019s sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)\u2010sample buffer (95\u2103, 5\u00a0min) and separated using 4%\u201320% mini\u2010protean TGX gels (Cat. No. 456\u20131094; Bio\u2010Rad). For albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), hemopexin, and haptoglobin detection (10\u00a0\u00b5l/lane of BAL, 0.5\u00a0\u00b5l/lane of plasma), SDS\u2010polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\u2010separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 88518). The membrane was rinsed twice (5\u00a0min each) in Tris\u2010buffered saline (TBS; 20\u00a0mM Tris, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% nonfat milk or BSA in TBS. The membrane was then incubated with goat anti\u2010mouse albumin [Immunology Consultants Laboratory [ICL]; Cat. No. GAL\u201090A, 1/5000], horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (R&D Systems; Cat. No. HAF007, 1/5000), rat anti\u2010mouse hemopexin (R&D Systems; Cat. No. MAB7007, 1/1000) or goat anti\u2010mouse haptoglobin (ICL; Cat. No. 90A\u2010Z, 1/1000) antibody diluted in 1% BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1\u20132\u00a0h (23\u2103). For H3.3\u00a0histone B (H3F3B) and pro\u2010platelet basic protein (PPBP, aka CXCL7) detection, proteins (25\u201335\u00a0\u00b5l/lane of BAL, 1 or 10\u00a0\u00b5l/lane of plasma) were separated using 4%\u201320% mini\u2010protean TGX stain\u2010free gels (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories; Cat. No. 4568094) and were transferred to immobilon membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. ISEQ00005) in sodium carbonate transfer buffer (Rossmann & Stillman, 2013). The immobilon membrane blot was briefly rinsed in water, dried at 37\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, and prewet in methanol. The membrane was rinsed twice (5\u00a0min each) in TBS and blocked for 1\u00a0h (23\u2103) with 5% BSA in TBS. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti\u2010histone H3 (Abcam; Cat. No. AB1791, 1/3000) or rabbit anti\u2010mouse CXCL7 antibodies (Abcam; Cat. No. 206406, 1/2000). To apply secondary antibody, the membrane was rinsed and washed twice in TBST (10\u00a0min each), and then incubated for 1\u00a0h (23\u2103) in HRP\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology; Cat. No. 7074, 1/20,000), mouse anti\u2010goat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 31400, 1/10,000) or goat anti\u2010rat IgG (Cell Signaling Technology; Cat. No. 7077, 1/3000) diluted in 1% BSA in TBST. After three to four washes, the immunoblot was incubated for 1\u20133\u00a0min in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. No. 34080) and the protein signal developed after exposure to x\u2010ray film (Phenix Research Products; Cat. No. F\u2010BX57).2.8. Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed and significance (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) determined by Holm\u2013Sidak all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (SigmaStat Program; SPSS, Inc.). 3.\u2003RESULTS3.1. Determination of lethal and sublethal acrolein doses in micePreviously, Conklin et al. (2016) reported that male C57BL6\u00a0mice were more sensitive to inhaled acrolein as compared to female mice. Because male mice are more susceptible, we sought to contrast the response of male with female mice after exposure to sublethal and lethal acrolein doses to investigate the pathophysiological events that contribute to this difference. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 75 or 50\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min. Exposure to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein resulted in 100% male and 79% female mice mortality within 120\u00a0h after exposure (Figure \u200b(Figure1a).1a). Within the first 24\u00a0h after acrolein exposure, mortality minimally occurred in male and female mice. With time, however, the survival curves for male and female mice diverged. The median lethality time (LT50) for male mice (LT50\u00a0=\u00a033\u00a0h) was shorter than that of female mice (LT50\u00a0=\u00a055\u00a0h). Exposure to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein resulted in 60% male and 0% female lethality within 120\u00a0h after exposure (Figure \u200b(Figure1b1b).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 1Survival of C57BL/6J mice following acrolein exposure. Survival of female and male C57BL/6J mice exposed to (a) 75\u00a0ppm or (b) 50\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min and returned to filtered air and survival monitored for up to 120\u00a0h. At either concentration, male C57BL/6J mice are more sensitive to acrolein exposure compared with female mice as determined by Kaplan\u2013Meier log\u2010rank survival (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001)Consistent with these findings, histological evidence of lung injury was more evident in males as compared to females following exposure to 50\u00a0ppm, while at 75\u00a0ppm lung injury was comparable in males and females (Figure \u200b(Figure2).2). In male and female mice exposed to filtered air control, the alveolar lumen was clear, neutrophils were not observed in the alveolar space and few in the interstitial space, proteinaceous debris, and alveolar wall thickening were absent. The control histological score was 0.015\u00a0+\u00a00.006 and 0.018\u00a0+\u00a00.008 (mean\u00a0+\u00a0standard error of mean [SEM]) for males and females, respectively. In male mice exposed to 50 or 75\u00a0ppm, the histological score increased to 0.274\u00a0+\u00a00.015 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and 0.346\u00a0+\u00a00.027 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), respectively. In female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm, the histological score was 0.043\u00a0+\u00a00.023 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.27), which was not significantly different from the control. In females exposed to 75\u00a0ppm, the histological score increased to 0.271\u00a0+\u00a00.043 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Thus, 50\u00a0ppm acrolein concentration was selected as a dose that was lethal to male but sublethal to female C57BL/6J mice.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 2Lung histology of C57BL/6J mice following acrolein exposure. Acrolein exposure increased alveolar wall thickening, lung proteinaceous deposits, and leukocyte infiltrates. Male (Left panels) and female (Right panels) mice were exposed to filtered air (Top panels), 50\u00a0ppm (Middle panels), or 75\u00a0ppm (Bottom panels) acrolein for 30\u00a0min and lungs collected 16\u00a0h after exposure for hematoxylin and eosin stainingTo assess the progression of lung injury, BAL was performed at 3 and 16\u00a0h after exposure in male and female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm or female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein (Figure \u200b(Figure3).3). The 3\u00a0h time was selected because it is the time when initial acrolein reactions with targets are complete and 16\u00a0h was selected because it is typically the time when inflammation is at its peak. At 16\u00a0h after exposure, BAL protein increased in male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein compared to control male mice whereas BAL protein in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein did not increase compared with control female mice (Figure \u200b(Figure3a).3a). BAL protein also increased in female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein 16\u00a0h after exposure compared to female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein. Increased BAL protein was evident, at least in some mice, by 3\u00a0h after exposure. These observations suggest that acrolein\u2010induced increased BAL protein reflects the phenotypic difference in acrolein\u2010induced sublethal compared to lethal sensitivity;Open in a separate windowFIGURE 3Bronchoalveolar (BAL) protein, total cells, and neutrophils in C57BL/6J mice exposed to 50 or 75\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min. BAL was collected from filtered air exposed male and female mice (0), male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm, or female mice exposed to 50 or 75\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min. Following exposure, mice were returned to filtered air and BAL was collected 3 or 16\u00a0h after exposure. BAL (a) protein, (b) total cells, and (c) neutrophils were determined. Each symbol represents one mouse and midline indicates mean and bars indicate standard deviation (SD, n\u00a0=\u00a05\u20139\u00a0mice/group). *Values are significantly different (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) as determined by one\u2010way analysis of variance with Holm\u2013Sidak all pairwise multiple comparison procedureAt 3\u00a0h after exposure, BAL total cell number, which is predominantly (~99%) macrophages, decreased in male and female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein as well as female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein (Figure \u200b(Figure3b).3b). Interestingly, BAL total cell number increased at 16\u00a0h post\u2010exposure in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein and was higher than the increase observed in male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein or in female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein (Figure \u200b(Figure3b).3b). The neutrophil percentage, which was <1% in control male and female mice, increased in acrolein exposed mice to 14% in male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein, 4% in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein, and 10% in female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein. Because the total cell number recovered in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein was higher, the neutrophil number in female mice exposed to 50 and 75\u00a0ppm acrolein was comparable (Figure \u200b(Figure3c).3c). Nonetheless, it should be noted that the ratio of total BAL cells to neutrophils was higher in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein compared with male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein and female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein. These findings suggest that during the early phase of ALI in mice, the decreased total cell number is followed by increased protein and neutrophils.3.2. Baseline lung transcripts that differ between male and female C57BL/6J miceLung mRNA from male and female mice exposed to filtered air (control n\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0mice/sex) was analyzed by RNASeq. Compared to control female mice, control male mice had 88 increased and 66 decreased transcripts (Table S1, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454309). Of these, 14 increased and three decreased by more than 1.5\u2010fold. Because little is known about sexual dimorphisms of constitutive mRNA in the lung, transcripts with related functions with an adjusted p value\u00a0<\u00a00.05 but below a threshold of 1.5\u2010fold are included for this analysis.The greatest increased transcripts in control males as compared to control females were DEAD (Asp\u2013Glu\u2013Ala\u2013Asp) box polypeptide 3 Y\u2010linked (DDX3Y), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u00a0subunit 3\u00a0structural gene Y\u2010linked (EIF2S3), lysine (K)\u2010specific demethylase 5D (KDM5D), and ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat gene Y chromosome (UTY), which are products of genes located on the Y\u2010chromosome. Male mice had corresponding decreased DDX3X, EIF2S3X, KDM5C, KDM6A, which are products of X\u2010chromosome genes that escape X inactivation. Interestingly, DDX3X is critical to innate immunity and coordinates cell stress granule and the NLRP3 inflammasome functions.Other sexually dimorphic transcripts increased in male as compared to females included 5\u2010aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), which catalyzes the first step of heme biosynthesis and the hemoglobin genes, HBA\u2010A1, HBB\u2010BS, and HBB\u2010BT. Complement component 3 (C3) and C7 increased in male as compared to female mice. Similarly, xenobiotic metabolism transcripts carboxylesterase 1F (CES1F), CES1G, metallothionein 2 (MT2), cytochrome P450 family 2\u00a0subfamily e polypeptide 1 (CYP2E1), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1), and aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1\u00a0subfamily A2 (ALDH2A1) increased in male as compared to female mice. Four anti\u2010proteinase genes, serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3\u00a0M (SERPINA3\u00a0M), SERPINA3N, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) were greater in male as compared to female mice.Transcripts decreased in male as compared to female mice included eight associated with cilia including dynein axonemal heavy chain 6 (DNAH6), DNAH10, and anterior gradient 3 (AGR3). Also, noteworthy, adrenomedullin (ADM) was decreased in males as compared with females. The resulting protein has several functions including vasodilation and regulation of hormone secretion.3.3. Increased DEGs pathway analysisAn analysis of KEGG murine pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) categories of Biological Process and Molecular Function was performed comparing the transcriptional responses of male and female C57BL/6J mice following acrolein exposure (n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mice/sex) as compared to filtered air exposure (control n\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0mice/sex) (Figure \u200b(Figure4).4). To identify pathways that were common in both males and females, we first identified DEGs that were increased in both male and female mice (Table S2, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454321). Common to both males and females were 4050 protein\u2010coding DEGs of which 3787\u00a0had known function and were used for pathway analysis. The total number of enriched KEGG murine pathways equaled 129 pathways that included several stress response pathways, for example, MAPK, IL\u201017, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways, as well as ubiquitin\u2010proteasome system\u2010related proteins, that is, chaperones, ubiquitin ligases, and proteasome components. The most enriched GO Biological Process was Protein modification by small protein removal (GO:0070646) and the most enriched GO Molecular Function was RNA binding (GO:0003723).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 4Differentially expressed genes altered in mouse lungs following acrolein exposure. Mice were exposed to air (control) (n\u00a0=\u00a06/sex) or 50\u00a0ppm acrolein (n\u00a0=\u00a08/sex) for 30\u00a0min and returned to filtered air. Lungs were collected 6\u00a0h after exposure and transcripts were analyzed by RNASeq. Transcripts that (Blue) decreased or (Yellow) increased by absolute value twofold and adjusted p value\u00a0<\u00a00.5 were arranged by centroid linked hierarchical clustering using Gene Cluster 3.0 and visualized by Java TreeView. (Left panel) Each column is one mouse (n\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0male and 8 female) and each row is one transcript (n\u00a0=\u00a01991) with enlarged cluster in which female mice had an uneven (Cluster A middle panel) decreased or (Cluster B right panel) increased response as compared to male miceIn the results that follow, transcripts that differed either in males or in females were used to identify pathways and ontologies (with exemplar transcript symbols presented in parenthesis). We identified pathways for the 671 DEGs of which 609\u00a0had known functions that increased only in males (Table S3, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454312). No KEGG murine pathway was enriched. The only enriched GO Biological Process was Maturation of SSU\u2010rRNA (GO:0030490) (adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). No GO Molecular Function ontology was enriched.Following acrolein exposure, 252 DEGs increased more in males than females of which 239\u00a0had known function and included increased myeloperoxidase (1.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43\u00a0log2 fold adj. p\u00a0<\u00a00.04) and neutrophilic granule protein (2.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31\u00a0log2 fold adj. p\u00a0<\u00a01.1E\u00a0\u2212\u00a006). Neither transcript was significantly altered in female mice (adj. p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). These indicators suggest an increase in neutrophil infiltration in male mice. In recent studies in humans, profiling studies have identified MCP\u20103 (CCL7), IP\u201010 (CXCL10), IL\u20106 (IL6), and other cytokines as predictors for the progression and severity of ALI, which increased more in males than females (McElvaney et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). We, therefore, compared the lung transcripts of CCL7, CXCL10, and IL6 in male and female mice. Each increased more in male than female mice (Figure \u200b(Figure5).5). In contrast, IL10 increased more in female mice. Thus, the IL6:IL10 ratio was 5.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.69 for males and 1.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 for females (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Open in a separate windowFIGURE 5Lung cytokines altered in male compared to female mice following acrolein exposure. Mice were exposed to air (control) (n\u00a0=\u00a06/sex) or 50\u00a0ppm acrolein (n\u00a0=\u00a08/sex) for 30\u00a0min and returned to filtered air. Lungs were collected 6\u00a0h after exposure and transcripts were analyzed by RNASeq. Chemokine (C\u2013X\u2013C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7 aka MCP\u20103), chemokine (C\u2013C motif aka IP\u201010) ligand 10 (CXCL10), interleukin 6 (IL6), increased more in male as compared to female mice. In contrast, IL10 increased more in female as compared to male mice. *Significantly different between sexes as determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by one\u2010way analysis of variance with Holm\u2013Sidak all pairwise multiple comparison procedureThe DEGs that increased more in male than female mice were enriched in 12\u00a0KEGG pathways including Glutathione metabolism (GCLC, GCLM, GPX2, GSR, GSS, GSTA1, A2, and O1), Ferroptosis (FTL1, FTH1, SLC3A2, and SLC7A11), and Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (ALDH1A3, ALDH3A1, CBR3, CYP1B1, and GSTs) (Table S4, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454306). Thirty\u2010two GO Biological Process pathways were enriched including Cellular response to oxidative stress (GO:0034599) and Glutathione metabolic process (GO:0006749) and included increased transcripts in the Glutathione metabolism KEGG pathway. Similarly, the single enriched GO Molecular Function ontology was Glutathione transferase activity (GO:0004364).The 1217 increased DEGs occurring only in females contained 1123 protein\u2010coding DEGs with known function (Table S5, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454318). The enriched 26\u00a0KEGG murine pathways included Oxidative phosphorylation (ATP1A4, COX10, and NDUFA10), Phagosome (CALR, COMP, FCGR4, H2\u2010D1, ITGAM, MRC1, and SCARB1), Lysosome (ACP5, ARSB, CTSK, CTSW, LAPTM5, and SLC11A1), and Natural killer cell\u2010mediated cytotoxicity (H2\u2010K1, IFNAB, KLRA4, KLRA7, KLRC1, KLRC2, KLRK1, NFATC2, PRF1, and ZAP70). The most enriched of 74 enriched GO Biological Process was Extracellular matrix organization (GO:0030198) (A2\u00a0M, COL4A5, FN1, HSPG2, ITGA4, LUM, and TNC) and most enriched of 14 enriched GO Molecular Function was Integrin binding (GO:0005178) (ACTN2, ADAMTS8, ANGPTL3, LTBP4, P4HB, VCAM1).Differentially expressed genes increased more in females as compared to males numbered 376 of which 358\u00a0had known function (Table S6, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14456352). These DEGs were enriched in 44\u00a0KEGG pathways including T cell receptor signaling pathway (CD3D, CD28 CTLA4, ICOS, ITK, LAT, and PDCD1) and Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (CD6, CDH15, CLDN 22, and SDC4). The enriched GO Biological Process pathways numbered 105 and included Cellular response to cytokine stimulus (GO:0071345) (CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CSF3, and CSF3R). The enriched GO Molecular Function included Cytokine activity (GO:0005125) (CXCL16, IL10, and OSM).3.4. Decreased DEGs pathway analysisPathways that were common to males and females contained 3483 DEGs with a known function that were decreased both in male and female mice (Table S7, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454315). Four KEGG pathways were enriched and included Peroxisome (ABCD1, ACOX3, ACSL3, CROT, DDO, DECR2, MVK, NUDT7, PEX6, 10, and 26, and PXMP2 and 4) and Fanconi anemia pathway (FANCA, B, C, F, G, and L, MH1, and TELO2). Twelve GO Biological Process ontologies were enriched and included cilium assembly (GO:0060271) (ATAT1, BBS1, 7, and 10, CC2D2A, CENPJ, DNAAF1, FOXJ1, MKKS, RSPH4A, VANGL2, 10 CEP, and 9 IFT transcripts), and DNA repair (GO:0006281) (ALKBH2, CHEK2. DDB2, DNA2, ENDOV, ERCC2 and 3, GTF2H2, 3, and 4, RAD9A, 50, 51, 52, and 9A, RFC2, WRN, XRCC1, and 9 POL transcripts). No GO Molecular Function was enriched significantly.The 797 decreased DEGs in only male mice included 713 transcripts with known function. The three enriched KEGG murine pathways included Protein digestion and absorption (ATP1A3, PRCP, and SLC16A10) (Table S8, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454324). No GO Biological Process or Molecular Function ontology was enriched. Following acrolein exposure, 560 DEGs with 555 of known function decreased more in males as compared to females. Three KEGG pathways that were enriched in decreased DEGs included Wnt signaling pathway (FZD2, WNT2, WNT3A, WNT7A, VANGL2) and Cytokine\u2010cytokine receptor interaction (CCR2, CSF2, CX3CR1, CXCR311, IL27RA, IL9R, and TNFSF10 and 13) (Table S9, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14454327). No GO Biological Function ontologies were enriched and three GO Molecular Function ontologies included death receptor activity (GO:0005035) (CD27, EDA2R, NGFR, and TNFRSF1B, 8, and 14).Differentially expressed genes decreased only in females equaled 993 of which 876\u00a0had known function. No enrichment was present in KEGG pathways or GO Molecular Function pathway. Two GO Biological Processes included cilium movement (GO:0003341) (ARMC4, GAS8, and DNAH3, 9, and 11) and nucleotide\u2010excision repair (GO:0006289) (ERCC1, ERCC6, POLD3, R2B. R2F, and R2J) (Table S10, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14456355). Similarly, 164 DEGs with 145 of known function that decreased more in females than in males did not reveal any enrichment in KEGG pathways. The decreased transcripts were enriched in one GO Biological Process ontology: cilium organization (GO:0044782) (CATIP, DNAH5, and DNAH6) and two GO Molecular Function ontologies including ATP\u2010dependent microtubule motor activity (GO:1990939) (KIF27, and DNAH5, 6, and 10) (Table S11, https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14456358).3.5. H3.3\u00a0histone B (H3F3B) and PPBP transcripts and protein increased during ALIA key difference between males and females was increased neutrophil in male mice as indicated by BAL and transcriptome analyses. Increased neutrophils in the lung can lead to extracellular traps consisting of histones, DNA, and platelet aggregates, which are an indication of the severity of lung injury (Bdeir et al., 2017; Xu, Zhang, Pelayo, et al., 2009). These studies (Xu, Zhang, Pelayo, et al., 2009) demonstrated that extracellular histones mediated mortality of mice in lipopolysaccharide, TNF, or cecal ligation and puncture models of sepsis. Also, the platelet protein PPBP (aka CXCL7) mediated acid\u2010induced ALI (Bdeir et al., 2017). To evaluate ALI progression, lung RNA was isolated from male and female C57BL/6J control and exposed mice 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0h after exposure to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein. H3F3B and PPBP transcript levels were assessed by qRT\u2010PCR analysis (Figure \u200b(Figure6).6). H3F3B and PPBP transcripts increased by 3\u00a0h after exposure in male and female mice compared to control mice. The transcript increase in acrolein exposed mice was maintained up to 12\u00a0h post\u2010exposure. H3F3B transcript was higher at 3 and 12\u00a0h after exposure in male mice compared to female mice. PPBP transcript was higher at 12\u00a0h after exposure in male mice compared to female mice.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 6Lung H3.3\u00a0histone B (H3F3B) and pro\u2010platelet basic protein (PPBP) transcripts increased in acrolein exposed male and female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were exposed to air (control) or 50\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min and returned to filtered air. Lungs were collected 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0h after exposure. H3F3B and PPBP transcripts were analyzed by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR). H3F3B (Top panel) and PPBP (Bottom panel) transcripts increased by 3\u00a0h after exposure and remained elevated up to 12\u00a0h after exposure compared to control. (Values are Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard error of means [SEM], n\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0mice/group). *Values are increased compared to control, \u2020increased in female compared to male (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) as determined by one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Holm\u2013Sidak all pairwise multiple comparison procedureTo examine the time course of H3F3B protein increase, control, 3 and 12\u00a0h BAL samples from male and female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein were assessed by Western blotting (Figure \u200b(Figure7).7). H3F3B protein was detected in 12\u00a0h BAL from acrolein exposed mice but not in 3\u00a0h BAL samples, suggesting time\u2010dependent H3F3B protein accumulation. To exclude the possibility that the observed BAL H3F3B or PPBP protein increase was simply as a consequence of the increased BAL protein in acrolein exposed mice compared with control mice, plasma H3F3B and PPBP protein levels were assessed (Figure [Link], [Link], https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14946405). Albumin, IgG, and hemopexin increased and haptoglobin decreased in BAL from acrolein exposed mice compared to control mice whereas albumin, IgG, and hemopexin slightly decreased in acrolein exposed plasma samples. Following acrolein exposure, due to dysregulated alveolocapillary barrier function, hemopexin moves from the region of high concentration in the vasculature to the alveoli. In contrast, haptoglobin which is induced in the lung by acrolein crosses from the alveoli into the vasculature. Compared to control mice, H3F3B and PPBP proteins increased in both BAL and plasma samples from acrolein exposed mice. This indicates that the increased BAL H3F3B and PPBP levels are due to acrolein exposure and not simply due to increased permeability into the alveoli due to respiratory barrier dysfunction.Open in a separate windowFIGURE 7Delayed H3.3\u00a0histone B (H3F3B) protein detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of acrolein exposed male and female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein for 30\u00a0min and returned to filtered air. BAL (35\u00a0\u00b5l/lane) from control or acrolein exposed mice was collected 3 or 12\u00a0h after exposure and analyzed by Western blotting for H3F3B protein. Haptoglobin was included to demonstrate protein loading 4.\u2003DISCUSSIONExposure to high acrolein concentrations can lead to death within hours. In one case report, a 4\u2010year\u2010old boy died due to smoke inhalation from an overheated fryer (Gosselin et al., 1979). Histopathology indicated massive cellular desquamation of the bronchial lining and the cause of death was attributed to acrolein inhalation. Exposure to 10 and 150\u00a0ppm acrolein has been estimated to cause death within minutes (Einhorn, 1975; Henderson & Haggard, 1943). Although reported human fatalities due to acrolein per se are rare, acrolein is one of the toxic components of smoke (Vos et al., 2008; Dost, 1991; Eiserich et al., 1995). Inhalation injury was associated with increased mortality in burn patients (Belenkiy et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2017; Veeravagu et al., 2014).Previously, Conklin et al. determined that 210\u2013275\u00a0ppm acrolein (30\u00a0min) produced death within 24\u00a0h, which was lethal to male mice whereas 90% of female mice survived (Conklin et al., 2016). In our study, we determined 50\u00a0ppm for male mice and 75\u00a0ppm for female mice (30\u00a0min) produced death when monitored for 120\u00a0h. Strain differences in sensitivity to acrolein have been reported (Leikauf et al., 2011). However, in both the Conklin and our studies, C57BL/6J mice of the same strain obtained from the same supplier (Jackson Laboratory) were tested. Differences in sample size, observational frequency, exposure systems, or housing conditions may explain these differences.Mouse lethality due to acrolein inhalation was delayed, in general, by 24\u00a0h or longer. Thus, analysis of key acrolein\u2010induced lung pathophysiologic responses was performed within the first 24\u00a0h after exposure. One of the early changes determined following acrolein exposure was reduced BAL cell number, including in female mice exposed to the sublethal, but toxic, dose of 50\u00a0ppm acrolein. The cell number decrease caused by acrolein exposure was followed by time\u2010dependent cell number increase. In female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein, but not in male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm or female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein, the total BAL cell number returned to control levels by 16\u00a0h after exposure.The total cell number increase after acrolein exposure was accompanied by a neutrophil increase. The percentage of neutrophils in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein was lower than the percentage of neutrophils in male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein and female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein. Previous studies reported suppression of pulmonary immune defense against bacterial and viral infection in mice subjected to prolonged acrolein exposure (Astry & Jakab, 1983; Green, 1985; Jakab, 1977, 1993; Li & Holian, 1998). The acute reduced BAL cell number is suggestive of compromised alveolar macrophage surveillance in the lungs. Improved restoration of alveolar cell number in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm may contribute to the resolution of the injury and reduce lethality. The observed increase of IL10, a resolving cytokine, in female mice is consistent with this possibility. The resolution of ARDS in sepsis patients was associated with an increased number of macrophages (Steinberg et al., 1994). However, a consistent trend of a higher polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration has been observed in patients who died compared with those who lived (Steinberg et al., 1994).Transcriptome profiling identified several pathways that were shared by male and female mice following 50\u00a0ppm acrolein exposure. Males and females had increased Th17 responses as indicated by increased IL17C, IL17F, and S100A8. However, male mice displayed greater neutrophil, glutathione metabolism, and oxidative stress responses than females. Females displayed greater macrophage\u2010mediated responses, which was indicated by augmented oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, and lysosome pathways in the RNASeq analysis. This is consistent with the return of total cells in female mice following exposure to 50\u00a0ppm measured at 16\u00a0h. Lung CCL7 (aka MCP\u20103), CXCL10 (aka IP\u201010), and IL6 transcripts also increased more in male compared with female mice, whereas IL10 increased more in female mice as compared with male mice. Thus, the IL6:IL10 ratio, which is an indicator of ALI disease severity (McElvaney et al., 2020), increased more in male mice than female mice following acrolein exposure. The utility of the IL6:IL10 ratio as a predictor of outcome in other forms of ALI seems to warrant further investigations. The faster recovery of BAL total cell count and increased IL10, a macrophage\u2010derived anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine, suggest that a restorative macrophage response occurs sooner in females than male mice.Total and induced BAL protein changes occur in a time\u2010dependent manner in acrolein exposed mice. Increased total BAL protein was less in female mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein compared to male mice exposed to 50\u00a0ppm acrolein and female mice exposed to 75\u00a0ppm acrolein. Increased BAL protein is likely due to the high abundance of blood proteins such as albumin and IgG leaking into the alveolar space. However, protein leak from the alveoli into the blood compartment also is implicated by increased plasma haptoglobin in acrolein exposed mice compared with control mice (Figure [Link], [Link], https://figshare.com/s/10.6084/m9.figshare.14946405).Acrolein exposure increased H3F3B and PPBP transcripts at 3\u00a0h after acrolein exposure and the increased transcript level was maintained up to 12\u00a0h. These results suggest that H3F3B and PPBP transcript increase may contribute to extracellular H3F3B and PPBP protein increase. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this work is the first to report a possible link between H3F3B and PPBP transcript and protein increases in acrolein exposed mice. The BAL protein change also reflects a change in composition as exemplified by increased H3F3B and PPBP proteins in BAL of acrolein exposed mice. Increased H3F3B and PPBP proteins were detected in the delayed phase of acrolein\u2010induced lung injury in BAL and plasma. It is not clear whether the delayed detection of the proteins is due to sensitivity limitation of the detection system, delayed appearance of the proteins in the extracellular compartment, or low protein concentration. PPBP protein was also detected in control mouse plasma. Platelet activation due to inherent technical manipulation during blood collection or thereafter cannot be ruled out. Multiple H3F3B protein bands were detected by Western blotting, the faster migrating forms likely being cleaved H3F3B protein species (Nair et al., 2018). No protein signal was obtained when antibodies against H1, H2 or H4\u00a0histone proteins were used for Western blotting.Acrolein\u2010induced neutrophil, H3F3B and PPBP protein increases may represent lung responses to counter suppression of antibacterial immune defense by acrolein. PPBP, also known as CXCL7, induces neutrophil chemotaxis and activation (Bdeir et al., 2016). Histones and histone\u2010derived peptides display anti\u2010bacterial activity (Hirsch, 1958; Kim et al., 1996; Zhdan\u2010Pushkina & Dronova, 1976). Histones are components of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that bind Gram\u2010positive and \u2010negative bacteria and function in bacterial sequestration and killing (Brinkmann et al., 2004). However, the increased neutrophil, H3F3B and PPBP protein may be double\u2010edged because it can be pathologic. Although lung injury can occur in neutropenic patients (Maunder et al., 1986; Ognibene et al., 1986) and recruitment of active neutrophils to the air space may not cause a significant change in permeability (Martin et al., 1989), excessive infiltrating neutrophils can augment injury (Grommes & Soehnlein, 2010; Potey et al., 2018). Also, available data indicate that circulating extracellular histones can be major mediators of death in liver malfunction and sepsis (Cheng et al., 2019; Xu, Zhang, Monestier, 2011; Xu, Zhang, Pelayo, et al., 2009). Circulating histone H3\u00a0level has been associated with fatal outcomes in septic patients (Xu, Zhang, Pelayo, et al., 2009). Deletion of PPBP and PF4\u00a0genes that encode the two most abundant platelet chemokines protected mice against acid\u2010induced ALI pathogenesis (Bdeir et al., 2016). Acrolein induced histone H3 citrullination and NETs formation in a co\u2010culture of neutrophils and HepG2 cells (Arumugam et al., 2018).Animal studies and clinical findings suggest acrolein\u2010induced platelet activation can lead to thrombosis (Sithu et al., 2010; Zirak et al., 2019). The delayed neutrophil and NETs protein increases in acrolein\u2010exposed mice were followed by or associated with lethality timing. Acrolein\u2010induced H3F3B and PPBP protein may thus contribute to the progression and development of acrolein\u2010induced ALI. Because acrolein increased critical components of NETs, that is, total protein, neutrophils, H3F3B, and the platelet protein PPBP, acrolein may induce NETs and or clot formation.One limitation of this study is that the estrus cycles of females were not synced. Previously, we reported that in the development of sex\u2010specific silica\u2010induced fibrosis the response of ovariectomized mice was similar with that of males compared to wild\u2010type females (Latoche et al., 2016). To examine the role of sex hormones and their receptors in acrolein\u2010induced lung injury use of ovariectomized mice would be informative.In conclusion, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern ALI development and progression may help to develop therapeutic drugs to treat ALI or counter its progression. Acrolein\u2010induced ALI progression was investigated in differentially sensitive female and male C57BL/6J mice. ALI progression severity was marked by increased BAL total protein associated with increased H3F3B and PPBP lung transcripts and H3F3B and PPBP BAL and plasma proteins. The molecular basis of acrolein\u2010induced H3F3B and PPBP transcript changes has not been investigated. If transcriptional regulation mediates the acrolein exposure\u2010induced transcript changes, more investigation is needed to determine the responsible cell type for PPBP transcript change.
