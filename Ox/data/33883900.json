Disease diagnosis and estimating patients at higher risk is important for the optimal management during the pandemic. This study aimed to identify the predictors of mortality and length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients.                  Methods:                       A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2020 and August 2020 at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. All patients who were admitted and had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients' demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Multiple logistic/linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of death and length of stay at the hospital.                  Results:                       A total of 706 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19. The mean age was 48.0 years (SD: 15.6 years). More than half of the patients (68.5%; n= 292) were males. The median duration of stay at the hospital was 6.0 days (IQR: 300-10:00). The prevalence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among the patients was 3.0% (n= 21). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age (AOR: 1.05; 1.02-1.09), patients with end-stage renal disease (AOR: 6.44; 2.20-18.87), low Oxygen saturation SPO2 (AOR: 9.92; 4.19-23.50), D.dimer >0.5 (AOR: 13.31; 5.45-32.49), ESR>10 mm/h (AOR: 4.08; 1.72-9.68), Ferritin>400mcg/L (AOR: 18.55; 6.89-49.96), and Procalcitonin>0.5ug/L (AOR: 8.23; 1.81- 37.40) were associated with a higher risk of death among patients with COVID-19. Patients with VTE (AOR: 12.86; 3.07- 53.92) were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19.                  Conclusion:                       Hospitalised COVID-19 patients have multiple negative consequences in terms of their laboratory findings, signs and symptoms.

MethodsStudy Design and ParticipantsA retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Al-Noor Specialist Hospital is a tertiary hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and it is part of the Ministry of Health. The description of the study settings and the hospital has been described previously.11 All patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR samples were obtained through a nasopharyngeal swap. All patients were admitted between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020 and they were followed up for a time to assess the clinical outcome; and the final date of follow-up was August 15, 2020. Data collection were between March 2020, and August 2020. All patients who were admitted and had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study.Data Collection and Study VariablesData were collected from patients\u2019 files and electronic records using a unique medical record number (MRN) for each patient. All data were collected, reviewed and checked by a medical team, including medical residents and a consultant pulmonologist. Data included the patient\u2019s demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and laboratory findings. Data were collected at the time of admission to the hospital. Patients were classified according to their severity based on the following category: mild, moderate, severe and, critically severe disease. The definition of these categories has been described previously.11OutcomesThe primary outcome was predictors of patients\u2019 admission to an intensive care unit. Secondary outcomes were to identify predictors of length of hospital stay and mortality.Ethical Approval and Consent-to-ParticipateThe study protocol and study methodology were approved by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Institutional Review Board (IRB), as well as the hospital (No H-02-K-076-0920-386). Patients informed consent were obtained and patients were informed that their clinical data would be used for clinical or research purposes, while keeping all their personal information confidential. The ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were adhered to during collection, handling, and storage of data, and all care was taken to protect patient confidentiality.Statistical AnalysisDescriptive statistics were used to describe patients\u2019 demographics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Independent sample t-test was used to compare the mean value for continuous variables. A Chi-squared test/Fisher test was used to compare proportions for categorical variables. Multiple logistic/linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of death and length of stay at the hospital, and a confidence interval of 95% (p < 0.05) was applied to represent the statistical significance of the results. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 25.0 software (SPSS Inc.). ResultsPatients\u2019 Clinical CharacteristicsTable 1 below shows the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at presentation to the hospital. A total of 706 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19. The mean age was 48.0 years (SD: 15.6 years). More than half of the patients (68.5%; n= 292) were males. The majority of them were having mild to moderate cases. Twenty-five patients (3.5%) reported working in the healthcare sector. More than half of them (61.9%; n= 435) were non-Saudi. Around 17.4% (n= 122) reported a history of smoking. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (DM) (36.0%, n= 254), hypertension (30.2%, n= 213), and coronary heart diseases (10.9%; n= 77). Around 9.8% of the patients (n= 69) reported a recent travel history. Regarding the severity of the patients\u2019 case, 33.7% were mild, 30.3% were moderate, and 24.2% were severe, and 11.8% were critical and required intensive care unit (ICU) care. Regarding patients\u2019 vital signs upon arrival to hospital, 47.3% (n= 334) had fever (body temperature > 38 \u00b0C), 9.5% (n= 67) had respiratory rate (RR) more than 30, 22.1% (n= 156) had SPO2 < 93, and 4.2% (n= 30) had heart rate (HR) > 125.\nTable 1Patients Demographic Characteristics at PresentationDemographicsAll Patients (n=706)Mild Cases (n= 238)Moderate Cases (n= 214)Severe Cases (n= 171)Critical Cases (n= 83)P-valueAge (years; mean (SD))48.0 years (15.6)41.4 years (14.1)48.4 years (14.3)51.5 years (16.0)58.4 years (14.5)0.001**Gender (Total n= 426, Mild n= 168, Moderate n= 154, Severe n= 58, Critical n= 46)\u2003Male No. (%)292 (68.5)116 (69.0)96 (62.3)49 (84.5)31 (67.4)0.022*Healthcare worker (Total n= 705, Mild n= 238, Moderate n= 214, Severe n= 170, Critical n= 83)\u2003Yes No. (%)25 (3.5)11 (4.6)6 (2.8)6 (3.5)2 (2.4)0.691Nationality No. (%)\u2003Non-Saudi435 (61.6)160 (67.2)135 (63.1)90 (52.6)50 (60.2)0.026*Smoking history (Total n= 698, Mild n= 234, Moderate n= 212, Severe n= 169, Critical n= 83)\u2003Yes No. (%)122 (17.3)46 (19.7)31 (14.6)36 (21.3)9 (10.8)0.102Body mass index (BMI)\u2003BMI >30 kg/m288 (15.8)18 (11.1)27 (16.7)30 (18.9)13 (17.8)0.250Comorbidities No. (%)\u2003Diabetes mellitus254 (36.0)55 (23.1)72 (33.6)73 (42.7)54 (65.1)0.000***\u2003Hypertension213 (30.2)38 (16.0)68 (31.8)62 (36.3)45 (54.2)0.000***\u2003Coronary artery disease77 (10.9)4 (1.7)19 (8.9)35 (20.5)19 (22.9)0.000***\u2003End-Stage Renal Disease64 (9.1)8 (3.4)20 (9.4)13 (7.6)23 (27.7)0.000***\u2003Asthma28 (4.0)11 (4.6)7 (3.3)8 (4.7)2 (2.4)0.730\u2003Congestive heart failure27 (3.8)1 (0.4)5 (2.3)13 (7.6)8 (9.6)0.000***\u2003Cerebrovascular accident17 (2.4)1 (0.4)07 (4.1)9 (10.8)0.000***\u2003Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease14 (2.0)2 (0.8)4 (1.9)5 (2.9)3 (3.6)0.320\u2003Chronic liver disease4 (0.6)01 (0.5)1 (0.6)2 (2.4)0.095\u2003Cancer3 (0.4)01 (0.5)02 (2.4)0.024*Tracing history No. (%)\u2003Recent travel history (Total n= 704, Mild n= 238, Moderate n= 212, Severe n= 171, Critical n= 83) (Yes) No. (%)69 (9.8)30 (12.6)32 (15.1)6 (3.5)1 (1.2)0.000***\u2003Contact with traveller (Total n= 706, Mild n= 238, Moderate n= 214, Severe n= 171, Critical n= 83) (Yes) No. (%)84 (11.9)38 (16.0)39 (18.2)5 (2.9)2 (2.4)0.000***\u2003Contact with COVID-19 patient (Total n= 706, Mild n= 238, Moderate n= 214, Severe n= 171, Critical n= 83) (Yes) No. (%)324 (45.9)127 (53.4)101 (47.2)65 (38.0)31 (37.3)0.007**Vital signs upon arrival to hospital No. (%)\u2003Fever (\u2265 38\u00b0C) (Yes) No. (%)334 (47.3)71 (29.8)84 (39.3)127 (74.3)52 (62.7)0.000***\u2003Respiratory rate > 30 (Yes) No. (%)67 (9.5)1 (0.4)1 (0.5)38 (22.2)27 (32.5)0.000***\u2003SPO2<93 (Yes) No. (%)156 (22.1)6 (2.5)6 (2.8)97 (56.7)47 (56.6)0.000***\u2003Heart rate>125 (Yes) No. (%)30 (4.2)04 (1.9)8 (4.7)18 (21.7)0.000***Outcome No. (%) (n= 680)\u2003Deceased54 (7.6)001 (0.6)53 (71.6)0.000***\u2003Not recovered3 (0.4)0003 (4.1)0.000***\u2003Recovered623 (91.6)235 (100)214 (100)156 (99.4)18 (24.3)0.000***Respiratory diseases\u2003Venous thromboembolism21 (3.0)03 (1.4)4 (2.3)14 (16.9)0.000***\u2003Pneumonia (radiologically)450 (63.6)0215 (99.5)155 (90.6)80 (96.4)0.000***Open in a separate windowNotes: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Abbreviations: COVID-19, coronavirus disease-2019; SD, standard deviation; No, number (frequency).Fever was the most common symptom at presentation (72.4%, n= 511), followed by cough (63.0%, n= 445), and shortness of breath (56.4%, n= 398) (Table 2).

Regarding patients\u2019 kidney function tests, 17.2% of them had Creatinine>115 umol/L, and 24.3% had Urea>6.04 mmol/L (Table 3).Factors Associated with DeathThe median duration of stay at the hospital was 6.0 days (IQR: 300\u2013 10:00). The duration of stay in the hospital ranged from one day to 55 days. The prevalence rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among the patients was 3.0% (n= 21). More than half of the patients (63.6%; n= 450) pneumonia radiologically. At the end of the follow-up period, a total of 623 patients (91.6%) recovered. Three patients (0.4%) did not recover at the end of the follow-up, and 7.6% of the patients (n= 54) deceased while the remaining either transferred to other facility or still in the hospital, at last, follow up. The severity of the cases affected the recovery rate and mortality rate in a statistically significant way (p>0.001) (Table 1).In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following risk factors were associated with a higher risk of death among patients with COVID-19. Age (AOR: 1.05; 1.02\u20131.09), high respiratory rate (RR) (AOR: 153.90; 9.80\u20132416.60), low Oxygen saturation SPO2 (AOR: 9.92; 4.19\u201323.50), D.dimer >0.5 (AOR: 13.31; 5.45\u201332.49), ESR>10 mm/h (AOR: 4.08; 1.72\u20139.68), Ferritin>400mcg/L (AOR: 18.55; 6.89\u201349.96), and Procalcitonin>0.5ug/L (AOR: 8.23; 1.81\u201337.40). Patients with VTE (AOR: 12.86; 3.07\u201353.92) were at higher risk of death due to COVID-19. End-stage renal diseases were identified to increase the risk of COVID-19.

DiscussionIn this cross-sectional study, we investigated the predictors of mortality and length of stay in hospital among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The key findings of this study are that age, patients with chronic comorbidities, patients with VTE and radiological evidence of pneumonia, and higher D-dimer values were important risk factors that were associated with a higher risk of death and increased length of stay in hospital.Our findings revealed the significant impact of age and chronic conditions on the mortality rate and the length of hospital stay. It comes as no surprise that the escalated rate of mortality and prolonged hospital stay was associated with older patients. Thus this study substantiates the previous findings of the literature.12 This may also be due to their weak immune system and some behavioural responses in the measures taken.13,14 Chronic diseases demonstrate a significant influence on the outcomes; diabetes patients were more vulnerable to fatal consequences and longer hospitalisation compared to non-DM patients, which is consistent with results reported from the previous study.15 Hypertensive patients have a propensity to express high mortality rate and stay hospitalised longer. Likewise, pre-existent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events carry a high risk of death and a longer duration of hospitalisation. The effect of SARS-COV-2 on the vascular endothelium could be explained by the current understanding that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptors as the entry sites of SARS-COV2 as shown in different studies.16,17There are several explanations for these results, Renin-Angiotensin system (RAAS) and inflammatory cytokines have been mentioned as mediators in severe outcomes among hypertensive patients.18 Furthermore, the frequent utilisation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can lead to a decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increase in the expression of ACE2 in the lungs which eventually facilitates the invasion of Covid-19 virus,19,20 nonetheless this still controversial as illustrated by other studies.21 Further, the severe viral virulence may lead to high oxygen demand, physiological and reflex tachycardia and aggravates the manifestation of coronary artery diseases accompanied by respiratory distress, finally, unfavourable outcomes will present.22 Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD) were also more susceptible to fatal consequences either death or a longer hospitalisation period. The confirmed laboratory findings emphasise the negative impact of Covid-19 on liver functions. The previous study elucidated the high mortality rate among CLD patient who they are Covid-19 infected.23,24 Our findings also highlighted the high mortality rate and the long period of hospitalisation among cancer patients. The nature of cancer and the antineoplastic agents compromise the immune system. Consequently, it spikes the probability of lethal and severe infection of the Covid-19 virus among these patients. Moreover, the redundant clinical visits for follow up and chemotherapy dose also expose the patients to the infection.25The hypercoagulability of Covid-19 patients was observed and confirmed by laboratory findings. Venous thrombus embolism was one of the poor outcomes among covid-19 patients with a significant correlation and high odd ratios. The severe infection and long bed-ridden interval in ICU dysregulate the homeostasis of the cascade system by activating the inflammatory cytokines.26 Not withstanding, the pathogeneses of VTE-induced by Covid-19 are complex and multifactorial. Our study provides further evidence of Covid-19 pneumonia as a predictor for the high mortality rate and prolonged hospitalisation. These findings support the aggressive preventive measures that be taken to halt the mortality rate among these patients.In our study, we found no significant difference between blood group type and the risk of death. However, we found a significant difference in the duration of hospital stay for patients with blood group O. Previous reports showed a reduced prevalence of Covid-19 infection in blood group O.27 However, this was later contradicted, as some other published report suggested that there is no link between Covid-19 infection and type of blood group.28,29 Future studies on a larger scale and different populations are needed to investigate this association.In our study and similar to published reports, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were found to be at higher risk for a severe outcome,30 likely due to the fact that these patients usually have reduced lung function along with various comorbidities.31 Interestingly, on the other hand, patients with pre-existent asthma did not have a risk of worse outcome,32 and this could be partly explained by the lower expression of ACE2 in asthmatic bronchial epithelium.33Obesity is one of the major comorbidities to be considered. Above increasing the risk of different complications such as DM, liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases, we observed obesity also increases the mortality rate and the demand on intensive care facilities among SARS-COV-2 patients, which augments the findings in a previous systematic review.34 Henceforth, obesity is one of the potential predictors for the study outcomes. However, the underlying mechanism behind the bad prognosis of obese patients still unknown.We believe that our results are similar to the literature, it may help in earlier risk stratification, and triage of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital and in reducing the overload on emergency departments visits and intensive care units in order to facilitate COVID-19 cases and other emergency care cases. Some factors identified in this study, such as older age and comorbidities, may help policymakers and guidelines in their recommendations about prioritising patients based on their symptoms and may help to improve the patient\u2019s care. Furthermore, the founded risk factors might be helpful in establishing a scoring system that can be applied to predict mortality and appropriate management plan.This study has some limitations. First, the study population only included patients from a single-centre hospital in Saudi Arabia. Second, the cross-sectional study design restricted our ability to identify causality between study variables. ConclusionHospitalised COVID-19 patients have multiple negative consequences in term of their laboratory findings, signs and symptoms. Age and chronic conditions have a significant impact on the mortality rate and the length of hospital stay among COVID-19 patients. Earlier risk stratification of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital is recommended. References1. Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.
