Graphical Abstract\n INTRODUCTIONMulti-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) interact with a wide array of accessory proteins that modulate every step of RNA synthesis. Among them, NusG/Spt5 is the only regulator that is conserved in all domains of life (Werner, 2012). NusG/Spt5 co-localizes with elongating RNAP across most genes (Mayer et al., 2010; Mooney et al., 2009a), typically enhancing transcript elongation by reducing RNAP pausing (Herbert et al., 2010; Hirtreiter et al., 2010) but also connecting transcription to diverse cellular processes through contacts with other regulators of RNA biogenesis (Werner, 2012). For example, Escherichia coli (Eco) NusG contacts ribosomes (Saxena et al., 2018), termination factor \u03c1 (Li et al., 1993), or NusA (Said et al., 2017); metazoan Spt5 interacts with the negative regulator NELF to stimulate promoter-proximal pausing (Yamaguchi et al., 1999), as well as many other interaction partners (Werner, 2012; Hartzog and Fu, 2013). Specialized NusG/Spt5 paralogs, generated during evolutionary diversification, have been identified in bacteria (Goodson et al., 2017) and eukaryotes (Bies-Etheve et al., 2009).Bacterial NusG is a two-domain monomer. Spt5 forms a heterodimer with Spt4 in archaea and eukaryotes (Werner, 2012). The NusG N-terminal domain (NGN), present in all NusG/Spt5-family proteins, contacts RNAP and is followed by a single KOW (Mooney et al., 2009b) domain in bacteria and archaea, five KOWs and a C-terminal phosphorylated repeat region in eukaryotes, and two more KOWs in metazoans and some plants. The NGN contacts the \u03b2\u2032/RPB1 clamp helices (CH) and \u03b2/RPB2 on opposite sides of the active site cleft in RNAPs from all domains of life (Bernecky et al., 2017; Ehara et al., 2017; Hirtreiter et al., 2010; Klein et al., 2011; Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011; Sevostyanova et al., 2011; 2008), although an alternative location has been proposed based on a NusG-RNAP co-crystal structure lacking nucleic acids (Liu and Steitz, 2017). By bridging the cleft, the NGN has been proposed to function as a processivity clamp that ensures uninterrupted RNA synthesis.The NGN alone modulates RNAP pausing (Belogurov et al., 2007; Hirtreiter et al., 2010; Mooney et al., 2009b). The KOWs serve as contact sites for interacting proteins, and the Spt5 KOWs also contact RNA or DNA (Bernecky et al., 2017; Ehara et al., 2017) to aid elongation or stabilize binding to the EC (Crickard et al., 2016).Life\u2019s only universal transcription factor plays a central role in pausing, underscoring the importance of pausing in gene regulation. Pausing is proposed to aid timely recruitment of transcription regulators, guide nascent RNA folding, oppose chromatin silencing and genome instability, permit termination, and match the rate of transcription to those of other coupled processes, such as translation and splicing (Mayer et al., 2017). However, excessive pausing may lead to arrest, particularly in protein-coated DNA such as eukaryotic chromatin. Indeed, yeast Spt5 assists RNAP progression through the nucleosome (Crickard et al., 2017). Although recent results have suggested biophysical mechanisms for pausing via uncoupling of RNA and DNA translocation and for pause stabilization via rotation of an RNAP \u201cswivel module\u201d (Kang et al., 2018), the mechanism by which NusG/Spt5 suppresses pausing is unclear.Eco RfaH is a NusG/Spt5 paralog that does not stimulate \u03c1, but exhibits strong anti-backtracking activity (like NusG/Spt5), can recruit ribosomes to nascent RNAs via its KOW, and unlike NusG, can counteract the pause-stabilizing effects of nascent RNA hairpins (pause hairpins; PHs) (Kolb et al., 2014). RfaH is recruited early in transcription units containing the ops sequence, which is exposed in the non-template strand DNA (nt-DNA) of paused elongation complexes (PECs) (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002).To investigate how interactions of NusG/Spt5/RfaH suppress backtrack and PH-stabilized pausing, and to visualize sequence-specific interaction of RfaH with the nt-DNA of ECs, we determined single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Eco NusG or RfaH bound to an ops-containing EC (opsEC). We used the structures to design and interpret biochemical experiments that probe the interactions of RfaH and NusG with ECs and the mechanism by which they modulate pausing. Together, our results suggest a molecular model for the effects of NusG/Spt5-family proteins on transcription elongation. RESULTSCryo-EM structures of a NusG-opsEC and an RfaH-opsECFor cryo-EM structure determination of the NusG-opsEC and RfaH-opsEC, we designed an RNA-DNA scaffold based on the A20 (20mer RNA transcript with A at the 3\u2032-end) scaffold used previously for cryo-EM structure determination of an Eco EC (Kang et al., 2017) except containing the ops sequence in the nt-DNA (Figure 1A). NusG suppresses pausing at and downstream from ops, whereas RfaH induces a strong pause 1\u20132 nucleotides after the ops pause (A20 on the opsEC scaffold; Figure 1A) (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000; 2002). To ascertain that the opsEC obtained by direct reconstitution on the ops-scaffold supports NusG and RfaH function, we monitored RNA extension of A20 RNA in the presence of NusG or RfaH. In agreement with data obtained on standard templates (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002, Mooney et al., 2009b), NusG reduced RNAP pausing downstream of ops whereas RfaH inhibited escape due to specific ops/RfaH interactions (Figure S1). We conclude that NusG or RfaH bind the directly reconstituted opsEC and modulate its function as expected.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Structures of the NusG-opsEC and RfaH-opsECA. Nucleic acid scaffold sequence used for cryo-EM. The same sequences were used in the NusG-opsEC (left) and RfaH-opsEC (right) structures. Disordered segments in each structure are faded. The nt-DNA ops sequence (nt-DNA \u221211 to +1, colored yellow for the RfaH-opsEC and numbered according to the ops position) forms a short hairpin that interacts specifically with RfaH but was disordered in the NusG-opsEC (left).B. The cryo-EM density maps for the NusG-opsEC (left, 3.7 \u00c5 nominal resolution, low-pass filtered to the local resolution) and RfaH-opsEC (right, 3.5 \u00c5 nominal resolution, but shown is the 3.7 \u00c5 nominal resolution map with full-length RfaH, low-pass filtered to the local resolution) are rendered as transparent surfaces and colored as labeled. Superimposed are the final models; proteins are shown as backbone ribbons, the nucleic acids as sticks. The domain organization of NusG (green) and RfaH (magenta) are indicated above. The disordered NusG-KOW is shown in white with a dashed green outline.See also Tables S1, S2, and Figures S1 \u2013 S7.We used cryo-EM to determine the Eco NusG-opsEC and RfaH-opsEC structures (Figure 1B). The NusG-opsEC structure was determined to a nominal resolution of 3.7 \u00c5 (Figures 1B, S2A, S3, S4, Table S1). Local resolution calculations indicate that the central core of the structure, including much of NusG, was determined to 3.0 \u2013 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (Figure S3H, S4A, B). Although full-length NusG was used, cryo-EM density for only the NusG-NGN was observed; the flexibly tethered NusG-KOW was disordered (Figure 1B). Density corresponding to the NusG-KOW could not be recovered by focused classification approaches (Scheres, 2012). The NusG-NGN alone is necessary and sufficient for NusG-mediated modulation of RNAP pausing (Belogurov et al., 2007; Hirtreiter et al., 2010; Mooney et al., 2009b) whereas the NusG-KOW links the EC to ribosomes (Saxena et al., 2018) and \u03c1 (Li et al., 1993; Mooney et al., 2009b).The RfaH-opsEC structure was determined to a nominal resolution of 3.5 \u00c5 (Figures S2B, S5, S6, Table S1). Local resolution calculations indicate that the central core of the structure, including much of RfaH, was determined to 2.9 \u2013 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (Figure S5H, S6). Although full-length RfaH was used, cryo-EM density for only the RfaH-NGN was observed in the 3.5 \u00c5 resolution map. A particle classification focused on the flap tip, RNA exit channel, and upstream duplex DNA gave rise to a second RfaH-opsEC reconstruction from a sub-population of the particles (3.7 \u00c5 nominal resolution) that revealed cryo-EM density corresponding to the RfaH-KOW (Figures 1B, S2B, Table S1).The RNAPs of the NusG- and RfaH-opsEC structures were very similar to previously reported Eco EC cryo-EM structures (Kang et al., 2017), with rmsds of 0.64 \u00c5 (2,666 C\u03b1\u2032s aligned) and 0.59 \u00c5 (2,732 C\u03b1\u2032s aligned), respectively. The NusG- and RfaH-opsEC structures were nearly as similar to an EC structure as two independently determined EC structures were to each other (Table S2).Initial examination of the structures revealed several key observations. First, both NusG and RfaH-NGN bound to the same location on the upstream face of the EC cleft, covering the single-stranded nt-DNA and upstream fork junction of the transcription bubble (Figure 1B). The location and orientation of the NGN domains is consistent with biochemical analyses of NusG and RfaH interactions with the EC (Belogurov et al., 2007; 2010; Mooney et al., 2009b) as well as structural analyses of archaeal and metazoan Spt4/5 complexes (Bernecky et al., 2017; Ehara et al., 2017; Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011) (Figures S7A, B). Our structures are not consistent with a crystal structure of an Eco NusG/core RNAP complex (Liu and Steitz, 2017) that lacks nucleic acids so may not be relevant to NusG function; further, the binding mode of the NusG-NGN seen in our NusG-EC structure (Figure 1B) is precluded by neighboring symmetry-related RNAP molecules in this crystal lattice, explaining the discrepancy (Figure S7C).Second, binding of the NusG- and RfaH-NGNs constrain the path of the upstream duplex DNA and the upstream segment of the single-stranded nt-DNA, facilitating rewinding of the upstream duplex DNA and possibly explaining the suppression of backtrack pausing (Figure 2). In the RfaH-opsEC, the ops sequence in the single-stranded nt-DNA forms a short hairpin-like structure that interacts sequence-specifically with RfaH (Figures 3, S6A). Space exists in the NusG-opsEC to accommodate the nt-DNA but NusG lacks the capacity to interact sequence-specifically with the DNA and much of the ops sequence in this context is disordered (Figure 1A).Open in a separate windowFigure 2NusG and RfaH remodel and stabilize the upstream duplex DNAA.

Structure-based sequence alignment of the Eco RfaH- and NusG-NGN, numbered above and below, respectively. Identical residues are shaded dark blue, homologous residues light blue. The colored dots on top (RfaH) and bottom (NusG) denote RNAP and ops contacts (color-coded as shown in the legend). The RNAP structural elements that the RfaH (top) and NusG (bottom) residues interact with are noted.Third, the NusG- and RfaH-NGNs make contacts with the RNAP that bridge across the upstream face of the active site cleft (Figures 4A, B), stabilizing the overall active conformation of the EC and disfavoring the swiveled conformation associated with PH-stabilized pausing (Figure 4C) (Kang et al., 2018). The stabilization of the active EC RNAP conformation by RfaH is stronger than NusG (Figure 5A\u2013F), and RfaH is more effective at inhibiting hairpin-stabilized pauses than NusG (Figure 5C) (Belogurov et al., 2009). We will describe these structural features in the context of the roles of NusG and RfaH in transcription elongation, and present biochemical evidence for their roles.Open in a separate windowFigure 4NusG-NGN and RfaH-NGN interactions with RNAP bridge the active site cleft and are incompatible with PH-induced RNAP swivelingA.

Effect of NusG on stimulation of pausing by 0.5 \u03bcM asRNA. NusG decreased the slower, apparently swiveled fraction of U19 only modestly, from 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 to 0.49 \u00b1 0.02.

RfaH-NGN but not NusG decreased the ratio of CTR reporter disulfides on the hisPEC scaffold (containing PH; Kang et al., 2018), indicating that RfaH-NGN but not NusG shifts the equilibrium from the swiveled to the unswiveled RNAP conformation. Data shown are means and s.d. from at least three replicates.G. RfaH and NusG retention on the EC. A linear DNA template with a T7A1 promoter, the ops element, and an EcoRI site 128 nt downstream from the opsP site was immobilized on streptavidin beads via a biotin on the nt-DNA (top). A cleavage-deficient EcoRIQ111 protein (RB) was bound to roadblock the transcribing RNAP. Halted ops10 (G42) ECs were formed by step-wise transcription with NTP subsets and incubated with radiolabeled RfaH or NusG. After washing away the unbound RfaH/NusG, transcription was resumed by addition of all NTPs with or without an excess of unlabeled NusG, which is expected to bind to RNAP upon dissociation of the pre-bound factor. G42 and roadblocked ECs were washed to remove unbound RfaH/NusG and analyzed by scintillation counting.H. RfaH (magenta bars) and NusG (green bars) binding to the immobilized ECs. The residual factor binding to the roadblocked ECs is expressed relative to that observed with the G42 EC, which is defined as 100%. Data shown are means and s.d. from three biological replicates.NusG and RfaH remodel the EC nucleic acids, chaperoning upstream duplex DNA reannealing and explaining the suppression of backtrack pausingAfter separating from the RNA-DNA hybrid, the template strand DNA (t-DNA) in the EC is directed out of the RNAP active site cleft through a channel between the \u03b2\u2032lid and the \u03b2\u2032rudder where it immediately anneals with the nt-DNA (\u221210 position, Figures 1A, \u200b,2A)2A) (Kang et al., 2017). The upstream DNA duplex in the EC is relatively unconstrained and mobile, making few interactions with the RNAP (Kang et al., 2017; Korzheva et al., 2000).Other than RfaH-R11, which interacts with the nt-DNA phosphate backbone at the \u221211 position (ops T1; Figure 3A), stable interactions between NusG or RfaH and upstream duplex DNA are not observed and consequently the DNA segment is mobile. Nevertheless, both NusG and RfaH alter the path of the upstream duplex DNA, decreasing the subtended angle with the downstream duplex DNA (Figures 2B, C, S4C, D).Psoralen intercalates into double-stranded DNA at TA steps and forms a T-T interstrand crosslink when activated by UV light. Psoralen crosslinking efficiency serves as a probe of DNA structure since psoralen intercalates most efficiently in stable, B-form duplex DNA. Based on results of psoralen crosslinking and fluorescence quenching, Turtola and Belogurov (2016) proposed that the \u221210 base pair at the upstream fork-junction of the EC transcription bubble was distorted, as later observed in the EC structure (Kang et al., 2017). We found that NusG increased the efficiency of psoralen crosslinking at the upstream fork-junction more than two-fold over the EC (Figure 2D), as observed previously (Turtola and Belogurov, 2016). RfaH increased the crosslinking efficiency more than 3.5-fold over the EC. Taken together, these results suggest that NusG and RfaH chaperone and stabilize the formation of the \u221210 bp.RfaH recognizes ops as an nt-DNA hairpinIn the EC, the ten nucleotides of single-stranded nt-DNA (\u22129 to +1) in the transcription bubble span from the \u221210 to +2 nucleotides, which are base-paired in the upstream and downstream DNA duplexes, respectively (Figure 1A). Repositioning of the upstream duplex DNA by NusG/RfaH reduces the distance separating the \u221210 and +2 nt-DNA phosphates from 41 \u00c5 in the EC to 33 \u00c5 in the NusG-opsEC and 30 \u00c5 in the RfaH-opsEC. In the RfaH-opsEC, a short hairpin with a two base-pair stem forms in the single-stranded nt-DNA and this DNA structure is specifically recognized by RfaH (Figures 3A, S6A).Using the ops sequence numbering (Figure 3A) rather than the scaffold numbering, ops T1 and G2 are base-paired as part of the upstream DNA duplex (Figure 3A). C3 forms a Watson-Crick base pair with G8, while G4 and A7 participate in a Saenger type XI base pair (Saenger, 1984) to form the ops hairpin stem. G5 stacks on the upstream face of G4 while T6 is flipped out of the base stack. C9 stacks with the downstream face of G8. The rest of the ops sequence (G10T11G12) is single-stranded and does not interact with RfaH but interacts with RNAP as in the EC structure.Other than RfaH-K10, which hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) with G4(O6), the base pairs C3:G8 and G4:A7 do not make extensive base-specific interactions with RfaH \u2013 these bases are conserved in the ops sequence because of their role in forming the ops hairpin stem, the geometry of the which sets up extensive base-specific interactions of RfaH with G5 and T6 (Figures 3A, S6A). The three H-bonding atoms of the Watson-Crick edge of G5 (N2, N1, O6) H-bond with the backbone carbonyls of RfaH-N70 and V75, and with the side chain of R16, respectively. The three H-bonding atoms of the T6 base (O2, N3, O4) participate in H-bonds with the side chains of R73, H20, and R23, respectively. The aliphatic chain of RfaH-Q24 makes van der Waals contact with the T6 exocyclic methyl. All of the RfaH side chains that make base-specific H-bonds (K10, R16, H20, R23, R73) are important for RfaH function. Single Ala substitutions of these residues interfere with RfaH recruitment at ops (Figure 3) (Belogurov et al., 2010).In the structure-based alignment with NusG, RfaH-K10, H20, R23, and R73 correspond to NusG-F15, S25, E28, and P87, each unable to participate in the equivalent interactions with ops (Figure 3B). The disposition of the DNA in the NusG-opsEC seems compatible with ops hairpin formation (Figure 2B) but cryo-EM density for most of the ops sequence (C3 to C9) is completely absent and the DNA is presumed to be disordered.NusG and RfaH contacts bridge the RNAP active-site cleftThe RNAP is like a crab claw, with one pincer comprising primarily the \u03b2\u2032 subunit, and the other primarily the \u03b2 subunit (Figure 4) (Zhang et al., 1999). A large cleft between the pincers contains the active site and accommodates nucleic acids in the EC (Gnatt et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2017; Korzheva et al., 2000; Vassylyev et al., 2007). The clamp (Figure 4A), a mobile structural module that makes up much of the \u03b2\u2032 pincer (Gnatt et al., 2001), undergoes swinging motions that open the channel to allow entry of nucleic acids during initiation, or that close the channel around the DNA and RNA-DNA hybrid to enable processive elongation (Chakraborty et al., 2012; Gnatt et al., 2001).The NusG and RfaH-NGN bind the upstream face of the EC, bridging the active-site cleft by contacting the clamp of the \u03b2\u2032 pincer and the protrusion and lobe of the \u03b2 pincer (Figures 4A, B, S4A, B, S6B, C). NusG and RfaH interactions with RNAP are analogous (Figure 3B) with one exception \u2013 the first \u03b1-helix of NusG (residues 18\u201334) interacts with the protrusion while the same region of RfaH (residues 13\u201324) interacts with the ops hairpin, which inserts between RfaH and the protrusion (Figure 4B). Despite these additional NusG/RNAP interactions, overall the NusG/RNAP and RfaH/RNAP interface buries a similar total surface area (NusG, 1,150 \u00c52; RfaH, 1,160 \u00c52). After RNAP escape from ops, the specific RfaH-ops contacts are lost and RfaH may establish interactions with the protrusion, significantly increasing the RfaH/RNAP interaction interface and affinity relative to NusG. Consistently, RfaH outcompetes NusG for EC binding in vitro even when NusG-NGN is at a 10-fold excess over RfaH, and excludes NusG from RNAP transcribing ops-operons in the cell (Belogurov et al., 2009) despite NusG being present in large excess (50 to 100-fold) over RfaH in vivo (Schmidt et al., 2016).The primary interaction determinant for both NusG and RfaH is the clamp helices (CH; Figures 4A, B, S4B, S6C), consistent with previous analyses (Belogurov et al., 2007; 2010; Mooney et al., 2009b; Sevostyanova et al., 2008). Both factors interact with the GL (Figures S4A, S6B). However, interactions of the RfaH HTT motif (residues 65\u201367; Figures 3B, S6B) with the GL are required for RfaH function (Belogurov et al., 2010; Sevostyanova et al., 2011), whereas deletion of the GL supports normal NusG activity (Nandymazumdar et al., 2016; Turtola and Belogurov, 2016).Both NusG and RfaH contacts are incompatible with RNA pause hairpin-induced EC swivelingRfaH efficiently suppresses both backtrack- and PH-stabilized pausing (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002; Kolb et al., 2014). Nascent PHs can increase pause lifetimes tenfold or more (Toulokhonov et al., 2001). Recent cryo-EM studies revealed that formation of the hisPH in the RNAP RNA exit channel induced a previously unseen global conformational change in the RNAP termed \u2018swiveling\u2019 (Kang et al., 2018). In the swiveled RNAP, the clamp, shelf, and other structural features of the \u03b2\u2032 pincer (called the swivel module; Figure 4C) undergo a concerted rotation of about 3\u00b0 about an axis roughly parallel with the BH (perpendicular to the RNA-DNA hybrid). A previously described conformational state of the RNAP termed \u2018ratcheting\u2019 has in common with swiveling the rotation of the shelf and other structural features of the \u03b2\u2032 pincer, but RNAPs in the ratcheted conformation have an open clamp (Tagami et al., 2010; Weixlbaumer et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 1999). PH-induced swiveling is unique in combining rotation of the shelf and other structural features with rotation of the closed clamp (Kang et al., 2018). Swiveling is thought to increase pause lifetimes by allosterically inhibiting trigger-loop folding (Kang et al., 2018). Swiveling alters the relative positions of the \u03b2\u2032 and \u03b2 pincers which the bound RfaH bridges (Figure 4B), and modeling reveals that RfaH binding is incompatible with the swiveled state (Figure 4C).Modeling indicates that NusG binding is also incompatible with the swiveled conformation. The greater inhibition of PH action and of RNAP swiveling by RfaH is likely due to stronger binding of RfaH to ECs. To explore these differences, we used a scaffold resembling the ops cryo-EM scaffold but containing his pause sequences that form an RNA-duplex-stabilized pause upon addition of an antisense RNA oligonucleotide (asRNA; Figure 5A) (Kang et al., 2018). RfaH, but not NusG, can outcompete binding of an 8mer asRNA to a similar scaffold (Kolb et al., 2014); thus, we used a 7mer asRNA to maximize the ability of NusG to compete (Figure 5A).C18 ECs formed one nucleotide upstream of the pause were reacted with UTP and GTP (Figure 5B). In the absence of ligands, the fraction of U19 present as a function of time was triphasic (Figure 5C). A small fraction of ECs failed to pause (bypass fraction). Most U19 ECs entered the elemental paused state and exhibited slow addition of G20. A small fraction of ECs added G20 even more slowly; we propose that this fraction may represent the swiveled state. Added at 2 \u03bcM, the 7mer asRNA stimulated pause dwell time at U19 ~20-fold. Whereas 125 nM RfaH could suppress pause stimulation by 2 \u03bcM asRNA almost as effectively as 2.5 \u03bcM RfaH, 2.5 \u03bcM NusG had little or no effect on asRNA action (Figure 5C). When asRNA was lowered to 0.5 \u03bcM, 2.5 \u03bcM NusG gave a minimally detectable effect (Figure 5D).Consistent with an ability of RfaH but not NusG to suppress asRNA-induced swiveling, a cysteine-triplet reporter (CTR) that detects swiveling by a shift in disulfide bond formation by \u03b2\u2032-lid Cys258i from \u03b2Cys1045i to \u03b2Cys843 (Kang et al., 2018) reported RfaH but not NusG suppression of the swiveled conformation on a hisPEC scaffold (Figures 5E, F).To ask if this reduced effect of NusG could be explained by weaker binding of NusG vs. RfaH to ECs, we performed a NusG-RfaH competition experiment (Figures 5G, H). RfaH or NusG was bound to ECs halted at ops by step-wise walking of RNAP after initiation on a T7 A1 promoter template. Upon addition of all four NTPs, ECs moved along the template until encountering a roadblock generated by a noncleaving mutant EcoRI endonuclease bound 128 nt downstream of ops (Pavco and Steege, 1990), so ops-RfaH contacts were no longer possible. When the roadblocked ECs were washed with buffer, radiolabeled RfaH was retained to a greater extent than radiolabeled NusG (Figure 5H). Almost no radiolabled NusG was retained when unlabeled NusG competitor was present at 5 \u03bcM, whereas most radiolabeled RfaH remained bound in the presence of NusG competitor. These data establish that, once associated with an EC at ops, RfaH remains bound even in the absence of ops contacts, whereas NusG is readily lost. In support of our structural observations that, once RNAP escapes from ops, the RfaH-EC interactions likely bury a larger surface area than NusG-EC interactions, these results are consistent with much weaker NusG-EC binding thatn RfaH-EC binding.RfaH KOW domain binds RNAP and remodels the upstream duplex DNA path and RNA exit channel like Spt5The positioning of Spt5 KOW1-5 domains on the surface of RNAPII by cryo-EM (Bernecky et al., 2017; Ehara et al., 2017) suggests that the Spt5-KOWs may contact upstream DNA, RNA, and transcription regulators from fixed locations on the EC, rather than on freely rotating tethers. The RfaH-KOW binds RNAP at a location similar to that occupied by Spt5-KOW1 (Figure 6). The side-chain contacts and orientations of Spt5-KOW1 and RfaH-KOW are not conserved, but their locations relative to RNAP and upstream duplex DNA are similar. For both structures, the open face of the large KOW domain \u03b2 sheet faces away from RNAP, but the RfaH-KOW is rotated ~45\u00b0 and shifted about 10 \u00c5 toward the RNA exit channel relative to Spt5-KOW1. Both KOWs appear to guide the upstream duplex DNA. Spt5-KOW1 contains an eukaryotic-specific insertion called L1 that increases the extent of upstream DNA contact. These DNA contacts are consistent with increased protection of upstream DNA against exonuclease III digestion by Spt4/5 (Crickard et al., 2016).Open in a separate windowFigure 6Comparison of the RfaH-opsEC with an Spt5-RNAPII-ECA.

(top) Schematic showing the domain organization of Spt5 (Bernecky et al., 2017), with amino acid residues numbered and disordered regions denoted as a dashed line.(bottom) overall view of the human Spt5-RNAPII-EC (Bernecky et al., 2017). This structure also includes Spt4, which has been removed for clarity. The RNAP is shown as a molecular surface, the nucleic acids in CPK format (colored as shown in the key or as labeled). Spt5 is shown as a backbone ribbon with a transparent molecular surface, colored as in the schematic above. The Spt5-KOW1-L1 domain binds directly above the upstream DNA duplex and next to the Rbp2 flap/wall. Also see (Ehara et al., 2017).See also Figure S8.Both RfaH-KOW and Spt5-KOWs affect the RNA exit channel, whose mouth is formed in part by the tip of a module called the flap in bacteria and the wall in eukaryotes. The bacterial flap tip is capped with an \u03b1-helix that contacts either \u03c3 factors or NusA and is required for their function (Guo et al., 2018; Kuznedelov et al., 2002). In contrast, the flap tip appears to be dispensable for human RNAPII transcription (Palangat et al., 2011). Both the bacterial flap tip and the eukaryotic wall/flap tip are flexible and often disordered in crystal and cryo-EM structures, but strikingly both are contacted by RfaH-KOW/Spt5-KOW1. These contacts pull the bacterial flap tip away from the RNA exit channel into a novel location (Figure 6). It is possible that this change contributes to RfaH effects on PH-stabilized pausing, since deletion of the flap tip eliminates PH stimulation of pausing (Hein et al., 2014). Given the lack of documented function for the wall, its contacts with Spt5-KOW1 may not have significant effects on transcription. However, the Spt5-KOWx-4 domain binds near the path of the exiting RNA immediately upstream from a bacterial PH, and would partially clash with the location of the PH (Kang et al., 2018). Thus, Spt5 KOWx-4 could inhibit formation of nascent RNA structures in the RNAPII RNA exit channel or shift to accommodate them. DISCUSSIONTranscription in all cellular organisms is a focal point for the regulation of gene expression. Although the central enzyme of transcription, the multisubunit cellular RNAP, is evolutionarily conserved across all life, this conservation does not extend to regulation. For instance, each RNAP faces similar mechanistic challenges during promoter-specific initiation but relies on evolutionarily unrelated basal factors (Werner, 2012). Similarly, unrelated factors control the elongation and termination phases of the transcription cycle, with one exception. NusG/Spt5 elongation factors are structurally (Figure 6) and functionally homologous, making them the only transcription regulators that are conserved in all domains of life (Werner, 2012). We report here key insights into the mechanistic basis for regulation of RNAP function by this family of universal regulators from cryo-EM structures of Eco NusG and its operon-specific paralog Eco RfaH engaged with an EC (Figure 1). We show that (i) NusG and RfaH stabilize base-pairing of the upstream duplex DNA (Figure 2), providing an explanation for their ability to suppress backtrack pausing; (ii) RfaH achieves operon-specificity in part by specific recognition of an ops DNA hairpin in the exposed nt-DNA of the EC transcription bubble (Figures 3, S6A), and (iii) RfaH suppresses PH-stabilized pausing by preventing RNAP swiveling (Figures 4, \u200b,55).The mechanistic basis for NusG/RfaH regulation of RNAP pausingRNAP pausing is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in all organisms (Mayer et al., 2017). The mechanistic and structural basis for transcriptional pausing is understood in greatest detail in bacteria (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000; Kang et al., 2018). Pauses initially arise when specific sequences prevent complete translocation of the DNA, resulting in an offline elemental paused EC (ePEC) with post-translocated RNA transcript but pre-translocated DNA (Kang et al., 2018). This hybrid state resists NTP binding, providing time for the ePEC to isomerize into other, more long-lived paused states: (i) Backtracking prolongs pausing by disengaging the RNA 3\u2032-terminus from the RNAP active site (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000); (ii) PH formation stabilizes the RNAP in the swiveled conformation (Figure 4C), prolonging pausing by allosterically inhibiting trigger-loop folding required for the optimal active site configuration (Kang et al., 2018). The results presented here allow us to propose mechanistic hypotheses for the complex effects of NusG and RfaH on RNAP elongation.The primary effects of NusG-NGN and RfaH-NGN on the EC are i) stabilizing base-pairing in the upstream duplex DNA (NusG and RfaH; Figure 2), and ii) inhibiting RNAP swiveling (RfaH; Figures 4C, \u200b,5).5). Formation of the ePEC is associated with an incompletely translocated intermediate without major conformational changes in the RNAP (Kang et al., 2018), and accordingly NusG and RfaH are not known to have strong effects on the ePEC (Larson et al., 2014).Both NusG and RfaH increase the overall transcription elongation rate by suppressing backtrack pausing (Belogurov et al., 2010; Turtola and Belogurov, 2016). Our structural and biochemical analyses (Figure 2) support the conclusion that both NusG and RfaH suppress backtracking by stabilizing the \u221210 bp of the upstream duplex DNA, as proposed by Turola and Belogurov (2016) for NusG.Both NusG and RfaH binding are sterically incompatible with RNAP swiveling (Figure 4C), but only RfaH efficiently suppresses PH-stabilized pausing (Figure 5C). The results of the CTR assay (Figures 5E, F) and the NusG/RfaH retention assay (Figures 5G, H) argue that the binding energy of RfaH to the EC is sufficient to inhibit PH formation and suppress RNAP swiveling, whereas NusG binding energy is not. These results explain how RfaH can suppress PH-stabilized pausing by counteracting RNAP swiveling, whereas NusG cannot.Adaptations in RfaH confer operon-specificityIn bacteria, the specialized NusG paralog RfaH has maintained key functions of the NGN (EC binding, suppression of backtrack pausing) and tethered KOW (ribosome interactions) but has developed an elaborate regulatory mechanism to confer operon-specificity. These include specific recognition of an ops-hairpin in the exposed nt-DNA of the transcription bubble (Figures 3A, S6A) and a molecular switch that auto-inhibits RfaH-NGN-RNAP interactions in the absence of ops recognition (Belogurov et al., 2007) (Figures 7A, B).Open in a separate windowFigure 7Comparison of NusG, RfaH, and Spt5 action as elongation regulatorsA. On most bacterial operons, NusG (G, green) associates with RNAP weakly until RNAP enters a protein-coding gene and NusG-KOW interaction with 30S is possible. Weak NusG interaction is sufficient to inhibit backtracking but not to inhibit PH-induced RNAP swiveling. When transcription and translation become significantly uncoupled, NusG activates Rho-dependent termination via NusG-KOW-Rho interaction.B. On ops-containing operons, RfaH (H, magenta) is recruited by contacts to the ops hairpin in the exposed nt-DNA (yellow; Figure 3A). The refolded RfaH-KOW domain interacts with RNAP and the tightly bound RfaH excludes NusG, inhibits backtracking, and inhibits PH stimulation of pausing by preventing RNAP swiveling (Figure 4C). RfaH associates with 30S similarly to NusG, but inhibits Rho indirectly upon significant transcription-translation uncoupling by excluding NusG.C. Spt4/5 (4 and 5, orange) associates with RNAPII in the promoter-proximal region though NusG homologous contacts of its NGN and of 5 its 7 KOWs. Spt5 inhibits backtracking, may inhibit swiveling and formation of nascent RNA structures, and mediates the regulatory switch between promoter-proximal pausing/attenuation and productive elongation in part through the actions of NELF and P-TEFb. The full set of Spt5 interactions involved in this switch as well as in downstream roles in mediating RNA maturation, chromatin modifications, recruiting of DNA repair factors, cell-cycle control, polyadenylation, and termination remains incompletely defined.The cryo-EM structure of the RfaH-opsEC represents the RfaH \u2018loading\u2019 complex, revealing the structural adaptations that allow specific ops-RfaH recognition (Figure 3). The auto-inhibitory RfaH C-terminal helical hairpin sterically blocks the protein-protein interactions between RfaH-NGN and the RNAP \u03b2\u2032 CH (Figure 4B) but would not interfere with ops-RfaH interactions. Presumably, pausing of the EC precisely at ops displays the ops hairpin in the nt-DNA to allow for RfaH recognition and establishment of RfaH/RNAP \u03b2 subunit interactions (Figure 4B). Thermal fluctuations of the RfaH auto-inhibitory helical hairpin allow RfaH-RNAP \u03b2\u2032 CH interactions, stabilizing the RfaH-NGN-EC interactions and freeing the RfaH-C-terminal domain (CTD) to refold into the KOW (Figure 1B). Unlike the NusG-KOW, which is disordered in our cryo-EM maps, the RfaH-KOW was pinned down through interactions with the EC in a sub-population of the particles (Figures 1B, \u200b,6A,6A, S2B), similar to the Spt5-KOW1-L1 domain (Figure 6B). Weak RfaH-KOW-EC interactions could help prevent the RfaH-CTD from competing with the RNAP \u03b2\u2032 CHs for RfaH-NGN interactions in the absence of other RfaH-KOW interactors, such as the ribosome (Figure 7B).The RfaH-NGN binds to the EC with a higher affinity than the NusG-NGN (Belogurov et al., 2009) (Figure 5H), a second adaptation that allows RfaH to function in an operon-specfic manner by excluding NusG from the RfaH-EC. Moreover, the tighter binding of the RfaH-NGN confers its ability to counteract RNAP swiveling, providing a mechanistic basis for the suppression of PH-stabilized pauses (Figures 5C, \u200b,7B7B).Complex roles of NusG/Spt5 factors in vivoThe in vivo roles of both NusG and Spt5 are complex. They both stimulate transcript elongation by RNAP over much of the genome, but more importantly for the cell they serve as recruitment platforms for accessory factors to coordinate transcription elongation with other cellular functions (Figure 7). For example, NusG plays a crucial role in \u03c1-dependent termination through direct NusG-KOW-\u03c1 interactions (Li et al., 1993) and functional/scaffolding roles in multiprotein assemblies that effect antitermination (Said et al., 2017).RfaH function is confined to transcription units containing an ops sequence in an upstream segment but is no less complex. RfaH uses its ability to suppress backtrack and RNA hairpin-stabilized pausing and to coordinate with the ribosome (but not \u03c1) through its KOW to ensure the efficient transcription of long operons.The control and release of promoter-proximal pausing by RNAPII is a major checkpoint for regulating gene expression in metazoans, and Spt4/5 (called DSIF in metazoa) plays a key role therein (Kwak and Lis, 2013). DSIF cooperates with the metazoan-specific NELF to enable promoter-proximal pausing (Yamaguchi et al., 1999), and is modified by P-TEFb to transition into an elongation activator that remains bound to the EC with incompletely understood roles during genic transcription (Kwak and Lis, 2013). A key question now is if DSIF and its regulatory partners control RNAPII pausing using similar mechanisms as those revealed here for NusG and RfaH. STAR METHODSCONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARINGS. A. Darst, ude.rellefekcor@tsradMETHODS DETAILSRNAP expression and purification for Cryo-EM Eco RNAP lacking the \u03b1CTDs was prepared as described previously (Twist et al., 2011). The \u03b1CTD has not been implicated in transcription control by NusG nor RfaH. Glycerol was added to the purified RNAP to 15% (v/v), and the sample was aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.NusG expression and purification NusG was purified from pRM1160. pRM1160 was generated by Gibson assembly of the wild-type nusG gene PCR amplified from Eco chromosomal DNA using primers 10224 and 10225 with a vector fragment amplified from pRM756 using primers 10226 and 10027. pRM1160 is kanamycin-resistant, contains the T7 promoter upstream of nusG, and encodes nusG followed by a precision protease cleavage site and ten histidine residues.To prepare full-length Eco NusG, plasmids encoding NusG with a C-terminal (His)6-tag were grown in Eco BL21 (DE3) in LB with 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.5, induced for protein expression by addition of IPTG to final concentration of 0.5 mM, grown for an additional 3 hours, then harvested by centrifugation at 17,600 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Harvested cells were resuspe nded in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, and lysed in a continuous flow French Press (Avestin, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The lysate was centrifuged (17,600 g, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C) and the sup ernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap IMAC column (GE healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with IMAC buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) with 30 mM imidazole, then eluted with an imidazole gradient to 250 mM. The protein eluted at about 70 mM imidazole and was inclubated with human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease to cleave the C-terminal (His)6-tag and dialyzed for overnight at 4 \u00b0C against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 00 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. The dialyzed and tag-cleaved protein was loaded onto a Hitrap Q (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and eluted with a NaCl gradient to 1 M. The protein eluted at about 200 mM NaCl and was subsequently purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. Additional glycerol was added to the purified NusG to 15% (v/v), and the sample was aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.RfaH expression and purification Wild-type Eco RfaH was expressed and purified as described previously (Vassylyeva et al., 2006), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.Purification and labeling of HMK-tagged RfaH and NusG Plasmids encoding NusG and RfaH with an N-terminal (His)6-tag and a protein kinase A recognition site (RRASV) were grown in Eco XJb (DE3) in LB with 40 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C to an OD 600 of 0.4, induced by addition of IPTG to final concentration of 0.2 mM, and grown at 18 \u00b0C overnight; L-arabinose w as added to 0.07% 2 hours before harvesting. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (18,000 g, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C), resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol and 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and incubated with 0.25 mg/ml of Lysozyme on ice for 30\u201340 minutes. The cells were then lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged (18,000 g, 30 minutes, 4\u00b0C) and the supernatant was loaded onto a gravity column with Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 500 mM NaCl, 5% Glycerol and 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed 20 mM imidazole. The proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient to 250 mM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 80 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) Glycerol and 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, directly loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin column, and eluted with an NaCl gradient to 1 M. The peak fractions were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen for storage at \u221280 \u00b0C.RfaH-opsEC and NusG-opsEC preparation for Cryo-EM Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), RNA oligonucleotides from GE Healthcare Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The nucleic acids for the ops-scaffold (Figure 1A) were dissolved in RNase-free water (Ambion/ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 0.2\u20131 mM. Template DNA and RNA were annealed at a 1:1 ratio in a thermocycler (95 \u00b0C for 2 min, 75 \u00b0C for 2 min, 45 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by steady cooling to 25 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min). The annealed RNA-DNA hybrid was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Purified Eco RNAP was buffer-exchanged over a Superose 6 INCREASE (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) column into 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT. The eluted protein was mixed with the pre-annealed RNA-DNA hybrid at a molar ratio of 1:1.3 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Nt-DNA and additional 5 mM MgCl2 was added and incubated for 10 min. RfaH or NusG (buffer exchanged over the Superose 6 INCREASE column in the same buffer as RNAP) was added to a molar ratio of 1:3 (RNAP:RfaH or RNAP:NusG). The complex was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) to 4.0\u20135.5 mg RNAP/ml concentration before grid preparation.Cryo-EM grid preparation Before freezing, CHAPSO was added to the samples to 8 mM final concentration. C-flat (Protochips, Morrisville, NC) CF-1.2/1.3 400 mesh gold grids were glow-charged for 15 s prior to the application of 3.5 \u03bcl of the complex sample (4.0\u20135.5 mg/ml protein concentration), then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot mark IV (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) with 100% chamber humidity at 22 \u00b0C.Cryo-EM data acquisition and processing for NusG-opsEC The grids were imaged using a 300 keV Titan Krios (FEI) equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Images were recorded with Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005) in counting mode with a pixel size of 1.07 \u00c5 and a defocus range of 0.8 to 2.5 \u03bcm (Figure S3C). Data were collected with a dose of 8 electrons/physical pixel/s. Images were recorded with a 10 s exposure and 0.2 s sub-frames (50 total frames) to give a total dose of 69.9 electrons/\u00c52. Structural biology software was accessed through the SBGrid consortium (Morin et al., 2013). Dose fractionated subframes were aligned and summed using Unblur (Grant and Grigorieff, 2015). The contrast transfer function was estimated for each summed image using CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015). From the summed images, particles were automatically picked in Gautomatch (Zhang, unpublished; see Key Resource Table), manually inspected, and then individually aligned using direct-detector-align_lmbfgs software (Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015). The aligned particles were subjected to 2D classification in RELION specifying 100 classes (Scheres, 2012), and poorly populated classes were removed, resulting in 514,900 particles (Figure S3D). These particles were 3D autorefined in RELION using a map of Eco elongation complex (EMD-8585; Kang et al., 2017), low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5 resolution as an initial 3D template. With this initial model, 3D classification was performed without alignment with a soft mask generated in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and RELION. The soft mask excluded flexible RNAP domains (SI1, SI3, flap tip helix, and single-stranded nucleic acids) of EC. Among the classes from the 3D classification, the best-resolved and most-populated class was 3D autorefined and subjected to the second 3D classification without alignment with the soft mask that was used in the first 3D classification. From this classification, the best-resolved class containing 171,900 particles was 3D autorefined with solvent flattening, and post-processed in RELION, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution (Figures S2A, S3F). Local resolution calculations (Figure S3H) were performed using blocres (Cardone et al., 2013).KEY RESOURCES TABLEREAGENT or RESOURCESOURCEIDENTIFIERBacterial and Virus StrainsEco BL21(\u03bbDE3)T-H/pEcrpo(HX-)ABCZ(Twist et al., 2011)N/AEco BLR \u03bbDE3NovagenEco XJb \u03bbDE3Zymo ResearchChemicals, Peptides, and Recombinant Proteins[\u03b1-32P]CTPPerkin ElmerCat# BLU008H[\u03b3-32P]ATPPerkin ElmerCat# BLU002ZBio-Rex 70 cation exchange resin, analytical grade, 100\u2013200 meshBio-RadCat# 14258423-([3-Cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPSO)Sigma-AldrichCat# C4695Dynabeads\u00ae MyOne\u2122 Streptavidin C1Dynal Biotech ASACat# 650.01HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pgGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 28989333HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pgGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 28989336HIS-Select\u00ae Nickel Affinity GelSigma-AldrichCat# M6611HiTrap IMAC HPGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 17092003HiTrap Q HPGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 171154018-MethoxypsoralenSigma-AldrichCat# M3501Nuclease-free water (not DEPC treated)AmbionCat# 4387936Polyethyleneimine, ~M.W.60,000, 50% wt.% aqueous solution, branched, Acros Organics 178572500Fisher ScientificCat# AC178572500Protein kinase A, catalytic subunitSigma-AldrichCat# P2645Superose 6 INCREASE 10/300 GLGE Healthcare Life SciencesCat# 29091596T4 polynucleotide kinaseNew England BiolabsCat# M0201\u0394\u03b1CTD Eco RNAP polymerase (cryo-EM samples)(Twist et al., 2011)N/ACTR RNAP: \u03b2\u20321045iC 258iC, \u03b2843CKang et al, 2018N/AEco NusG (cryo-EM)This paperEco NusG (transcription assays)(Mooney et al., 2009b)Eco PKA-tagged NusGThis paperEco RfaH(Vassylyeva et al., 2006)Eco RfaH-NGN (transcription assays)(Hein et al., 2014)Eco PKA-tagged RfaH(Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002)EcoRIQ111; a mutant variant of EcoRI used as a roadblock(Strobel et al., 2017)Critical Commercial AssaysDeposited DataCoordinates of Eco NusG-opsECThis paperPDB: 6C6UCoordinates of Eco RfaH-NGN-opsECThis paperPDB: 6C6TCoordinates of Eco RfaH-full-length-opsECThis paperPDB: 6C6SCoordinates of Eco EC(Kang et al., 2017)PDB: 6ALFCoordinates of Eco NusG-NGN(Mooney et al., 2009b)PDB: 2K06Coordinates of Eco RfaH-NGN(Belogurov et al., 2007)PDB: 2OUGCoordinates of Eco RfaH-KOW(Burmann et al., 2012)PDB: 2LCLCoordinates of E. coli hisPEC(Kang et al., 2018)PDB: 6ASXCoordinates of Human DSIF/Pol II-EC(Bernecky et al., 2017)PDB: 5OIKCoordinates of Pyrococcus furiosis Spt5-RNAP clamp domain(Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011)PDB: 3QQCCoordinates of Eco NusG/RNAP(Liu and Steitz, 2017)PDB: 5TBZCryo-EM map of Eco EC(Kang et al., 2017)EMD-8585Cryo-EM map of Eco NusG-opsECThis paperEMD-7351Cryo-EM map of Eco RfaH-NGN-opsECThis paperEMD-7350Cryo-EM map of Eco RfaH-full-length-opsECThis paperEMD-7349OligonucleotideshisPEC non-template DNA (6ASX)GCGTCCTATCGATCTTCGGAAGAGATTCAGAGIDTLab stock #10924hisPEC template DNA (6ASX)CTCTGAATCTCTTCCAGCACACATCAGGACGCIDTLab stock #10919his\nePEC G17 RNAUCAUCCGGCGAUGUGUGIDTLab stock #6593his\n7-nt antisense RNACCGGAUGIDTLab stock #12196NusG forward primerGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGTCTGAAGCTCCTAAAAAGIDTLab stock #10224NusG reverse primerGAACAGAACTTCCAACTCGAGGGCTTTTTCAACCTGGCTGIDTLab stock #10225opsEC non-template DNAGGGCTGCGGTAGCGTGACGGCGAATACCCIDTopsEC template DNAGGGTATTCGCCGTGTACCTCTCCTAGCCCIDTopsEC RNAGCAUUCAAAGCGGAGAGGUAGE Healthcare DharmaconTAops\nnt-DNAGAAACACCACCAGTAGGCGGTAGCGTGCGTTTTTCGTTCTTCCIDTTAops\nt-DNAGGAAGAACGAAAAACGCACGCTACCGCCTACTGGTGGTGTTTCIDTTAops\nRNAUUAUUCGGUAGCGUIDTEcoRI roadblockATAGGCAGTCATGGAATTCACCACTGGAAGATCTGAASigma-AldrichLab stock #2600T7A1 template primerBio-GGAGAGACAACTTAAAGAGASigma-AldrichLab stock #44T7 vector forwardCTTTTTAGGAGCTTCAGACATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAGTTAAACIDTLab stock #10226T7 vector reverse primerGAACAGAACTTCCAactcgagGGCTTTTTCAACCTGGCTGIDTLab stock #10227Recombinant DNApACYCDuet-1_Ec_rpoZTwist et al., 2011N/ApEcrpo(HX-)ABCZTwist et al., 2011N/ApIA244wild-type NusG with His6+HMK tag at the N-terminusThis workN/ApIA270wild-type RfaH with His6+HMK tag at the N-terminus(Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002)pIA349transcription template with T7A1 promoter followed by the ops and his pause signals(Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002)pIA900Wildtype RNAP overexpression plasmid with the TEV protease and His10-tags at rpoC-C-terminus(Svetlov and Artsimovitch, 2015)pRM1160pIA244wild-type NusG with His6+HMK tag at the N-terminusThis workN/ApIA270wild-type RfaH with His6+HMK tag at the N-terminus(Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002)pIA349transcription template with T7A1 promoter followed by the\nops\nand\nhis\npause signals(Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002)pVS12Wild-type RfaH fused to the chitin-binding and intein domains(Vassylyeva et al., 2006)pIA900Wildtype RNAP overexpression plasmid with the TEV protease and His10-tags at rpoC-C-terminus(Svetlov and Artsimovitch, 2015)pRM756RNAP overexpression plasmid.

Images were recorded with Serial EM (Mastronarde, 2005) in super-resolution counting mode with a super resolution pixel size of 0.650 \u00c5 and a defocus range of 0.8 to 2.4 \u03bcm (Figure S5B). Data were collected with a dose of 8 electrons/physical pixel/s (1.3 \u00c5 pixel size at the specimen). Images were recorded with a 15 s exposure and 0.3 s sub-frames (50 total frames) to give a total dose of 71.0 electrons/\u00c52. Dose fractionated subframes were 2 \u00d7 2 binned (giving a pixel size of 1.3 \u00c5), aligned and summed using Unblur (Grant and Grigorieff, 2015). The contrast transfer function was estimated for each summed image using CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015). From the summed images, particles were automatically picked in Gautomatch (Zhang, unpublished; see Key Resource Table), manually inspected, and then individually aligned using direct-detector-align_lmbfgs software (Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015). The aligned particles were subjected to 2D classification in RELION specifying 100 classes (Scheres, 2012), and poorly populated classes were removed, resulting in 389,200 particles (Figure S5C). These particles were 3D autorefined in RELION using a map of Eco elongation complex (EMD-8585; Kang et al., 2017), low-pass filtered to 60 \u00c5 resolution as an initial 3D template. With this initial model, 3D classification was performed without alignment with a soft mask generated in Chimera and RELION. The soft mask excluded flexible RNAP domains (SI1, SI3, flap tip helix, and single-stranded nucleic acids) of EC. Among the 3D classes, the two best-resolved classes were combined, 3D autorefined, and subjected to second 3D classification without alignment with the soft mask that was used in the first 3D classification. From this classification, the best-resolved class was 3D autorefined with solvent flattening, and post-processed in RELION, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (Figures S5, S5E).To resolve heterogeneity around RfaH the upstream duplex DNA, focused 3D classification on the unmodeled region was performed (Scheres, 2012). A soft map containing RNAP, nucleic acids, and the RfaH-NGN was generated in Chimera and RELION to make a subtracted particle stack in RELION. The subtracted particles were 3D classified into six classes without alignment, reverted to the original (unmasked) particles, and 3D autorefined. Among the classes, one class resolved the RfaH-KOW domain and flap-tip helix. The particles in this class, containing 107,500 particles (about 28% of the starting particles after 2D classification; Figure S2B), was 3D autorefined with solvent flattening and post-processed, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution (Figure S2B). Local resolution calculations (Figure S5H) were performed using blocres (Cardone et al., 2013).Model building, refinement and validation To build initial models, The Eco EC (PDB ID 6ALF; Kang et al., 2017) was fitted into the electron density maps using Chimera. NusG-NGN (PDB ID 2K06; (Mooney et al., 2009b), RfaH-NGN (PDB ID 2OUG; (Belogurov et al., 2007), and RfaH-KOW (PDB ID 2LCL; (Burmann et al., 2012) were also fitted into NusG-opsEC, RfaH-NGN-opsEC, and focused RfaH-opsEC cryo-EM maps accordingly. These initial models were real-space refined against the working half map using Phenix real-space-refine (Adams et al., 2010). In the refinement, domains in the core and nucleic acids were rigid-body refined, then subsequently refined with secondary structure restraints. At the end of refinement, Fourier shell correlations (FSC) were calculated between the refined model and the half map used for refinement (work), the other half map (free), and the full map to assess over-fitting (Figures S3G, S5F, G).Psoralen crosslinking Scaffolds were assembled from synthetic TAops oligonucleotides, t-DNA was end-labeled with [32P]-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK; NEB). Following labeling, oligonucleotides were purified using QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). To assemble a scaffold, RNA and t-DNA oligonucleotides were combined in PNK buffer and annealed in a PCR machine as follows: 5 min at 45 \u00b0C; 2 min each at 42, 39, 36, 33, 30, and 27 \u00b0C, 10 min at 25 \u00b0C. 12 pmoles of t-DNA/RNA hybrid were mixed with 14 pmoles of His-tagged core RNAP in 30 \u03bcl of TB [20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% (v/v) Glycerol, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol], and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. 15 \u03bcl of His-Select\u00ae HF Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) was washed once in TB and incubated with 20 \u03bcg Bovine Serum Albumin in a 40-\u03bcl volume for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by a single wash step in TB. The t-DNA/RNA/RNAP complex was mixed with the Affinity Gel for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C on a ther momixer (Eppendorf) at 900 rpm, and washed twice with TB. 30 pmoles of the nt-DNA oligonucleotide were added, followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C, one 5-min incuba tion with TB supplemented with 1 M KCl in a thermomixer, and five washes with TB. The assembled ECs were eluted from beads with 90 mM imidazole in a 15-\u03bcl volume, purified through a Durapore (PVDF) 0.45 \u03bcm Centrifugal Filter Unit (Merck Millipore), and resuspended in TB. For crosslinking, the ECs were supplemented with 6.3% (v/v) DMSO and 0.92 mM 8-methoxypsoralen and incubated for 2 min at 37 \u00b0C, f ollowed by addition of 50 nM RfaH, 500 nM NusG, or storage buffer, and a 3-min incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Complexes were then exposed to 365 nm UV light (8W Model UVLMS-38; UVP, LLC) for 20 min on ice. The reactions were quenched with an equal volume of Stop buffer (8 M Urea, 20 mM EDTA, 1 x TBE, 0.5 % Brilliant Blue R, 0.5 % Xylene Cyanol FF). Samples were heated for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and separated by electrophoresis in denaturing acrylamide (19:1) gels (7 M Urea, 0.5X TBE). The gels were dried and the products were visualized and quantified using a FLA9000 Phosphorimaging System (GE Healthcare), ImageQuant Software, and Microsoft Excel.Cys Triplet Reporter (CTR) assays Nucleic-acid scaffolds used to reconstitute hisPEC for Cys triplet reporter cross-linking assays (Figure 5E) were assembled on purified DNA and RNA oligonucleotides as described (Hein et al., 2014). Briefly, 10 \u03bcM RNA, 12 \u03bcM template DNA, and 15 \u03bcM nt-DNA (Key Resource Table) were annealed in reconstitution buffer (RB; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA). To assemble complexes, scaffold (2 \u03bcM) was mixed with limiting CTR RNAP (1 \u03bcM; CTR RNAP: \u03b2\u20321045iC 258iC, \u03b2843C) in transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 2.5 \u03bcg of acetylated bovine serum albumin/ml). NusG-NGN or RfaH-NGN proteins were added to 1 \u03bcM and combined with cystamine and DTT to final concentrations of 2.5 mM and 2.8 mM, respectively, to generate a redox potential of \u22120.36. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and then stopped by addition of iodoacetamide to 15 mM. The formation of cysteine cross-links was then evaluated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (4\u201315% gradient Phastgel; GE Life Sciences) as described previously (Hein et al., 2014). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged with a CCD camera. The fraction cross-linked was quantified with ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012). The experimental error was determined as the standard deviation of measurements from three or more independent replicates.RNAP pause assays The nucleic-acid scaffold (Figure 5A; Key Resources Table) used to reconstitute ECs for pause assays (Figures 5C, D) was assembled as previously described (Hein et al., 2014). Briefly, PAGE-purified G17 RNA (2 nt upstream of the pause site, 10 \u03bcM), t-DNA (15 \u03bcM), and nt-DNA (20 \u03bcM) were annealed in reconstitution buffer (RB; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2). Scaffolds (2 \u03bcM) were incubated with 0.5 \u03bcM RNAP for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C in Elongation Buffer (E B; 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 130 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, DTT, 0.15 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 25 \u03bcg of acetylated bovine serum albumin/ml) to form ECs, diluted to 0.1 \u03bcM in EB, then incubated with heparin (0.1 mg/ml final) for 3 min at 37 \u00b0C, and labeled by incorporation of 2 \u03bcM [\u03b1-32P]CMP for 1 min at 37 \u00b0C. NusG-NGN or RfaH-NGN (or EB for the \u00b1asRNA conditions) were added to the C18 complexes and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min before adding 7-mer asRNA or equal volume TE for the minus asRNA condition, and then incubated for another 10 min at 37\u00b0C to fo rm an RNA duplex mimic of the hisPEC hairpin. ECs were then assayed for pause-escape kinetics by addition of 100 \u03bcM UTP and 10 \u03bcM GTP in EB at 37 \u00b0C. Reaction sampl es were removed at time points and quenched with an equal volume of 2X urea stop buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM EDTA, 90 mM Tris-borate buffer, pH 8.3, 0.02% each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol). All active PECs were then chased out of the pause by addition of 1 mM GTP for 1 min at 37 \u00b0C to aid quantitation. RNAs in each quenched re action sample were separated on a 15% urea-PAGE gel. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the screen was scanned using Typhoon PhosphorImager software and quantified in ImageQuant (GE Life Sciences). The fraction of RNA at pause (U19) as a function of time was fit to single- or double-exponential decay functions using KaleidaGraph to obtain the amplitudes of bypass, slow pause, and slower pause species and pause escape rates.Retention of RfaH and NusG on the EC A linear template was generated by PCR of pIA349 using a top biotinylated primer and a bottom primer with an EcoRI recognition site. The template (8 pmoles) was incubated with EcoRIQ111 (3 \u03bcM; to achieve complete occupancy) in 40 \u03bcl BB (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. To form an immobilized halted G37 EC, holo-RNAP (8 pmoles), ApU (100 \u03bcM) and 5 \u03bcM each CTP, GTP and ATP were added together with 20 \u03bcl of prewashed Streptavidin coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads\u00ae MyOne\u2122 Streptavidin C1) and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. The halted complexes were washed three times with 500 \u03bcl of BB using a Magnetic Separation Stand (Promega). UTP was added at 5 \u03bcM for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C, followed by three washes. Then ATP, GTP, and CTP were added at 5 \u03bcM to form G42 (ops10) EC. The sample was divided into two aliquots; to one, 32P-labeled RfaH was added to 50 nM, and to the other 32P-labeled NusG was added to 470 nM, followed by a 5-min incubation at 37\u00b0C and three washes. Each reaction was split again into three aliquots: a) no further treatment; b) 5-min chase at 37\u00b0C with 100 \u03bcM NTPs; and c) 5-min chase at 37\u00b0C with 100 \u03bcM NTPs and 5 \u03bcM unlabeled NusG. After three washes with BB, samples were measured in a LS6500 Multi-Purpose Scintillation Counter (Beckman Coulter). The experiment was done in triplicates. \u200b\n                    HIGHLIGHTSCryo-EM structures of NusG and RfaH-bound transcription elongation complexesNusG and RfaH suppress backtracking by stabilizing the upstream duplex DNARfaH recognizes an ops DNA hairpin in the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubbleRfaH suppresses RNA hairpin-stabilized pausing by preventing RNAP swiveling Supplementary Material1Click here to view.(59K, pdf)2Figure S1. Ops scaffold verification. Related to Figure 1: NusG and RfaH effects on RNA chain elongation on the scaffold used for cryo-EM experiments (shown on top). Scaffolds were assembled with the 32P-labeled RNA strand in the cryo-EM buffer and preincubated with RfaH (100 nM) or NusG (1000 nM), in the absence or in the presence of 8 mM CHAPSO. Elongation was restarted upon addition of 0.15 mM ATP, GTP, and CTP, aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and analyzed on 12% denaturing urea-acrylamide gels (19:1) in 0.5x TBE. Positions of RNA products are indicated, with the region encompassing C21, A22, C23 and G24 RNAs highlighted in black. RfaH and NusG display their characteristic effects immediately downstream from the ops site (A20). Consistent with the patterns observed on standard transcription templates, RfaH promotes RNAP pausing in the 21\u201324 region, whereas NusG decreases pausing in this region. The bar graph shows the fraction of C21-G24 RNAs (as % of total RNA) at the 40-sec time point. The addition of CHAPSO has only a minor effect on RNAP elongation and response to NusG and RfaH.Click here to view.(11M, jpg)3Figure S2. Data processing pipeline for the cryo-EM data. Related to Figure 1: A. Flowchart showing the image processing pipeline for the cryo-EM NusG-opsEC data starting with 6,318 dose-fractionated movies collected on a 300 keV Titan Krios (FEI) equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). Movie frames were aligned and summed using Unblur (Grant and Grigorieff, 2015). Particles were autopicked with Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/) and manually revised from these summed images. The revised particles were polished using direct-detector-align_lmbfgs (Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015) for subsequent 2D classification using RELION (Scheres, 2012). After 2D classification, the dataset contained 514,900 aligned particles. These particles were auto-refined in RELION using a model of the Eco EC (PDB ID 6ALF; (Kang et al., 2017) as an initial 3D template. 3D classification into six classes was performed on the particles using the refined model and alignment angles. The best class (containing the most particles and having the highest resolution) was subjected to a second 3D classification into four classes. After the second 3D classification, one class containing 33.4% of the starting particles (171,900 particles) was autorefined and post-processed in RELION, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution.B.

The revised particles were polished using direct-detector-align_lmbfgs (Rubinstein and Brubaker, 2015) for subsequent 2D classification using RELION (Scheres, 2012). After 2D classification, the dataset contained 389,200 aligned particles. These particles were auto-refined in RELION using a model of the Eco EC (PDB ID 6ALF; (Kang et al., 2017) as an initial 3D template. 3D classification into six classes (right branch) was performed on the particles using the refined model and alignment angles. The best two classes (containing the most particles and having the highest resolutions) was subjected to a second 3D classification into four classes. After the second 3D classification, one class containing 44.9% of the starting particles (174,600 particles) was autorefined and post-processed in RELION, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution.For the focused 3D classification (left branch of the flowchart), a soft mask that excluded the upstream duplex DNA and nearby protein regions was generated using Chimera and RELION. The mask was used to make a subtracted particle stack in RELION with the filtered map generated in the initial autorefinement. The subtracted particles were 3D classified into six classes without alignment. Among the six classes, one class containing 24% of the starting particles (107,500 particles) had density for the RfaH-KOW domain. The original (unmasked) particles in this class were autorefined and post-processed in RELION, yielding the final reconstruction at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution.Click here to view.(14M, jpg)4Figure S3.

Related to Figure 6: Previously determined structures of NusG/Spt5 factors bound to the archaeal RNAP clamp domain (A; 3QQC; (Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011), bound in a RNAPII-EC (B; 5OIK; (Bernecky et al., 2017), or bound to Eco core RNAP (C; 5TBZ; (Liu and Steitz, 2017)) are superimposed with the NusG-opsEC via RNAP \u03b1-carbons to compare the resulting dispositions of the NusG/Spt5. The color-coding in each panel is indicated in the color keys below.A. The archaeal (Pyrococcus furiousus) RNAP clamp domain was superimposed with the Eco RNAP from the NusG-opsEC, resulting in an rmsd for the 40 \u03b1-carbons of the CHs of 1.23 \u00c5. The positions of the NusG-NGN (green) and Spt5 (orange) are shifted relative to each other by about 2.8 \u00c5 but the orientation of the domain is conserved.B. The Rpb1 and Rpb2 subunits of human RNAPII from the human DSIF(Spt4/Spt5)/RNAPII-EC were superimposed with the \u03b2\u2032 and \u03b2 subunits (respectively) from the NusG-opsEC, resulting in an rmsd for the 40 \u03b1-carbons of the CHs of 1.52 \u00c5. The positions of the NusG-NGN (green) and Spt5 (orange) are shifted relative to each other by about 7.9 \u00c5 but the orientation of the domain is conserved.C. The Eco core RNAP from the NusG/RNAP was superimposed with the RNAP from the NusG-opsEC, resulting in an rmsd for the 40 \u03b1-carbons of the CHs of 1.94 \u00c5. The orientation of overall fold of the NusG-NGN (orange) is not consistent with the NusG-NGN from the NusG-opsEC (green).Click here to view.(14M, jpg) AcknowledgmentsWe thank K. Uryu and D.
