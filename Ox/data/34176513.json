The EOLIA study suggested that Extra- Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) could be effective in some of the most severe patients, but failed to demonstrate a 20% increase in survival [4]. One reason could be that criteria for selecting patients were only based on blood gas analysis. Our hypothesis is that adding other factors could allow a better selection of patients who could benefit from ECMO.We took advantages to have a large multicentric cohort of patients under protective ventilation for moderate-to-severe ARDS [5] to determine the incidence, characteristics and outcome of patients eligible for ECMO according to EOLIA-based criteria and to identify patients who would benefit the most of the technique. ECMO was only used in these centers as a recue therapy.Mechanical ventilation was applied in the volume-assist control mode, with a target tidal volume (TV) of 6\u20138\u00a0mL/kg (predicted body weight) and a plateau pressure\u2009<\u200930 cmH2O. Respiratory rate could be increased in case of high arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2). Prone positioning was left to the discretion of the attending physician, but was typically performed in patients with a PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u2009100\u00a0mmHg and/or an acute core pulmonale (ACP) [6]. Patients eligible for ECMO according to EOLIA-based criteria were identified as follows: PaO2/FiO2\u2009<\u200980\u00a0mmHg with optimal PEEP, or a pH\u2009<\u20097.25 and PaCO2\u2009>\u200960\u00a0mmHg with a respiratory rate\u2009\u2265\u200935 cycles/min, despite the use of prone positioning or nitric oxide inhalation.Statistical analysis was performed with R.4.0.4. Patients eligible for ECMO were compared to the rest of the cohort. Continuous data, expressed as medians (interquartile ranges), were compared with Mann\u2013Whitney test. Categorical variables, expressed as numbers and percentages, were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. To evaluate independent factors associated with ICU mortality in this identified subgroup of patients, significant or marginally significant (p\u2009<\u20090.10) bivariate risk factors were examined using univariate and multivariable backward stepwise mixed logistic regression stratified on the center. SAPS II was forced in the model.752 patients were studied. Characteristics and outcome are given in the Table \u200bTable1.1. 67 (9%) patients were potentially eligible for ECMO. They had lower PaO2/FiO2 (62 [55\u201372] versus 114 [90\u2013120] mmHg: p\u2009<\u20090.01) and higher incidence of ACP (42% versus 20%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Only 8 of them underwent the procedure. In-ICU mortality in the whole cohort was 36%. Causes of death in patients eligible for ECMO was multi-organ failure in 21 (68%), neurologic in 4 (13%) and ECMO complication in 3 (10%). Only 3 patients (10%) died from hypoxic cardiac arrest.Table 1Clinical characteristics and outcome of the entire cohort according to EOLIA criteriaCharacteristics, outcomes and complicationsARDS patients without EOLIA criteria(n\u2009=\u2009685)ARDS patients with EOLIA criteria(n\u2009=\u200967)p-valueAge (years)59 (47\u201372)56 (47\u201370)0.43Male sex, n (%)465 (68)42 (63)0.47SAPS II51 (38\u201365)47 (33\u201364)0.27Weight (kg)77 (65\u201384)70 (59\u201386)0.43Cause of ARDS, n (%)0.20\u00a0Pneumonia83 (12)8 (12)\u00a0Aspiration259 (39)34 (51))\u00a0Non-pulmonary sepsis245 (37)17 (26)\u00a0Other causes83 (12)7 (11)Respiratory setting at inclusion\u00a0Tidal volume (ml/kg)6.7 (6.0\u20138.0)6.02 (5.4\u20136.9)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Respiratory rate (cycle/min)22 (16\u201327)26 (22\u201330)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0PEEP (cmH2O)8 (5\u201310)10 (7\u201312)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Plateau pressure (cmH2O)24 (21\u201328)27 (25\u201329)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Compliance (ml/cmH2O)30.7 (24\u201339.1)25.9 (19.3\u201333.8)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Driving pressure (cmH2O)15 (13\u201319)17 (14\u201319.8)0.04Arterial blood gases\u00a0PaO2/FiO2 ratio (mmHg)114 (90\u2013120)62 (55\u201372)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0PaCO2 (mmHg)44 (38\u201352)48 (41\u201360)\u2009<\u20090.01Shock, n (%)449 (66)53 (79)0.04Prone positioning, n (%)163 (24)55 (82)\u2009<\u20090.01VV ECMO in rescue during ARDS course, n (%)0 (0)8 (12)\u2009<\u20090.01RRT during ARDS course, n (%)126 (30)15 (40)0.27Echocardiographic findingsRVEDA/LVEDA0.68 (0.57\u20130.81)0.83 (0.64\u20131.04)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (mmHg)35 (20\u201348)52 (35\u201359)\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0Severe acute cor pulmonale43 (6)11 (16)\u2009<\u20090.01Outcome, n (%)\u00a0ICU mortality243 (36)31 (46)0.10\u00a0ICU stay (days)16 (8\u201330)15 (6\u201331)0.43Open in a separate windowValues are expressed as median (interquartile range) or n (%)ARDS, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; PEEP, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure; VV ECMO, Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; RRT, Renal Remplacement Therapy; RVEDA, Right Ventricular End-Diastolic Area; LVDEA, Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Area; ICU, Intensive Care UnitCharacteristics and outcome of patients potentially eligible for ECMO according to ICU mortality are given in the Table \u200bTable2.2.

However, six of these eight patients died.In conclusion, we report a 9% incidence of patients who reach the EOLIA-based criteria for ECMO in a large non-selected cohort of ARDS patients ventilated with moderate-to-severe ARDS. These patients exhibited higher driving pressure and more frequent right ventricle failure, both being independently associated with ICU mortality. How this subgroup of patients could be considered as the ideal target for ECMO selection strategy should better be evaluated in the future.\n AcknowledgementsNot applicable.
