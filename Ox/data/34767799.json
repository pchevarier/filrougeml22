Progress in this area is due in part to the propensity of some structured RNAs to form clefts, pockets, or deep grooves that are receptive to ligand binding (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). In this respect, promising steps have been made to target the internal bulged loop of the HIV-1 trans-activation response (TAR) element RNA, which represents a model system for RNA drug development (11, 12, 13, 14, 15).The significance of TAR in the viral life cycle is underscored by its presence in every HIV-1 transcript (16, 17), where the TAR hairpin is highly conserved in terms of its sequence and structure (18). Following integration of proviral DNA into the host genome, the virus initiates transcription using host RNA polymerase II, but stalls subsequently due to negative elongation factors (19, 20, 21). To activate viral transcription, the polymerase must interact with the positive transcription elongation factor (pTEFb) complex, which contains cyclin T1 and CDK9 (22) (Fig.\u00a01A). HIV has evolved the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein to hijack this host complex, freeing it from inactivation by the host 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein assembly, which includes the host protein HEXIM (22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27). By mimicking the RNA-binding domain of HEXIM, the Tat arginine-rich motif (ARM) binds 7SK RNA; simultaneously, Tat releases HEXIM and recruits the pTEFb complex to TAR where CDK9 phosphorylates the CTD of RNA polymerase II, leading to transcription elongation (26, 27, 28, 29). Because Tat is not produced in appreciable amounts in latent viral reservoirs (30, 31), inhibitors that block the Tat-TAR interaction could ostensibly abrogate viral mRNA transcription, promoting a functional cure (32, 33).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a01Tat interactions with HIV TAR leading to RNA polymerase II elongation and the TAR binding protein (TBP) consensus sequence with a representative conformation from the TAR-TBP6.9 complex.A, left, cartoon model of the inactive pTEFb complex sequestered by the host 7SK small-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK RNP) complex. The arginine-rich motif (ARM) of Tat displaces its counterpart from host HEXIM, producing a free Tat-pTEFb complex. Right, Tat conveys the pTEFb complex to TAR, leading to formation of a Tat-TAR elongation complex. Transcription of viral mRNA is activated by CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of host RNA polymerase II (105, 106). B, amino acids in the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop of U1A that were diversified and selected for TAR binding (39). \u03b22-\u03b23 loop amino acids are depicted for TBPs of known structure (38, 40) that were used as a basis to produce the cyclic peptides of this investigation. The Weblogo depicts the consensus of known \u03b22-\u03b23 loop sequences resulting from lab evolution (39). C, inset, global view of the TAR-TBP6.9 complex highlighting the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop (yellow). The main cartoon shows ribbon and ball-and-stick depictions of key interactions required for molecular recognition, including the arginine fork motif (highlighted in green) (38, 40, 65).Rationally designed TAR-binding peptides that mimic the Tat ARM have been derived from structures of the bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) TAR-Tat complex. Therein, the arginine-rich BIV Tat peptide adopts a sharp type V\u2032 turn that supports major-groove recognition at a bulged UU internal loop (34). This observation provided a foundation to produce a series of cyclic \u03b2-hairpin peptides that have been iteratively refined and include natural and unnatural positively charged amino acids that mimic the HIV Tat ARM (33,\u00a035, 36). An ingenious aspect of the underlying scaffold is that peptides are closed by D- and L-proline to enforce cyclization. This feature also allows the peptide to adopt a well-packed core similar to a mini \u03b2-sheet, which likely reduces conformational entropy. This strategy has yielded tight binding TAR binders with affinities that range from nanomolar to picomolar and IC50 values that range from 4\u00a0\u03bcM to 120\u00a0\u03bcM in antiviral assays tested using laboratory viral strains in cell culture (35, 37).In contrast to structure-guided design principles garnered from the BIV TAR-Tat complex, we employed a fundamentally different strategy based on the chemical features observed in lab-evolved TAR-binding proteins (TBPs) selected to recognize HIV-1 TAR (38, 39, 40). A key observation is that the arginine composition and spacing within the lab-evolved \u03b22-\u03b23 loops of TBPs are primary factors in high-affinity TAR recognition (Fig.\u00a01B), as demonstrated by the binding series: TBP6.9 (KD of 3.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0nM) > TBP6.7 (KD of 5.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0nM) > TBP6.R (KD of 34.3\u00a0\u00b1 2.7\u00a0nM) > TBP6.3 (KD of 45.2\u00a0\u00b1 3.2\u00a0nM) (40). Moreover, only three arginines of the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop engaged in recognition of conserved guanines, even when \u03b22-\u03b23 loops with as many as five arginines were tested. This finding parallels the observation that the Tat ARM naturally recognizes both host 7SK RNA and HIV TAR RNA by using different subsets of arginine residues wherein only 2 to 4 guanidinium groups were engaged at one time (28).Significantly, our previous structural and biochemical analyses of individual TAR-TBP complexes also revealed that each lab-evolved protein recognizes TAR using analogous structural features on a global level (Fig.\u00a01C, inset). Significantly, each TBP uses a specific arginine fork motif wherein R47 recognizes TAR at the Hoogsteen edge of Gua26, as well as the phosphate backbone of Uri23. This mode of readout entails highly specific geometric features of the target RNA (38, 40) (Fig.\u00a01C) that appear integral to TAR recognition by HIV Tat (28, 40). Notably, the latter arginine fork motif is absent in existing lab-derived peptides and small molecules to our knowledge (33,\u00a040).Mandates to produce next-generation HIV antivirals emphasize a need for drugs that are long acting, have fewer side effects, and promote compliance and ease of use (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-137.html). Hence, although TBPs represent a promising route to block infectivity, treatment would likely require injections similar to enfuvirtide (41), which can erode patient adherence (42). Moreover, recombinant biologics can lose efficacy over time due to immunogenicity (43, 44). In contrast, cyclic peptides have gained traction as therapeutics in the past decade with some showing oral availability and others attaining plasma half-lives of \u223c1\u00a0day (45).Accordingly, we leveraged both global and local structural details of TBPs to design a small cyclic peptide that mimics the lab-evolved \u03b22-\u03b23 loop of TBP6.9 and its interaction with the TAR major groove (Fig.\u00a01C). Our efforts led to the synthesis and characterization of TAR-binding cyclic-peptide-6.9a (or TB-CP-6.9a; Fig.\u00a02, A and B), which binds HIV-1 TAR with a KD of 3.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.4 \u03bc\u039c and blocks association between TAR and a Tat ARM peptide (40). In contrast, a related TBP6.7-derived cyclic peptide (TB-CP-6.7a), which contains three arginines and differs only by an R-to-Q change (Fig.\u00a01B), binds TAR with a KD of 20.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.1 \u03bc\u039c and did not obstruct binding of the Tat ARM to TAR (40). Altogether this work supported the feasibility of producing short cyclic peptide mimics of TBPs to target HIV TAR.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a02Schematic diagrams of cyclic peptide sequences and linkers.A, cyclic peptide sequences produced in this investigation. The sequences were derived from the \u03b22-\u03b23 loops of TBP6.3, TBP6.9, and TBP6.7(Q48R/T51R) as described (40). Cysteines were added to each terminus to promote cyclization with various linking chemical groups. B, the linker groups shown were used to cyclize peptides in panel A at the site of the R-group.Herein, we report the analysis of an expanded library of TBP-derived cyclic peptides to explore the influence of arginine composition, spacing, and the intramolecular cross-link on their TAR recognition properties and antiviral activity. Thermodynamic profiling by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed a range of affinities from 24.2\u00a0\u00b1 3.4 \u03bc\u039c to 0.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM. Importantly, the most promising cyclic peptides show specificity for TAR while avoiding interactions with off-target RNAs. A cyclic peptide variant predicted to lack the arginine-fork elicited poor TAR affinity, suggesting that this motif is operative in binding. Significantly, a handful of cyclic peptides showed antiviral activity against HIV in cell culture without substantial cytotoxicity. Overall, this work establishes key molecular recognition determinants and cyclization chemistries that show promise for development of new HIV TAR-targeting antivirals. ResultsChoice of peptide sequence and strategy for optimization of TAR-binding cyclic peptidesOur previous work on TBPs demonstrated that specific amino acids are important not only for RNA binding but also to stabilize a distinct \u03b22-\u03b23 loop conformation conducive to TAR recognition (Fig.\u00a01, B and C) (38, 40). In particular, we noted that T50 fulfills an important role in stabilizing the R52 guanidinium group. Similarly, R48 hydrogen bonds to the R47 carbonyl oxygen while simultaneously salt-bridging to the TAR backbone (Fig.\u00a01C). Prolines 46 and 51 also favor a distinct backbone conformation. Accordingly, we sought to design a series of small-sized cyclic peptides that would mimic the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop of TBPs and retain conformations conducive to cognate RNA readout. To stabilize these conformations and promote serum stability (46, 47), we chose to prepare cyclic peptides by restraining the peptide sequence encompassing positions 46 through 54 of the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop region via cysteine bis-alkylation (48). Residues V45 and A55 appeared well suited as cyclization sites because their side chains reside on the same face of neighboring \u03b2-strands in all TAR-TBP crystal structures (e.g., Fig.\u00a01C). Although cysteines will form a disulfide bond, we employed them in a workflow outlined in Figure\u00a0S1 to generate stable alkane and aromatic thioacetal linkers (49, 50). To empirically optimize the size, we synthesized and tested peptides containing a variety of linkers including methyl, ethyl, butyl, acetone, pyridine, xylene, and naphthalene groups (Fig.\u00a02 and Table S1). Arene substitution and cysteine stereochemistry were also treated as variables. The choice of the peptide sequences was based on three \u03b22-\u03b23 loops identified in TBPs that were found to bind TAR with high affinity in previous studies (40), namely TBP6.3, TBP6.9, and TBP6.R (Fig.\u00a01B). Each peptide sequence contains a residue equivalent to R47 (Fig.\u00a02A) that likely recognizes TAR by an H\u03b7\u03b7P arginine fork (38, 40). To optimize these compounds as \u03b22-\u03b23 loop mimics and TAR-targeting agents (Fig.\u00a0S1), these peptides were further diversified by incorporating different linkers including methyl, ethyl, butyl, acetone, pyridine, xylene, and naphthalene groups (Fig.\u00a02B) and through variation of other structural elements (i.e., cysteine configuration).Terminal cysteine chirality alters affinities of methylene-linked cyclic peptides derived from TBP6.9As a first step in identifying specific cyclic peptides for antiviral analysis, we characterized the TAR-binding profiles of various cyclic peptides by ITC (Fig.\u00a03 and Table\u00a01). In this manner, we identified specific chemical attributes that support high-affinity binding (Fig.\u00a0S1). As a starting point, we chose to modify cyclic peptide TB-CP-6.9a, which we found previously to have a 5.6-fold affinity improvement over TBP6.7-derived cyclic peptide TB-CP-6.7a (40). Consistent with previous studies, ITC analysis herein on TB-CP-6.9a showed a KD of 5.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM compared with 23\u00a0\u00b1 1\u00a0\u03bcM for TB-CP-6.7a (Table\u00a01).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a03Scatter bar graph representation of thermodynamic parameters for TAR binding by cyclic peptides. TAR recognition by cyclic peptides is enthalpically (\u0394H) driven in the case of most cyclic peptides, whereas 6.9ss, 6.9d, 6.9h, and 6.9i display an apparent favorable entropic (-T\u0394S) contribution. Methylene (6.9a), 1,3 di-bromo methylene (6.9i) and xylene (6.9f-m) linkers display an increased enthalpic contribution that contributes to higher affinity (improved KD) and favorable binding free energies (improved \u0394G). The methylene and xylene linkers display comparable thermodynamic signatures in the context of the TBP6.3 \u03b22-\u03b23 loop sequence (6.3a and 6.3f) but display tighter binding and higher enthalpic favorability in the context of the TBP6.R \u03b22-\u03b23 loop sequence (6.Ra and 6.Rf). The naphthalene linkers (6.9l and 6.9m) display comparable thermodynamic signatures in the presence of the 6.9a\u00a0methylene linker. Representative thermograms and isotherm fits are provided in Figure\u00a0S2. Each experiment was replicated two or more times.

Compared with TB-CP-6.9a, the resulting cyclic peptides TB-CP-6.9aLD and TB-CP-6.9aDD proved to be poorer binders, with Krel values of 4.7 and 3.2 (Table\u00a01). Each peptide showed a favorable enthalpy (i.e., \u0394H of\u00a0\u221212.9\u00a0\u00b1 7.6 and\u00a0\u22127.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) but unfavorable entropies (i.e., -T\u0394S of 7.0\u00a0\u00b1 6.2 and 0.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.6\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) (Fig.\u00a03). In particular for TB-CP-6.9aLD, the large entropic cost of binding could imply a significant distortion of the peptide conformation from the bioactive one, as induced by inversion of the \u03b1-carbon configuration of only one of the two cross-linked cysteines. This effect was less pronounced in the case of TB-CP-6.9aDD, where the configuration of both cysteines was inverted. Notably, the side chain of the corresponding residues (i.e., V45 and A55) in the TBP protein does not interact with TAR in parental RNA-TBP complexes (e.g., Fig.\u00a01C). These results highlight the sensitivity of TAR binding to the conformation of the cyclic peptide as influenced by the chirality of the terminal cysteines. In addition, the findings define the use of L-cysteines as optimal choices for subsequent compound optimization.Alkyl linkers diminish binding but acetone-based linkers enhance affinity of TB-CP-6.9 variantsWe next examined the effect of varying the length of the linker in the TB-CP-6.9-based cyclic peptides. Accordingly, we prepared and tested TB-CP-6.9SS, wherein the methylene linker is replaced by a disulfide bond (Fig.\u00a02B). This variant produced comparable affinity to its methylene-linked counterpart, as indicated by a KD of 7.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0\u03bcM (Krel of 1.4). TB-CP-6.9SS showed favorable entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding (i.e., \u0394H of\u00a0\u22123.4\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and -T\u0394S of\u00a0\u22123.4\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) (Fig.\u00a03). A series of peptides with longer cross-links were also prepared, including TB-CP-6.9b and TB-CP-6.9c, in which the methylene linker was replaced by an ethyl and a propyl linker (Fig.\u00a02). The respective KD values were 6.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0\u03bcM (TB-CP-6.9b) and 12.1\u00a0\u00b1 2.0\u00a0\u03bcM (TB-CP-6.9c) with enthalpically driven binding (\u0394H of\u00a0\u22128.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and\u00a0\u22128.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) and unfavorable entropies (+1.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.02\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and\u00a0+2.0\u00a0\u00b1 1.0\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) (Fig.\u00a03 and Table\u00a01). Interestingly, an acetone-based linker (51) resulted in a cyclic peptide (TB-CP-6.9d) with a KD of 4.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM and a Krel of 0.8 compared with TB-CP-6.9a. Like the disulfide-bridged peptide, TB-CP-6.9d exhibited a favorable entropy, which largely drives the binding process (-T\u0394S of\u00a0\u22126.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 compared with a \u0394H of\u00a0\u22120.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.4\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121). Although the chemical basis of the underlying interactions is unknown, the favorable entropic contribution is desirable for binding (52) and suggests that the acetone-based linkage is able to induce a peptide conformation conducive to TAR recognition. This finding prompted us to examine a series of conformationally rigid linkers, including xylene and dimethylpyridine groups.Xylene enhances binding of TB-CP-6.9 peptides but pyridine does notAccordingly, we next produced a series of cyclic peptides via cysteine bis-alkylation using ortho, meta, and para xylene (Fig.\u00a02B). Peptides TB-CP-6.9f-o (ortho) and TB-CP-6.9f-p (para) had no detectable binding heats (data not shown). In contrast, TB-CP-6.9f-m (meta) showed strong TAR binding, as indicated by a KD of 1.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.4 \u03bc\u039c and a Krel of 0.3 compared with starting peptide TB-CP-6.9a (Table\u00a01). This value is notably tighter in its binding than our starting peptide TB-CP-6.9a (40), and like the methylene-linked parental peptide, TB-CP-6.9f-m elicited a favorable enthalpy (\u0394H of\u00a0\u22128.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.8\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) but an unfavorable entropy (-T\u0394S of 1.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.7\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) (Fig.\u00a03 and Table\u00a01). We next explored the impact of substitutions at the level of the meta-xylene linker. We synthesized and tested TB-CP-6.9i, which is cross-linked by a dibromo-substituted meta-xylene unit (Fig.\u00a02B). This peptide showed improved TAR affinity compared with TB-CP-6.9a (Krel of 0.6) but no improvement over TB-CP-6.9f-m, indicating that substitution of the aryl ring did not improve binding. One notable difference in the thermodynamic profile of TB-CP-6.9i is that the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding were both favorable (\u0394H of\u00a0\u22127.3\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and -T\u0394S of\u00a0\u22120.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) (Fig.\u00a03). Replacement of the meta-xylene linker with its pyridine-based counterpart (TB-CP-6.9h) produced a similar thermodynamic signature (\u0394H of\u00a0\u22125.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.8\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and -T\u0394S of\u00a0\u22121.6\u00a0\u00b1 0.6\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) but resulted in a 2- and 5.7-fold lower affinity for TAR (KD of 9.8\u00a0\u00b1 2.5 \u03bc\u039c) compared with TB-CP-6.9a and TB-CP-6.9f-m, respectively (Fig.\u00a03C and Table\u00a01). Altogether, these observations pinpointed m-xylene as one of the best linkers for improving TAR-binding affinity among this group of peptides.Xylene-linked peptides with varied \u03b22-\u03b23 loop sequences show enhanced TAR bindingTo test the effects of various \u03b22-\u03b23-loop sequences from previously characterized TBPs, we synthesized peptides based on TBP6.3 and a TBP6.9 mutant with a T50R variation called TBP6.R (Fig.\u00a02A). Our rationale with the former sequence was to evaluate other high-affinity TBP sequences; our motivation with the latter sequence was to augment the arginine content to improve cell penetration (53, 54). The resulting cyclic peptides were TB-CP-6.3f-m and TB-CP-6.Rf-m (Fig.\u00a02, B and C). We also produced methylene-linked versions of these peptides to compare their TAR binding properties to TB-CP-6.9a. ITC revealed that cyclic peptides containing the TBP6.3 sequence in the context of methylene (KD of 3.1\u00a0\u00b1 1.4\u00a0\u03bcM and Krel of 0.6) or meta-xylene (KD of 2.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM and Krel of 0.4) linkers have higher affinity for TAR than the corresponding TBP6.9-derived cyclic peptides (Fig.\u00a03 and Table\u00a01). Notably, comparable cyclic peptides containing five arginines show even higher affinity for TAR, as revealed by KD values of 1.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM (Krel of 0.2) and 0.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM (Krel of 0.15) (Fig.\u00a03 and Table\u00a01). Like the parental TB-CP-6.9a peptide, each new peptide had favorable enthalpies (i.e., \u0394H ranging from of\u00a0\u22128.3\u00a0\u00b1 1.0\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 to\u00a0\u22129.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.05\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) with unfavorable entropies (i.e., -T\u0394S ranging from\u00a0+0.8\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 to\u00a0+1.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121). The results further demonstrated the importance of both the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop sequence and the linker structure for high-affinity TAR binding.Naphthalene linkers enhance affinity and possess cell penetrating propertiesAs a preface to antiviral analysis, we sought to use an alternative strategy to promote cell penetration by our arginine-rich cyclic peptides. This goal led us to employ naphthalene-based cysteine cross-linkers based on reports that naphthyl-based amino acids promote cell entry of cationic cyclic peptides (55, 56, 57). Accordingly, we synthesized and tested two TBP6.9-derived cyclic peptides constrained by a 1,4- and a 2,3-dimethyl-naphthalene linker (i.e., TB-CP-6.9l and TB-CP-6.9m, Fig.\u00a02B).A thermodynamic analysis of TAR-binding revealed that both peptides bind with low micromolar affinity (Fig.\u00a03). TB-CP-6.9m showed a slightly stronger affinity compared with TB-CP-6.9l (KD of 3.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.7 \u03bc\u039c versus a KD of 5.0\u00a0\u00b1 1.5 \u03bc\u039c) (Table\u00a01). The binding of each peptide was enthalpically driven (\u0394H values of\u00a0\u221210.3\u00a0\u00b1 1.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and\u00a0\u22128.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) with unfavorable entropic contributions (-T\u0394S of\u00a0+3.2\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 and\u00a0+0.8\u00a0\u00b1 3.1\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121). Both naphthalene-containing peptides were thus deemed viable for targeting TAR while potentially exhibiting enhanced cell penetration.Structure\u2013activity analysis of cyclic peptide TB-CP-6.9a for HIV TAR variantsWhile the studies above revealed the importance of the peptide sequence and cross-link for TAR recognition, the mode of binding of the cyclic peptides to TAR remains unknown and can be inferred only from cocrystal structures of parental HIV TAR-TBP complexes (e.g., Fig.\u00a01C) (38, 40). To gain structure\u2013activity insights in this regard, we tested binding of TB-CP-6.9a to TAR variants with deleted or substituted nucleobases. Variants included: TAR\u039425, in which internal bulge-loop base U25 was deleted; GNRA TAR, wherein the apical loop was replaced by a GAAA tetraloop stabilized by a CG closing pair (58); GNRA TAR\u039435, in which the apical loop and bulged nucleotide Ade35 were replaced and removed; and TAR\u0394bulge, in which the conserved central UCU bulged loop was deleted (Fig.\u00a04A).Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a04Analysis of cyclic peptide TB-CP-6.9a binding to HIV TAR RNA variants.A, secondary structure diagrams of modified TAR constructs analyzed by ITC for cyclic peptide binding. B, representative thermogram of TB-CP-6.9a titrated into wild-type TAR. Here and elsewhere the apparent KD, n value (ligand-to-receptor binding ratio), and the unitless quality-control c value (107) are shown; average values and thermodynamic parameters are in Table\u00a02. C,\u00a0representative thermogram of TB-CP-6.9a titrated into TAR with a single deletion at Uri25 (\u039425). D, representative thermogram of TB-CP-6.9a titrated into a TAR variant in which the apical loop was replaced by a stable GNRA tetraloop (GNRA). E, representative thermogram of TB-CP-6.9a titrated into a TAR variant in which the apical loop was replaced by a GNRA tetraloop and bulged nucleotide Ade35 was deleted (GNRA \u039435). F, representative thermogram of TB-CP-6.9a titrated into a TAR variant in which residues Uri23, Cyt24 and Uri25 of the internal bulged loop were deleted (\u0394bulge). Errors represent the standard deviation taken from separate replicate measurements.As expected, TB-CP-6.9a retains binding to TAR\u039425 (KD of 6.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM and Krel of 1.2; Fig.\u00a04, A and B and Table\u00a02). This finding suggests that our cyclic peptides will bind this TAR variant, which is present in \u223c9% of circulating recombinant forms of the virus (38, 59). Replacement of the apical loop with a GNRA tetraloop is not a naturally occurring TAR variation, but this mutant was tested to identify whether TB-CP-6.9a recognizes the conserved apical loop of TAR, which is integral to binding of the host super-elongation complex (Fig.\u00a01A) (22,\u00a029, 60, 61). TAR binding analysis showed that the loop variant binds with slightly less affinity than wild-type TAR, as indicated by a KD of 6.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.8\u00a0\u03bcM and Krel of 1.3 (Fig.\u00a04C and Table\u00a02). This observation was not entirely surprising since the TAR apical loop does not contact TBP6.9 in the cocrystal structure (Fig.\u00a01C). Furthermore, a recent analysis of TBP6.9 revealed that the apical loop can be replaced by GAAA without significant reduction to TAR binding (62). In contrast, changing the apical loop to a GAAA tetraloop accompanied by deletion of the conserved Ade35 nucleotide causes substantial affinity loss (i.e., KD of 17.4\u00a0\u00b1 2.7\u00a0\u03bcM and Krel of 3.4) (Fig.\u00a04D and Table\u00a02). This finding is consistent with the close proximity of the bulged Ade35 base to the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop in the TBP6.9 cocrystal structure (Fig.\u00a01C). Importantly, when the conserved UCU bulged loop was eliminated, TB-CP-6.9a showed no detectable binding (Fig.\u00a04E). This outcome is consistent with the essentiality of the internal bulged loop for \u03b22-\u03b23 loop recognition (38). Overall, the results suggest that TB-CP-6.9a binds to TAR in a manner analogous to the parental TAR-TBP6.9 complex (Fig.\u00a01C).Table\u00a02Specificity of TB-CP-6.9a for variants of HIV TAR RNATAR sampleKD (\u03bc\u039c)Krela\u0394\u0397\u00b0 (kcal mol\u22121)-T\u0394S\u00b0 (kcal mol\u22121)\u0394G\u00b0 (kcal mol\u22121)Wild type5.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.21.0\u22127.7\u00a0\u00b1 1.1+0.6\u00a0\u00b1 1.2\u22127.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.01\u0394254.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.70.9\u221210.4\u00a0\u00b1 0.33.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.4\u22127.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.1GNRA8.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.91.6\u22124.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.12.3\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u22127.1\u00a0\u00b1 0.1GNRA\u039435ndbndndndnd\u0394bulgendndndndndOpen in a separate windowaDefined as the ratio of [Cyclic peptide KD]/[TB-CP-6.9a KD].bNot detected due to poor heat of binding.TB-CP-6.9a resists binding to off-target RNAsWe next assessed the specificity of the TB-CP-6.9a cyclic peptide for TAR compared with other RNAs. Accordingly, we tested binding of this cyclic peptide to human U1 snRNA hairpin II, BIV TAR, and human 7SK RNA (Fig.\u00a0S3A). Each of these RNAs exhibits multiple major-groove guanines for arginine recognition. Whereas U1 hpII possesses a loop on top of a stem, BIV and 7SK exhibit pyrimidine-rich internal loops with major-groove base triples that share sequence features with HIV TAR (28, 34, 63, 64).We first titrated TB-CP-6.9a into solutions of U1 snRNA hp II. This RNA is the natural target of the parental U1A protein that was subjected to yeast display maturation as a means to select the family of TBPs (Fig.\u00a01B) (39). No heats of binding were detected (Fig.\u00a0S3B), indicating that the cyclic peptide does not interact appreciably with the hpII stemloop. This observation parallels a previous analysis that revealed the absence of a hpII interaction with proteins TBP6.6 and TBP6.7 by surface plasmon resonance (39).The BIV TAR RNA was tested next and also showed no heat of binding (Fig.\u00a0S3C). BIV TAR adopts a bulged loop conformation analogous to HIV TAR but assumes a different internal loop fold that necessitates a distinct mode of recognition by the BIV Tat ARM compared with that of HIV Tat (34, 64). The ability to discriminate between HIV TAR and BIV TAR proved to be a shortcoming of prior cyclic peptides that were produced by structure-guided design using the BIV TAR-Tat structure (33, 35, 36).Finally, we titrated TB-CP-6.9a into human 7SK RNA. We chose 7SK because it is the target of HIV Tat binding (Fig.\u00a01A), which utilizes a series of arginines to read specific guanines in the RNA major groove (28). This mode of RNA binding has commonalities with TBP6.9 (Fig.\u00a01C) (38, 40). Although the Tat ARM peptide showed a strong binding response for the 7SK RNA (average KD of 6.4\u00a0\u00b1 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM), we observed no detectable heat of binding for cyclic peptides (Fig.\u00a0S3, D and E). Titration of the methylene- and meta-xylene-linked cyclic peptides TB-CP-6.Ra and TB-CP-6.Rf-m similarly indicated no evidence of specific binding, although small interaction heats were visible that implied traces of off-target interactions (Fig.\u00a0S3, F and G). This effect was likely due to the higher arginine content of the peptide sequence, which was derived from site-directed mutagenesis of TBP6.9 rather than lab-based selection (40). Collectively, the results suggest that these TAR-targeting cyclic peptides\u2014and in particular TB-CP-6.9a\u2014are highly selective toward TAR and resist off-target binding interactions.Cyclic peptides block the arginine-rich TAT ARM from TAR bindingWe next investigated whether representative cyclic peptides could compete for binding to HIV TAR RNA against a peptide derived from HIV Tat. In this experiment, the cyclic peptide to be tested is titrated into the target TAR RNA and monitored for binding by ITC (Fig.\u00a05A). Next the HIV Tat ARM peptide is injected into the preformed TAR-cyclic peptide complex and the heat of binding is recorded. As a control, we showed previously that the Tat ARM peptide binds to TAR in the absence of cyclic peptide with a KD of 135\u00a0\u00b1 31\u00a0nM and a 2:1 ratio of peptide to RNA (40). Moreover, TB-CP-6.9a was observed to block binding of the Tat ARM when a fivefold molar ratio of the HIV peptide was titrated into the preformed TAR-TB-CP-6.9a complex (40). In contrast, linear peptide TB-LP-6.9a did not block TAR binding to the Tat ARM.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a05TAR-binding competition assay using the Tat ARM peptide to displace cyclic peptides and vice versa.A, schematic diagram of a TAR competition experiment in which a cyclic peptide is titrated into TAR RNA; the complex is then probed for binding by the Tat ARM peptide, which is titrated subsequently into the ITC sample. In a successful assay, the presence of the cyclic peptide prohibits binding of the Tat ARM to TAR. The far-right panel shows a reverse assay in which a preformed TAR-Tat complex exists in the ITC sample cell and is probed by titration of a cyclic peptide. B, titration of the HIV Tat ARM peptide into a preformed complex between TAR and TB-CP-6.9l. Here and elsewhere, the absence of Tat ARM binding is based on the lack of an appreciable heat change with increasing peptide that is expected for this interaction (40). C, titration of the HIV Tat ARM peptide into a preformed complex between TAR and TB-CP-6.9m. D, titration of the HIV Tat ARM peptide into a preformed complex between TAR and TB-CP-6.Rf-m. E, reverse titration in which TB-CP-6.9a was titrated into the preformed TAR-Tat ARM complex. The heats of titration reveal cyclic peptide binding and saturation consistent with an apparent KD of 18.3\u00a0\u00b1 2.1\u00a0\u03bcM and 1:1 binding stoichiometry; the average values from replicate experiments were: KD\u00a0= 17.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.1\u00a0\u03bcM, n\u00a0= 0.96 and c\u00a0= 2.2. Each experiment in panels B\u2013E was performed twice. Errors represent the standard deviation taken from separate replicate measurements.Here, we tested TB-CP-6.9l, TB-CP-6.9m, and TB-CP-6.Rf-m, due to their high-affinity binding to TAR (Table\u00a01). Like TB-CP-6.9a, each cyclic peptide blocked the TAR interaction with the HIV Tat ARM peptide as indicated by the absence of titration heats while the Tat ARM was added to each preformed TAR-cyclic peptide complex (Fig.\u00a05, B and D). As an additional control experiment, we preformed the HIV TAR-Tat ARM complex and then titrated TB-CP-6.9a into the mixture, which was held in the ITC sample cell (i.e., the backward arrow extending from the TAR-Tat ARM complex in Fig.\u00a05A). The results demonstrated that the cyclic peptide displaced the Tat ARM peptide (Fig.\u00a05E). Although the apparent KD of TB-CP-6.9a for TAR was weaker in the presence of the Tat ARM (average KD of 17.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.1\u00a0\u03bcM), the cyclic peptide still appeared to bind TAR with 1:1 stoichiometry. The ability of our cyclic peptides to block binding by the Tat ARM and to release the Tat ARM peptide from a bound state suggests that there is overlap between the site of cyclic peptide binding to TAR and an RNA site recognized by the Tat ARM. This observation, along with TAR-TBP cocrystal structures and TAR-variant structure\u2013activity analysis (above), localizes cyclic peptide binding to the major groove of the TAR internal bulged loop.TBP-derived cyclic peptides use an arginine fork motif for TAR bindingA key prediction from the structures of HIV TAR in complex with TBPs is that our designer cyclic peptides, such as TB-CP-6.9a, will exploit a specific arginine fork motif for TAR recognition (38, 40). The arginine fork is exemplified by the TBP6.9 interaction with TAR (Fig.\u00a01C). Here, the Hoogsteen edge of conserved base Gua26 accepts hydrogen bonds from the N\u03b71 and N\u03b72 moieties of the R47 guanidinium group. R47 also makes a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond to the pro-Rp oxygen and O5\u2032 of Uri23, respectively. Cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions also occur between the R47 guanidinium group and nucleobases from Ade22 and Uri23 above and below the side chain. These interactions give rise to a type H\u03b7\u03b7P fork (65) (Fig.\u00a06A). Previously we showed that the R47K mutation to TBP6.7 reduced HIV TAR binding by 327-fold (38). Accordingly, we synthesized a cyclic peptide variant of TB-CP-6.Rf-m in which the R47-equivalent position was changed to lysine. We chose TB-CP-6.Rf-m because this cyclic peptide binds TAR with 0.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM affinity (Fig.\u00a06B and Table\u00a01). In contrast, the R47K variant produced an average KD of 8.2\u00a0\u00b1 1.0 \u03bc\u039c, yielding a Krel of 10 (Fig.\u00a06C and Table\u00a01). Like the parental TB-CP-6.9f-m peptide, the R47K variant shows binding driven by enthalpy (\u0394H of\u00a0\u22129.5\u00a0\u00b1 1.0\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121) countered by unfavorable entropy (-T\u0394S of\u00a0+2.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.9\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121). The \u0394\u0394G of\u00a0+1.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 is consistent with loss of two or more hydrogen bonds or a salt-bridge interaction.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a06R47K mutation reduces affinity toward TAR and does not entirely compete with the Tat-ARM.A, close-up view of the variant TBP6.7 Q48R/T50R, where R47 makes an arginine fork interaction to recognize the TAR major groove. TB-CP-6.Rf, derived from TBP6.7 Q48R/T50R, contains five arginines and binds TAR with an average KD of 0.8\u00a0\u00b1 0.1 \u03bc\u039c (Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a0S1P). B, representative thermogram of the TB-CP-6.Rf cyclic peptide titrated in TAR. C, representative thermogram of the TB-CP-6.Rf R47K mutant peptide titrated into TAR. The lysine substitution diminishes TAR affinity by tenfold, indicating the importance of arginine at a position equivalent to 47. Average thermodynamic parameters are reported in Table\u00a01. D, representative thermogram of the Tat-ARM titrated into the preformed complex of TAR-TB-CP-6.Rf R47K. The Tat-ARM binds to the complex with an average KD of 2.8\u00a0\u00b1 1.1 \u03bc\u039c, displaying a 1:1 stoichiometry. Each ITC experiment was performed twice. Errors represent the standard deviation taken from separate replicate measurements.We next investigated the ability of the R47K cyclic peptide to block the Tat-ARM from TAR binding. By analogy to TBPs, we hypothesized that R47 is a crucial determinant of our cyclic peptides in blocking TAR recognition by the Tat-ARM. As expected, a competition assay revealed that the R47K variant was unable to compete with the Tat-ARM for TAR binding. Specifically, the Tat-ARM showed binding to a preformed complex of TAR-(TB-CP-6.Rf R47K), which yielded an apparent KD of 2.8\u00a0\u00b1 1.1 \u03bc\u039c (Fig.\u00a06D).The Tat-ARM was shown previously to recognize TAR at two binding sites (40, 66), but binding here was consistent with a one-site binding during titration of the Tat ARM peptide into the preformed TAR-TB-CP-6.Rf R47K complex. This suggests that the R47K variant incompletely blocks Tat-ARM recognition of TAR, supporting a case for arginine-fork-based TAR recognition. In contrast, cyclic peptides that contain R47, such as TB-CP-6.9a, TB-CP-6.9l, TB-CP-6.9m, and TB-CP-6.Rf, bind TAR with 1:1 stoichiometry while completely abrogating Tat-ARM association with the TAR-peptide complex (Fig.\u00a05, B\u2013D). Notably, replacement of other arginine positions in cyclic peptides, such as the R48T variation that differentiates TB-CP-6.9a and TB-CP-6.3a, led to a slight increase in affinity (Krel of 0.6) (Table\u00a01). This comparison shows that not all arginine changes in cyclic peptides are deleterious. The results underscore the importance of arginine at a position equivalent to R47 in the cyclic peptide, which is expected if cyclic peptides engage TAR via an arginine fork, as observed in all known TAR-TBP cocrystal structures (38, 40).Methylene and naphthalene-linked cyclic peptides exhibit antiviral activityWe next evaluated the most promising TAR-binding cyclic peptides for antiviral activity, namely TB-LP-6.9, TB-CP-6.9a, TB-CP-6.Rl, TB-CP-6.Ra, TB-CP-6.Rf-m, TB-CP-6.Rm, TB-CP-6.9i, TB-CP-6.9l, TB-CP-6.9f-m, and TB-CP-6.3f-m. Linear peptide TB-LP-6.9\u2014derived from TBP6.9 and described previously (40)\u2014was included as reference. For these studies, a single-round infectivity assay was employed in which pseudotyped HIV-1 was produced by HEK293T cells (67, 68). The virus is made from a modified proviral HIV-1 plasmid lacking the env gene that is replaced by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G-protein. A gene encoding green fluorescent protein replaces the nef gene, allowing virion production to be tracked in producer cells. A range of concentrations of each cyclic peptide was incubated for up to 1\u00a0h with TZM-bl cells prior to infection with pseudotyped virus. Viral infection was monitored after 48\u00a0h by detection of luciferase activity resulting from TAR-mediated expression that depends on viral infection and Tat binding (69). As a control for antiviral activity, we used temacrazine, which selectively inhibits viral transcription without affecting cellular genes (70). Of the cyclic peptides tested, no appreciable antiviral activity was observed for TB-CP-6.Ra, TB-CP-6.Rl, TB-CP-6.Rf-m, TB-CP-6.Rm, TB-CP-6.9i, TB-CP-6.9f-m, and TB-CP-6.3f-m compared with control levels of infectivity measured in the absence of cyclic peptide (Fig.\u00a0S4). Indeed, peptides such as TB-CP-6.Ra and TB-CP-6.9i enhanced infectivity by 300 and 150% at 200\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations. The positive charge of the arginine residues within the cyclic peptides could cause cells to become more susceptible to virus uptake\u2014a phenomenon similar to that reported for polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) whose polycationic character enhances pseudotyped virus capsid binding to the cell membrane (71, 72, 73).In contrast, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in viral infectivity for TB-CP-6.9a (Fig.\u00a07A) and TB-LP-6.9 (Fig.\u00a0S4). Whereas TB-LP-6.9 showed only a modest 19% reduction of viral infectivity at 200\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations\u2014consistent with its somewhat poorer KD for TAR of 13.8\u00a0\u00b1 5.6\u00a0\u03bcM (40), its methylene-linked counterpart TB-CP-6.9a reduced infectivity by 47% at 250\u00a0\u03bcM. Fitting a dose\u2013response curve for this cyclic peptide yielded an IC50 of 410\u00a0\u00b1 18 \u03bc\u039c (Fig.\u00a07A). A cellular toxicity assay was then used to derive a CC50, which was estimated to be \u223c2200\u00a0\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a07A). The selectivity index (SI) of this compound, as given by the ratio of CC50 to IC50, is 5.5, indicating that TB-CP-6.9a exhibits good selectivity in the cell-based activity assay albeit with modest potency.Open in a separate windowFigure\u00a07Antiviral and cell viability assays of cyclic peptides in HIV-1 infectivity assays.A, TB-CP-6.9a reduces HIV-1 infectivity in a dose-dependent manner, displaying a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of infectivity at 410\u00a0\u00b1 18 \u03bc\u039c and CC50 (cytotoxicity) of \u223c2200 \u03bc\u039c. The selectivity index (SI) is the ratio of cytotoxicity to antiviral activity, which was calculated to be 5.5. Here and elsewhere, values denoted by an asterisk are considered estimates due to extrapolations of CC50 values. B, TB-CP-6.9l reduces HIV-1 infectivity in a dose-dependent manner, displaying an IC50 of 461\u00a0\u00b1 26 \u03bc\u039c and a CC50 of \u223c819\u00a0\u00b1 30 \u03bc\u039c. The SI was 1.8. C, TB-CP-6.9m reduces HIV-1 infectivity in a dose-dependent manner, displaying an IC50 of 233\u00a0\u00b1 5 \u03bc\u039c and a CC50 of 327\u00a0\u00b1 7 \u03bc\u039c. The SI was calculated to be 1.4. Each data point is the result of three biological replicate measurements where error bars represent standard deviations. Standard errors for IC50 and CC50 are defined in GraphPad.The 1,4-dimethyl-naphthalene linked variant of TB-CP-6.9a (Fig.\u00a02), TB-CP-6.9l, also suppressed infectivity. An IC50 of 461\u00a0\u00b1 27 \u03bc\u039c was measured (Fig.\u00a07B) and cytotoxicity assays produced a CC50 of \u223c819\u00a0\u00b1 30 \u03bc\u039c (Fig.\u00a07B). The selectivity index for TB-CP-6.9l was calculated to be 1.8 (Fig.\u00a07B). Compared with the methylene linker, 1,4-dimethyl-naphthalene appears more toxic to cells. Interestingly, the closely related 2,3-dimethyl-naphthalene-linked peptide, TB-CP-6.9m, revealed higher potency but slightly higher toxicity. The dose\u2013response curve produced an IC50 of 233\u00a0\u00b1 5 \u03bc\u039c (Fig.\u00a07C). However, the CC50 was 327\u00a0\u00b1 7.1 \u03bc\u039c (Fig.\u00a07C), which gave rise to an SI value of 1.4. Given how similar TB-CP-6.9l and TB-CP-6.9m are in terms of their KD values for TAR (KD values of 5.0\u00a0\u00b1 1.5\u00a0\u03bcM and 3.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM, Table\u00a01), our results demonstrate the importance of cell-based analysis to provide a more in-depth picture of selectivity. DiscussionHigh-priority topics for HIV/AIDS research include development of next-generation HIV therapies (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-137.html). The goal of this investigation was to find new compounds that disrupt the HIV TAR RNA interaction with the viral protein Tat\u2014an essential complex for viral replication (Fig.\u00a01A) (16,\u00a074, 75, 76). HIV TAR is appropriate as a therapeutic target because of its high sequence conservation and low mutation frequency (77). Nonetheless, TAR has eluded thus far the development of inhibitors suitable for clinical applications (16,\u00a017, 78, 79). Toward this goal, we used a nonconventional approach in which lab-based evolution was applied to the human U1A RNA-binding protein to repurpose it for high-affinity TAR binding (Fig.\u00a01B) (39). Cocrystal structures of TAR-TBP complexes revealed that the majority of binding arises from the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop amino acids of TBPs (Fig.\u00a01C). This finding suggested that the loop could function as a standalone TAR-recognition motif (38, 40). Here, we reported that the design of a library of cyclic peptide mimics of this TAR recognition motif and analyzed the influence of peptide cyclization linkers and arginine composition on their affinity and selectivity toward TAR, TAR mutants, and off-target RNAs, as well as their ability to interfere with Tat ARM binding to TAR and their antiviral properties in cell culture. Our studies demonstrate that our \u201cTBP \u03b22-\u03b23 loop mimics\u201d can provide promising agents for selective recognition of TAR and inhibition of the TAR-Tat interaction in\u00a0vitro. Importantly, some of these cyclic peptides exhibit antiviral activity in cells, while displaying relatively low cytotoxicity.Peptides continue to play key roles in the therapeutic armamentarium with >60 FDA-approved peptide drugs available, including the anti-HIV peptide Fuzeon (80, 81). As part of our design strategy, the TAR-binding \u03b22-\u03b23 loop motif of TBPs was translated into macrocyclic peptides constrained by an inter-side-chain cross-link via cysteine bis-alkylation. Cognizant of the impact of backbone modifications on the conformational\u2014and thus functional\u2014properties of cyclic peptides (82, 83, 84), variation of the linker structure was exploited to tune the affinity of these TBP mimics toward TAR, resulting in TAR affinities ranging from 24.2 to 0.8 \u03bc\u039c (Table\u00a01). Of note, subtle structural modifications at the level of the linker, including some as small as single-atom substitutions (e.g., TB-CP-6.9h versus TB-CP-6.9f-m or TB-CP-6.9c versus TB-CP-6.9d), were found to impart important changes in TAR affinity (3\u20136-fold difference in KD), highlighting the sensitivity of these cyclic peptides to conformational changes imposed by the intramolecular crosslink. A general trend emerging from structure\u2013activity analysis of our library of 16 TAR-targeting cyclic peptides is that shorter and/or more rigid linkers are associated with tighter TAR binding (e.g., CH2 > CH2CH2 > CH2CH2CH2; CH2C(O)CH2 > CH2CH2CH2; m-xylene >> p-xylene). This may reflect the fact that these linkers allow for the cyclic peptide to adopt a conformation that better resembles that of the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop in the TAR-TBP complexes (Fig.\u00a01C).Indeed, although cocrystals structures of our cyclic peptides in complex with TAR are not yet available, our results suggest that TB-CP-6.9a\u2014and related peptides of this study\u2014interacts with TAR in a manner comparable to TBP6.9 recognition of TAR (Fig.\u00a01C) (40). For example, the \u039425 mutant, which eliminated this nucleotide from the central bulge, had little effect on TAR binding (Fig.\u00a04C). This finding is consistent with cocrystal structures wherein Cyt25 bulges outside the core fold (38, 40). Similarly, replacement of the apical loop with a GNRA tetraloop had no appreciable effect on TB-CP-6.9a affinity (Fig.\u00a04D). This finding concurs with cocrystal structures wherein no contacts occur between the TAR apical loop and the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop (Fig.\u00a01C). In contrast, the \u039435 mutant indicates a key role for this nucleotide in high-affinity TB-CP-6.9a binding to TAR, in accord with the close proximity of this bulged base to the \u03b22-\u03b23 loop (e.g., Fig.\u00a01C) (40). These findings pinpoint cyclic peptide binding near the TAR Uri23\u00b7Ade27-Uri37 base triple, which implies arginine-mediated readout at the Hoogsteen edges of Gus26, Gua28, and Gua36.Additional evidence of major groove recognition by cyclic peptides is based on competition experiments using the Tat ARM. This peptide was unable to bind TAR when specific cyclic peptides were present in preformed complexes (Fig.\u00a05, B\u2013D). Previously, TB-CP-6.9a produced an analogous result, whereas its linear counterpart, TB-LP-6.9, did not (40). Conversely, we found that preformed TAR-Tat complexes did not impede binding of TB-CP-6.9a (Fig.\u00a05E). One plausible explanation of these results is that cyclic peptides compete with the Tat ARM for overlapping binding sites. Indeed, a solution structure of the TAR-Tat ARM complex shows direct overlap of the polypeptide with the site of TBP \u03b22-\u03b23 loop recognition (28, 33, 40). Although kinetic measurements of Tat ARM binding to TAR have been unsuccessful, it is plausible that the viral peptide dissociates more rapidly than cyclic peptides. Indeed, the NMR ensemble of the HIV TAR-Tat complex reveals substantial dynamics and flexibility (28).Another explanation that could account for cyclic peptide obstruction of Tat binding to TAR comes from Evrysdi. This FDA-approved drug is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) caused by SMN1 gene mutations. Although this drug binds with a modest affinity of 28\u00a0\u00b1 9 \u03bc\u039c, it targets the E7 5\u2032-splice site of SMN2 pre-mRNA (85). The resulting conformational changes render the message accessible to the U1-C zinc-finger (86), which promotes E7 inclusion in the spliced transcript leading to a functional compensatory SMN2 protein (87, 88). This result illustrates that a small molecule can influence RNA conformation to induce an alternative function. Our cyclic peptides could conceivably alter the TAR RNA conformation as well, preventing Tat from recognizing the TAR major groove.To compete with the Tat ARM for TAR binding, our cyclic peptides were designed to use an arginine fork motif. This motif is a key determinant of major groove recognition that is observed in all TAR-TBP cocrystal structures (e.g., Fig.\u00a06A) (38,\u00a040). Specifically, R47 stabilizes the Uri23\u00b7Ade27-Uri37 base triple, which is a hallmark of most ligand-bound TAR structures (33). Solution NMR pinpoints arginine binding to Gua26 of TAR (28, 89) and these observations collectively explain the finding that at least one arginine in the Tat ARM is required to promote TAR binding and viral transactivation (28, 90). Evidence that our cyclic peptides use arginine-fork readout is based on TAR affinity shown by the TB-CP-6.Rf-m R47K variant. This mutation reduced binding by tenfold and rendered the RNA susceptible to Tat ARM binding (Fig.\u00a06, C and D). These findings allow us to infer two important properties regarding cyclic peptide binding to TAR. First, loss of TAR affinity by the R47K mutation in TB-CP-6.Rf-m is consistent with disruption of arginine fork recognition of the major groove. We hypothesize that fork ablation promotes TAR major groove expansion\u2014as observed in the unliganded state (33)\u2014as a preface to Tat-ARM binding. Second, the R47K variant along with other peptides, such as TB-CP-6.9a, TB-CP-6.9f-m, TB-CP-6.9l, and TB-CP-6.9m that effectively compete with the Tat-ARM, each possesses four arginines. Our ITC analysis suggests that the ability to block the Tat-ARM varies based on arginine positioning in the sequence to recognize a specific geometry\u2014not on the number of arginines. These results concur with our previous observations about arginine composition and placement in the context of TBP \u03b22-\u03b23 loop recognition of HIV TAR (40).Significantly, some cyclic peptides of this investigation exhibit noticeable, albeit modest, antiviral activity, as measured by a cell-based infectivity assay (IC50 values in a range of 230\u2013460\u00a0\u03bcM). Among these, TB-CP-6.9a and TB-CP-6.9m show the most promising activity, while exhibiting comparatively low and modest cytotoxicity, respectively. Interestingly\u2014and in contrast to the clear SAR trends observable for these compounds with respect to TAR affinity\u2014both the linker structure and peptide composition were found to elicit idiosyncratic effects in terms of antiviral activity. In addition, a strict correlation between in\u00a0vitro TAR affinity and antiviral activity was not observed, which might be attributable to the differential ability of these compounds to penetrate cells and reach the cytoplasm. For example, while the meta-xylene linker produced relatively tight TAR binding across multiple peptide sequences (e.g., KD of 0.8\u20132.0 for TB-CP-6.9f-m, TB-CP-6.3f-m, and TB-CP-6.Rf-m), these compounds showed low to no antiviral activity (Fig.\u00a0S4). In contrast, while showing slightly weaker binding to TAR (KD values of 3.7\u20135.0\u00a0\u03bcM), naphthalene-containing peptides proved effective as antivirals in the context of the TBP6.9 sequence (Fig.\u00a07, B and C). This difference may be the result of improved cytosolic localization of these compounds, as observed for other naphthalene-containing peptides (91, 92, 93).Arginine-rich linear peptides, such as the HIV Tat ARM, readily enter cells (94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100), and arginine-rich cyclic peptides\u2014with molecular weights and arginine compositions analogous to those described here\u2014have been reported to undergo facile cell entry with no toxicity (56, 91, 93, 101, 102, 103). Surprisingly, we found that our penta-arginine cyclic peptides (i.e., TB-CP-6.Ra and TB-CP-6.Rf-m) failed to elicit antiviral activity (Fig.\u00a0S4), despite their relatively high affinity for TAR (KD\u00a0= 0.8\u20131.0\u00a0\u03bcM). Similarly, both naphthalene-linked peptides based on the TBP6.R sequence showed no antiviral activity (Fig.\u00a0S4), while their TBP6.9 counterparts with one less arginine showed dose-dependent antiviral activity (Fig.\u00a07, B and C). Overall, these results indicate that while beneficial for the TAR interaction, an increase in the arginine content in these cyclic peptides is not necessary or sufficient to elicit antiviral activity in cells.RNA-targeting cyclic peptides are still at nascent stage of development. In this work, we demonstrated the design and development of a new class of macrocyclic peptides capable of targeting HIV-1 TAR RNA with high affinity and selectivity at the binding interface between TAR RNA and the Tat ARM peptide. Furthermore, some of these compounds were also found to interfere with the viral lifecycle in cells, albeit with modest activity. We envision that both the in\u00a0vitro affinity and cellular activity of these compounds can be further optimized by leveraging the structure\u2013activity insights gained from the present investigation. As such, this work provides a foundation for further development of cyclic peptide-based anti-HIV agents as well as a framework for a better understanding of RNA recognition by small macrocyclic peptides. Experimental proceduresRNA synthesis and purificationHIV-1 TAR 27-mer was used for all ITC experiments. The RNA was in\u00a0vitro transcribed and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis (104). The product was desalted, lyophilized, and stored at\u00a0\u221220 \u00b0C until needed. RNAs used for specificity and off-target analysis such as BIV TAR, TAR \u0394bulge, TAR-GNRA, TAR-GNRA\u039435, TAR \u0394U25, U1hpII RNA, and 7SK RNA were synthesized (Horizon Discovery Group) and purified as described (38).Peptide library synthesis and purificationSynthesis of sequences provided in Table S1 was carried out by conventional Fmoc-solid-phase peptide synthesis on Knorr amide resin (0.4\u00a0mmol\u00a0g\u22121 on a 0.1-mmol scale). Peptides were generated manually in syringes equipped with a Teflon frit. Initially, the resin was subjected to swelling for 30\u00a0min in 5\u00a0ml of a 1:1 mixture of dichloromethane/N,N-dimethylformamide (DCM/DMF). Swollen resin was then treated with 20% piperidine in DMF containing 0.05\u00a0M 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (3 cycles of 3\u00a0min, 5\u00a0min, and 3\u00a0min) to achieve the deprotection of Fmoc. After washing with DMF (5\u00d7), the resin was loaded with four equivalents of amino acid, four equivalents of HCTU, and eight equivalents of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) with respect to the initial loading of the resin. The coupling reaction was left at room temperature for 40\u00a0min with shaking. This process was repeated to attain the desired peptide sequence. Upon final Fmoc-deprotection, the peptide N-terminus was acetylated using ten equivalents of acetic anhydride and 20\u00a0equivalents of DIPEA in DMF for 30\u00a0min.The polypeptide product was cleaved from resin as follows: the resin was washed with DMF (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0ml), DCM (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0ml) and dried in vacuo. A 10\u00a0ml volume of cleavage mixture comprising 95% (v/v) TFA, 2.5% (v/v) triisopropylsilane and 2.5% (v/v) water was added to the resin and shaken 2\u00a0h at room temperature. The filtrate was collected and concentrated under reduced pressure and was mixed with a tenfold excess volume of cold diethyl ether and centrifuged. The crude precipitated peptide was dissolved in 10\u00a0ml of 1:1 acetonitrile:water and lyophilized.Peptide cyclization was performed as follows: lyophilized peptide (4\u00a0mmol) was dissolved in 20\u00a0ml of 0.05\u00a0M ammonium bicarbonate buffer in acetonitrile: water (1:1), pH 8.5. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (8\u00a0mmol, 2 equivalents) was added, and the reaction mixture was shaken at 37 \u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. The respective bis-halide linker (24\u00a0mmol, six equivalents) dissolved in DMF (0.20\u00a0ml) was added, and the reaction mixture was shaken further overnight. Cyclization progress was monitored by MALDI-MS. Upon quantitative cyclization, the solution was lyophilized and the cyclic peptide was purified by semipreparative HPLC using a gradient of 5 to 30% acetonitrile over 30\u00a0min. The average overall yield was \u223c10%. The pure and lyophilized peptide was treated further with 0.10\u00a0M HCl and lyophilized to remove TFA.Isothermal titration calorimetryLyophilized TAR RNA was dissolved in an RNA dilution buffer of 0.01\u00a0M HEPES pH 7.5 and heated to 65 \u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. TAR folding buffer containing 0.01\u00a0M Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 0.05\u00a0M NaCl and 0.002\u00a0M MgCl2 was added and incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 3\u00a0min. The RNA was cooled to room temperature over 5 to 6\u00a0h. The RNA was dialyzed overnight against 4\u00a0l of ITC buffer (0.05\u00a0M Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 0.05\u00a0M NaCl, 0.05\u00a0M KCl, and 0.002\u00a0M \u03b2-ME). All experiments were performed using a PEAQ ITC (Malvern Panalytical) with peptide in the syringe and RNA in the cell. RNAs used for structure\u2013activity analysis were handled similarly. All ITC thermograms were measured at 20 \u00b0C unless noted. In each experiment, 200 or 300 \u03bc\u039c of the cyclic peptide in the syringe was titrated into the cell containing 15 or 20 \u03bc\u039c TAR RNA. Data were analyzed using PEAQ-ITC software (Malvern Panalytical) and all thermograms fit best to one-site binding models based on criteria described (62). Average thermodynamic parameters from duplicate measurements are reported in Figure\u00a03 and Table\u00a01. Representative thermograms are provided in Figure\u00a0S2. Errors represent the standard deviation derived from replicate measurements.Competition ITC assaysTat competition experiments were performed as described elsewhere (40). Briefly, pure Tat-ARM peptide was prepared from Genscript, Inc; the sequence (GISYGRKKRRQRRRAHQ) (28) contains an acetylated N-terminus and an amidated C-terminus. In each competition assay, 400 \u03bc\u039c of cyclic peptide was titrated into 20 \u03bc\u039c TAR in the sample cell. All competition and reverse competition experiments were conducted at 20 \u00b0C. Thermograms were analyzed using PEAQ-ITC analysis software and fit best to a one-site binding model. Subsequently, the Tat-ARM at a concentration of 500 \u03bc\u039c was titrated from the syringe into the TAR-cyclic peptide complex preformed in the sample cell during a preceding ITC experiment. Most resulting thermograms showed no substantial heats of binding and data failed to fit available binding models (Fig.\u00a05, B\u2013D). One exception was TB-CP-6.Rf R47K, which showed discernible binding (Fig.\u00a06D). For reverse competition assays, the Tat-ARM peptide at 2.6 \u03bc\u039c was titrated dropwise into 40 \u03bc\u039c HIV TAR RNA and incubated on the bench for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. TB-CP-6.9a at a concentration of 620 \u03bc\u039c was then titrated into the preformed Tat-TAR complex in the ITC sample cell. The resultant thermogram showed substantial heats of binding and fit best to a one-site binding model.Pseudotyped HIV-1 infectivity and cell toxicity assaysThe antiviral activity of TAR-binding cyclic peptides was measured by single-round infectivity assays using pseudotyped HIV-1 produced by HEK293T cells (67). A single round of infectivity was achieved by the transient cotransfection of the viral vector and a plasmid expressing VSV-G envelope. After 24\u00a0h, the p24 viral capsid protein was quantified by ELISA to normalize the viral load. Individual cyclic peptides or temacrazine was added 1\u00a0h prior to the infection of TZM-bl reporter cells with p24 normalized virus. Each well contains 104\u00a0cells and equal viral loads. The reporter cells express luciferase in a TAR-dependent manner following successful HIV infection. Luminescence was used as a direct measure of viral infectivity in the presence of cyclic peptide. In parallel with infectivity, cytotoxicity was tested across the same dose ranges using temacrazine or peptide-treated mock-exposed cells. At 48\u00a0h after treatment, the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega Corp.) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The infectivity and cytotoxicity experiments were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates. IC50 and CC50 values were calculated from the Richard\u2019s five-parameter dose\u2013response curve of values plotted by percent of control infectivity and cytotoxicity in Prism v9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc).
