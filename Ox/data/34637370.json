Although the exact causal pathways of this increased risk are still not completely clear, different non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed: (i) the use of immunomodulatory agents; (ii) the impairment of antigen presentation and the presence of acquired immunosuppression due to SARS-CoV-2; (iii) the impairment of microcirculation due to the endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy occurring during COVID-19 [1,4,5].Regarding the aetiology of BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19, an unexpectedly high prevalence of enterococcal BSI has been previously observed [3,6,7]. Against this background and considering the frequent use of antimicrobials in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [8,9], the risk of selecting difficult-to-treat resistant strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may be non-negligible [10], in turn possibly impacting patients\u2019 outcomes.The present, descriptive cases series was aimed to better depict the characteristics of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially in the terms of cumulative incidence, causative microorganisms, and outcome. MethodsThis retrospective, single-centre study was conducted in two ICU wards (up to a maximum of 39 beds for COVID-19 patients, with their number being dynamically reduced/increased according to the local COVID-19 epidemiology) at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, a 1200-bed teaching hospital in Genoa, Italy. From 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, all patients with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI were included in the study.The primary objective was to describe the characteristics of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19, in terms of cumulative incidence, causative microorganisms, clinical characteristics, antimicrobial treatment, and 30-day mortality. A secondary objective was to exploratorily assess the predictors of 30-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI.The collection of anonymized data for the present study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Liguria Region Ethics Committee, registry number 163/2020) and specific informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study.DefinitionsCOVID-19 was defined as at least one real-time polymerase chain reaction assay positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a respiratory specimen. ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI was defined as at least one blood culture drawn at >48\u2009h after ICU admission positive for enterococci [11].Data collectionThe following data were collected from the laboratory database and the patients\u2019 medical records as they were at the time of the first enterococcal BSI episode: age in years; gender; Charlson score [12]; diabetes mellitus; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic kidney disease [13]; previous myocardial infarction; presence of solid neoplasm; presence of hematological malignancy; solid organ transplant; haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; admission from a long-term care facility; previous hospitalization (within 6\u2009months); previous vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolation (within 6\u2009months); acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at hospital admission (at least mild according to Berlin criteria [14]); need for invasive mechanical ventilation (before the development of enterococcal BSI); previous therapy with glycopeptides (within 6\u2009months); anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 (steroids and/or tocilizumab); ICU stay in days before the development of the first enterococcal BSI episode; recent treatment with cephalosporins (during hospital stay before the development of BSI), presence of neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500 cell/mm3); presence of a central venous catheter (CVC); Pitt bacteraemia score [15]; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score [16]; presence of septic shock [17]; causative agent of the enterococcal BSI; presence of a polymicrobial BSI (and type of concomitant aetiological agent other than Enterococcus spp., with at least two consecutive cultures positive for the same pathogen being necessary for defining BSI due to coagulase-negative staphylococci or other common skin contaminants); DENOVA score [18]; presence of a CVC-related BSI (CRBSI) [19]; concomitant endocarditis (the presence of IE was defined according to the modified Duke\u2019s criteria [20]); adequate source control, that is, unnecessary, removal of infected devices, or drainage of infected fluid collections; administration of an empirical therapy; administration of an appropriate empirical therapy (defined as administration of at least one agent with in vitro activity against the given blood isolate).MicrobiologyThe Vitek MS MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (bioM\u00e9rieux, Craponne, France) was routinely used for identifying Enterococcus spp. as causative microorganisms of ICU-acquired BSI, whereas the Vitek 2 automated system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Craponne, France) was routinely used for susceptibility testing. The results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (breakpoint tables for interpretation of minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC] and zone diameters, version 10.0, 2020; http://www.eucast.org). For daptomycin, isolates were considered susceptible in the case of MIC \u22642\u2009mg/L [21].Statistical analysisNo sample size calculations a priori were performed for this descriptive, exploratory study. For the primary descriptive analysis, the cumulative incidence of ICU- acquired enterococcal BSI was calculated as the number of events per 1000 ICU admissions of COVID-19 patients, with exact mid-p 95% confidence interval (CI) [22]. In the case of multiple episodes of enterococcal BSI from the same species occurring in the same patient, a novel event was considered as independent from the previous one if developed at least 30\u2009days after the last positive culture related to the previous episode. With regard to the demographic and clinical characteristics of single patients, categorical variables were summarized with numbers and percentages, and continuous variables with medians and interquartile ranges. The 95% CI was calculated for all estimates [23,24].For the secondary exploratory analysis of predictors of 30-day mortality, the first ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI per patient was considered. The possible association between clinical variables and 30-day mortality was first tested in univariable logistic regression models. Then, variables potentially associated with the outcome in univariable comparisons (p\u2009<\u2009.20) were included in an initial logistic regression multivariable model, and then further selected for the final multivariable model through a stepwise backward procedure based on the Akaike information criterion. The survival of patients with ICU-acquired BSI was also summarized graphically through the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, with the time of origin set at the day when the first positive culture of the first enterococcal BSI episode was drawn. Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Software (version 3.6.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). ResultsDuring the study period, 223 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the participating ICUs. Overall, 51 episodes of enterococcal BSI, occurring in 43 patients, were registered. 29 (56.9%) and 22 (43.1%) BSI were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. The cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI was of 229 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions (95% mid-p confidence interval [CI] 172\u2013298). The cumulative incidence of E. faecalis and E. faecium BSI was 130 (95% mid-p CI 89\u2013184) and 99 (95% mid-p CI 63\u2013147) episodes per 1000 ICU admissions, respectively.The demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. As shown in the table, the median age of patients with ICU-acquired Enterococcus spp. BSI was of 63\u2009years (interquartile range [IQR] 58\u201369) and 77% were males (33/43). The first episode of ICU-enterococcal BSI mainly occurred late during ICU stay (median 18\u2009days from ICU admission, interquartile range 12\u201332). Overall, a moderate burden of baseline comorbidities was observed, with a median Charlson score of 3 (IQR 2\u20135). Most patients received an empirical therapy with at least one agent showing in vitro activity against the blood isolate (38/43, 88%).Table 1.Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with ICU-acquired Enterococcus spp. BSI.VariableNo. of patientsa%95% CIDemographic variables\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Age in years, median (IQR)63 (58\u201369)\u00a059\u201366\u2003Male gender33/437762\u201388Medical history\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Charlson score, median (IQR)3 (2\u20135)\u00a02\u20134\u2003Diabetes mellitus9/432111\u201336\u2003Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease3/4372\u201318\u2003Chronic kidney disease8/43199\u201333\u2003Previous myocardial infarction4/4393\u201322\u2003Presence of solid neoplasm1/4320\u201312\u2003Presence of hematological malignancy1/4320\u201312\u2003Solid organ transplant0/4300\u20137\u2003Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation0/4300\u20137\u2003Admission from LTCF4/4393\u201322\u2003Previous hospitalisation (within 6\u2009months)7/43167\u201330\u2003Previous VRE isolation (within 6\u2009months)5/43125\u201325\u2003Previous therapy with glycopeptides (within 6\u2009months)5/43125\u201325COVID-19 pneumonia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003ARDS at hospital admissionb40/439382\u201398\u2003Need for invasive mechanical ventilationc43/4310093\u2013100Anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Treatment with steroidsd34/437964\u201389\u2003Treatment with tocilizumabe12/432816\u201343Variables at BSI onsetf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Duration of ICU stay before BSI onset in days, median (IQR)18 (12\u201332)\u00a013\u201323\u2003Recent treatment with cephalosporinsg34/437964\u201389\u2003Neutropenia (ANC\u2009<\u2009500 cell/mm3)0/4300\u20137\u2003Presence of CVC42/439888\u2013100\u2003Pitt bacteraemia score6 (4\u20138)\u00a06\u20138\u2003SOFA score8 (6\u201311)\u00a07\u201310\u2003Septic shock21/434933\u201364Infection variablesh\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003Aetiological agent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003\u2003 Enterococcus faecalis24/435641\u201370\u2003\u2003 Enterococcus faecium19/434430\u201359\u2003\u2003 Ampicillin-resistant E. faecalis0/2400\u201313\u2003\u2003 Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium7/193717\u201361\u2003Polymicrobial BSIi19/434430\u201359\u2003DENOVA score1 (0\u20132)\u00a01\u20131\u2003CRBSI31/437257\u201384\u2003Endocarditis0/4300\u20137\u2003Source control\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2003\u2003 Performed/unnecessaryj40/439382\u201398\u2003\u2003 Not performed3/4372\u201318\u2003 Empirical therapyk41/439584\u201399\u2003 In vitro active empirical therapyl38/438875\u201395Open in a separate windowANC, absolute neutrophil count;

The additional analysis with Firth\u2019s correction was performed using the logistf package for R Statistical Software version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).**Only results for variables retained in the final multivariable model are presented. The discriminatory performance and the calibration of the model were evaluated using the C-statistic (area under the curve [AUC] 0.835, with 95% CI from 0.702 to 0.967) and the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow\u2019s test (p\u2009=\u2009.149), respectively. DiscussionDuring 2020, we registered 51 episodes of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI in 43 different COVID-19 patients, with a high cumulative incidence of 229 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions. A high crude 30-day mortality of 42% was observed, despite the lack of a heavy burden of baseline comorbidities and a high rate of appropriate empirical therapy.The high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI we observed is in line with the results of Bonazzetti and colleagues, who previously registered 55 episodes of enterococcal BSI among 96 critically patients with COVID-19, equal to a cumulative incidence of 573 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions, which was even greater than the high cumulative incidence we observed in our centre [6]. In addition, Enterococcus spp., together with coagulase-negative staphylococci, was the most frequently responsible for BSI among critically ill COVID-19 patients in four different previous series [1,3,6,7]. Some possible explanations for an increased predisposition of critically ill COVID-19 patients to develop enterococcal BSI have been proposed. For example, the use of ceftriaxone or ceftaroline (which is inactive against E. faecium, although some in vitro activity against E. faecalis has been reported) as empirical agents in the suspicion of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia superimposed to the viral disease, since this could have exerted a selective pressure increasing the risk of enterococcal BSI [3]. However, large use of cephalosporins may have not been the rule in all series reporting a high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI in critically ill COVID-19 patients [1,6]. An alternative, non-mutually exclusive possible explanation is an increased risk of cross-transmission of Enterococcus spp. due to possibly relaxed infection-control measures (i.e. during the peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic the protection of healthcare personnel from the virus was prioritized with respect to the allocation of personal protective equipment, with a possible consequent risk of cross-transmission of bacteria across patients [25\u201327]), although this explanation is not fully in line with the fact that a similar increase in the transmission of several other bacteria (e.g. Enterobacterales, staphylococci) was apparently not observed [3,6]. Finally, an intriguing hypothesis is that of an increased bacterial translocation from the gut due to the presence/worsening of intestinal wall damage/inflammation related to the viral infection and/or the host response to the virus [1], which nonetheless deserves further investigation in the light of, again, the apparent absence of a parallel increase in the risk of BSI due to Enterobacterales and the lack of a clear elucidation of the underlying causal pathway and mechanisms.Despite the above-discussed uncertainty in deciphering the true reasons for the high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI we and others observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the high number of such infections remains, and with the present series, we tried to better depict the characteristics and outcomes of enterococcal BSI in this peculiar population. Notably, despite the high median age of patients in our cohort (63\u2009years), we ultimately registered only a moderate burden of baseline comorbidities (frequency <10% for most of the registered comorbidities, as shown in Table 1), likely reflecting the fact that severe respiratory insufficiency by SARS-CoV-2 may present not only in patients with already existing severe conditions but also in old patients with none or few comorbidities [28]. Another interesting aspect worth discussing is that mortality was high despite most patients (88%) received an in vitro active empirical therapy since the onset of BSI, suggesting a possible role of the severity of the underlying viral disease in unfavourably influencing the outcome. Of note, two patients did not receive prompt empirical therapy, possibly due to initially unclear or unrecognized infections in presence of mitigated clinical signs and inflammatory markers at the onset of BSI after previous treatment with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents [29,30].The prognostic impact of the patients\u2019 critical conditions is in line with the independent association we observed between higher SOFA score and 30-day mortality in the multivariable logistic regression model, although it should be recognized that this secondary analysis was burdened by the small sample size and the consequent low power for detecting other possible clinically relevant associations. For example, the potential unfavourable impact of vancomycin resistance in E. faecium, since, in crude numbers, 30-day mortality was higher in the small subgroup of patients with VRE BSI (57% vs. 42% in the entire series), possibly connected to the fact that 3 of the 5 in vitro inactive empirical therapies in the entire series were administered to patients with VRE BSI. Finally, it should be noted that we detected a high number of CRBSI (72%). However, we are unsure whether the CVC was the primary site of infection since we cannot exclude that colonization and infection of the device may have occurred after an initial translocation into the bloodstream from another site (e.g. the gut). Another factor showing a non-statistically significant direction of effect towards increased mortality and deserving further investigation in larger cohorts is the Pitt bacteraemia score (reflecting the severity of BSI presentation), whereas in our cohort there was no apparent association between baseline comorbidities (summarized by means of the Charlson score) and an unfavorable prognosis. The absence of endocarditis diagnoses and the low values of the DENOVA score (reflecting the risk of endocarditis) did not allow us to explore their possible prognostic effect in our cohort.Besides the low power of the secondary, exploratory analysis of predictors of 30-day mortality (discussed above), the present study has some other important limitations. First, this was a case series of COVID-19 patients with enterococcal BSI, thus no comparison was made with critically ill COVID-19 patients with no BSI or with BSI caused by other microorganisms. However, such a possible comparison was not the aim of our study, which was instead conceived to depict the characteristics and outcome of ICU-acquired enterococcal BSI, once recognized their high cumulative incidence in the target population. Second, owing to the observational nature of the study, which implies the existence of unmeasured confounding, and the small sample size, which precludes more sophisticated adjustment for measurable confounding, the present study was not structured to assess the impact of antibacterial therapy (and the type of employed drug/s) on mortality in a completely reliable way. Other not included data that we were eventually unable to reliably collect retrospectively from all patients were: (i) presence and type of recent chemotherapy; (ii) the time elapsed from the last CVC substitution and development of enterococcal BSI. In addition, we cannot exclude the incompleteness of the information on previous glycopeptide use and previous VRE isolation (e.g. in case of the previous hospitalization in other centers). Finally, the single-centre nature of the study may reduce the generalizability of our findings.In conclusion, our results are complementary to those of other series reporting a high cumulative incidence of enterococcal BSI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our hypothesis-generating findings suggest a crucial role of the severity of the acute clinical conditions, to which both the underlying viral pneumonia and the enterococcal BSI may contribute, in majorly influencing the outcome.
